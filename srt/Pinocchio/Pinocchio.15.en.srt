1
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:11,797
Pinocchio

2
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,287
It's so similar...

3
00:00:36,683 --> 00:00:38,049
to the case from 13 years ago.

4
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:42,061
I think it was like then too.
Everyone was searching for the cause,

5
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:45,351
but the story of your father came up
out of nowhere just like Chan-soo now.

6
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:47,311
How could this be Ahn Chan-soo's fault?

7
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:48,763
How could she conclude it so easily?

8
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:02,581
Chief. This exclusive makes no sense.

9
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:04,972
How could this accident be
Ahn Chan-soo's fault?

10
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:07,734
He's your friend, right?

11
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:11,411
You lost your rationality
because he's your friend.

12
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:14,952
I don't intend to respond
to every little thing that has no logic.

13
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:20,736
I wasn't his friend
and I didn't lose my rationality.

14
00:01:20,826 --> 00:01:22,190
Would you respond to me then?

15
00:01:24,396 --> 00:01:28,488
The report that he received was
an explosion of a household butane gas.

16
00:01:28,996 --> 00:01:30,570
It has nothing to do with this case.

17
00:01:30,896 --> 00:01:33,111
Of course he will say
it has nothing to do with the case.

18
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:34,629
Do you think he'll say he's responsible?

19
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:37,303
Did you meet with employee
who reported the explosion?

20
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:39,694
I was going to, but he was unconscious.

21
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:43,150
-It was so sad.
-So you haven't.

22
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:47,924
Then on what basis are you saying
that Ahn is responsible for this incident?

23
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,488
I'm the one who want to ask you.

24
00:01:50,554 --> 00:01:53,487
What proof do you have
that Ahn is not responsible?

25
00:01:53,984 --> 00:01:57,650
At least I have the CCTV footage
but where's your evidence?

26
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:03,929
And I just posed the suspicion.
I didn't conclude it. Is that a problem?

27
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,754
It is a problem.
People will accept that as truth

28
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:09,288
just like 13 years ago.

29
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:15,154
Why are you bringing up
what happened 13 years ago here?

30
00:02:15,254 --> 00:02:17,294
You used a shallow evidence
and posed suspicion

31
00:02:17,384 --> 00:02:19,763
and destroyed a family back then.

32
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:22,602
Then at least
bring a shallow evidence to argue!

33
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:26,774
Don't shelter one-sidedly
just because he's your friend.

34
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:29,158
Bring proper evidence as a reporter!

35
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:32,130
I'll come back with evidence.

36
00:02:37,284 --> 00:02:39,654
I'll find the evidence that Ahn Chan-soo
is not responsible.

37
00:02:39,754 --> 00:02:45,222
I will not lose someone powerlessly
like 13 years ago.

38
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:54,153
The flow that you're trying to change,
I'll put it to the right place.

39
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:07,232
Seoul Han River Police

40
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:12,354
Hello.

41
00:03:12,454 --> 00:03:15,519
Ahn Chan-soo from Han River Patrol
came to cheer up all the reporters.

42
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:18,818
Chan-soo. What are you doing here?

43
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:21,937
I stopped by while I was patrolling.

44
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:23,956
Are you alright?

45
00:03:24,184 --> 00:03:25,095
Of course.

46
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:28,698
Ahn, is it true that you went by the plant
but came back without doing anything?

47
00:03:29,274 --> 00:03:32,648
Yes. I actually came by
to tell you about it.

48
00:03:37,454 --> 00:03:42,090
This is the scene of the fire
where over 40 people died or injured.

49
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:47,154
The fire is extinguished but
the toxic gas is still quite evident.

50
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:52,538
However, that this fire could be prevented
has been revealed through the CCTV.

51
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:56,924
It's true that I got the report and went,
but it was just a butane gas accident.

52
00:03:57,024 --> 00:03:58,740
The workers were making ramen.

53
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,733
You know, those household butane gas?

54
00:04:01,214 --> 00:04:02,704
That small thing exploded.

55
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,273
Was that it?

56
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:10,026
But when I saw the CCTV,
you looked careless, standing on one foot.

57
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:13,725
The search words related to you
is “One footed Officer Ahn.”

58
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:19,347
The day before the fire, an officer
comes in after receiving a report.

59
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:23,054
He talks to the employee for a bit,

60
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:27,564
...takes a look at the scene
and leaves the plant.

61
00:04:27,664 --> 00:04:30,772
The time that he spent here
is less than 5 minutes.

62
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:33,754
The policeman in question,
Officer Ahn of Han River Patrol

63
00:04:33,854 --> 00:04:37,131
revealed that he didn't take precautions.

64
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:39,543
Standing on one leg didn't look okay.

65
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:41,281
It looked insincere.

66
00:04:42,544 --> 00:04:45,934
We police officers can't really help it.

67
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:50,287
This belt is over 3 kilograms
because of the handgun and handcuffs.

68
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:55,650
And because of the weight difference,
many of us lean on one foot.

69
00:04:55,864 --> 00:04:57,094
The pelvis gets twisted also.

70
00:04:57,204 --> 00:04:59,837
That's why herniated disc
is an occupational illness for us.

71
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:04,975
You can't misunderstand that
as an insincere posture.

72
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:09,749
The policeman dismissed the incident
as if it was nothing.

73
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:15,724
The next day, a great tragedy took place
where over 40 people were affected.

74
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,434
Incidents keep repeating themselves
like this

75
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:22,364
and might have been caused by
an irresponsible public authority.

76
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:25,266
The people can only feel despair.

77
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:28,504
This is Song Cha-ok from MSC news.

78
00:05:29,784 --> 00:05:33,200
Even the people that reported
apologized to me.

79
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:35,746
That they uselessly called the police
over nothing.

80
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:40,034
Everyone said they should cancel it
but I came by so fast.

81
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:41,560
They could not cancel it.

82
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:45,426
It was like that, wasn't it?
I knew it was like that.

83
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:47,295
You must've thought it was unfair.

84
00:05:48,184 --> 00:05:51,346
So please write a favorable article
for me.

85
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:54,139
What is this envelope?

86
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,525
Is this a bribe for us?

87
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:02,954
No. It's an invitation
to my third kid's first birthday.

88
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:06,384
-First birthday party?
-Your third kid?

89
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:10,344
It's lunch the day after tomorrow,
so drop by to eat.

90
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:12,674
Chan-soo. Talk to me in private for a bit.

91
00:06:12,774 --> 00:06:15,254
Why? I still have a lot to say.

92
00:06:15,354 --> 00:06:17,024
What's wrong? I still have more to say.

93
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:21,984
Come out!

94
00:06:22,084 --> 00:06:24,764
Hey! Hey! Hey!

95
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:28,660
Hey, man. I wasn't done talking!
I didn't get to pass out the invitations.

96
00:06:31,718 --> 00:06:34,280
Are you crazy? You're going to do a party
while this is going on?

97
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:37,444
Why not? What's wrong with a dad
throwing a birthday party for his son?

98
00:06:37,676 --> 00:06:39,790
Can't you figure out the situation?
Didn't you see the news?

99
00:06:40,084 --> 00:06:43,340
Everyone thinks you're responsible
for the fire right now.

100
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:47,256
How many times should I tell you,
it wasn't my fault!

101
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:49,534
I know but this is not a good time.

102
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:53,094
If you throw a party now,
everyone's going to find fault in you

103
00:06:53,194 --> 00:06:55,159
and you'll end up
with 10,000 people against you.

104
00:06:57,754 --> 00:06:58,602
Chan-soo.

105
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:01,494
I know because I went through
something like this.

106
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,287
It'll get difficult for you from now on.

107
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:06,554
Brat.

108
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,005
I know what you're worried about.

109
00:07:09,954 --> 00:07:14,365
But I'm stronger than you think.
I'm not going to get shaken by slandering.

110
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:17,289
I'm sorry, Chan-soo.

111
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:20,699
I'm really sorry.

112
00:07:21,614 --> 00:07:23,804
What are you sorry about?<b>
What do you have to be sorry about?</b>

113
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:28,334
You're suffering
because of my mom's report.

114
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:30,830
Brat. Is that something
you need to apologize for?

115
00:07:37,764 --> 00:07:38,706
Be strong.

116
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:41,824
I'm not going to just watch you
get blamed unjustly.

117
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:43,777
Me neither.

118
00:07:44,524 --> 00:07:48,022
Thanks.
You're the only ones who are about me.

119
00:07:48,644 --> 00:07:49,532
Thank you, friend.

120
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:52,304
Thanks.

121
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:56,695
Yes. Stay strong.

122
00:07:57,974 --> 00:08:00,621
-Right.
-Brat.

123
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:05,034
You know Chan-soo,

124
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:07,884
I was worried that he might be like us
13 years ago.

125
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:09,784
But I'm relieved.

126
00:08:09,904 --> 00:08:12,038
He's braver than I thought.

127
00:08:13,004 --> 00:08:14,427
He's probably pretending to be brave.

128
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:18,645
He's probably dying inside.

129
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:20,805
I was like that before.

130
00:08:21,964 --> 00:08:27,511
Well, I thought
you were enduring well back then too.

131
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:33,334
Are you doing okay?

132
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,344
What do you mean?

133
00:08:35,444 --> 00:08:38,966
Chan-soo's incident and what happened
13 years ago are quite similar.

134
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:44,314
Will you be okay covering the story,
since it will remind you of the incident?

135
00:08:45,564 --> 00:08:48,033
It's okay. This time it's different.

136
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:52,518
There weren't any good reporters then,
but this time there are.

137
00:08:53,724 --> 00:08:54,990
Good reporters? Who?

138
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:57,644
Me.

139
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:02,403
What's with you?

140
00:09:04,226 --> 00:09:05,493
You've become pretty shameless.

141
00:09:06,864 --> 00:09:08,165
Have I?

142
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:17,674
Episode 15 - Don Quixote

143
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:31,157
Chief. Are you going to keep coming
to the meeting?

144
00:09:33,124 --> 00:09:35,208
Continue comfortably.
Consider that I'm not here.

145
00:09:36,984 --> 00:09:39,232
Yes. I understand.

146
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:44,344
Let's start with Il-joo.

147
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:46,199
Officer Ahn has been the issue recently.

148
00:09:47,184 --> 00:09:51,684
I was wondering about the story of him
losing the Santa burglar a week ago.

149
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:54,843
I've even secured the CCTV footage of him
losing the culprit.

150
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:58,444
What are you going to do
with what happened a week ago?

151
00:09:58,535 --> 00:10:01,564
A week has passed
but the people are curious right now.

152
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:03,494
Then it's not a past item.

153
00:10:04,432 --> 00:10:06,399
Why do you keep highlighting Officer Ahn?

154
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:09,451
Shouldn't the cause of the fire
or the owner of the plant come first?

155
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:13,243
Yes. And losing the culprit
and the fire incident are not related.

156
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,190
You guys...

157
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,437
I also think that the two are unrelated.

158
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:18,925
It's unrelated?

159
00:10:19,615 --> 00:10:22,504
The person who missed the sign of fire
and had 16 people die

160
00:10:22,604 --> 00:10:24,636
turned out to be the one
who even lost a culprit.

161
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:27,381
Aren't they both related
to a slacker officer?

162
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:34,585
Why are you looking at me like that?

163
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:41,228
No. Since you're here,
it feels like I'm not even here.

164
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:53,823
Have we figured out
the cause of the accident yet?

165
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:57,040
Did you check the fire department
and the police forensics?

166
00:10:57,404 --> 00:11:01,758
Yes. I've been checking them hourly
but it will take at least a week.

167
00:11:02,774 --> 00:11:06,723
They see storage one as the point of fire
but even that is an early assumption.

168
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,647
This is the problem with fire accident.
Determining the cause is too slow.

169
00:11:13,013 --> 00:11:14,073
Next, Cha Woo-chul.

170
00:11:14,164 --> 00:11:15,269
Yes.

171
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,897
Officer Ahn has a record
of losing a culprit recently.

172
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:22,177
The officer who missed
the fire accident lost a culprit also.

173
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:23,900
It makes sense.

174
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:27,647
That guy...

175
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:31,281
Who said Ahn missed the fire accident?
Is that verified?

176
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:37,585
No, but that's what everyone thinks.

177
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,087
I don't know. That's not what I know.

178
00:11:42,906 --> 00:11:44,742
Don't be seduced by unverified news.

179
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:47,179
Don't cloud the essence either.

180
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:49,920
You're the best, captain!

181
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:51,683
What is that?

182
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:56,411
Don't forget Ki Ho-sang incident
from 13 years ago.

183
00:11:56,669 --> 00:12:00,487
Remember why it was the topic of debate
during your interview.

184
00:12:03,798 --> 00:12:08,371
From now on, we won't use Officer Ahn
as a news item

185
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,260
until whoever is responsible
is officially verified.

186
00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:15,043
Until everything is revealed,
don't predict and just report the facts.

187
00:12:15,331 --> 00:12:18,151
If you don't, the rage will go
to an absurd place. Alright?

188
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:19,647
-Yes.
-Yes.

189
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,347
-Yes.
-Yes.

190
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:30,103
That's what I said when I was scolding him
during Ki Ho-sang incident.

191
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,708
It must've stayed with him.

192
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:39,884
I'd say he's been holding a grudge.

193
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:46,151
That guy...

194
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:50,131
The day before the accident
at the waste-disposal plant,

195
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:52,661
Officer Ahn returned
even after he received a report

196
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:54,341
and evoked much criticism.

197
00:12:54,441 --> 00:13:00,770
Turns out, he's lost an arrested suspect
inside the police station in the past.

198
00:13:00,861 --> 00:13:05,589
As his past is being put
to the chopping block again...

199
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:07,938
What is this?

200
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:10,971
Captain.

201
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,522
I want to put you
on the chopping block instead.

202
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:16,095
You...

203
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:20,194
Why?

204
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,670
What are you doing? What is that?

205
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,115
The CCTV footage that chief took.

206
00:13:38,206 --> 00:13:40,055
I was wondering if the cause
might be in here.

207
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:41,942
Let's look at it together.

208
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:44,458
Do you have a Band-Aid by any chance?

209
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,359
Why do you need a Band-Aid?

210
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:49,230
My heel keeps blistering
because of new shoes.

211
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:51,029
Wait here. I'll go buy some.

212
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,280
No. I'll...

213
00:13:53,722 --> 00:13:55,289
Wow, he's so fast.

214
00:14:06,895 --> 00:14:10,580
Just how did Song Cha-ok get the footage
from a place like this?

215
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:22,553
Are you okay?

216
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:26,421
Why did you come here?
You're not assigned here.

217
00:14:26,787 --> 00:14:28,268
Because I was curious about something.

218
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:33,019
I'm sure you were curious.

219
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:36,367
I'm sure you missed me and were curious
since you couldn't see me.

220
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,159
I thought he still had feelings for In-ha
but I guess he doesn't.

221
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:48,079
Excuse me. I'd like to ask you something.

222
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,352
Where do you keep
the CCTV footage of the plant?

223
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:52,125
In the security office
in the basement floor.

224
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:53,862
How do I get there?

225
00:14:54,589 --> 00:15:00,190
You can't. It's collapsed and
we can't even find the entrance yet.

226
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:05,188
Huh? That's strange.
Song Cha-ok secured the footage recently.

227
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:07,882
I thought it was strange too.

228
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,040
You can't even get into the office.

229
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:16,036
Then is there another place
that keeps the CCTV footage?

230
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,775
There is but...

231
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:22,063
Not here but over there...

232
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:44,819
Are you awake?

233
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:46,759
I wasn't sleeping.

234
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:48,738
I guess I was sleeping.

235
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,380
You didn't even sleep for 10 minutes.
Anyway, look at this.

236
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:55,567
Did you find something?

237
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:57,324
Look at this. This part...

238
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,449
Isn't that strange?

239
00:16:05,357 --> 00:16:08,138
It skips here. The person
who was here is suddenly standing there.

240
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:10,094
I think this was edited.

241
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,695
Yeah. But wasn't the footage original?
The one that Song brought?

242
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:17,177
She said it was original
but how could it be cut in the middle?

243
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:19,749
Don't you think someone
deleted it on purpose?

244
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:21,919
On purpose?

245
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:26,634
Is this before or after Chan-soo came out?

246
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:27,869
After.

247
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:58,180
Chief. I have something to ask you.

248
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:02,982
The CCTV footage that you got
from the scene. Is it original?

249
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,389
Why do you ask?

250
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:06,853
There's an edited part in the middle.

251
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:09,469
If it's original,
it couldn't have been edited.

252
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:17,458
The CCTV must've stopped working briefly.

253
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:18,816
Chief!

254
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,682
I have something to ask also.

255
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,388
That footage. Did you really get it
from the plant?

256
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,959
Of course I got it from that plant.

257
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,619
Where else could I have gotten
the footage of the plant?

258
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:45,280
The security office that stored
the CCTV footage was completely collapsed.

259
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:49,679
Then it means that you got it
from a security company, not the plant.

260
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:53,739
According to the company,
only the owner can have access to it.

261
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:56,616
The owner of the company?

262
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:59,705
Did you get the CCTV from him?

263
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:02,548
No.

264
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:09,008
You should take your hand off.
I don't have time to play with you.

265
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:11,778
If it's like this, the story is different.

266
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:14,087
If the owner of the plant
sent you the CCTV footage,

267
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,164
then it means that he edited it too.

268
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:19,825
And that the real cause of the fire
is within the time that was edited.

269
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:25,319
I told you to argue with me with proof,
not with speculation.

270
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:30,498
Yes. Please wait. I'll find
the missing time and come back.

271
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:53,981
If what you're saying is true...

272
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:57,882
my mom intentionally drove Chan-soo
as guilty...

273
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:01,153
to hide whoever is actually responsible.

274
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,559
Probably.

275
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,706
I thought there was no way...
I just thought there was no way...

276
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:30,639
Chairwoman

277
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:32,253
Should we meet for a bit?

278
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:41,112
Where are you going?

279
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:45,149
We have to find that edited time.
The answer must be in it.

280
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:46,919
How are you going to find it?

281
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:50,828
I have to search through
all the CCTVs near the plant.

282
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:54,461
There must be so many. How are you
going to search through all that?

283
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,689
100 or 1000, I'll search through them all.

284
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:58,555
Chan-soo. We can't just leave him be.

285
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:01,217
I'll get going.

286
00:20:14,939 --> 00:20:15,869
Where are you going?

287
00:20:15,969 --> 00:20:18,329
I'll search through the CCTVs
near the plant.

288
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:20,549
There's something hidden
in the edited portion.

289
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:23,799
Hey. Your nose is bleeding.

290
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:27,319
Nosebleed?

291
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:31,479
Oh, and please take my gift when you go
to Chan-soo's son's party.

292
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:35,090
Hey, you stayed up all night.
Get some sleep before you go.

293
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:36,650
I'm alright. I'm perfectly fine.

294
00:20:36,741 --> 00:20:38,465
I'm so sorry I can't even rest.

295
00:20:38,556 --> 00:20:40,403
What are you sorry about? Choi In-ha.

296
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:45,591
Where is she going with that foot? Hey!

297
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:03,799
What is this?

298
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:06,739
Hello?

299
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:08,359
Hey, who are you?

300
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:10,495
Why do you have my cell phone?

301
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,038
Yoon Yoo-Rae?

302
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:16,426
How did this get in my bag?

303
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:20,891
Hey. Do you know how much trouble I got in
with Nitpick Jang because of you?

304
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:26,288
But you...The wallpaper of your phone
was the picture of Ha-myung.

305
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:30,407
Oh, that? Ha-myung seems so pitiful.

306
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:33,936
I'm thinking about accepting his feelings.

307
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:35,902
What? No way.

308
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:38,595
Did you really think
that Ha-myung like you?

309
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,835
Yeah. You said that he likes me.

310
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:48,098
Yoo-Rae, I'm sorry. That was all a lie.

311
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:50,929
-What?
-The situation was a bit complicated.

312
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:53,094
So I had to lie to make up something.
I'm sorry.

313
00:21:53,449 --> 00:21:54,304
I'm sorry.

314
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:01,813
I see. But that lie has become truth now.

315
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,039
What?

316
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:05,015
Now Ha-myung really likes me.

317
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:09,768
-Hey, there's no way. Ha-myung...
-Stop.

318
00:22:13,307 --> 00:22:15,019
The phone call came at a perfect timing.

319
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:16,707
Who could it be?

320
00:22:20,077 --> 00:22:21,162
Ki Ha-myung

321
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:23,524
See? It's a call from Ha-myung.

322
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:28,289
Yeah. Ha-myung.

323
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:29,807
It's me, Ha Myeong.

324
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:32,219
Yeah. Go ahead.

325
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,439
I can't go to Chan-soo's son's
birthday party.

326
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:36,037
Please give him a money gift for me.

327
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:39,999
I have to search for CCTVs
near that plant right now.

328
00:22:41,435 --> 00:22:42,951
Okay. Leave it to me.

329
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:47,576
And please take care of Chan-soo for me.

330
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,664
Don't worry.
Do a good job with covering the story.

331
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,067
Thanks.

332
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:03,821
See? See?
He asked me to take care of Chan-soo.

333
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,590
Why is it me instead of you or In-ha?

334
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:10,472
The answer is right there.
The one Ki Ha-myung likes is me.

335
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:12,095
Yes.

336
00:23:12,186 --> 00:23:14,173
I really wish that was true also.

337
00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:24,929
How much does a rich person
like you give as a money gift?

338
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:26,658
A hundred? A thousand?

339
00:23:26,749 --> 00:23:29,639
I need to search for all the CCTVs
near the plant.

340
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:32,009
I'm going to search through
the CCTVs near the plant.

341
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:34,444
I think there's something hidden
in the edited portion.

342
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:38,551
Yoo-Rae. I'll drop you off here
so take a taxi.

343
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:39,793
What?

344
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:43,383
I'm sorry.
Please give the money gift for me too.

345
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:55,863
What is this?
Did I ask something inappropriate?

346
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,649
I'm really curious as to how much this is.

347
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:04,569
Seo Beom-Jo

348
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:14,953
CCTV
CCTV

349
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:24,109
My nephew In-ha

350
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:27,669
Hello.

351
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:30,235
Yeah, it's me. Where are you?
I'm near the plant.

352
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,079
Near the plant?

353
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,459
I see you. Wait for me.

354
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:39,269
What are you doing here?

355
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,792
You can't find that all by yourself.
Let's divide it up and look for them.

356
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,101
I marked all the CCTV near the plant here.

357
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,384
I'll take this side,
so you take the side across the street.

358
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:51,195
And I saw that there weren't any CCTV
at these three places.

359
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:55,339
I really enjoyed the news.

360
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:59,188
Both of you are always so trustworthy.

361
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:02,260
I got some brownie points
from the Assemblymen, thanks to you.

362
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:04,488
I'm glad that we were helpful.

363
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:06,375
He is a good person,

364
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:08,479
but he's weak-hearted.
So since the incident

365
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:10,409
he hasn't been able to sleep well.

366
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,299
Once the Olympic starts,
the nation's interest

367
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:15,179
will all go towards it naturally.

368
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,633
So please block it
with Officer Ahn until then.

369
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:19,099
Yes.

370
00:25:19,489 --> 00:25:22,156
I'll compensate you very well.

371
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:25,827
Chief Song?

372
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:28,174
Yes, ma'am.

373
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:29,636
Is something bothering you?

374
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:32,477
You look nervous since earlier.

375
00:25:38,394 --> 00:25:42,835
Actually, Ki Ha-myung from YGN
came by today.

376
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:47,894
He found out that the CCTV footage
that you gave us was edited.

377
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:50,792
How did he?

378
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:54,344
It seems he's going to search through
all the CCTVs near there.

379
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:56,654
What should we do?

380
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:04,286
Chief Song, you worry too much.

381
00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:10,969
Would I be able to get
the CCTV files perhaps?

382
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,849
Do you think I didn't expect
something like that?

383
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:16,289
I already took care of it so don't worry.

384
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:19,747
That? Someone came by and
collected them right after the accident.

385
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:21,329
Who?

386
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:26,251
Some guys with suits on. Maybe the police?
If not, maybe the insurance company?

387
00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:30,719
What? Only the recording
from that day is missing.

388
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:34,179
Is there anyone else that came
to see the CCTV other than me?

389
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:36,274
That's strange.

390
00:26:36,365 --> 00:26:38,732
The people who came to inspect
the security saw it.

391
00:26:39,729 --> 00:26:42,142
Is that why? Why is it missing?

392
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,714
I'm not that sloppy.

393
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,277
Someone came by recently
and took them all.

394
00:26:51,969 --> 00:26:53,046
I see.

395
00:26:55,249 --> 00:26:59,759
Don't worry about the kids playing around
and just focus on what you need to do.

396
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:04,469
If you get shaken by their games,
you'll look small.

397
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:07,371
Don't you think so?

398
00:27:09,949 --> 00:27:13,270
You're right. I worried over nothing.

399
00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:30,799
Were you able to get it?

400
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:34,004
No. Not even one. What about you?

401
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,213
I didn't either. It looks as if
someone intentionally deleted it.

402
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:40,229
Did they really delete it intentionally?

403
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:43,864
Yeah. There must be something
in that edited portion.

404
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:48,079
It's a good sign. I'll go check it out
once more so you go first.

405
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,191
No. I'll go around again also.

406
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:01,878
That idiot.

407
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:13,999
Mother

408
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:38,183
Reporter Ki Ha-myung.
How is your coverage going?

409
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,519
You said you'll come argue with me
with proof. Did you find it?

410
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,959
Did you find any?

411
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:46,508
No. I was foolish.

412
00:28:47,229 --> 00:28:48,722
What do you mean, foolish?

413
00:28:48,813 --> 00:28:51,029
I just thought that
it was unfair to Ahn Chan-soo.

414
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:54,094
I was just thinking about resolving
that misunderstanding.

415
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,190
But as I was going around
searching for the CCTV today...

416
00:28:57,829 --> 00:29:00,022
I realized that I was too short-sighted.

417
00:29:01,046 --> 00:29:04,219
I realized that the whoever took care
of all the CCTVs near the plant,

418
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,964
is hiding the truth of this case.

419
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:12,891
If you know who that is,
please deliver this message for me.

420
00:29:13,423 --> 00:29:15,558
That I'm thankful for the hint.

421
00:29:39,353 --> 00:29:41,172
Sapphire hall.

422
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:43,879
Kara Hall

423
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:45,049
Sapphire Hall

424
00:29:45,139 --> 00:29:46,444
It's there.

425
00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:51,050
What is this? The reporters came?

426
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:57,939
A luxurious banquet hall
located in the middle of Seoul.

427
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,180
I'll try again.

428
00:29:59,271 --> 00:30:01,446
Although he could've prevented a tragedy,

429
00:30:01,537 --> 00:30:06,148
Officer Ahn who was careless
and allegedly led to many deaths...

430
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:09,311
Instead of reflecting on his actions,
he held a birthday party for his child.

431
00:30:09,402 --> 00:30:12,979
Many guests gathered at
his third child's first birthday party

432
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:15,217
which took place at
a luxurious banquet hall this afternoon.

433
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:20,149
It's a first birthday celebration.
Stop filming.

434
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:22,609
Isn't this neglecting your duty?

435
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:25,279
We don't know
if the fire was because of me or not yet.

436
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:27,924
What's wrong with a father
taking care of his child's birthday?

437
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:31,259
The bereaved families are in rage
that he should mourn over the victims

438
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:33,069
before putting a birthday party.

439
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:35,306
This is Kang Sung-hwan from ATS news.

440
00:30:38,249 --> 00:30:41,815
Why are you watching that?
I told you not to watch it.

441
00:30:43,081 --> 00:30:46,300
Mom. What does “Mold of the people” mean?

442
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:52,659
What are you talking about?

443
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:56,744
The kids were saying that dad
is the mold of the people.

444
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:00,530
They meant to say cane of the people,
right?

445
00:31:01,979 --> 00:31:04,910
Who said that?
What brat said something like that?

446
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:12,631
Honey, where are you going?

447
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:24,328
Yeah. Dal-Po.

448
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:27,624
Are you alright? Where are you right now?

449
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,448
I'm going to MSC right now.

450
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:33,037
I have something to nitpick
with that reporter Song Cha-ok.

451
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:34,381
What?

452
00:31:34,472 --> 00:31:36,260
Wait a second. Meet with me first.

453
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:41,359
Hey, Chan-soo.

454
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,649
In-ha, it's me. You have to stop Chan-soo.

455
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:52,479
He's on his way to your TV station now.

456
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,648
He said he was going to argue
with reporter Song.

457
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:58,824
Let me come in.
I'm a police officer. I'm coming in.

458
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:03,035
How many times do I have to tell you?

459
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:05,631
I came to have a conversation,
not to cause disturbance.

460
00:32:05,722 --> 00:32:08,108
If you won't let me in,
call reporter Song Cha-ok for me.

461
00:32:10,949 --> 00:32:12,740
-Chan-soo.
-Why are you doing this?

462
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:15,495
If you do this, the reporters
will gather again. Calm down.

463
00:32:15,586 --> 00:32:18,545
I want to, but they keep provoking me.

464
00:32:19,361 --> 00:32:20,375
Chan-soo.

465
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:23,793
Hey. You guys saw the news today, right?

466
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:27,019
You saw how the reporters ruined
my kid's first birthday party, right?

467
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:29,820
That's why I told you not to do it
because it'd end badly.

468
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:32,788
That's what I'm saying.
Why did it have to end badly?

469
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:36,067
-I know you didn't do anything wrong...
-If you do, then tell them!

470
00:32:36,678 --> 00:32:39,549
Tell them that it's not me.

471
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:42,281
Tell them not to criticize me
and leave my family alone!

472
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:48,459
You guys are reporters. You believe me.

473
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,278
So tell them it's not me.

474
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:53,951
Please tell them.

475
00:32:56,909 --> 00:32:58,739
In-ha...

476
00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:01,569
You go and tell them it's not me.

477
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:03,532
Song Cha-ok is your mother.

478
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:07,809
She'll listen to you.
Please talk to her for me.

479
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:09,326
Chan-soo.

480
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:14,297
-Chan-soo. Stop.
-You said it.

481
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:17,373
That you won't just stand
and watch me get criticized unfairly.

482
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:22,269
Please do something, Dal-Po.

483
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:49,494
In-ha.

484
00:34:05,939 --> 00:34:08,178
-Are you alright?
-No, I'm not alright.

485
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:10,247
Where are you going?

486
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:13,288
I'm going to the plant
and look for any CCTV that might be left.

487
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,491
At this hour?

488
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:25,704
You have to rest.

489
00:34:25,795 --> 00:34:28,099
You stayed up all night
watching the original footage.

490
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,199
And you ran around all day today.

491
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:33,269
Look at your heels.
It's covered in blood!

492
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:35,629
I'm alright. I don't feel anything.

493
00:34:35,729 --> 00:34:37,769
Alright? You're going to faint!

494
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:41,245
I'm really fine.
See? I'm not even hiccuping.

495
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:43,754
I'm in a hurry. Why isn't it coming?

496
00:34:43,845 --> 00:34:46,669
Stop it! Why do you have to go this far!

497
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:50,599
What can I do then?
You saw Chan-soo and Dal-Po earlier.

498
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:53,339
They're both my friends.
But because of my mom,

499
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:55,875
Chan-soo became like Dal-Po 13 years ago.

500
00:34:55,966 --> 00:34:56,971
How can I rest?

501
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:59,761
How can I rest when I feel like
I'm going crazy from guilt?

502
00:34:59,852 --> 00:35:01,674
Why do you have to feel bad?

503
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:11,063
Because my mom isn't apologizing
or making it right.

504
00:35:23,012 --> 00:35:24,935
Alright then let's go in my car.

505
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:27,804
You can sleep a little bit
on the way at least.

506
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:52,256
Because my mom isn't apologizing
or making it right.

507
00:36:20,069 --> 00:36:22,029
-Il-joo.
-Yes?

508
00:36:22,209 --> 00:36:25,671
Did anyone clean up my desk by any chance?

509
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:29,077
No. Are you missing something?

510
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:32,770
No. It's nothing.

511
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:48,539
Yim Jae-hwa.

512
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,684
You finally look like a woman
now that you loosened your hair.

513
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:56,249
Lee Il-joo.
You finally look like a woman,

514
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:58,498
now that you wear heavy foundation.

515
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:01,197
Hey, this is BB cream.

516
00:37:02,649 --> 00:37:04,663
I enjoyed your report yesterday.

517
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:07,641
But it seemed unfitting,
considering it was given by you,

518
00:37:07,753 --> 00:37:10,403
who neglected evidence,
when you could have prevented a tragedy.

519
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:12,709
Hey!

520
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:16,185
The person who could've prevented
a tragedy is Officer Ahn, not me.

521
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:18,709
Don't you remember?

522
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:21,419
You reported that
the waste-disposal plant at Han River...

523
00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:25,199
...was an environmental friendly plant.

524
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:28,854
If you reported properly then,
this tragedy wouldn't have happened.

525
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:32,829
-That was half a year ago.
-Is that so?

526
00:37:32,929 --> 00:37:34,508
It hasn't even been a year?

527
00:37:37,149 --> 00:37:40,982
If I was you, I wouldn't even think
about a wedding or first birthday party.

528
00:37:42,122 --> 00:37:44,056
Because I'd have a guilty conscience
and I'd be reflecting.

529
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:51,024
That nitpicker...

530
00:37:54,389 --> 00:37:56,172
Why didn't he greet me?

531
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:01,329
What am I supposed to do with him?
What am I supposed to do with them?

532
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:11,799
So why did it have to end so badly?
Just what did I do so wrong?

533
00:38:11,899 --> 00:38:14,579
There must be a reason.
Why are you condemning him

534
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:16,820
without figuring it out?
That's all rumors.

535
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:41,849
You're here!

536
00:38:41,949 --> 00:38:44,389
Why does your face look so haggard?
Did you stay up all night?

537
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:45,479
Yeah.

538
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:48,829
What are you looking at?

539
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:51,629
It's the original CCTV footage
that Manipulator Song brought.

540
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:52,979
In-ha emailed it to us.

541
00:38:58,409 --> 00:38:59,909
What is that car?

542
00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:01,685
I don't know. Is it an employee vehicle?

543
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:06,079
Wait. Is that light from the car
coming from a black box video?

544
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,813
It seems like it.

545
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:12,306
Hey. We just have to find this car.

546
00:39:12,397 --> 00:39:14,155
That's right. At this angle,

547
00:39:14,246 --> 00:39:16,676
it must have recorded everything
happening at the plant.

548
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:18,462
What's the plate number?

549
00:39:22,081 --> 00:39:25,167
Team Leader.
Please inquire about the vehicle.

550
00:39:26,168 --> 00:39:29,001
Why are you doing this, Reporter Yoon?
You know full well that I can't do it.

551
00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:34,311
It's not someone else's business
but it's to save Officer Ahn.

552
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:37,619
Please do it for us, Team Leader.

553
00:39:37,955 --> 00:39:41,914
No way.
I hate going against principles the most.

554
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:47,011
Team Leader, you're such
a stubborn principle ideologist.

555
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:51,110
Thank you, Team Leader.

556
00:39:55,419 --> 00:39:56,869
I hate you.

557
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:02,891
Here. It's the address
and the name of the owner.

558
00:40:03,189 --> 00:40:05,223
It was really hard getting it.

559
00:40:08,229 --> 00:40:10,342
Thank you so much.
I'll treat you big time later.

560
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:14,564
-Do you want me to go with you?
-No, I can do it myself.

561
00:40:16,728 --> 00:40:19,191
His smile is so refreshing.

562
00:40:33,378 --> 00:40:34,293
Childish Dal-po

563
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,848
29 Gu 2252

564
00:40:59,772 --> 00:41:01,519
These are the deleted scenes
from the footage...

565
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:03,149
...that reporter Song Cha-ok obtained.

566
00:41:03,249 --> 00:41:05,313
It's two hours after Officer Ahn came by.

567
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,173
-They edited it to hide these trucks?
-Yes.

568
00:41:09,899 --> 00:41:11,159
Yes. I'd have to find out more,

569
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:13,899
but if Song really received
the CCTV footage from the plant,

570
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,824
...they must've deleted it
because these trucks were a problem.

571
00:41:17,173 --> 00:41:20,106
Did you check into this business
called Chan Joo Environmental?

572
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:23,219
Yes. It's an oil waste processing
and disposal company.

573
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:26,613
I think that truck was probably carrying
oil waste also.

574
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:29,169
The experts said that the explosion
was caused

575
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:30,851
by oil mist, so it's roughly true.

576
00:41:31,569 --> 00:41:34,459
Hand this over to Jang Hyun-gyu
and start gathering additional info.

577
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,579
Yes, Captain.

578
00:41:44,179 --> 00:41:45,621
Captain.

579
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:49,068
I think that we shouldn't just reveal
the cause of this accident.

580
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,969
We should also reveal
that Ahn Chan-soo is innocent

581
00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:56,248
and those who are truly responsible
that were hiding behind Ahn Chan-soo.

582
00:42:01,259 --> 00:42:04,380
Do you think I will cover this up here?

583
00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:11,119
No.

584
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,359
Really?

585
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:27,704
Are you sure those trucks came in
after I came by?

586
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,795
Yeah.

587
00:42:28,886 --> 00:42:30,798
Hey. When will that go out?

588
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:32,739
Will I be cleared of the false charge
once it's out?

589
00:42:33,194 --> 00:42:35,308
As soon as
the additional information is gathered.

590
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:37,530
And the captain said
it won't end with just once.

591
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:40,916
He said he's going to reveal
the truth that's hiding behind you.

592
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:44,673
Thanks. Thank you really.

593
00:42:45,682 --> 00:42:48,059
-Thanks, Dal-Po. Thank you!
-Whoa!

594
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:50,349
Hey, get off. It's gross.

595
00:42:50,727 --> 00:42:52,343
You saved me.

596
00:42:53,569 --> 00:42:55,775
You're crazy. I'm leaving.

597
00:42:56,149 --> 00:42:57,062
Dal-Po.

598
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:02,058
When we were in high school...

599
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:05,091
Why are you hesitating?

600
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:10,139
The one who spread the rumor
about you cheating

601
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:12,399
and stealing the test
to the quiz contest...

602
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:15,383
...that was me.

603
00:43:15,997 --> 00:43:17,010
What?

604
00:43:17,101 --> 00:43:20,837
Now that this happened to me,
I was thinking a lot about that time.

605
00:43:21,581 --> 00:43:24,225
It felt like I was being punished
for that time.

606
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:29,667
Anyway, I'm really sorry about that.

607
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,806
It's so unfair.

608
00:43:35,509 --> 00:43:38,319
I was running around in this cold weather
to save a jerk like this?

609
00:43:38,419 --> 00:43:40,979
Hey. I'll text you
my bank account number,

610
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:43,227
so give me back the money gift.

611
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:44,804
Hey.

612
00:43:46,853 --> 00:43:49,966
You bastard. You don't even give an inch.

613
00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:01,103
Chief.

614
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:03,663
What are you looking for so desperately?

615
00:44:03,779 --> 00:44:06,889
I lost the contact information
of my source.

616
00:44:07,246 --> 00:44:08,369
It's not that important.

617
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,189
Alright.

618
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,594
If it's not that important,
why is she looking for it so hard?

619
00:44:18,484 --> 00:44:19,964
Dal-pyung.

620
00:44:20,956 --> 00:44:24,210
Aren't there anymore of Dal-po's picture
from when he was young?

621
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:29,326
I was thinking
about visiting Dal-po's older brother.

622
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,694
What are you doing?

623
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:38,863
What are you looking at like that?

624
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,272
In-ha's mom's cell phone.
Why do you think it's here?

625
00:44:43,156 --> 00:44:45,440
Maybe her mom gave it to In-ha.

626
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:48,564
You think she gave her a cell phone
from 10 years ago? Why?

627
00:44:49,702 --> 00:44:51,574
There must be something important in it.

628
00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:54,243
What important thing?

629
00:44:55,814 --> 00:44:59,009
Stop asking me. What would I know?

630
00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:03,725
You weird brat.

631
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:11,987
It's nothing.

632
00:45:12,826 --> 00:45:14,155
I already erased it all.

633
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:15,973
It's alright.

634
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,237
It's alright.

635
00:45:19,122 --> 00:45:21,069
I realized that I was too short-sighted.

636
00:45:21,658 --> 00:45:24,779
I realized that the whoever took care
of all the CCTVs near the plant,

637
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,532
is hiding the truth of this case.

638
00:45:28,969 --> 00:45:31,799
If you know who that is,
please deliver this message for me.

639
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:34,564
That I'm thankful for the hint.

640
00:45:40,899 --> 00:45:43,689
The line is busy,
please leave a voicemail.

641
00:45:43,789 --> 00:45:45,650
Why isn't she answering her phone?

642
00:45:47,479 --> 00:45:49,742
Yoon Yoo-Rae. Have you seen In-ha today?

643
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,272
No I haven't seen her.

644
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:53,415
That black box from earlier...

645
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,729
Sung-hwan.
Have you seen In-ha by any chance?

646
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:57,858
I haven't seen her.

647
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:01,394
Where did she go?

648
00:46:03,075 --> 00:46:04,849
Seo Bum-Jo. It's me.

649
00:46:05,067 --> 00:46:06,447
Do you know where In-ha is?

650
00:46:08,048 --> 00:46:09,677
Really? Where is that?

651
00:46:10,529 --> 00:46:11,611
Yeah.

652
00:46:16,116 --> 00:46:17,859
74 Reo 387

653
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:21,288
Seo Bum-Jo!

654
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,588
Where is In-ha?
Why isn't she answering her phone?

655
00:46:28,149 --> 00:46:29,201
Why?

656
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,462
Now you're finally thinking of In-ha?

657
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:33,104
What?

658
00:46:33,195 --> 00:46:37,190
She's been trying to solve Ahn's case.
She hasn't slept for several days...

659
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:40,314
and has been running around
with a bloody nose.

660
00:46:40,696 --> 00:46:41,660
Didn't you know that?

661
00:46:47,399 --> 00:46:49,153
No. I'll go around once again also.

662
00:46:55,448 --> 00:46:57,499
You can't see anyone but Chief Song,
can you?

663
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,860
All you think about
is how to drag her down, right?

664
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:03,646
You can't see that she acts like a sinner
because you're like that, can't you?

665
00:47:08,149 --> 00:47:12,654
She says that the reason Ahn is suffering
is because of her.

666
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:16,629
She says it's her fault that you had
to suffer 13 years ago too.

667
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:19,167
She says she feels like a sinner
when she sees you.

668
00:47:24,819 --> 00:47:25,776
Let me ask you.

669
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:28,383
What did In-ha do wrong?

670
00:47:29,836 --> 00:47:31,441
Is it her fault
that she's Chief Song's daughter?

671
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:37,709
If you're going to make her suffer,
just cut it off cleanly and let her go!

672
00:47:38,217 --> 00:47:39,081
Stop it.

673
00:47:39,172 --> 00:47:42,173
What is this? You're making her suffer
while you're holding on.

674
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:49,450
But...you know what's really irritating?

675
00:47:51,116 --> 00:47:53,310
I want to stop her
from doing such stupid things,

676
00:47:53,379 --> 00:47:55,455
but she won't even listen to me.

677
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,558
No matter how much I tell her
that it's not her fault

678
00:47:57,649 --> 00:47:59,979
and that she's not responsible
so she should rest,

679
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:01,889
she doesn't listen to me.

680
00:48:01,989 --> 00:48:05,834
Because you have to be the one
to say that...

681
00:48:08,014 --> 00:48:11,167
for it to be effective.

682
00:48:21,879 --> 00:48:23,037
Where is In-ha?

683
00:48:25,146 --> 00:48:26,618
She's by 105.

684
00:48:38,807 --> 00:48:40,358
Was it true?

685
00:48:40,763 --> 00:48:42,662
The one that Ha-myung likes is In-ha?

686
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:45,265
Now you believe me?

687
00:48:58,292 --> 00:49:01,113
I'm really sorry. What should I do?

688
00:49:02,084 --> 00:49:04,939
If was you, I wouldn't even want
to see someone like me.

689
00:49:05,514 --> 00:49:07,309
I remind you of my mom
whenever you see me, right?

690
00:49:07,409 --> 00:49:09,269
You hate me
and get irritated by me, right?

691
00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:12,839
Don't worry about me.
Say whatever you want

692
00:49:12,939 --> 00:49:14,494
and argue with my mom.

693
00:49:16,569 --> 00:49:17,886
I'm sorry.

694
00:49:42,774 --> 00:49:45,632
Dal-Po... No, I mean, Ha-myung!

695
00:49:49,597 --> 00:49:50,750
I discovered something huge.

696
00:49:50,953 --> 00:49:54,622
That CCTV from that plant
when I re-watched it, there was a car.

697
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:59,967
It might have a black box.
The edited hour may be in that black box.

698
00:50:00,058 --> 00:50:01,789
It's huge, right?
You didn't know that, right?

699
00:50:01,889 --> 00:50:04,271
Isn't that so smart?
I could even join Mensa.

700
00:50:04,844 --> 00:50:06,844
I wrote down the plate number,
so let's look for it together.

701
00:50:07,009 --> 00:50:09,509
If we find that we can save Chan-soo.

702
00:50:09,899 --> 00:50:10,939
You can stop now.

703
00:50:11,865 --> 00:50:14,781
I found that black box
and also found the edited hour.

704
00:50:14,872 --> 00:50:17,989
Really? You thought of the black box too?

705
00:50:18,089 --> 00:50:20,209
Why didn't you tell me?
You should've told me sooner.

706
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,153
Why did you turn off your cell phone?

707
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:27,489
I was going around outside
so I couldn't recharge it.

708
00:50:27,579 --> 00:50:28,950
Why are you getting mad?

709
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:32,751
I found everything
so stop now and go home.

710
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:35,244
What was edited out?

711
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:37,509
Will we be able to save Chan-soo with it?

712
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:41,450
Yeah. We can start collecting data
from now on.

713
00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:44,930
Wow. That's a relief.

714
00:50:45,529 --> 00:50:46,865
That's a real relief.

715
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,269
What's wrong?

716
00:50:51,939 --> 00:50:55,107
I'm not sure.
My legs are suddenly getting weak.

717
00:50:57,809 --> 00:50:59,397
Have you eaten?

718
00:51:00,389 --> 00:51:01,424
Eat?

719
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:05,809
Now that I think about it,
when was the last time I ate?

720
00:51:05,899 --> 00:51:06,742
You!

721
00:51:11,317 --> 00:51:12,270
Just get on my back for now.

722
00:51:14,209 --> 00:51:16,609
No. I can go on my own.

723
00:51:16,709 --> 00:51:17,896
I'm fine.

724
00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:00,679
I was thrown away.

725
00:52:02,129 --> 00:52:03,989
You said you loved me!

726
00:52:04,129 --> 00:52:06,229
Hey! Hey! You!

727
00:52:09,219 --> 00:52:12,035
Die! Die!

728
00:52:31,579 --> 00:52:32,569
Gosh.

729
00:52:33,589 --> 00:52:35,579
Isn't she the one who crawled
in here last time?

730
00:52:36,259 --> 00:52:37,419
Yeah.

731
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:41,456
You're not going to get rid of her
this time either?

732
00:52:41,546 --> 00:52:43,407
She'll leave on her own when she wakes up.

733
00:53:11,739 --> 00:53:14,749
This is why my dad says that
your body suffers if you're not smart.

734
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,456
It would've been simple
if I inquired about the vehicle

735
00:53:16,546 --> 00:53:17,979
I just ran around for no reason.

736
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:21,583
Did you tell Chan-soo?

737
00:53:22,689 --> 00:53:23,669
Yeah.

738
00:53:24,909 --> 00:53:27,738
I really felt sorry towards Chan-soo.
I'm relieved.

739
00:53:28,769 --> 00:53:31,836
Then we just have to dig
into that black box from now on.

740
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:35,100
You have to share that video with us.

741
00:53:36,228 --> 00:53:37,200
Yeah.

742
00:53:42,183 --> 00:53:45,203
If I'd just thought of that black box
when I first saw the CCTV...

743
00:53:45,671 --> 00:53:47,276
it wouldn't have taken this long.

744
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,713
Why am I so stupid?

745
00:53:52,323 --> 00:53:53,677
I'm really sorry.

746
00:53:59,693 --> 00:54:02,175
Stop saying you're sorry.
What are you so sorry about?

747
00:54:03,224 --> 00:54:06,142
-I was just...
-You didn't slander my father.

748
00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:09,875
You didn't frame Chan-soo.
So why do you keep apologizing?

749
00:54:10,713 --> 00:54:11,926
You're being strange.

750
00:54:12,503 --> 00:54:14,241
Why do you keep getting mad at me?

751
00:54:14,332 --> 00:54:16,719
You're making me mad and irritating me.

752
00:54:18,513 --> 00:54:19,953
You said it before.

753
00:54:20,053 --> 00:54:22,513
You told me not to worry about you,
or to comfort you.

754
00:54:22,613 --> 00:54:24,691
You told me to stay still
so that you won't fall apart.

755
00:54:25,483 --> 00:54:27,857
All that I can do is to be sorry.
So what do you want me to do then?

756
00:54:29,363 --> 00:54:30,596
That bugs me too.

757
00:54:34,093 --> 00:54:35,172
Fine.

758
00:54:36,103 --> 00:54:37,840
I really won't do anything from now on.

759
00:54:38,463 --> 00:54:40,533
From now on, I won't
worry or comfort you.

760
00:54:41,372 --> 00:54:42,414
Or even feel sorry toward you.

761
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:44,521
Is that enough?

762
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,962
I was thinking that it's too shameless
to eat four bowls and just leave.

763
00:56:51,392 --> 00:56:52,938
Don't feel sorry.

764
00:56:55,013 --> 00:56:58,601
You're neither Song Cha-ok's daughter
nor a niece to me.

765
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:01,461
To me, you're just you.

766
00:57:02,943 --> 00:57:05,269
Dal-Po. I mean Ha-myung.

767
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,175
You can call me Dal-Po.

768
00:57:11,933 --> 00:57:16,184
I tried so hard. I tried everything.

769
00:57:18,263 --> 00:57:19,757
But it's been the same way
for a long time.

770
00:57:21,613 --> 00:57:25,763
When I think about my father,
my brother, and your mother,

771
00:57:25,863 --> 00:57:27,863
I know that I shouldn't be doing this.

772
00:57:29,823 --> 00:57:30,939
But I can't give you up.

773
00:57:33,063 --> 00:57:34,022
So we...

774
00:57:39,143 --> 00:57:40,644
I'm the same as you.

775
00:58:01,253 --> 00:58:02,561
Do you want to stop by my house?

776
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:05,947
-Your house? What house?
-The house I'm living in now.

777
00:58:06,433 --> 00:58:09,473
Son! It's natural for you to come home.
How did we become like this?

778
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:12,043
-The ones behind the fire...
-What do you want to say?

779
00:58:12,143 --> 00:58:14,993
-Mother!
-It seems we need to be more careful now.

780
00:58:15,093 --> 00:58:17,283
The earlier ones
were intentionally deleted?

781
00:58:17,383 --> 00:58:21,916
Choi In-ha.
How can you sleep in this situation?
