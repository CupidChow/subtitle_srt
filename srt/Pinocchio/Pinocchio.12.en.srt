1
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:11,907
Pinocchio

2
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,300
It’s nice to meet you.

3
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,030
Everything is ready here.

4
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,918
These are the interview questions,
but the order may change.

5
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,130
This is Reporter Choi Dal-Po from YGN.
Are you the informant?

6
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,700
It’s me, Ha-myung.

7
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,637
I'm your informant.

8
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,250
Jae-myung?

9
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,091
I turned myself in to you.

10
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,680
Jae-myung.

11
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,080
I'm going to leave it to you
to seek revenge for us.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,720
If you're going to do it...

13
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,468
then do it with flair.

14
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,730
Episode 12 -The Magic Flute

15
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,694
Dal-Po must be happy.

16
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:27,174
He gets to go before me,
and his story is cooler too.

17
00:02:27,474 --> 00:02:29,604
Hey, you'll get to do it too.

18
00:02:29,694 --> 00:02:33,064
But Dal-Po’s story is the sixth story
and mine is the eleventh.

19
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:35,774
My mother's going to fall asleep
waiting for me.

20
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,324
What about my mother?

21
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,134
Hey.

22
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:49,644
Hey, which button do you have to press
to record?

23
00:02:50,674 --> 00:02:53,769
What am I going to do
if In-ha and Dal-Po come out?

24
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:56,316
Are you going to let yourself
get fooled again?

25
00:02:57,164 --> 00:02:58,369
They're not going to be on TV.

26
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:01,514
I doubt they’ll get to be on TV
before we finish paying this TV off.

27
00:03:01,604 --> 00:03:06,194
You rotten jerk.
Are you hoping that they won't be on TV?

28
00:03:12,044 --> 00:03:13,714
Good evening.

29
00:03:17,724 --> 00:03:21,696
From now on, even the parents
who have children under the age of 8

30
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:27,566
or lower than second grade
can apply for child care compensation.

31
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:31,696
Wasn't it too cruel,
giving hat item to Choi Dal-Po today?

32
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:34,867
It was his own decision.

33
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:51,024
Did you come here because you were worried
what Ki Jae-myung will do?

34
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:52,264
Yeah.

35
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:11,664
It’s time for “Issue People” where we meet
a person who's been the topic of the week.

36
00:04:11,754 --> 00:04:14,614
Our special guest on News Times

37
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:19,034
is the national hero who risked his life
to save a child from a drunk driver.

38
00:04:19,124 --> 00:04:21,674
Mr Ki Jae-myung, everyone.

39
00:04:22,324 --> 00:04:23,575
Hello.

40
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:26,348
It’s nice to meet you.

41
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:31,954
You received more attention
when it was revealed

42
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:34,494
that you were a victim of the media

43
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:37,304
in the Michungri waste plant fire
13 years ago.

44
00:04:38,634 --> 00:04:43,255
We met here 13 years ago, right?

45
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:45,414
Yes.

46
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:51,198
I requested an interview from you because
I wanted to prove my father’s innocence.

47
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:55,724
MSC was the only TV station
that listened to Gi Jae-myung

48
00:04:55,814 --> 00:04:58,076
and his story of injustice at that time.

49
00:04:58,552 --> 00:04:59,984
We've saved the interview video,

50
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:03,584
thinking that there will be a day
that we may be able to show it.

51
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,924
Mr Ki Jae-myung who was 17 at the time,

52
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:11,124
and we will now share with you
the interview video for the first time.

53
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:14,664
This is...

54
00:05:15,574 --> 00:05:19,549
This is the Best Fireman of the Year award
that my father won last year.

55
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:23,514
For 21 years and two months
that my father worked as a fireman,

56
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:30,130
he put out 730 fires,
and saved over 1400 lives and property.

57
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:32,664
He received this award
for his dedication.

58
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:35,614
He’s not the type of person
to abandon his colleagues and run away.

59
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:38,979
Furthermore, he is not someone
who would abandon his family to hide.

60
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:42,309
As his son...

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,422
I'd rather die than to accept
my father's death.

62
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:50,024
But I know the truth because I'm his son.

63
00:05:50,114 --> 00:05:51,744
My father...

64
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,674
died in the line of duty.

65
00:05:58,584 --> 00:05:59,863
Mr Ki Jae-myung.

66
00:06:00,424 --> 00:06:04,084
Do you remember this interview
from 13 years ago?

67
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:05,424
Yes.

68
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:08,998
I haven’t forgotten a single word.

69
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:10,345
And...

70
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:16,519
I also remember how you told them
to edit that interview.

71
00:06:18,484 --> 00:06:20,114
At the time, you said that

72
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:22,824
you could just use the part where I
screamed that I wished my father was alive

73
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:26,905
even if my father is reviled.

74
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:31,533
But that part is missing

75
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:34,500
from the video you showed today.

76
00:06:43,414 --> 00:06:45,884
Don't look at the camera,
just talk to me.

77
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:46,912
Are you ready?

78
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,984
Yes.

79
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:52,656
What is that trophy?

80
00:06:57,694 --> 00:06:59,914
What do you think?
Was the interview useful?

81
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:05,364
Yeah. Just use the part where he screams
he wants him alive, even if he is reviled.

82
00:07:05,454 --> 00:07:07,804
I think that’s going too far.

83
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,224
-That’s not the main point.
-To me, that is the main point.

84
00:07:16,864 --> 00:07:19,824
-Let’s move on to the next question.
-It's funny...

85
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:22,544
that depending on the edit...

86
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:26,371
a person can become a devil, or a hero.

87
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:31,814
With that kind of editing...

88
00:07:31,904 --> 00:07:35,098
you made my father into a devil
13 years ago.

89
00:07:43,474 --> 00:07:47,444
It’s an incident
that happened 13 years ago.

90
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:51,754
Please consider the fact that
the media wasn’t mature at that time.

91
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:53,504
Do you mean...

92
00:07:53,884 --> 00:07:58,320
that it’s more mature now?

93
00:07:59,204 --> 00:08:00,324
Of course.

94
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:02,013
It took some time,
but wasn’t it our MSC News

95
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:07,974
that informed the world
about your father’s injustice?

96
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:10,994
It goes the same for your heroic story.

97
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:12,265
I can’t agree with you.

98
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:15,774
You’re making the same mistake

99
00:08:15,864 --> 00:08:19,094
you made 13 years ago.

100
00:08:22,104 --> 00:08:25,864
Just as you made my father
into a devil from a hero...

101
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:30,114
you've made me, a murderer...

102
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,154
into a hero.

103
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:41,544
What do you mean you’re a murderer?

104
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:49,411
Yes, I've killed someone.

105
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:56,494
If you can’t believe me,
turn to YGN news to find out.

106
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,460
This is YGN exclusive report.

107
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:46,044
Do you remember the hero Ki Jae-myung,
who became a big story

108
00:09:46,134 --> 00:09:48,574
when he saved
a middle school student recently?

109
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:53,034
But surprisingly,
Mr Ki has revealed that he’s a murderer.

110
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:56,104
Ki met with one of our reporters

111
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:59,654
and confessed that
he took the lives of three people.

112
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:02,464
This is YGN exclusive news report.

113
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:05,734
The body of 54-year-old Mr Moon,
who is the prime suspect

114
00:10:05,824 --> 00:10:08,194
of the container arson murder
that took place on the 26th of last month

115
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:12,394
was discovered in the manhole in
Han River District in Seoul around 6 PM.

116
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:15,304
There were no external injuries.

117
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:19,056
An autopsy will be needed
to find out the exact cause.

118
00:10:22,064 --> 00:10:24,994
Moon Deuk-soo’s body is here?

119
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:26,028
Yeah.

120
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:29,529
How do you know that?

121
00:10:29,924 --> 00:10:33,938
-The killer gave me the information.
-Who is the killer?

122
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,672
Ki Jae-myung.

123
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:39,314
Wow. Of course.

124
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:41,814
I knew it. I had a feeling.

125
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:47,875
But why did Ki Jae-myung send you this?

126
00:10:50,423 --> 00:10:52,034
Ki Jae-myung is my older brother.

127
00:10:57,344 --> 00:10:59,704
That merciless brat.

128
00:11:00,204 --> 00:11:01,702
To his own brother...

129
00:11:04,148 --> 00:11:05,624
How can he expose that?

130
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:07,944
Mr Moon was discovered as a corpse.

131
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,934
Ki Jae-myung not only revealed
that he murdered Mr Moon

132
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:14,944
but that he also murdered Mr Kwon
and Park from the container arson murder.

133
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:17,082
He sent the evidence himself.

134
00:11:17,172 --> 00:11:21,960
I was angry at those people
that framed by father 13 years ago...

135
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:26,037
and I did something I shouldn’t have.

136
00:11:26,128 --> 00:11:29,562
As soon as Mr Ki turns himself in,
the police will begin the investigation

137
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:32,012
including whether
he actually committed the crime.

138
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:38,182
Mr Ki decided to turn himself in,
because the media portrayal wasn't true

139
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:42,572
and decided that
he couldn’t deceive people any further.

140
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:49,222
This is Ki Ha-myung of YGN news.

141
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,032
Dal-Po.

142
00:12:03,112 --> 00:12:05,242
What was that just now?

143
00:12:05,582 --> 00:12:10,882
Why did he say Ki Ha-myung,
not Choi Dal-Po?

144
00:12:56,972 --> 00:12:58,971
Did you finish the report well?

145
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:01,422
Yeah.

146
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:07,576
I also screwed over reporter Song Cha-ok.

147
00:13:11,092 --> 00:13:12,612
You did well.

148
00:13:12,702 --> 00:13:14,228
You did well, Jae-myung.

149
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:29,132
Sir.

150
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:34,312
We have been apart for so long...

151
00:13:36,396 --> 00:13:38,112
and I have to leave so soon.

152
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:43,458
It would’ve been nice if we'd met earlier.

153
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:45,512
I'm sorry, Jae-myung.

154
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:47,672
I'm sorry.

155
00:13:54,986 --> 00:13:56,460
Today is just the beginning.

156
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:02,362
From now on you are going to go
up against reporter Song Cha-ok alone.

157
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,916
Show what a proper reporter looks like
to both reporter Song Cha-ok and me.

158
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:22,395
I trust you.

159
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:24,882
Jae-myung.

160
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:29,442
Here.

161
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,592
Pinky swear.

162
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:42,172
Stamp.

163
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:48,102
Copy.

164
00:14:58,286 --> 00:15:00,012
It's been stamped and sealed.

165
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:01,672
Jae-myung. Jae-myung.

166
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,041
I leave everything to you.

167
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:28,192
Ha-myung.

168
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:15,882
Have you...

169
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,572
found a place to live?

170
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:21,042
Yes.

171
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,847
I think I’m going to live in the house
that my brother used to live.

172
00:16:27,902 --> 00:16:29,273
Can't you...

173
00:16:29,849 --> 00:16:32,902
Can't you just live here?

174
00:16:35,145 --> 00:16:36,541
I...

175
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:41,818
I don’t care what your story is.

176
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:45,404
To me, you're just...

177
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:50,332
my son, Choi Dal-Po.

178
00:16:52,086 --> 00:16:53,402
I'm sorry.

179
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:59,841
Was it that difficult living here?

180
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:05,601
Yes.

181
00:17:07,614 --> 00:17:08,682
It's...

182
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:16,132
It's been painful for me.

183
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:20,653
No. I was happy.

184
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:25,901
To the point where I felt sorry
for my brother.

185
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:28,074
Yes, of course.

186
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:32,970
You had to hide that horrible story

187
00:17:35,566 --> 00:17:37,604
and had to suffer through it alone.

188
00:17:38,477 --> 00:17:40,698
Yes, of course it must have been tough.

189
00:17:41,664 --> 00:17:43,526
Okay. Okay.

190
00:17:47,028 --> 00:17:50,333
I want to find my real name.

191
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,972
What?

192
00:17:57,695 --> 00:17:59,217
In order for me to do that,

193
00:18:00,553 --> 00:18:02,288
I’ll need you to dissolve my adoption.

194
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,531
How could you say that?

195
00:18:10,782 --> 00:18:12,941
How could you?

196
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:15,862
How...

197
00:18:16,452 --> 00:18:18,222
How could you be so harsh?

198
00:18:26,862 --> 00:18:28,412
I'm sorry, father.

199
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:31,192
But I don't think...

200
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:33,717
I should be allowed to be happy anymore.

201
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,454
Is this going to be my room now?

202
00:18:53,737 --> 00:18:56,622
I finally get to have my own room
past the age of 50.

203
00:18:59,446 --> 00:19:00,930
What’s going to happen
with you and In-ha?

204
00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:06,783
Everything was settled.

205
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,680
You don’t have to worry.

206
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:16,956
Don't leave.

207
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:25,118
Every hurtful thing I said to you...

208
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:27,092
I’ll take back all of it.

209
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:29,222
I'm sorry.

210
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:32,560
So please don't leave.

211
00:19:35,464 --> 00:19:36,752
I'm sorry.

212
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:39,577
If I were to be happy by myself...

213
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:44,478
then it would be doing wrong
to my brother.

214
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:53,472
Thank you for everything.

215
00:19:58,213 --> 00:19:59,642
Please be well.

216
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:09,895
Your name is Choi Dal-Po.

217
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:12,674
Your name is Choi Dal-Po.

218
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,132
Father.

219
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,553
In Ha, what are you doing?
Why aren’t you coming out?

220
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,572
I’m going to start that revenge properly.

221
00:21:12,682 --> 00:21:13,909
And that is why...

222
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,052
I gave up on In-ha.

223
00:22:04,512 --> 00:22:05,652
Don't worry.

224
00:22:06,094 --> 00:22:07,584
I can get over my feelings.

225
00:22:08,191 --> 00:22:09,332
So...

226
00:22:09,945 --> 00:22:11,329
don’t worry about me.

227
00:22:12,411 --> 00:22:15,312
Don’t hesitate because of me.
Fight with my mom properly.

228
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,804
You can hate her all you want.
Argue with her and get angry at her.

229
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,702
Today is just the beginning.

230
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:53,272
From now on,
you will have to face Song Cha-ok alone.

231
00:22:55,706 --> 00:22:59,566
Show what a proper reporter looks like

232
00:22:59,657 --> 00:23:03,009
to reporter Song Cha-ok and me.

233
00:23:24,832 --> 00:23:26,585
To my younger brother Ki Ha-myung.

234
00:24:15,844 --> 00:24:18,365
Are you having a hard time with anything?
Is there anything you need?

235
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:21,016
No.

236
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,532
I'm glad I listened to you.

237
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,969
If I didn’t turn myself,

238
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:33,913
I wouldn’t have been able to see
your funny face often.

239
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:44,308
Tomorrow is the crime scene inspection,
right?

240
00:24:46,322 --> 00:24:47,512
Yeah.

241
00:24:47,795 --> 00:24:49,268
Bring me some comfortable clothes.

242
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,404
I think I’ll stand out too much
if I go to the inspection like this.

243
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,261
Alright.

244
00:24:57,935 --> 00:25:00,515
Be sure to come
to the crime scene inspection.

245
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:05,562
Even though you’ll see
the unsightly side of me

246
00:25:06,024 --> 00:25:10,640
but it’s the last chance
for us to see each other outside.

247
00:25:16,902 --> 00:25:18,092
Yeah.

248
00:25:23,582 --> 00:25:28,212
Anyway that Choi Dal-Po,
no, that guy named Ki Ha-myung,

249
00:25:29,122 --> 00:25:31,072
He's really heartless.

250
00:25:32,102 --> 00:25:34,752
-How so?
-That guy...

251
00:25:34,842 --> 00:25:37,967
convinced his brother to turn himself in
because he wanted an exclusive.

252
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,761
Would you arrest your family
for a special promotion?

253
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:44,716
You brat.
Do I look like that kind of person?

254
00:25:44,807 --> 00:25:46,677
Your level of thinking...

255
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:51,827
Don’t you think
Dal-Po might have cheated?

256
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:56,222
Don’t you think that All-zero
didn’t cheat but stole the test?

257
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,402
What about my level? What about it?

258
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:03,542
Your level of thinking is
exactly like mine.

259
00:26:04,215 --> 00:26:05,442
What is your level of thinking?

260
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:09,562
I’m thoughtless and shallow.

261
00:26:10,226 --> 00:26:12,967
You brat, what did you say? Ahn Chan-soo!

262
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,261
Did you visit your brother?

263
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:28,256
Are you going to
the crime scene inspection tomorrow too?

264
00:26:28,347 --> 00:26:30,208
The inspection...

265
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:34,492
I tried to make it closed to public
but it didn’t work out.

266
00:26:34,582 --> 00:26:35,867
I'm sorry.

267
00:26:37,201 --> 00:26:39,693
Please take good care of my brother.

268
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,341
Don't worry.

269
00:26:59,872 --> 00:27:02,266
That guy's Gi Jae-myung’s younger brother,
right?

270
00:27:03,094 --> 00:27:05,434
What do you think about
getting some footage of him first?

271
00:27:05,672 --> 00:27:09,603
What are you even going to do with it?
Do you think it will be useful?

272
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,482
The reporter brother reporting
that his older brother is a murderer,

273
00:27:12,572 --> 00:27:14,792
I think we can make a story out of it.

274
00:27:15,112 --> 00:27:16,094
I’m not sure.

275
00:27:16,774 --> 00:27:18,958
-I don’t think we can.
-Hey!

276
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,922
Are you here to cover the inspection
or some gossip news?

277
00:27:23,012 --> 00:27:26,772
Jae-hwan. Why are you both picking on me?

278
00:27:26,863 --> 00:27:27,944
Move aside!

279
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:30,074
He’s here!

280
00:27:38,612 --> 00:27:40,372
Let’s go.

281
00:27:40,462 --> 00:27:41,502
The suspect

282
00:27:49,562 --> 00:27:52,807
-Have you committed any other crime?
-Was saving the kid just a show?

283
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:54,258
Do you have anything
to say to the victims’ families?

284
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:57,721
Did you hope that your heroic action
would cover up your crime?

285
00:28:09,378 --> 00:28:10,914
What are you all doing?

286
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,822
You don’t have to answer every question.
Just focus on the crime scene inspection.

287
00:28:23,392 --> 00:28:26,292
Reporters. Please quiet down.
You’re interfering with our work.

288
00:28:26,682 --> 00:28:28,352
Please quiet down.

289
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:32,824
Please move aside now.

290
00:29:39,842 --> 00:29:41,052
Are you alright?

291
00:29:41,142 --> 00:29:42,944
You don't look alright.

292
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:53,002
I'm alright.

293
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,652
I'm fine.

294
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,912
So don’t do anything and stay still.

295
00:30:08,752 --> 00:30:09,785
Dal-Po.

296
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:13,035
Don't call me by that name.

297
00:30:14,532 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm fine.

298
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,215
So don’t worry about me
or try to comfort me.

299
00:30:21,074 --> 00:30:22,345
So that I won't fall...

300
00:30:23,495 --> 00:30:24,942
so that I won't sway.

301
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,122
Just please don't do anything.

302
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,478
Did you say that he was your uncle?
Choi Dal-Po.

303
00:31:12,844 --> 00:31:14,977
He's Ki Jae-myung’s younger brother.

304
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:18,191
Did you know this?

305
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,532
Yes.

306
00:31:21,592 --> 00:31:23,755
To think that your uncle
was the younger brother of a murderer...

307
00:31:24,802 --> 00:31:26,542
what a scary world.

308
00:31:28,515 --> 00:31:30,336
I’m a daughter of a murderer too.

309
00:31:36,317 --> 00:31:38,179
You murdered someone with your words.

310
00:31:52,742 --> 00:31:55,992
The search words relating to Song Cha-ok
have completely changed over a few days.

311
00:31:56,355 --> 00:31:59,112
Fabrication anchor, fabrication Song,
reporter trash Song...

312
00:31:59,202 --> 00:32:01,232
Ki Jae-myung’s case was really huge.

313
00:32:02,632 --> 00:32:03,432
What are you doing?

314
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,599
I made a café called Song Jeung Mo.

315
00:32:06,106 --> 00:32:07,239
I’m going to post something there.

316
00:32:08,062 --> 00:32:10,439
'Song Jeung Mo?' What does that mean?

317
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,985
It's for everyone
that despises Song Cha-ok.

318
00:32:13,477 --> 00:32:15,462
I’ll show you
the power of the public opinion.

319
00:32:16,827 --> 00:32:19,578
-This is from that lecture.
-I edited it.

320
00:32:20,131 --> 00:32:24,777
Once I reveal this,
that will be the end of her.

321
00:32:25,626 --> 00:32:28,722
The one who succeeded by fabrication
will be brought down by fabrication.

322
00:32:29,482 --> 00:32:32,644
Hey, why do you hate Song Cha-ok so much?

323
00:32:32,853 --> 00:32:34,627
Because she is hateful.

324
00:32:36,028 --> 00:32:40,880
And I feel sorry for Choi Dal-Po,
I mean Ki Ha-myung.

325
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:42,347
I want to get revenge for him.

326
00:32:42,438 --> 00:32:45,507
-You’re sorry? What about?
-It’s about Ki Ha-myung’s case.

327
00:32:45,887 --> 00:32:47,341
Not knowing that it was about his brother,

328
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:49,434
I only saw it as a story.

329
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,669
I learned a lot from this.

330
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:55,471
To us, it might be just a story
but it could be life to someone else.

331
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,686
I thought of it too lightly.

332
00:32:59,884 --> 00:33:01,022
The video's uploaded.

333
00:33:05,306 --> 00:33:08,161
This article is based on facts only.
Not interesting.

334
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:12,201
It’s not flavorful or stylish.
Facts alone don't make it interesting.

335
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,661
You need seasoning.
To get more attention...

336
00:33:15,751 --> 00:33:19,771
Put aside things from ethics textbooks
like reporting ethics or sense of duty.

337
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:22,911
We need to add more impact to the facts.

338
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,681
That’s right Song Cha-ok.

339
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:29,073
You’re going to get all kinds of criticism
from this world now.

340
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:31,663
I’m not sure if you’re being nice or bad.

341
00:33:31,754 --> 00:33:33,161
Most people are like that.

342
00:33:33,251 --> 00:33:36,188
They’re more attracted to talking bad
than praising other people.

343
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,154
You have talent in editing.

344
00:33:47,491 --> 00:33:54,491
Song Cha-ok loses MSC News credibility
with interview fabrication

345
00:34:04,495 --> 00:34:06,856
-Please turn off the music.
-Yes.

346
00:34:15,232 --> 00:34:16,681
Please stop the car for a moment.

347
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:34,668
So your real name is Ki Ha-myung, right?

348
00:34:38,191 --> 00:34:42,061
That’s why you’ve been
targeting me all this time.

349
00:34:42,738 --> 00:34:48,467
I finally understood
what you growled at me at that time.

350
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:54,691
It looks like you even turned
your brother in to get at me.

351
00:34:54,781 --> 00:34:56,171
It's a shame...

352
00:34:56,271 --> 00:34:58,406
but it didn’t work at all.

353
00:34:59,383 --> 00:35:00,590
You must be nervous.

354
00:35:02,422 --> 00:35:04,419
You’re answering questions
that I didn’t even ask...

355
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,545
and your voice is unusually shaky.

356
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:12,491
Are you...

357
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,618
scared of me now?

358
00:35:18,196 --> 00:35:19,291
Not at all.

359
00:35:19,381 --> 00:35:20,688
That’s good then.

360
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:23,955
Even if you are, don’t let it show.

361
00:35:24,415 --> 00:35:26,054
Don’t fall so easily either.

362
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:29,809
It won’t be fun then.

363
00:35:31,752 --> 00:35:34,535
I’m expecting this fight
to be quite long.

364
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:39,861
I was curious.

365
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:44,041
Whether Song Cha-ok
was a bad reporter just to me

366
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:46,349
or to everyone else.

367
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:50,781
Whether the embers of distrust
that my brother and I threw at her

368
00:35:50,871 --> 00:35:53,641
would go out like this or blaze up.

369
00:35:54,745 --> 00:35:55,862
I was quite curious.

370
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,911
But that ember

371
00:36:02,511 --> 00:36:04,398
began to blaze up more than I had thought.

372
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:08,772
She looks down on the viewers.

373
00:36:11,863 --> 00:36:15,461
-Hey, don’t you think she really sucks?
-I know, right?

374
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:18,011
-What is it?
-Have you seen this?

375
00:36:18,101 --> 00:36:19,541
-What is it?
-What's that?

376
00:36:19,631 --> 00:36:23,091
Apparently, she was kneeling down
when she was doing this.

377
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:28,051
-That’s why she’s the Queen of Fabrication.
-She could be an actress.

378
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:33,386
That ember caught wind...

379
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:36,176
and spread more and more.

380
00:36:37,688 --> 00:36:39,661
In the end,
it became my ember of opportunity.

381
00:36:39,751 --> 00:36:41,261
Public demands for
Sung Cha-ok's termination.

382
00:36:41,351 --> 00:36:43,461
We are in front of the MSC TV station
in Seoul, Han River district.

383
00:36:43,551 --> 00:36:46,211
The public continues to hold
demonstration demanding

384
00:36:46,301 --> 00:36:49,641
that Anchor Song Cha-ok be terminated
for her news editing and fabrication.

385
00:36:49,731 --> 00:36:51,771
There are some who are claiming
that they were victimized

386
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:54,521
by her false reports in the past.

387
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:57,281
Mr Cho Jang-won, who owned a bus company
until six years ago, claims

388
00:36:57,371 --> 00:37:02,191
that he had to close the business due to
her report from when she was a reporter.

389
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:05,631
The incident began when Mr Cha
who worked as a bus driver at his company

390
00:37:05,721 --> 00:37:09,761
died soon after getting fired.

391
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:12,061
At that time, reporter Song reported
exclusively that Mr Cha

392
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:14,651
was accused of embezzling 60 cents
from the bus fare and got fired.

393
00:37:14,741 --> 00:37:18,190
And that he couldn’t handle the injustice
that he committed suicide.

394
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:22,321
He died of an illness actually.

395
00:37:22,601 --> 00:37:28,091
But she reported that
he committed suicide because of me.

396
00:37:28,251 --> 00:37:33,669
This is Mr Cha Dae-geun’s
death certificate.

397
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:34,930
Look.

398
00:37:35,021 --> 00:37:36,701
It wasn’t a suicide.

399
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:41,581
People pointed at me saying
that I was a murderer

400
00:37:41,671 --> 00:37:47,796
and refused to get on my buses
and in the end my company was ruined.

401
00:37:47,887 --> 00:37:52,386
Mr Cho is laying down these claims
and demanding Song’s official apology

402
00:37:52,476 --> 00:37:57,006
but MSC news department
hasn’t shown an official position yet.

403
00:37:57,096 --> 00:37:59,463
This is Kang Sung-hak from NTS news.

404
00:38:03,136 --> 00:38:06,606
These NTS guys
really have no business ethics.

405
00:38:06,964 --> 00:38:10,377
How can they slander
another company’s anchor so shamelessly?

406
00:38:10,596 --> 00:38:14,309
Report this bus company president
for defamation of character.

407
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:18,836
-Let’s just cover it up and move on.
-This isn't something we can cover up.

408
00:38:18,926 --> 00:38:20,150
We need to give an explanation.

409
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,982
Is there something
that you’d be suspected of?

410
00:38:27,382 --> 00:38:30,116
There was too much circumstantial evidence
that it was a suicide.

411
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:33,306
-Even his family said it was a suicide.
-So...

412
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:36,166
So you had already decided on the answer
before you covered the story?

413
00:38:37,846 --> 00:38:40,720
-What about the death certificate?
-I didn’t verify it.

414
00:38:41,496 --> 00:38:46,076
What? Then is that story true?

415
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:47,135
No. It’s not but...

416
00:38:47,226 --> 00:38:49,260
You’re saying you aren't
100 percent sure.

417
00:38:50,557 --> 00:38:52,742
-No.
-Then you can’t give an explanation?

418
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:56,617
-I'm sorry.
-If that man's words are true...

419
00:38:58,179 --> 00:38:59,640
resign from the anchor position.

420
00:39:02,956 --> 00:39:04,256
Yes.

421
00:39:10,216 --> 00:39:12,104
You want me to dig into
the bus company owner?

422
00:39:12,195 --> 00:39:12,894
Yeah.

423
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:16,556
-And report only to me.
-Then what about the captain?

424
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,257
I just told you to report only to me.

425
00:39:19,046 --> 00:39:21,846
-Okay.
-I’m sorry Ms Song.

426
00:39:22,347 --> 00:39:25,441
-Was I that untrustworthy?
-Captain.

427
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,946
Don’t worry, Ms Song.

428
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:33,097
I plan to entrust it to someone
who is even more trustworthy than Il-joo.

429
00:39:33,756 --> 00:39:38,138
How can we just entrust it to anyone
when your life is on the line?

430
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:42,950
If we entrust it to just any reporter,
they’ll just see it as an excuse

431
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,344
and no explanation will work.

432
00:39:44,435 --> 00:39:45,358
But...

433
00:39:47,023 --> 00:39:50,639
if a Pinocchio covers this,
they won’t be able to say that

434
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,651
and the controversy will subside as well.

435
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:56,587
-You don’t mean...
-Yes.

436
00:39:57,954 --> 00:39:59,576
Choi In-ha and Seo Bum-Jo.

437
00:40:00,416 --> 00:40:04,496
From now on, I want you to prove
Ms Song’s innocence no matter what.

438
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:06,455
Don't leave a single thing out,
and turn over every stone

439
00:40:06,936 --> 00:40:09,217
and you'll report directly to me.
Is that understood?

440
00:40:09,308 --> 00:40:10,438
Excuse me?

441
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:13,614
-Yes.
-Yes.

442
00:40:14,874 --> 00:40:16,530
Why are you doing something
that you weren’t told to do?

443
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,853
Are you ignoring the order of things?

444
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:22,161
You’re the one who has ignored it.

445
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:27,216
The task of assigning reporters to cases
only rests with the captain.

446
00:40:34,884 --> 00:40:38,803
NTS really picked on an anchor
from another station.

447
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,063
-Didn’t they go too far?
-I don't know.

448
00:40:41,154 --> 00:40:44,215
If there is something to be picked on, then
they should be, regardless of the station.

449
00:40:44,306 --> 00:40:48,566
60 cents suicide story even won
a broadcasting reporter award.

450
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,606
Seeing that MSC is not giving
an official explanation.

451
00:40:52,696 --> 00:40:54,301
Don’t you think there's something fishy?

452
00:40:54,392 --> 00:40:55,876
If anchor Song reported it properly,

453
00:40:55,966 --> 00:40:59,106
they would’ve filed a defamation suit
and be done with it.

454
00:40:59,196 --> 00:41:00,891
But that hasn't happened.

455
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:05,456
It’s clear that Fabrication Song,
I mean anchor Song, gave a false report.

456
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:07,476
Since NTS news made the news solely based

457
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:10,756
on the bus company owner's story,
it's meaningless.

458
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:14,230
If you want to make the news properly,
you have to verify the other side too.

459
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:16,427
Do you understand, Ki Ha-myung?

460
00:41:18,062 --> 00:41:19,758
-Excuse me?
-No way.

461
00:41:20,216 --> 00:41:23,046
Would you be able to look into
anchor Song’s false report case?

462
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:27,604
Yes. I will do my best, Captain.

463
00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:31,163
Then the next item...

464
00:41:36,491 --> 00:41:39,066
Yoon Yoo-Rae, work on it with him
and get it done by this Thursday.

465
00:41:39,466 --> 00:41:40,616
Yes, Captain!

466
00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:48,006
So you’re in charge of Song Cha-ok’s
false report case?

467
00:41:48,326 --> 00:41:52,688
Yeah. So I think I’ll be able to keep
the promise I made to you soon.

468
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:54,936
That news even won an award

469
00:41:55,026 --> 00:41:56,866
so if she falsely reported,
it will really be over.

470
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:01,036
Tell me more.
What kind of incident is it?

471
00:42:01,631 --> 00:42:03,256
Six years ago, there was an incident
where a bus driver was fired

472
00:42:03,346 --> 00:42:05,710
for embezzling 60 cents,
and he committed suicide.

473
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:10,166
A bus driver who was fired
after being accused of embezzling 60 cents

474
00:42:10,256 --> 00:42:13,606
couldn’t handle it and committed suicide.
It shocked the nation.

475
00:42:13,696 --> 00:42:17,506
Mr Cha, in his 40s,
worked as a bus driver in Seoul,

476
00:42:17,596 --> 00:42:20,596
and his body was found
at his house this morning.

477
00:42:20,866 --> 00:42:22,366
According to his family,

478
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:26,046
Mr Cha was suffering from depression
after being fired a month earlier.

479
00:42:26,136 --> 00:42:31,816
While the family was out,
he overdosed on sedatives and died.

480
00:42:31,906 --> 00:42:36,109
The reason for Mr Cha’s dismissal
was embezzlement of 60 cents.

481
00:42:36,696 --> 00:42:39,436
Although Mr Cha claimed that
it was a simple calculation error

482
00:42:39,526 --> 00:42:44,004
and that his termination wasn't fair,
the company did not accept it in the end.

483
00:42:44,673 --> 00:42:48,788
Even if it’s 60 cents embezzlement,
it’s still embezzlement.

484
00:42:50,165 --> 00:42:53,618
His termination was justified.

485
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:57,455
His suicide is regrettable.

486
00:42:57,626 --> 00:43:00,096
The sole breadwinner in his 40s,
responsible for providing for his family,

487
00:43:00,186 --> 00:43:03,906
gave up his life over a mere 60 cents.

488
00:43:03,996 --> 00:43:06,946
The bus company
is under severe public criticism.

489
00:43:07,036 --> 00:43:09,788
This is Song Cha-ok from MSC news.

490
00:43:11,016 --> 00:43:13,466
Then why is it such a big problem?

491
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:17,096
The bus driver didn’t commit suicide,
he died of a chronic heart condition.

492
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,940
And anchor Song made it sound
like a suicide.

493
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:23,188
In the end, the bus company was criticized
and even went bankrupt.

494
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:27,905
The owner must really feel
that it was unfair.

495
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,755
That’s why I’m going to try
to reveal that injustice

496
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:34,216
If I do this right,

497
00:43:34,306 --> 00:43:37,734
then Song Cha-ok won’t be able to come out
on TV as a reporter anymore.

498
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:40,916
I’m looking forward to it.

499
00:43:41,006 --> 00:43:43,216
I'm looking forward to see
how you’ll bring down Song Cha-ok.

500
00:43:43,805 --> 00:43:47,226
Don’t worry. I’ll drag her down properly.

501
00:43:49,516 --> 00:43:51,501
Did you meet with a lawyer?

502
00:43:53,856 --> 00:43:55,772
Yeah, I met with one.

503
00:43:56,419 --> 00:43:59,691
-How was it? Was he okay?
-He seems like a nice guy.

504
00:44:01,546 --> 00:44:04,259
But he seems a bit clumsy and slow.

505
00:44:05,446 --> 00:44:06,737
I'm not sure yet.

506
00:44:07,456 --> 00:44:09,456
He can’t be clumsy and slow
when he’s a lawyer.

507
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:11,271
What's his name?
Did you memorize his number?

508
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:17,126
Yes, Mother. I was assigned
to the same case as In-ha again.

509
00:44:17,216 --> 00:44:18,456
What’s wrong?

510
00:44:18,546 --> 00:44:21,265
You were eager to work with her before.

511
00:44:21,356 --> 00:44:24,489
I just want to end it now.

512
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,547
It feels like a fight
with no chance of success.

513
00:44:28,816 --> 00:44:30,036
So it's discouraging.

514
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,306
Then there’s nothing you can do.

515
00:44:32,396 --> 00:44:34,214
How do you plan on getting over it?

516
00:44:34,946 --> 00:44:38,335
I’m going to tell her about
stealing her texts.

517
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:39,716
Really?

518
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,344
Then she'll really resent you.

519
00:44:42,895 --> 00:44:44,493
That's why I'm telling her.

520
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,084
So that I can stop
having feelings for her.

521
00:44:47,876 --> 00:44:51,307
If she hits me, I’ll get let her
and if she curses me, I’ll hear her out.

522
00:44:54,226 --> 00:44:56,256
Ki Jae-myung, the national hero
turns out to be a murderer.

523
00:44:56,346 --> 00:44:59,156
Then you should quit being a reporter
while you’re at it.

524
00:44:59,526 --> 00:45:01,935
You started this
because you wanted to see Choi In-ha.

525
00:45:04,626 --> 00:45:05,748
Yes.

526
00:45:07,196 --> 00:45:10,606
Then would it be okay to accept
a potential marriage meeting?

527
00:45:10,696 --> 00:45:14,566
-Professor Pyo's daughter is...
-I'm not interested in that yet.

528
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:17,033
I’m not in the mood for
something like that.

529
00:45:17,586 --> 00:45:21,496
Still, I’ll send you the picture
so just take a look at it.

530
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:24,270
Its fine, mother.

531
00:45:31,415 --> 00:45:32,386
Mother

532
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:35,397
I told her not to send it.

533
00:45:41,796 --> 00:45:44,774
Whoa! No, I don't have time for this.

534
00:45:57,136 --> 00:45:58,636
Alright.

535
00:45:58,826 --> 00:46:00,814
I’ll tell her and end it clean.

536
00:46:04,256 --> 00:46:07,991
If she hit me, I’ll get hit
and if she curses me, I’ll hear her out.

537
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,770
-Choi In-ha, I have something to tell you.
-What is it?

538
00:46:20,896 --> 00:46:22,966
The person who stole your texts
for the past 13 years...

539
00:46:24,736 --> 00:46:25,770
that was me.

540
00:46:28,126 --> 00:46:29,506
What?

541
00:46:30,303 --> 00:46:31,933
I'm sorry.

542
00:46:32,483 --> 00:46:34,291
-I’ve done wrong...
-You jerk!

543
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:42,249
What is it that you have to tell me?

544
00:46:47,183 --> 00:46:49,066
You said something about

545
00:46:49,156 --> 00:46:51,864
a person who stole your text for 13 years.

546
00:46:51,954 --> 00:46:53,087
Yeah.

547
00:46:55,254 --> 00:46:56,622
Don’t you resent that person?

548
00:46:57,046 --> 00:46:59,052
If those texts were properly delivered,

549
00:46:59,142 --> 00:47:02,106
your relationship with your mother
wouldn’t be twisted to this degree.

550
00:47:03,427 --> 00:47:04,557
I don't know.

551
00:47:04,647 --> 00:47:06,761
I did resent that person at first
but now I’m not.

552
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,393
If those text went to my mom,

553
00:47:09,483 --> 00:47:11,787
she would’ve told me not to text her
and ended it.

554
00:47:13,123 --> 00:47:14,310
Do you think so?

555
00:47:15,653 --> 00:47:18,823
I’m thankful to that person
who got those texts instead.

556
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:22,673
That person was my bamboo forest
for 13 years

557
00:47:22,763 --> 00:47:23,817
and he was my diary.

558
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,267
I’m kind of disappointed because
I have no where else to send the texts.

559
00:47:31,033 --> 00:47:31,989
Really?

560
00:47:36,983 --> 00:47:38,513
This is not it.

561
00:47:38,923 --> 00:47:40,672
Then I won’t be able to end it.

562
00:47:41,373 --> 00:47:42,297
End what?

563
00:47:42,713 --> 00:47:44,762
What? No, it’s nothing.

564
00:47:45,885 --> 00:47:48,655
I've put together questions
for that bus company owner

565
00:47:48,745 --> 00:47:50,392
and additional materials.

566
00:47:50,482 --> 00:47:52,302
I’ll explain it to you on the way,
so let’s go.

567
00:47:53,802 --> 00:47:55,222
Okay.

568
00:48:07,463 --> 00:48:11,557
I won’t interview with a MSC reporter.

569
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,006
You’re just going to make a report
that’s favorable to Song Cha-ok.

570
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:18,482
No way. We’re reporters, after all.

571
00:48:18,689 --> 00:48:20,018
We will put out just the truth.

572
00:48:20,432 --> 00:48:23,320
That's what Song Cha-ok said six years ago

573
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:26,620
when she interviewed me.
I won’t be deceived ever again.

574
00:48:26,711 --> 00:48:27,781
Sir.

575
00:48:28,032 --> 00:48:30,042
My name is Choi In Ha, from MSC.

576
00:48:30,132 --> 00:48:33,038
I'm a Pinocchio. If I lie, I hiccup.

577
00:48:38,695 --> 00:48:40,345
The one from the commercial?

578
00:48:42,236 --> 00:48:44,532
What is this? Are they on this case too?

579
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:47,008
I will deliver the truth just as it is.

580
00:48:47,272 --> 00:48:48,756
If it’s true that she falsely reported,

581
00:48:48,846 --> 00:48:51,431
I’ll make sure that you get an apology
from reporter Song.

582
00:48:54,879 --> 00:48:55,958
She’s really trying hard.

583
00:48:56,436 --> 00:48:59,002
See? She's not hiccuping
because it’s the truth.

584
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:03,881
I won’t add or take away anything,
and deliver it just as it is.

585
00:49:04,911 --> 00:49:07,177
Fine. Let’s do the interview.

586
00:49:09,751 --> 00:49:12,064
Please include us too.
We’re reporters from YGN.

587
00:49:33,386 --> 00:49:35,413
-What are you doing?
-Stay out of this.

588
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:39,005
I can't, I'm just a rookie.
My captain ordered me to do it.

589
00:49:39,096 --> 00:49:40,376
Stay out of it anyway.

590
00:49:40,466 --> 00:49:42,533
Come up with whatever excuse you can,
and  just stay out of it.

591
00:49:43,338 --> 00:49:45,689
I’m going to bring her down
no matter what with this opportunity,

592
00:49:45,779 --> 00:49:48,871
I’m going to reveal every detail
of everything that she did wrong.

593
00:49:48,961 --> 00:49:50,697
And show it to the entire world.

594
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,411
I’m going to show everyone
that she’s not qualified to be a reporter.

595
00:49:52,501 --> 00:49:55,381
-But why do I have to stay out of it?
-Because I’m worried about you.

596
00:49:58,551 --> 00:50:00,861
I want to fight with her properly
while only thinking about my brother.

597
00:50:00,951 --> 00:50:04,131
But if I keep seeing you,
I will get confused and I’ll hesitate.

598
00:50:04,221 --> 00:50:06,904
-So please stay out of it.
-Don’t worry about me.

599
00:50:08,019 --> 00:50:09,761
Fight with her properly.
Don’t hesitate either.

600
00:50:09,851 --> 00:50:11,300
I’m the same as you.

601
00:50:12,571 --> 00:50:14,670
I also think that my mom is not qualified
to be a reporter.

602
00:50:15,151 --> 00:50:17,699
Just like you said,
I’m show it to everyone.

603
00:50:18,611 --> 00:50:21,591
I know how hard it is for you.
You are not okay.

604
00:50:21,681 --> 00:50:25,541
You’re going to cry every night
and miss your grandfather every moment.

605
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:28,121
But you will pretend that you’re okay
because of your brother.

606
00:50:28,211 --> 00:50:29,931
Even though I know better than anyone
that you’re not fine,

607
00:50:30,021 --> 00:50:32,582
I’m not going to worry about you
or comfort you.

608
00:50:37,091 --> 00:50:39,021
Because I'd hate to see you crumble down.

609
00:50:40,641 --> 00:50:43,998
So don’t worry about me
and just go down your path.

610
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:02,760
Ms Song,

611
00:51:03,821 --> 00:51:08,375
I met with that bus driver’s brother
and he confirmed what the owner has said.

612
00:51:10,231 --> 00:51:12,711
Then why did he lie to me six years ago?

613
00:51:12,801 --> 00:51:15,241
At that time, he was so heartbroken
over his brother's death

614
00:51:15,331 --> 00:51:18,191
and was resentful towards the owner,
that's why he lied.

615
00:51:18,561 --> 00:51:19,977
Alright, you can go.

616
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:25,006
What about Choi In-ha and Seo Bum-Jo?

617
00:51:25,681 --> 00:51:27,462
Right now they’re interviewing
the bus company owner.

618
00:51:28,401 --> 00:51:32,990
And YGN assigned
Ki Ha-myung to the case as well.

619
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,071
What?

620
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,858
You’re alright, aren’t you?

621
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:47,804
What?

622
00:51:47,894 --> 00:51:51,864
Well, I’m not sure how to comfort you

623
00:51:51,954 --> 00:51:54,179
because I’m so shocked about
your parents and your brother.

624
00:51:55,254 --> 00:51:56,494
But anyway...

625
00:51:56,879 --> 00:51:58,318
I’m completely on your side this time.

626
00:51:58,674 --> 00:52:00,084
I just wanted you to know.

627
00:52:01,294 --> 00:52:04,217
-Thanks.
-If you need any help, just tell me.

628
00:52:04,614 --> 00:52:06,693
My mother is a second generation
stockholder of MSC.

629
00:52:08,294 --> 00:52:09,288
What does that mean?

630
00:52:10,254 --> 00:52:11,474
Well...

631
00:52:11,564 --> 00:52:13,854
if you’re really having a hard time,
just tell me.

632
00:52:13,944 --> 00:52:16,516
I’ll speak to my mother about Ms Song.

633
00:52:20,384 --> 00:52:21,941
Was I out of line?

634
00:52:23,939 --> 00:52:25,886
-Did I show off too much?
-Yeah.

635
00:52:33,184 --> 00:52:35,974
Hey, I hate doing things like this too.

636
00:52:36,064 --> 00:52:39,394
But I’m just saying
that I really am on your side.

637
00:52:39,484 --> 00:52:41,454
Why would I be doing this
if I’m not on your side?

638
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,372
Doesn’t this feel like
we’re having a press conference?

639
00:52:50,614 --> 00:52:51,841
I’m Ki Ha-myung from YGN.

640
00:52:52,364 --> 00:52:54,983
How did you find out that
the bus driver didn’t commit suicide?

641
00:52:56,414 --> 00:53:01,265
I went out drinking
with the brother of that driver recently

642
00:53:01,356 --> 00:53:04,910
and he confessed to me
that he had lied at that time.

643
00:53:07,366 --> 00:53:09,649
When I saw the death certificate,

644
00:53:09,739 --> 00:53:13,249
it says that he died
of coronary artery disease.

645
00:53:16,809 --> 00:53:18,623
My whole world just collapsed.

646
00:53:19,509 --> 00:53:23,089
Didn’t Song Cha-ok verify the certificate
when she interviewed you?

647
00:53:23,609 --> 00:53:24,681
No she didn’t.

648
00:53:25,543 --> 00:53:29,139
If she had just verified this,
none of this would’ve happened.

649
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:30,885
I’m Seo Bum-Jo from MSC.

650
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:33,561
What other evidence do you have
other than the death certificate?

651
00:53:33,814 --> 00:53:37,491
This is the contact information of
Mr Cha’s brother.

652
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:43,868
These are the contact information
of his colleagues from that time.

653
00:53:43,959 --> 00:53:45,629
Call them all.

654
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:48,769
They’ll testify how unfair this was to me.

655
00:53:52,909 --> 00:53:54,860
Should we divide these up and verify them?

656
00:53:55,069 --> 00:53:57,719
I think someone sympathetic
should go see his family.

657
00:53:57,809 --> 00:53:59,263
So a person who has an active right brain.

658
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,419
A rational person
for the death certificate.

659
00:54:01,509 --> 00:54:05,409
-So a person with a developed left brain.
-I’ll verify the death certificate.

660
00:54:05,499 --> 00:54:07,204
I’ll meet with his colleagues.

661
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:12,099
-There are more than 10.
-Okay.

662
00:54:12,189 --> 00:54:15,847
Then I’ll go see his family.
Dal-Po, I mean Ha-myung, what about you?

663
00:54:16,897 --> 00:54:18,569
I’ll meet with Song Cha-ok.

664
00:54:20,452 --> 00:54:23,547
I’ll see if she properly covered the story
and what kind of problem there was.

665
00:54:23,638 --> 00:54:26,368
Okay, then let’s meet up
in the press room at 6 PM.

666
00:54:30,698 --> 00:54:33,569
If you’re going to need our company’s ID
if you’re going to see Ms Song.

667
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:34,561
Take this.

668
00:54:37,659 --> 00:54:39,019
Thanks.

669
00:54:39,629 --> 00:54:42,620
You see?
I’m really completely on your side.

670
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:51,289
Newsroom

671
00:55:01,479 --> 00:55:04,108
Excuse me, where is Ms Song?

672
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:07,419
-I think she went to the cafeteria.
-Thank you.

673
00:55:10,109 --> 00:55:11,699
Who is that?

674
00:55:11,789 --> 00:55:13,259
He looks familiar.

675
00:55:33,459 --> 00:55:37,178
It looks like this cafeteria
is better than our TV station.

676
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:42,561
What brings you here?

677
00:55:44,346 --> 00:55:45,620
You must be having a hard time.

678
00:55:46,449 --> 00:55:48,910
This situation where
you’re getting swayed by nonsense rumors.

679
00:55:49,549 --> 00:55:52,467
I know this well
because I experienced it 13 years ago.

680
00:55:59,069 --> 00:56:02,934
But you’re luckier than I am,
it’s easier to prove your innocence.

681
00:56:03,657 --> 00:56:06,999
You just have to sue
that bus company owner for defamation.

682
00:56:07,089 --> 00:56:11,239
Then the police will investigate
and they’ll find out who is lying.

683
00:56:11,329 --> 00:56:13,129
It’s not even worth suing.

684
00:56:13,219 --> 00:56:16,015
It isn’t that it’s not worth it,
but that you’re not confident?

685
00:56:16,105 --> 00:56:18,935
I mean there’s no need
to respond to every rumor.

686
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:22,140
Can you prove that it’s a rumor?

687
00:56:24,137 --> 00:56:25,645
That they're just rumors?

688
00:56:30,565 --> 00:56:33,921
-It’s all a rumor.
-Can you prove that it’s a rumor?

689
00:56:43,177 --> 00:56:44,481
Yes,

690
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:46,865
I can prove it.

691
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:49,701
On what basis did you conclude
that it was a suicide?

692
00:56:49,791 --> 00:56:52,663
-There were circumstances.
-Did you verify the death certificate?

693
00:56:52,753 --> 00:56:56,110
-I had the family’s statement.
-Did you verify the death certificate?

694
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,090
-I verified the will also.
-I asked if you verified the certificate.

695
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:00,533
There was no need to verify it!

696
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:04,100
Even without it, I had a lot of evidence
that it was a suicide!

697
00:57:08,182 --> 00:57:10,288
Thank you for your answer.

698
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:39,762
Chairman: Please resign for now.

699
00:58:39,072 --> 00:58:42,082
It just slipped when I was
comfortably talking with my brother.

700
00:58:42,172 --> 00:58:44,412
-I'm sorry.
-Even if that’s true,

701
00:58:44,502 --> 00:58:46,452
it was unpleasant to hear
that you said I was clumsy and slow.

702
00:58:46,542 --> 00:58:49,009
Just how am I clumsy and slow?

703
00:58:53,442 --> 00:58:54,305
What?

704
00:58:55,542 --> 00:58:58,921
-I brought the wrong case file.
-Mr Attorney.

705
00:59:00,442 --> 00:59:03,778
Don’t worry.
I memorized all of your record.

706
00:59:04,672 --> 00:59:08,994
And just as you requested,
I delivered the Gonzales to your brother.

707
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,211
Can you...

708
00:59:14,643 --> 00:59:16,577
honestly call yourself a reporter?
