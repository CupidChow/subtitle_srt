1
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:11,947
Pinocchio

2
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,360
Are you going into the interrogation?

3
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:53,388
When you're done, I'll come
looking for you with questions.

4
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:02,392
I don't know what a reporter is.

5
00:01:02,877 --> 00:01:06,310
Once I know what a reporter is,
I'll come and find you.

6
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:08,776
Not as a street mutt, but as a wolf.

7
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:12,216
Then, I'll bark at you for real.

8
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:14,941
Ki Ha-myung.

9
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:25,076
Now, have you figured out
what a reporter is?

10
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,577
Yes, I think I've figured out
the hard parts.

11
00:01:34,112 --> 00:01:35,242
Good.

12
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:37,492
Then come...

13
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:40,654
and bark at me for real.

14
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,035
When you do, I'll answer all
your questions.

15
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:54,647
Yes, I will.

16
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:07,621
Episode 19 -
The Sun, the Wind, and the Wanderer

17
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,261
MSC reporter Song Cha-ok who was sued

18
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:13,171
for defamation of character
by the police officer

19
00:02:13,262 --> 00:02:15,353
at Ilsan, has reported to the police.

20
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:19,108
Ms Song stated that this report
was instigated

21
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,808
by the station executives to mislead
the public opinion.

22
00:02:21,928 --> 00:02:25,428
She exposed that such orders have been
given since 10 years ago.

23
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:26,963
It is expected to create a ripple.

24
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:29,432
Reporter Ki Ha-myung will be reporting.

25
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:32,958
Reporter Song Cha-ok who was sued for
defamation of character

26
00:02:33,058 --> 00:02:36,323
by Officer Ahn of Seoul Han River police
was examined for three hours today.

27
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,450
Reporter Song appeared today
because Officer Ahn, who investigated

28
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,138
the waste-disposal plant...

29
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:47,194
Hey. That situation right now is happening
because of your lawsuit, right?

30
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,006
Yes.

31
00:02:49,748 --> 00:02:52,087
Wow, Ahn Chan-soo.

32
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:54,141
You're an amazing guy, aren't you?

33
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:59,955
I want to sincerely apologize to Mr Ahn

34
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,903
who suffered because of
my overreaching suspicion.

35
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:04,722
Are you admitting that you gave
a false report intentionally?

36
00:03:04,822 --> 00:03:06,492
Yes. I admit it.

37
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:11,099
I disclosed everything sincerely
at the examination.

38
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:15,542
However, Reporter Song stated that
this report was a media manipulation

39
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:18,582
to evade the cause of the accident
and the punishment of the guilty.

40
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:22,166
She revealed that she was following
the orders from the station's executives.

41
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,042
She also revealed that it was difficult
to refuse the orders of major shareholder

42
00:03:26,142 --> 00:03:30,868
Chairwoman Park Rosa and the station
executives for over 10 years.

43
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:34,797
Every time the executives demanded
a manipulation,

44
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:36,755
I complied even though I was ashamed.

45
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,203
Since when did you receive those orders?

46
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:44,131
I received them since the incident
of Fireman Ki Ho-sang 14 years ago.

47
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:46,549
Tell us more about the executives
that you mentioned.

48
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:48,457
Is Chief Song in her right mind?

49
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:51,931
How could she destroy herself like that
unless she's crazy?

50
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:55,497
Hey, that's not self destruction
but declaration of conscience.

51
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:59,411
Ms Song is finally acting
like a real reporter.

52
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,211
Gong-joo.

53
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:06,764
What's with YGN?
Aren't they declaring war on us?

54
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:08,841
Does that look like a declaration of war?

55
00:04:09,484 --> 00:04:12,476
It's an advice. It's an advice for us
to come to our senses.

56
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,803
It's really embarrassing to be called
a MSC reporter.

57
00:04:24,024 --> 00:04:27,404
In the case of Michungri
waste-disposal plant fire 14 years ago,

58
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:30,024
Ms Song manipulated the story
to put Fireman Ki Ho-sang

59
00:04:30,114 --> 00:04:32,332
in a negative light
to protect a Junior Assemblyman

60
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:34,582
who exerted pressure
to overlook illegal disposal

61
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:37,070
under the order of her executives.

62
00:04:37,636 --> 00:04:39,194
Regarding the identity of the executives,

63
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:41,884
Ms Song pointed out the MSC major
stockholder Chairwoman Park Rosa

64
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:44,134
and others in charge of news department.

65
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:46,363
She submitted the text messages

66
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,281
she exchanged with them
since 2000 as evidence.

67
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:52,732
On the other hand,

68
00:04:52,823 --> 00:04:56,113
Chairwoman Park Rosa is denying
the text messages from 14 years ago.

69
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,558
Did you ever exchange text messages
with Chief Song Cha-ok from MSC?

70
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:03,197
I can't remember
since it was from a long time ago.

71
00:05:03,297 --> 00:05:05,512
I didn't say that it was
from a long time ago.

72
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:09,252
You said you can't remember but you do
remember it was from a long time ago.

73
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:10,802
Get rid of him.

74
00:05:14,152 --> 00:05:15,312
Darn it.

75
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:21,186
The police believe that subpoenaing
the Chairwoman who is suspected

76
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:23,956
of ordering the defamation of
Officer Ahn is inevitable.

77
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:27,705
This situation is expected to spread
the financial and political world.

78
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:30,027
This is Ki Ha-myung from YGN news.

79
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:34,254
Mom. You're alright, aren't you?

80
00:05:35,232 --> 00:05:37,529
No. I'm not alright.

81
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,953
Tell your friend Ki Ha-myung clearly.

82
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:47,121
Tell him to use the most powerful parts
in the beginning from now on.

83
00:05:47,332 --> 00:05:49,538
The report isn't interesting or attractive

84
00:05:49,638 --> 00:05:51,327
because he's foolishly using
standard tactics.

85
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:52,943
He should've put the interview

86
00:05:53,034 --> 00:05:55,503
of Chairwoman Park in the very beginning
for impact.

87
00:05:56,808 --> 00:05:57,788
Excuse me?

88
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:06,026
From now on is the important part.

89
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:09,788
Now Chairwoman Park will probably gather

90
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:12,075
her legal team and formulate
a plan to evade it.

91
00:06:12,175 --> 00:06:16,364
Tell YGN to keep their eyes open
and watch her carefully.

92
00:06:18,422 --> 00:06:19,689
What kind of a plan?

93
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:23,605
First, they will try to find a way to
avoid having her report to the police.

94
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:25,376
Captain.

95
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,221
First, we have to avoid having you
report to the police.

96
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,183
Subpoena : Ms Park Rosa

97
00:06:37,274 --> 00:06:40,356
I will submit papers that you're on
a business trip to Japan.

98
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,762
The Chief of Police was under me
when I was a prosecutor,

99
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,710
so the talks will go easily.

100
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:49,330
My legal team leader.

101
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,132
You've always made
my difficult moments into opportunities.

102
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,112
Please take care of it this time.

103
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:55,479
Please don't worry.

104
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:57,869
If you go somewhere and rest quietly
for a few days,

105
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,525
it should all be settled.

106
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:02,189
Then I'll trust you and go.

107
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,169
Secretary Ko, I'll be...

108
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:10,459
Yes. Assemblyman Yoon.

109
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:13,169
You saw the news?

110
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,774
I know. Reporter Song must've been
disappointed with the reward this time.

111
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:19,203
Yes. You don't have to worry about it.

112
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,580
You can come to the grand opening
ceremony, right?

113
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,790
Yes. I'll see you then.

114
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,656
I will be at Cheongjeongri villa for
a while so make the arrangements.

115
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:29,389
Yes.

116
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:34,326
According to my captain, Ms Park
will postpone the reporting

117
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:36,242
with an overseas business trip
as an excuse.

118
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:37,267
An excuse?

119
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:40,205
- Then she will go into hiding?
- Yeah.

120
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:43,206
My mom says, if she does that,

121
00:07:43,306 --> 00:07:46,728
there's a big possibility that she
will be staying at Cheongjeongri villa.

122
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:51,799
Cheongjeongri villa?

123
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,610
Yes. When she was subpoenaed last year
on accounting fraud,

124
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:56,946
she said she was on a business trip
to the US but stayed there.

125
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:58,067
Is it certain?

126
00:07:58,256 --> 00:07:59,253
Where did you get this?

127
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:02,567
Reporter Song Cha-ok informed me
through Reporter Choi In-ha.

128
00:08:05,332 --> 00:08:06,667
Chief Song informed you?

129
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,140
Yes.

130
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:11,403
Ms Song...

131
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:15,678
It seems she made up her mind to make
Chairwoman stand for the police mug shot.

132
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:17,749
Cha Woo-chul.

133
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,565
You'll need to go to Cheongjeongri.

134
00:08:21,254 --> 00:08:22,164
Yes.

135
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:29,901
Using overseas business trip as an excuse
not to answer the police subpoena,

136
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,941
Bumjo Department Store
Chairwoman Park Rosa

137
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:35,964
was staying in the country,
as YGN has found out.

138
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:39,081
The police sent the subpoena
to Chairwoman Park

139
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:41,802
who did not appear using
the fake business trip as an excuse.

140
00:08:41,902 --> 00:08:44,890
The police plans to request for
an arrest warrant if she doesn't comply.

141
00:08:45,602 --> 00:08:47,665
This is Cha Woo-chul from YGN news.

142
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:51,432
If it wasn't for YGN news,
it wouldn't have gotten this complicated.

143
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,705
It looks like the commissioner
spoke to the Chief about it.

144
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:58,792
That's why this came again.

145
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:03,002
Just because of the mere one minute news
that this came again, right?

146
00:09:03,402 --> 00:09:06,137
The connection you had in the
prosecutor days are useless, aren't they?

147
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:13,670
Yes. Assemblyman Koo.

148
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:15,792
I know.

149
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:20,172
You would stress if I get subpoenaed
so I was in hiding,

150
00:09:20,272 --> 00:09:22,169
but it looks like I embarrassed myself.

151
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,182
Of course. Nothing is wrong.

152
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:28,910
I'll see you at
the grand opening ceremony.

153
00:09:29,872 --> 00:09:31,940
You heard, right?
You heard it all, right?

154
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:34,421
If report of me appearing
to the police goes on the news,

155
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,806
what do you think our Assemblymen
are going to think?

156
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:39,556
The Police Chief is truly sorry.

157
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:44,056
If you just make an appearance,
he promised to take care of it quietly.

158
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:48,206
First, it's scheduled on Sunday morning
when there won't be any reporters around.

159
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,076
If you go through
the underground parking,

160
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:54,480
you should be able to finish it
quietly and leave without anyone knowing.

161
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,349
Why is this getting so complicated?

162
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:03,422
Maybe I'm getting bad vibes?

163
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:06,951
Even if she does come,

164
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,408
she'll come when there aren't
any reporters like on a holiday or Sunday.

165
00:10:09,498 --> 00:10:11,474
And at dawn or morning hours.

166
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,902
Then, we'll just have to stake out
at the front gate.

167
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,803
These bigwigs will never go through
the front door.

168
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:20,053
Do they have any reason
to advertise their appearance?

169
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,147
They'll go through the underground parking
for sure.

170
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,577
So...

171
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:26,686
5:03 AM

172
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:30,977
If you stake out, you have to do it there.

173
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:51,996
Okay.

174
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:53,657
She's here.

175
00:11:03,257 --> 00:11:05,887
Is it true that you ordered to frame
an innocent police officer

176
00:11:05,987 --> 00:11:08,240
and manipulation to cover up
a politician's corruption?

177
00:11:08,497 --> 00:11:10,231
What happened? You said
there won't be any reporters.

178
00:11:11,097 --> 00:11:13,280
- No interviews. Don't film it.
- Please move.

179
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,611
Just one question please.

180
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:19,801
Do you admit using fireman Ki Ho-sang
for the same reason 14 years ago?

181
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:21,510
- Stop filming.
- Please move.

182
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,530
- Please stop filming.
- Give us a statement.

183
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,533
The assemblymen that you took care of

184
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:28,091
must be watching this scene nervously.

185
00:11:28,191 --> 00:11:30,074
Do you have anything to say to them?

186
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:31,697
Shut up!

187
00:11:33,536 --> 00:11:34,309
Ma'am.

188
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:40,853
Are you denying it?

189
00:11:43,374 --> 00:11:45,177
Please let go of the door. Quickly.

190
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:00,961
About now, Chairwoman Park will try

191
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:03,241
to shift the attention
to another direction.

192
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:05,893
-She's going to use another issue?
-Yeah.

193
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:07,702
She'll try to cover it
with more powerful issue.

194
00:12:07,802 --> 00:12:10,262
For example, with celebrity news.

195
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:16,702
Since when did the people start
watching the news so much?

196
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:18,438
Did you see the search word?

197
00:12:18,925 --> 00:12:20,331
If you type my name Park Rosa,

198
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:22,545
underground parking comes up
as a related search word.

199
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:26,145
How about shifting their focus
in another direction for now?

200
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:31,175
It's a bit difficult to do anything
because there are too many eyes watching.

201
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:33,521
So what? So what can you do?

202
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:35,611
How about a habitual propofol use?

203
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:39,587
Propofol?

204
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:41,655
That's good.

205
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:43,111
Who?

206
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,691
FAMA who modeled for us last year.

207
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,486
Recently there was a rumor that
he was taking propofol habitually.

208
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:52,631
- PR team must have evidence.
- That's good.

209
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:56,273
He released a new album recently
and got a main role in a show,

210
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:57,962
so he'll become a good issue.

211
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:06,367
The police discovered that FAMA,
the famous star, took propofol habitually.

212
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,854
They revealed that
they will subpoena FAMA tomorrow.

213
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:14,663
Along with the medical record from
a hospital in the Han River District

214
00:13:14,763 --> 00:13:16,773
and through the testimony
of a hospital staff,

215
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:19,751
they confirmed that FAMA was administered

216
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:22,279
over 10 doses of propofol
over the past 2 months.

217
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,347
No.

218
00:13:26,218 --> 00:13:27,429
That can't be true.

219
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,635
That's a complete lie!

220
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,920
Hey. You scared me.

221
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:46,773
FAMA, we believe in you
FAMA, we'll protect you

222
00:13:58,623 --> 00:13:59,810
Please tell us one thing.

223
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,910
Is it true?

224
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,020
Please tell us one thing.

225
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:24,128
I sincerely apologize for being here
as a public figure.

226
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:27,082
Do you admit that
you took propofol habitually?

227
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:29,020
I didn't take it habitually.

228
00:14:29,638 --> 00:14:31,054
It was a legitimate medical procedure.

229
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:33,138
I believe you.

230
00:14:36,904 --> 00:14:39,345
Hey, Yoon Yoo-Rae. Are you crazy?

231
00:14:40,437 --> 00:14:41,803
Please tell us one thing
before you go in.

232
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:44,298
I will reveal everything
during the police examination

233
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:45,829
and prove my innocence.

234
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,470
- Are you pleading your innocence?
- Are you denying the charge?

235
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:51,781
- When did you start taking it?
- Can you clarify it?

236
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:05,335
I know that you're not someone
who would do that.

237
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:09,474
I'll reveal it all. Just trust me.

238
00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:11,082
She's lost it.

239
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:16,812
I will protect you.

240
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:32,303
The police revealed that FAMA was cleared

241
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:34,352
of the suspicion of habitual use
of propofol.

242
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:36,958
I revealed everything
during the police examination.

243
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:39,212
I will be even better in the future.

244
00:15:39,312 --> 00:15:41,652
FAMA was struggling with
the production of new album,

245
00:15:41,752 --> 00:15:44,082
shooting a new show
and overexerting himself

246
00:15:44,182 --> 00:15:48,102
and suffered gastro enteric trouble and
was administered propofol for treatment.

247
00:15:48,202 --> 00:15:49,877
As you can see, once during endoscopy,

248
00:15:49,977 --> 00:15:52,571
once during colonoscopy
and twice during gastro spasm.

249
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:55,001
He was administered total
of four times during two months.

250
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:56,576
There wasn't any before or after.

251
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,479
FAMA who was cleared of taking propofol

252
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:04,070
stated that he will be even more
devoted to his music career in the future.

253
00:16:04,469 --> 00:16:06,467
This is Yoon Yoo-Rae from YGN news.

254
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:15,085
These kinds of issue should last
few more days,

255
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:17,326
but the YGN's report was so fast

256
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,276
that it was inadequate to cover it up.

257
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,261
I'm sure it was.

258
00:16:29,352 --> 00:16:32,513
You work so hard and
have a lot of connections.

259
00:16:32,622 --> 00:16:35,382
The reporters at the parking lot
was just a coincidence

260
00:16:35,473 --> 00:16:36,893
and the rumor was probably wrong.

261
00:16:36,984 --> 00:16:40,924
Since you are both so competent!

262
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:51,425
Yes, Assemblyman Joo.

263
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:54,954
Don't mention it.

264
00:16:56,502 --> 00:16:57,340
Of course.

265
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,731
I know it's a sensitive time.

266
00:17:02,591 --> 00:17:06,253
You don't have to worry.
Just think of as a passing wind.

267
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:11,033
You remember the date of
the grand opening ceremony, right?

268
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:14,176
Of course we'll stay on schedule.

269
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,981
Then...

270
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,439
Yes. I'll see you then.

271
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,369
So tell me. What should I try this time?

272
00:17:26,932 --> 00:17:28,013
Ma'am.

273
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:31,225
Defamation of character falls through
more than half of the time.

274
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,917
If the victim doesn't want you
to be punished, you can't be punished.

275
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:37,603
So...

276
00:17:38,714 --> 00:17:41,752
are you saying that I should go see
Officer Ahn and beg?

277
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,476
Rather than begging,

278
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:45,761
won't it be better to resolve
the misunderstanding quickly?

279
00:17:46,574 --> 00:17:48,140
Before the matter gets any bigger,

280
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,500
it'd be better to reach
an agreement with Officer Ahn

281
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,471
and quietly settle it.

282
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:54,970
If it turns out like this,

283
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:58,064
Chairwoman Park will change
the direction to appease Officer Ahn.

284
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,040
Appease him?

285
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,649
Defamation of character fails
more than half of the time.

286
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,960
That's right.

287
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:09,455
If Officer Ahn reaches an agreement,
Chairwoman Park won't be punished.

288
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:13,607
Then this case will just end like this.

289
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:19,525
Her side will probably try to convince
Officer Ahn with favorable conditions.

290
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:23,375
If he falls for that appeasement,
everything will go up in the air.

291
00:18:23,884 --> 00:18:25,218
What do you think?

292
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:28,230
Is he a person who will fall for
something like that?

293
00:18:28,818 --> 00:18:29,691
No.

294
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:36,463
I don't know.

295
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:38,807
He has three kids.

296
00:18:44,387 --> 00:18:45,877
Hey.

297
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:49,679
Even if I have three kids,
I'm a proud Police officer of Korea.

298
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:52,096
I will never fall for an appeasement.
I won't settle.

299
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:55,036
I knew that you'd be like this.
I believed in you.

300
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:02,946
I was a little bit doubtful.
Just a little bit.

301
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,173
Fine. I was really doubtful.

302
00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:10,818
I'm sorry.

303
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:14,961
You were worried that Chan-soo
will fall for it. Right?

304
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:16,264
No. Not at all.

305
00:19:16,874 --> 00:19:17,583
Hey!

306
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:20,468
Don't worry.

307
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,116
I started this fight because of you,
Ha-myung.

308
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:26,597
I started this because I was sorry for
spreading that rumor in high school

309
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:28,800
and because you saved me
despite all that.

310
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:32,006
I started this because you told me to
and I'll stop when you tell me to stop.

311
00:19:34,557 --> 00:19:36,300
I know what this fight means to you.

312
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,833
I'm going to stake my conscience
and hold out to the end.

313
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:43,408
Thanks, Chan-soo.

314
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:48,617
If you're that thankful, bring a gift to
my housewarming party this weekend.

315
00:19:49,162 --> 00:19:50,247
A housewarming party?

316
00:19:50,463 --> 00:19:52,348
I thought it's been three years
since you moved.

317
00:19:52,448 --> 00:19:53,848
So why are you having
a housewarming party?

318
00:19:54,378 --> 00:19:57,380
It's been three years but it hasn't been
that long since I met you guys again.

319
00:19:59,258 --> 00:20:01,964
Come with light hearts
but heavy hands okay?

320
00:20:02,064 --> 00:20:05,186
It wasn't enough that you had
a first birthday party for your third kid?

321
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,346
You really don't have any conscience.

322
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,205
You try having three
kids and raising them.

323
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:10,532
Things like conscience are a luxury.

324
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,992
Hey.

325
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:17,066
You said you're putting
your conscience on the line?

326
00:20:18,954 --> 00:20:22,882
That conscience and this conscience are
managed separately so don't worry.

327
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:37,309
I'm back.

328
00:20:42,262 --> 00:20:44,972
You're just coming home?
Wash up quickly and let's eat.

329
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,821
Why are you coming out of that room,
grandpa?

330
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:51,078
I went to your brother's house
and brought back some clothes.

331
00:20:51,472 --> 00:20:55,160
I put them in the dresser so wear them.

332
00:20:57,266 --> 00:21:01,657
Even if we're home, I couldn't stand
watching you wearing my short clothes.

333
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,072
I could've gotten them myself.

334
00:21:04,172 --> 00:21:06,622
How nice would it be if you could
fit into anyone's clothes?

335
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:08,828
Your limbs are uselessly long.

336
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:09,882
He's right.

337
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:13,250
You are longer than you need to be.

338
00:21:27,262 --> 00:21:29,834
By the way, will Chan-soo be alright?

339
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,678
Why? Are you nervous?

340
00:21:31,852 --> 00:21:35,222
No but Chairwoman Park is going to
suggest something enormous.

341
00:21:35,332 --> 00:21:38,242
If Chan-soo agrees to settle,
everything will end right here.

342
00:21:39,302 --> 00:21:41,828
Don't worry. Chan-soo isn't someone
who would fall for that.

343
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:45,107
And Nitpicker is supposed to be there
tomorrow so you don't need to worry.

344
00:21:46,093 --> 00:21:48,142
Then it's a relief. Then wash up.

345
00:21:48,262 --> 00:21:48,867
Yeah.

346
00:21:58,676 --> 00:22:00,573
That's right.
Call me when you need to shave.

347
00:22:02,802 --> 00:22:04,191
Hey, your right arm.

348
00:22:07,812 --> 00:22:10,073
What is this? Are you fine now?

349
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:15,481
What is this?

350
00:22:15,681 --> 00:22:17,794
Why were you pretending your arm
hurt when it was healed?

351
00:22:18,391 --> 00:22:22,101
I wasn't pretending.
It's not completely well yet.

352
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:24,405
Why?

353
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:27,304
Were you worried that we'd tell
you to go home if you're better?

354
00:22:27,991 --> 00:22:29,599
No. It's...

355
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:32,202
You like this house, don't you?

356
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:36,141
You don't have to eat
those flimsy fried eggs here

357
00:22:36,241 --> 00:22:38,625
and you can see grandpa
and my father everyday.

358
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,314
And you can see me everyday too, right?

359
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:45,555
Can't you just move back in?

360
00:22:46,171 --> 00:22:48,788
Are you still worried
about your brother a lot?

361
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:51,371
No.

362
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:55,237
Then move back in.

363
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:59,266
I've been worried
about that ridiculous breakfast.

364
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:03,401
- Come out and eat.
- Yes.

365
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:04,661
Hurry up and come out.

366
00:23:05,871 --> 00:23:06,976
Throw this away.

367
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:32,811
- What is this?
- What in the world...

368
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,848
The Chairwoman would like
to resolve the misunderstanding.

369
00:23:36,141 --> 00:23:37,139
Take them back.

370
00:23:37,997 --> 00:23:40,231
If it's a misunderstanding,
doesn't it mean that she won't admit it?

371
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:43,077
First...

372
00:23:44,421 --> 00:23:46,662
...you should resolve
the misunderstanding.

373
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:49,938
Look here.

374
00:23:54,705 --> 00:23:56,851
- How much is this?
- How much is it?

375
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:58,285
How much is it?

376
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:11,603
- Aren't they Chairman Park's people?
- I think you're right.

377
00:24:11,703 --> 00:24:13,143
Hey!

378
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,293
Are you here to have him agree
to a settlement?

379
00:24:15,393 --> 00:24:16,803
What is all this?

380
00:24:16,903 --> 00:24:18,873
What is that envelope?

381
00:24:26,443 --> 00:24:28,833
What I need isn't an envelope
full of money or settlement.

382
00:24:29,673 --> 00:24:33,107
I'm a proud police officer of Korea.
Tell Chairwoman Park clearly.

383
00:24:33,198 --> 00:24:35,620
I, Ahn Chan-soo,
don't need things like these.

384
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:38,264
Please tell us one thing.

385
00:24:48,427 --> 00:24:50,217
He said that he doesn't need anything.

386
00:24:50,308 --> 00:24:53,464
So he'd like you to admit to the charge
and come to apologize personally.

387
00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:56,397
- That's what he said.
- And?

388
00:24:56,603 --> 00:24:57,526
That was...

389
00:24:59,174 --> 00:25:00,123
That was all.

390
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:03,582
Is that all?

391
00:25:03,977 --> 00:25:06,583
Then I just have to go and apologize?

392
00:25:06,683 --> 00:25:10,293
I should've gone myself.
I've committed a grave sin.

393
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:13,005
What do I have to do?
Do I just have to kneel and beg?

394
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:14,570
Should I beg like this?

395
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,054
- Ma'am.
- What?

396
00:25:16,145 --> 00:25:17,954
I don't think there is any other way.

397
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:20,740
You must cooperate with
the investigation at this point

398
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,661
and look for a different way out.

399
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,223
Team Leader. Secretary Ko.

400
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:27,193
Am I not giving you enough money?

401
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:28,164
Am I?

402
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:32,411
Tell me if you need more money,
instead of doing things like this.

403
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:36,051
Ma'am. Just bend down for a bit
and plan out future affairs.

404
00:25:36,151 --> 00:25:38,351
Bend down? To whom?

405
00:25:38,681 --> 00:25:39,915
To that police officer?

406
00:25:40,884 --> 00:25:43,018
Then it would mean that
I'm admitting to defamation of character.

407
00:25:43,351 --> 00:25:45,212
And I'm admitting those connections.

408
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:47,864
They'll reveal all the assemblymen
to the world

409
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:50,422
and the prosecution will start
the internal investigation.

410
00:25:50,513 --> 00:25:52,550
Do you think this will end
with just bending down a little?

411
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:53,783
Really?

412
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:07,213
Now let's do it my way.

413
00:26:08,945 --> 00:26:11,481
- Excuse me?
- The rougher you are to them...

414
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:16,254
the nicer they are to you.

415
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,627
Let's take the easy way now.

416
00:26:20,075 --> 00:26:22,331
We've done enough to humor them
and pacify them.

417
00:26:23,438 --> 00:26:24,637
Let's look for another way.

418
00:26:26,141 --> 00:26:27,461
You know what I mean, don't you?

419
00:26:28,097 --> 00:26:28,989
Mother...

420
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:33,035
Please...

421
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:38,569
Please stop.

422
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:46,927
Notice

423
00:26:47,027 --> 00:26:49,403
HR meeting to set punishment
for Chief Song

424
00:26:49,494 --> 00:26:51,835
I guess they want to see her to the end.

425
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:57,330
- Is this the end of Ms Song?
- Isn't that reasonable?

426
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:02,019
Because of her, people lost confidence
in MSC and our status has hit the ground.

427
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:06,600
She caused this huge act of destruction,
so it's fair that she's being punished.

428
00:27:07,901 --> 00:27:11,846
I'm so displeased with you.
You're really displeasing.

429
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:16,712
Hey, do we have to put our hands down
and just watch?

430
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:38,839
What?

431
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:40,971
No. It's nothing.

432
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:46,707
But it's the first time
I'm seeing you sleep at work, mom.

433
00:27:48,772 --> 00:27:50,387
I know. It's the first time.

434
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:54,450
You're not sick anywhere, are you?

435
00:27:55,248 --> 00:27:56,616
I'm sleepy.

436
00:27:57,569 --> 00:28:01,138
Because of insomnia, I haven't slept well
for the past 15 years.

437
00:28:02,195 --> 00:28:06,031
It seems like I'm catching up all at once.

438
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,396
I saw the notice about the HR meeting.

439
00:28:13,702 --> 00:28:15,233
Yeah, I saw it too.

440
00:28:16,502 --> 00:28:18,182
I'm not surprised.

441
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:20,172
It's rather late.

442
00:28:24,982 --> 00:28:27,658
I'm sleepy so please be quiet.

443
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,892
Okay.

444
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,372
I'm going to sleep just for five minutes
so stay there.

445
00:28:39,263 --> 00:28:40,784
The sun is too bright.

446
00:28:42,761 --> 00:28:43,741
Yes, mom.

447
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,042
There you are.

448
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:33,592
- Why? Were you looking for me?
- Yeah.

449
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:37,174
I heard it all.

450
00:29:37,947 --> 00:29:40,453
I heard that your mom is called
for an HR meeting.

451
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,599
You guys heard it too?

452
00:29:46,372 --> 00:29:47,316
Is it okay?

453
00:29:48,723 --> 00:29:50,177
She's seemed calmer than I thought.

454
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:51,761
She looked somewhat peaceful.

455
00:29:51,852 --> 00:29:54,269
No. I meant you.

456
00:29:54,379 --> 00:29:55,589
Me?

457
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:58,718
I'm fine compared to my mom.

458
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:03,125
Other than being marked by
the new captain, it's okay. It's bearable.

459
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:07,408
If I'm having hard time with this,
I'd feel sorry to my mom.

460
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,343
Pretending you're okay
because you feel sorry,

461
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:12,594
that's a foolish thing to do.

462
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:15,460
No. I'm really fine.

463
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:20,967
I guess I'm not.

464
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:23,897
See?

465
00:30:31,969 --> 00:30:34,279
I should've held you like this then.

466
00:30:36,177 --> 00:30:38,913
Even when you told me not to worry,
comfort you or do anything,

467
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:41,540
I should've held you anyway.

468
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:44,030
It's so comforting.

469
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:13,841
YGN

470
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,579
You remember
the housewarming party today right?

471
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,361
Light heart and heavy hands!

472
00:31:24,452 --> 00:31:25,883
Make sure to bring Reporter Yoon.

473
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,850
Yoon Yoo-Rae, you're coming to Chan-soo's
housewarming party, right?

474
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,500
Yeah. Why?

475
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,888
Let's get together with In-ha
and go together.

476
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,370
Why? Why do I have to go with you?

477
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,533
Why do I have to go with someone
who has a girlfriend?

478
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,403
Do you have some kind of grudge
against me these days?

479
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,830
Yeah.

480
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:48,947
You're becoming more unlikable recently.

481
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,160
Fine.

482
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,266
- Are you going by yourself?
- No. I'm not going by myself.

483
00:31:57,554 --> 00:31:59,930
Cha Woo-chul, wanna to go to
Officer Ahn's housewarming party?

484
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,936
I'm busy.

485
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:06,511
Captain. Do you want to go to
Officer Ahn's housewarming party?

486
00:32:06,602 --> 00:32:08,192
- Okay.
- Excuse me?

487
00:32:09,624 --> 00:32:10,656
What do you mean okay?

488
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:14,626
You asked me to go to
the housewarming party.

489
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:19,476
I'm going.

490
00:32:23,837 --> 00:32:25,803
Why is the captain like that?
Why is he going?

491
00:32:26,414 --> 00:32:28,134
He's going because you asked him to go.

492
00:32:29,185 --> 00:32:30,595
So why...

493
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,361
I want to ask you.

494
00:32:33,729 --> 00:32:35,433
Why did you invite the captain?

495
00:32:38,102 --> 00:32:39,805
I didn't know he was going to say yes.

496
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:54,683
What is this? Why did your captain come?

497
00:32:55,704 --> 00:32:57,925
I want to ask why he came also.

498
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,731
How much did Chairwoman Park's people
talk for settlement money?

499
00:33:08,502 --> 00:33:09,951
From what I saw in the envelope,

500
00:33:10,051 --> 00:33:11,983
it seemed enough to pay off rent

501
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:15,273
and send our kids
to a private kindergarten.

502
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:20,271
Thanks for rejecting that kind of
temptation and standing firm.

503
00:33:21,447 --> 00:33:26,393
Alright. But aren't your gifts too simple?

504
00:33:28,412 --> 00:33:30,431
Then again, there is someone
who didn't even bring a gift.

505
00:33:39,444 --> 00:33:41,157
After appeasement, it will be threats.

506
00:33:41,612 --> 00:33:43,743
Record all the calls
from Chairwoman Park's side

507
00:33:43,843 --> 00:33:47,803
and if you see a sign of threat,
give it to our reporters immediately.

508
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:50,841
- Do you understand?
- Yes. I understand.

509
00:33:53,203 --> 00:33:54,323
Stop at Japchae

510
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:56,336
and look for a good time
to take a plate of ribs out.

511
00:33:56,436 --> 00:33:57,456
Yeah.

512
00:34:00,954 --> 00:34:03,522
What is that?
I thought your captain was totally cool?

513
00:34:04,457 --> 00:34:08,566
I know. He's disappointing me
in many ways today.

514
00:34:31,749 --> 00:34:34,388
Joon-gi. Look here and smile.

515
00:34:41,376 --> 00:34:42,776
What do you think?
I'm so pretty, aren't I?

516
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,846
Wow. You look like
a completely different person, ma'am.

517
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:50,158
Hey. Who are you calling ma'am?

518
00:34:51,276 --> 00:34:54,946
Seeing it like this,
your family is really blessed.

519
00:34:55,446 --> 00:34:58,706
I know. How is this possible at our age?

520
00:34:59,694 --> 00:35:00,526
Pretty angle.

521
00:35:04,057 --> 00:35:06,646
It's possible for you too.
Look over here.

522
00:35:15,924 --> 00:35:19,108
Should I show you something shocking?
Ji-hee, turn on the remote.

523
00:35:22,646 --> 00:35:25,425
- What is it?
- Was this nine years ago?

524
00:35:25,516 --> 00:35:28,666
- This is when I went on the quiz contest.
- Hey, why are you turning that on?

525
00:35:28,805 --> 00:35:33,335
- Don't turn it off!
- Come on! Really?

526
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,155
Turn it off!

527
00:35:38,225 --> 00:35:40,325
I directed this.

528
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:44,075
- Wow, it's Choi Dal-Po!
- Come on...

529
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,775
Unpredictable match

530
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:52,065
It will begin now!

531
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:57,655
Turn it off, In-ha.

532
00:35:58,445 --> 00:36:01,725
- Wow, it's Choi Dal-Po!
- Just look at your hair!

533
00:36:01,825 --> 00:36:03,045
I don't have a brilliant mind.

534
00:36:03,155 --> 00:36:05,415
You only looked good because of
your hair, didn't you?

535
00:36:09,255 --> 00:36:13,285
- Fine, laugh all you want.
- Chan-soo. Send that to me

536
00:36:13,385 --> 00:36:16,615
- I want to see it when I'm depressed.
- Should I upload it to the web?

537
00:36:16,705 --> 00:36:18,135
I'm at the bottom of my school.

538
00:36:18,235 --> 00:36:21,755
I'll get all zeroes next year.
On all subjects.

539
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:26,375
Hey. We're out of alcohol, right?
I'll go get some more beer.

540
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:39,202
Seo Bum-Jo.

541
00:36:43,165 --> 00:36:43,993
Yeah.

542
00:36:44,965 --> 00:36:47,795
Why are you just leaving?
Didn't you come here to see Chan-soo?

543
00:36:48,848 --> 00:36:49,795
Yeah.

544
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:51,984
But I didn't know you guys were here.

545
00:36:52,954 --> 00:36:54,765
We're all here for his housewarming party.

546
00:36:55,398 --> 00:36:57,837
- Do you want me to call Chan-soo?
- No.

547
00:36:59,202 --> 00:37:02,205
I decided to come to ask him
to forgive my mother,

548
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:04,330
but there's really nothing I can do.

549
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:09,486
My mother isn't someone
who will back down.

550
00:37:10,657 --> 00:37:13,524
She can't be convinced and
she won't repent even more.

551
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:16,167
But that doesn't mean...

552
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:20,159
that I have enough courage
to report my family like you did.

553
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,978
I think I finally understand
why In-ha felt sorry to you.

554
00:37:28,237 --> 00:37:29,225
Don't do that.

555
00:37:30,412 --> 00:37:33,679
I don't have any intention
to urge you to report your mother.

556
00:37:35,396 --> 00:37:37,084
Because I know how difficult that is.

557
00:37:38,347 --> 00:37:42,544
And it's been a long time since I gave up
things like revenge and resentment.

558
00:37:44,926 --> 00:37:46,327
Are you saying that
to make me feel better?

559
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:49,623
It's not that.

560
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:56,405
Seo Bum-Jo.

561
00:37:57,084 --> 00:37:58,135
I like you.

562
00:37:58,999 --> 00:38:00,235
Hey!

563
00:38:00,818 --> 00:38:02,704
Why are you acting so gross?

564
00:38:03,652 --> 00:38:04,859
I like In-ha even more.

565
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,400
I like her so much that every minute
and every second

566
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,624
that we're together is so precious.

567
00:38:10,703 --> 00:38:12,429
Why are you confessing that to me?

568
00:38:13,103 --> 00:38:16,122
I let it go because
that time is so precious.

569
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:23,195
I just want to erase revenge,
resentment or whatever.

570
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:26,433
Now I just want to inform the world
properly as a reporter.

571
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,359
Good things are good
and bad things are bad.

572
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:33,361
There's nothing else I hope for
other than informing the world properly.

573
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:38,601
I'm sorry, Jae-myung.

574
00:38:39,713 --> 00:38:41,615
I said the word forgiveness too easily,
didn't I?

575
00:38:43,005 --> 00:38:44,194
It's not easy.

576
00:38:45,442 --> 00:38:46,628
It's amazing.

577
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,245
It's not amazing.

578
00:38:50,763 --> 00:38:53,953
When I was focused
on revenge and resentment,

579
00:38:54,063 --> 00:38:55,889
I couldn't see the things
I needed to see.

580
00:38:57,243 --> 00:38:59,286
I kept researching with an answer
already in mind.

581
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:01,884
I was covering the story
without seeing the other person's life.

582
00:39:03,777 --> 00:39:07,550
I got scared
because I kept making mistakes like that.

583
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:10,882
I was scared that I could become
like Reporter Song Cha-ok...

584
00:39:10,992 --> 00:39:12,987
Hey. You can't do that.

585
00:39:13,962 --> 00:39:15,488
I know that I can't.

586
00:39:16,022 --> 00:39:18,197
Whether it's forgiveness or whatever,
you just do what you want.

587
00:39:18,812 --> 00:39:21,094
You don't need to get my permission.

588
00:39:23,657 --> 00:39:25,104
I killed someone.

589
00:39:26,274 --> 00:39:32,041
So, what right would I have
to resent or forgive someone?

590
00:39:35,062 --> 00:39:35,641
Jae-myung.

591
00:39:38,062 --> 00:39:39,191
Don't lose that right...

592
00:39:40,806 --> 00:39:42,137
to the end.

593
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:55,633
Bum-Jo Department Store in Yeonjoo
which breaks ground today

594
00:39:56,052 --> 00:40:00,499
is a business that our Bum-Jo group
carefully planned for over 10 years.

595
00:40:00,752 --> 00:40:01,832
Largest in the country...

596
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:05,512
What did you gain
from granting those favors?

597
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:11,220
Everything you enjoyed until now
and everything you'll enjoy in the future.

598
00:40:13,046 --> 00:40:15,192
The effect of direct employment of 5000

599
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:19,352
and indirect employment
of 15,000 is to be expected...

600
00:40:20,482 --> 00:40:24,513
- What are you doing?
- My speech for the ceremony.

601
00:40:24,732 --> 00:40:27,505
If I read off the manuscript,
it doesn't look good.

602
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:37,338
Why didn't I know until now?

603
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,364
That you lived so hard like this?

604
00:40:43,222 --> 00:40:46,177
I didn't know that I was able
to enjoy everything thanks to that...

605
00:40:48,745 --> 00:40:49,808
I didn't know that.

606
00:40:56,042 --> 00:40:57,273
You don't have to know.

607
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,124
My son has to just enjoy everything
and live.

608
00:41:07,312 --> 00:41:08,538
I'm sorry...

609
00:41:10,114 --> 00:41:10,889
Mother.

610
00:41:17,593 --> 00:41:18,410
He's cute, right?

611
00:41:18,842 --> 00:41:22,142
Hey, he's the same age as you
but he has three kids?

612
00:41:22,532 --> 00:41:23,592
Does that make any sense?

613
00:41:24,942 --> 00:41:27,809
I think that it makes more sense
than being single at 40.

614
00:41:30,587 --> 00:41:31,884
Isn't Captain kind of good looking?

615
00:41:32,752 --> 00:41:33,672
Is it because I edited it?

616
00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:39,473
Hey. Don't you think Captain is
looking at you in this picture?

617
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:42,352
Yes.

618
00:41:42,762 --> 00:41:43,641
He's looking at me.

619
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:46,422
He's looking at you again.

620
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:48,034
Again.

621
00:41:51,372 --> 00:41:53,120
- Isn't it strange?
- Yeah.

622
00:41:54,049 --> 00:41:54,819
It's strange.

623
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,194
Captain is a bit strange.

624
00:41:58,232 --> 00:41:59,437
Really? Is captain strange?

625
00:42:03,423 --> 00:42:05,592
No. I didn't mean that.

626
00:42:05,683 --> 00:42:07,403
It's okay for you to mean it.

627
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:10,161
No matter how many times I look at you...

628
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:13,962
I think you're meant to be a nitpicker.

629
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:19,151
No.

630
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,600
No, I'm not.

631
00:42:34,532 --> 00:42:35,582
Did you see that turn?

632
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:45,118
Seoul Han River Jail

633
00:42:59,053 --> 00:43:00,131
Who is it?

634
00:43:04,299 --> 00:43:07,824
I'm the son of Bum-Jo Department Store
Chairwoman, Seo Bum-Jo.

635
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:14,710
What brings you here?

636
00:43:16,532 --> 00:43:17,828
I came to tell you that...

637
00:43:19,654 --> 00:43:22,858
you're doing well and you don't have
to worry about what was promised.

638
00:43:25,072 --> 00:43:25,919
Yes.

639
00:43:29,314 --> 00:43:30,878
Bum-Jo came to Chan-soo's house?

640
00:43:31,412 --> 00:43:33,689
- But why didn't he come in?
- He just left.

641
00:43:34,193 --> 00:43:36,680
He wanted to ask for forgiveness
but there wasn't anything he could do.

642
00:43:38,227 --> 00:43:39,049
Forgiveness?

643
00:43:39,811 --> 00:43:42,394
He wasn't standing on his mother's side?

644
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,956
He was just pretending.

645
00:43:46,482 --> 00:43:47,538
Really?

646
00:43:48,812 --> 00:43:51,488
I misunderstood him without knowing that.

647
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:53,841
He didn't tell you because
you might worry.

648
00:43:56,355 --> 00:43:59,508
- It must've been hard for Bum-Jo.
- Yeah.

649
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,363
Nitpicker Jang

650
00:44:05,634 --> 00:44:07,372
Yes. This is Ki Ha-myung
of Han River team.

651
00:44:07,463 --> 00:44:09,993
You're preparing for Bum-Jo Shopping Mall
grand opening

652
00:44:10,092 --> 00:44:11,120
in Yeonjoo at 4 PM, right?

653
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,415
Yes.

654
00:44:12,515 --> 00:44:15,425
Many assemblymen from
Chairwoman Park's side will be there.

655
00:44:16,183 --> 00:44:17,309
Did you confirm the list?

656
00:44:18,338 --> 00:44:18,967
Yes.

657
00:44:19,925 --> 00:44:22,793
When I checked the guest list,
there were many assemblymen

658
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,102
that were mentioned in the texts.

659
00:44:25,193 --> 00:44:27,723
Good. They obviously
won't give you interviews,

660
00:44:27,842 --> 00:44:30,702
but stick to them tenaciously
and film them refusing at least.

661
00:44:30,802 --> 00:44:31,806
Do you understand?

662
00:44:32,132 --> 00:44:32,814
Yes.

663
00:44:34,115 --> 00:44:36,832
- You saw the ceremony brochure, right?
- Yes.

664
00:44:37,013 --> 00:44:41,080
It's the largest mall in the nation
which will improve Yeonjoo's economy

665
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,013
and that it's expected to attract
many Chinese tourists.

666
00:44:44,104 --> 00:44:45,418
Try to make a report with that fact.

667
00:44:47,878 --> 00:44:49,839
- What are you looking at?
- Just because...

668
00:44:51,941 --> 00:44:53,803
Your ability is such a waste.

669
00:44:55,830 --> 00:45:00,256
How about going to the advertising team
instead of newsroom at MSC?

670
00:45:01,423 --> 00:45:02,827
I think that suits you better.

671
00:45:04,962 --> 00:45:08,760
Emphasize the effects of
direct and indirect employment also.

672
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:10,516
Yes. I understand.

673
00:45:13,801 --> 00:45:15,710
- Are you covering the ceremony too?
- Yeah.

674
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,276
He wants me to promote it.
Does that even make sense?

675
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:21,088
Aren't you going to hiccup
while reporting?

676
00:45:21,188 --> 00:45:24,208
I probably will since
it's a complete fake report.

677
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:29,733
I'm going to the same place
and same event

678
00:45:29,823 --> 00:45:31,324
to cover the same story
but it's so different.

679
00:45:33,084 --> 00:45:34,443
Should I just quit?

680
00:45:35,046 --> 00:45:36,363
I thought you're going to hold out?

681
00:45:36,463 --> 00:45:38,506
You were going to hold out
no matter what and make a change?

682
00:45:39,543 --> 00:45:41,805
I'm trying but it doesn't seem hopeful.

683
00:45:42,163 --> 00:45:45,428
Whatever I suggest, they reject it and
they just want me to do PR things.

684
00:45:46,383 --> 00:45:49,175
Is this what being a reporter is?
Should I hold out when it's like this?

685
00:45:49,275 --> 00:45:50,212
Yeah.

686
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:56,362
- Don't answer that easily.
- Ouch.

687
00:46:00,866 --> 00:46:04,229
I want to give a real report
rather than a fake one.

688
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,025
A real one.

689
00:46:21,425 --> 00:46:23,350
Eat so that you can live.

690
00:46:24,175 --> 00:46:25,495
Thanks.

691
00:46:29,895 --> 00:46:32,715
We have to give a Nobel prize
to the person who invented this.

692
00:46:32,815 --> 00:46:34,821
Is this really the first time
eating a triangle kimbap?

693
00:46:43,395 --> 00:46:44,537
Bum-Jo.

694
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:46,687
Choi In-ha.

695
00:46:47,435 --> 00:46:49,584
It's been a long time, right?

696
00:46:50,075 --> 00:46:50,821
Yeah.

697
00:46:51,794 --> 00:46:53,648
Your face looks good. I was worried.

698
00:46:53,748 --> 00:46:56,137
It's not just my face. Everything is good,
like the proportions.

699
00:46:57,633 --> 00:46:58,661
You're talking rubbish.

700
00:46:59,158 --> 00:47:00,187
What brings you here?

701
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:02,013
I had something to take care of.

702
00:47:02,923 --> 00:47:05,578
I'm going to Bum-Jo Shopping Mall
grand opening ceremony right now.

703
00:47:05,678 --> 00:47:06,741
Aren't you going?

704
00:47:08,056 --> 00:47:08,790
No.

705
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:12,860
This is great.
I can just ask you to do it.

706
00:47:13,256 --> 00:47:14,265
What do you want to ask me?

707
00:47:15,427 --> 00:47:19,271
If you end up interviewing my mother
at the ceremony...

708
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:23,249
can you tell her something for me?

709
00:47:24,167 --> 00:47:25,161
What is it?

710
00:47:30,218 --> 00:47:33,302
Team Leader.
Please give me some information.

711
00:47:34,931 --> 00:47:38,408
You know that if I had something
I'll give it to you.

712
00:47:38,753 --> 00:47:42,938
- I really don't have anything today.
- You have something that you kept secret.

713
00:47:43,038 --> 00:47:44,728
Please give it to me.

714
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:45,633
Just once. Just once.

715
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:47,843
Reporter Seo.

716
00:47:49,278 --> 00:47:50,070
Seo Bum-Jo.

717
00:47:50,928 --> 00:47:53,318
What is it? I heard you quit.
What brings you here?

718
00:47:53,418 --> 00:47:55,918
What's with you?
You didn't contact all this time.

719
00:47:56,028 --> 00:47:58,318
- Did you return?
- No.

720
00:47:59,308 --> 00:48:01,488
I came because I had a business
with Team Leader.

721
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:02,668
Business?

722
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:04,223
What business do you have with me?

723
00:48:05,009 --> 00:48:06,018
I...

724
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,711
I came to turn myself in.

725
00:48:08,374 --> 00:48:10,468
- Turn yourself in?
- Turn yourself in?

726
00:48:10,747 --> 00:48:11,708
What do you mean?

727
00:48:12,819 --> 00:48:14,528
Do you remember
the attack at the TV station

728
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:16,556
a little while ago?

729
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:18,224
Of course I know. Cho Dae-gook case.

730
00:48:18,905 --> 00:48:22,459
The person who ordered it was me.

731
00:48:23,226 --> 00:48:24,393
- What?
- What?

732
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:27,457
No way.

733
00:48:32,505 --> 00:48:34,354
Jackpot. It's total jackpot.

734
00:48:36,475 --> 00:48:38,305
Isn't he crazy?

735
00:48:38,405 --> 00:48:40,777
Seo Bum-Jo, the son of
Chairwoman Park Rosa,

736
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:43,267
and who also quit at MSC...

737
00:48:45,081 --> 00:48:47,456
He ordered the Cho Dae-gook attack case..

738
00:48:48,531 --> 00:48:51,430
The culprit came personally
and he's confessing now.

739
00:48:52,374 --> 00:48:54,650
Why did you use Cho Dae-gook?

740
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:59,356
The motive has to be clear
to avoid suspicion.

741
00:49:00,681 --> 00:49:05,287
It wasn't difficult to find someone
who had a grudge against those three.

742
00:49:07,366 --> 00:49:11,752
Being a reporter is a job
that warrants many grudges.

743
00:49:14,696 --> 00:49:16,772
What did you promise Cho Dae-gook?

744
00:49:17,213 --> 00:49:20,847
Then what kind of reward
did he promise Dae-gook?

745
00:49:20,987 --> 00:49:24,595
He said that since it's his first offense,
he'll be in jail for two years at most.

746
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:27,757
That he should consider it as
going to college and promised

747
00:49:27,857 --> 00:49:29,958
that he'll be given a job
for the rest of his life.

748
00:49:30,749 --> 00:49:35,180
He though he had no future as a repeater,
it was an offer he couldn't refuse.

749
00:49:36,127 --> 00:49:38,145
That doesn't make sense at all.

750
00:49:38,858 --> 00:49:40,532
Did you confirm it
with Cho Dae-gook's side?

751
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:45,453
Yes. I couldn't believe it either,
so I checked with the Team Leader.

752
00:49:46,175 --> 00:49:48,272
According to the conversation he had
with the prison officer,

753
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:52,864
Seo Bum-Jo and Cho Dae-gook
did have contact.

754
00:49:54,697 --> 00:49:56,707
The timing is artistic.

755
00:49:57,123 --> 00:49:59,457
He's blowing this up on the day of
his mother's grand opening ceremony?

756
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:02,217
Sir.

757
00:50:02,617 --> 00:50:04,348
Do we have to see this as
he's turning himself in?

758
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:10,851
Yeonjoo BJ Square
Grand Opening Ceremony

759
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,836
I'm on my way to the ceremony.

760
00:50:25,247 --> 00:50:26,364
What are you talking about?

761
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,284
Chairwoman's son ordered a murder?

762
00:50:32,351 --> 00:50:34,788
There are so many eyes as they are...

763
00:50:36,437 --> 00:50:38,629
I understand. Hang up.

764
00:50:41,397 --> 00:50:44,564
I'm not going to the ceremony anymore.
Turn the car around.

765
00:50:45,717 --> 00:50:48,411
Sir. It's the Chief from
Han River Police Station.

766
00:50:48,511 --> 00:50:51,781
He says Chairwoman's son just
turned himself in for ordering a murder.

767
00:50:52,071 --> 00:50:52,879
What?

768
00:51:21,891 --> 00:51:25,641
- You didn't set it up last time.
- What is this?

769
00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:28,738
They said all the assemblymen
were going to come.

770
00:51:29,161 --> 00:51:30,427
Why is it so empty?

771
00:51:32,927 --> 00:51:35,221
I know.
They've should've been here a while ago.

772
00:51:49,861 --> 00:51:50,921
What's wrong?

773
00:51:51,021 --> 00:51:53,111
Why aren't the assemblymen coming?
Call them now.

774
00:51:53,385 --> 00:51:54,917
Ma'am.

775
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:10,162
Ma'am. Are you alright?

776
00:52:12,861 --> 00:52:13,653
Help me.

777
00:52:14,817 --> 00:52:16,675
Over here. Quickly!

778
00:52:21,927 --> 00:52:23,061
Ma'am. Are you alright?

779
00:52:23,901 --> 00:52:25,038
What's wrong with her?

780
00:52:26,021 --> 00:52:27,548
Is something wrong?

781
00:52:35,134 --> 00:52:35,980
Yes Captain.

782
00:52:37,222 --> 00:52:39,778
Excuse me? Seo Bum-Jo turned himself in?

783
00:52:41,151 --> 00:52:43,247
What are you talking about?
He turned himself in?

784
00:52:44,571 --> 00:52:47,181
- Yes. Captain.
- What? He turned himself in?

785
00:52:47,281 --> 00:52:49,291
- Ordering a murder?
- That attack?

786
00:52:49,391 --> 00:52:51,388
- Chairwoman Park's son ordered that?
- Interview her?

787
00:52:51,498 --> 00:52:54,308
- Seo Bum-Jo did?
- Yes. I understand, Captain.

788
00:52:55,178 --> 00:52:58,598
- Seo Bum-Jo, you bastard.
- What? What's going on?

789
00:52:59,222 --> 00:53:00,698
He confessed that he ordered Cho Dae-gook

790
00:53:00,798 --> 00:53:02,328
to attack us and turned himself in.

791
00:53:03,057 --> 00:53:03,805
What?

792
00:53:04,538 --> 00:53:05,805
He's not answering his phone.

793
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:08,888
It looks like he went in
instead of his mother.

794
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:10,508
Why did he...?

795
00:53:12,758 --> 00:53:14,278
This is great. I can just ask you.

796
00:53:14,378 --> 00:53:18,410
If you end up interviewing my mother
at the ceremony...

797
00:53:21,049 --> 00:53:22,492
can you tell her something for me?

798
00:53:23,998 --> 00:53:26,325
- No way...
- What's wrong?

799
00:53:27,848 --> 00:53:32,312
I saw Bum-Jo earlier.
He asked a strange favor.

800
00:53:33,366 --> 00:53:34,658
A favor? What favor?

801
00:53:36,327 --> 00:53:37,685
Do you admit everything?

802
00:53:44,229 --> 00:53:48,668
He asked me tell Chairwoman Park
something if I end up interviewing her.

803
00:53:57,138 --> 00:53:59,752
Do you know that your son
just turned himself in?

804
00:53:59,852 --> 00:54:01,934
Did he do it alone?

805
00:54:02,034 --> 00:54:03,745
Do you know why he ordered the attack?

806
00:54:03,845 --> 00:54:06,382
Why do you think he ordered an attack?

807
00:54:06,482 --> 00:54:08,940
Did you sense that he would do
something like that recently?

808
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,078
- Move aside. Move aside.
- No interviews.

809
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:17,024
Chairwoman Park. You son asked me to
tell you something just earlier.

810
00:54:17,124 --> 00:54:18,456
Would it be okay for me to tell you?

811
00:54:22,804 --> 00:54:23,961
Seo Bum-Jo?

812
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:25,994
Hey, did you interview Seo Bum-Jo?

813
00:54:28,286 --> 00:54:31,738
If you end up interviewing my mother
at the ceremony...

814
00:54:32,846 --> 00:54:34,242
can you tell her something for me?

815
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:35,880
What do you want me to tell her?

816
00:54:36,121 --> 00:54:37,714
Everything I've enjoyed...

817
00:54:38,633 --> 00:54:40,448
and everything I'll enjoy in the future...

818
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:44,218
I'll take responsibility
with mother for that.

819
00:54:44,321 --> 00:54:45,663
Your son wanted me to tell you that...

820
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:48,202
"everything I've enjoyed..."

821
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:50,421
"and everything I'll enjoy
in the future..."

822
00:54:51,086 --> 00:54:53,451
"I'll take responsibility
with mother for that."

823
00:54:56,852 --> 00:54:59,662
- What is he talking about?
- Does that mean that she participated?

824
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:06,143
Tell her that I'm sorry for leaving her
alone and pretending not to know.

825
00:55:06,955 --> 00:55:08,471
He told me to tell you that he's sorry

826
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:10,282
"for leaving you alone and
pretending not to know."

827
00:55:14,392 --> 00:55:15,470
Tell my her that, from now on...

828
00:55:18,154 --> 00:55:19,739
I'll always be with her.

829
00:55:21,574 --> 00:55:22,422
Please tell her that.

830
00:55:23,789 --> 00:55:28,727
He wanted me to tell you that
he'll be with you always from now on.

831
00:55:34,691 --> 00:55:37,951
- So they're accomplices.
- That means Chairwoman Park participated.

832
00:55:38,051 --> 00:55:40,061
Is she telling the truth?

833
00:55:40,161 --> 00:55:42,772
She's a Pinocchio so she can't lie.
It's the truth.

834
00:55:45,664 --> 00:55:47,295
Where is my son right now?

835
00:55:49,585 --> 00:55:51,341
He's at Han River Police Station.

836
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:57,371
Move aside. Move aside.

837
00:56:12,899 --> 00:56:15,234
I think Bum-Jo really wanted
to tell her this.

838
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:22,897
This interview probably can't go out
from MSC, right?

839
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:25,361
Yeah. Probably.

840
00:56:25,461 --> 00:56:28,918
- Yes. It seems the son was interviewed.
- He hinted that they were accomplices.

841
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:32,518
- If it's true, it's an ordered attack.
- The recent attack on the reporters.

842
00:56:32,618 --> 00:56:36,040
Yes. She left for Han River
Police Station. I'll head over there.

843
00:56:38,074 --> 00:56:41,248
But since everyone else filmed
your interview, it will be aired.

844
00:56:41,979 --> 00:56:42,788
Don't worry.

845
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:45,691
Then it's good.

846
00:56:50,903 --> 00:56:52,824
Seo Bum-Jo

847
00:57:00,779 --> 00:57:02,579
Hey, you bastard. What did you just do?

848
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:05,194
Speak softer. I can hear everything.

849
00:57:05,867 --> 00:57:08,289
- Why didn't you answer your phone?
- I was in the interrogation.

850
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:11,112
They said I'll be going to
a holding cell soon.

851
00:57:11,975 --> 00:57:13,594
This will be the last phone call.

852
00:57:15,077 --> 00:57:16,377
Tell them that you didn't do it.

853
00:57:16,838 --> 00:57:20,246
I know why you're doing this
but this isn't right.

854
00:57:21,861 --> 00:57:23,386
If you know, just stay out of it.

855
00:57:25,613 --> 00:57:28,139
- This is the only way.
- Seo Bum-Jo!

856
00:57:32,945 --> 00:57:34,615
Why didn't you press me instead?

857
00:57:36,137 --> 00:57:39,544
That you resent her, hate her.

858
00:57:40,814 --> 00:57:41,957
You should've told me that.

859
00:57:43,826 --> 00:57:44,462
If you did that...

860
00:57:46,274 --> 00:57:48,330
...I could've pretended
not to know and held out longer.

861
00:57:58,443 --> 00:57:59,779
I don't have any other reason either.

862
00:58:01,671 --> 00:58:04,712
I'm doing this because
I want to reveal the truth.

863
00:58:06,976 --> 00:58:10,581
The good and the bad,
the truth of everything.

864
00:58:14,009 --> 00:58:14,937
In my own way...

865
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:19,919
I just wanted to let the world know.

866
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,369
Bum-Jo.

867
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:28,638
Although it was brief,
I was a reporter too.

868
00:58:30,463 --> 00:58:32,061
Just why do you have to go this far?

869
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,150
Just why?

870
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,876
I told you before...

871
00:58:39,285 --> 00:58:40,446
that I'm on your side.

872
00:58:41,943 --> 00:58:43,648
Why would I be doing this...

873
00:58:45,325 --> 00:58:46,619
...if I wasn't on your side?

874
00:58:53,018 --> 00:58:54,166
Do you believe my words now?

875
00:58:57,074 --> 00:58:58,920
I believed you from the beginning,
you crazy bastard.
