1
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:11,943
Pinocchio

2
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,990
Don't be sorry for me.

3
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,300
You're not Song Cha-ok's daughter,
and you're not a niece to me either.

4
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,640
To me, you're just you.

5
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,630
Dal-po... I mean, Ha-myung.

6
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,560
You can call me Dal-po.

7
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,210
No matter how hard I tried...

8
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,930
no matter what I did...

9
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,060
it's still the same as always.

10
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,980
When I think about my father, my brother,
and your mother...

11
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,140
I know that
I shouldn't be feeling this way.

12
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,240
But I just can't give you up.

13
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,860
So let's just...

14
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,971
I feel the same way you do.

15
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,120
Taxi.

16
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,630
Why is it so hard to call a cab?

17
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,480
Should we walk over to a busier street?
We might have better luck then.

18
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,840
Then we're going to have
to walk for a while.

19
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,633
Why don’t we stop by my place for a bit?

20
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,087
Your place?
Which place?

21
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,749
Where I'm living right now.
It's right across the street from here.

22
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:57,992
Hey, what... What are you talking about?

23
00:02:58,314 --> 00:02:59,554
No, I can't!

24
00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:01,042
Why are you overreacting?

25
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:06,112
What kind of nonsense
are you thinking about?

26
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:08,372
No, it's not like that.

27
00:03:12,764 --> 00:03:16,841
Am I the only one who thinks that
inviting me to your place sounds weird?

28
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:18,978
Don't you know what that means?

29
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,307
What does it mean?
It just means I'll fix you up.

30
00:03:21,474 --> 00:03:24,254
I take stray cats home all the time
and treat them if they're injured.

31
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:25,964
That's all it means.

32
00:03:26,054 --> 00:03:28,309
Then, are you comparing me
to a stray cat?

33
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:31,864
I'm just saying that your current state
is that of a stray cat.

34
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:33,783
Let me carry you on my back for now.

35
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,502
Then, it'll just be
for five minutes, okay?

36
00:03:39,874 --> 00:03:41,594
I'm uncomfortable
with any longer than that.

37
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:43,394
Even five minutes is too long for me.

38
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:04,042
It's okay, I can do it myself from here.

39
00:04:05,274 --> 00:04:06,546
Just hold still.

40
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:13,051
You let it get to this point
without saying anything?

41
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:16,536
I really wasn't aware of it.
It didn't hurt at all earlier.

42
00:04:25,984 --> 00:04:27,274
It’s done.

43
00:04:32,374 --> 00:04:34,154
That took exactly four minutes.

44
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:36,254
-Okay?
-Okay.

45
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:38,204
Thanks, I'll just be going now.

46
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:42,362
I'll walk you out.
I'll help you get a cab.

47
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:52,754
Dal-po.

48
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:54,404
It's your father.

49
00:04:55,654 --> 00:04:58,164
Dal-po, are you home?

50
00:04:59,854 --> 00:05:01,861
What do we do?
My dad's here, too.

51
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,464
I think I hear some noise coming
from inside.

52
00:05:08,094 --> 00:05:09,604
Dal-po.

53
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:15,134
This might actually be for the better.
Let's just tell them about us right now.

54
00:05:15,724 --> 00:05:17,134
Are you mad?
No, we can't.

55
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,724
They'll definitely get the wrong idea
if we tell them now. No, never!

56
00:05:20,824 --> 00:05:23,346
We can't tell them like this.
Not like this.

57
00:05:34,804 --> 00:05:37,634
What took you so long?
I thought we were going to freeze.

58
00:05:38,024 --> 00:05:39,744
I was in the bathroom.

59
00:05:44,284 --> 00:05:46,994
Was someone in here with you?
I thought I heard some talking.

60
00:05:47,084 --> 00:05:48,784
No, I'm here alone.

61
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:51,754
What was that sound just now?

62
00:05:57,844 --> 00:05:59,814
I had something stuck in my throat.

63
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:01,234
What brings you by at this hour?

64
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:04,064
Mr Moon at the butcher shop
just got a fresh cow,

65
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:06,684
so we brought you some meat,
and got you some groceries too.

66
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,453
You didn't have to do that.

67
00:06:10,774 --> 00:06:12,044
Are you using the boiler?

68
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:14,784
You have to keep your room
well heated.

69
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:17,794
Yes, the boiler works great.

70
00:06:19,904 --> 00:06:24,264
That's hurting my ears.
You shouldn't play it so loud at night.

71
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:26,105
Your neighbors will complain about it.

72
00:06:29,394 --> 00:06:32,104
Father, all the food has been put away,
so shall we get going now?

73
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:33,179
Okay.

74
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,804
Eat all the meat that we brought you.

75
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:55,664
And your room is still sitting empty.
Dal-pyung doesn't want to use it either.

76
00:06:56,644 --> 00:06:59,144
-We're leaving.
-I see, be careful going home.

77
00:07:26,844 --> 00:07:28,044
Choi In-ha.

78
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:30,294
How can you fall asleep in this situation?

79
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:47,614
-Are you up, now?
-You should've woken me up.

80
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:48,714
I'll just be going now.

81
00:08:49,374 --> 00:08:51,823
Why don't you get cleaned up first?
You're a mess right now.

82
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:54,006
No, I have to get going. I'm going.

83
00:08:56,684 --> 00:08:57,845
It's long past your five minutes.

84
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,368
Since you're still here, get cleaned up
and have breakfast before you go.

85
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:09,444
You're okay with all this?
You don't find this awkward at all?

86
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:11,514
No, not at all.

87
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:13,804
For 13 years we've lived together,
we ate together,

88
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:16,434
shared the same bathroom
and farted in front of each other,

89
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:17,805
so you're the weird one
for being awkward about it.

90
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:22,424
Go get cleaned up.
We can leave for work after breakfast.

91
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:25,254
Okay.

92
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:37,304
Geez, I thought I was going to die.

93
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:42,984
Father, I think
Dal-po might have a girlfriend.

94
00:09:43,484 --> 00:09:45,404
What?
A girlfriend?

95
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:50,014
I found a long strand of hair on the floor
when we were over there last night.

96
00:09:50,104 --> 00:09:51,835
Oh, my goodness.

97
00:09:52,404 --> 00:09:56,344
Do you think it's the girl that we met
at the police station from before?

98
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:58,264
I don't know who it is, either.

99
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,274
How could he bring a girl into his room?
Into his room!

100
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:04,644
Come on, he's old enough
to do that now.

101
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:07,564
His hormones should be raging at his age.

102
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:11,684
-That's understandable.
-How is that understandable?

103
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:16,474
How could he be seeing
another girl already?

104
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,982
That's not right!

105
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:21,254
How can his love change so quickly?

106
00:10:23,944 --> 00:10:28,560
I don't think that’s something
a divorced man like you can say.

107
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:42,563
This is a very simple meal.

108
00:10:42,654 --> 00:10:44,171
Is this how you eat every day?

109
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:47,146
It's a very bare meal, isn't it?

110
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:50,294
Father brought some meat last night.
Want me to grill up some of that?

111
00:10:52,587 --> 00:10:54,234
No, just give me a few moments.

112
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:55,944
I'll make us breakfast.

113
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:32,959
Now this is what you call breakfast.

114
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,974
Yes, you're right.

115
00:12:00,084 --> 00:12:01,924
What are you waiting for?
Have a seat and eat.

116
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:03,740
Okay.

117
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:11,604
I didn't know that you had
a picture taken with your brother.

118
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:13,654
Yeah.

119
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:16,984
-We took it the day he turned himself in.
-I see.

120
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:51,094
Why are you hiccuping?

121
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:54,824
That's because...

122
00:12:57,004 --> 00:12:59,344
After what happened last night
and this morning,

123
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:01,234
to be honest, I'm not sure about this.

124
00:13:02,134 --> 00:13:04,104
I have to run whenever I see my dad,

125
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:06,156
and seeing your brother
makes me feel heavy with guilt.

126
00:13:06,604 --> 00:13:07,974
My mom...

127
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:13,654
No matter how hard I try, I can't get her
out of my head whenever I'm around you.

128
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,975
But I hate the thought
of giving you up even more.

129
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:21,898
So can you give me some time?

130
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:26,054
I'm going to make my mom apologize
to you and to your brother.

131
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:30,910
Then I'll be able to get over my guilt
and see you with a sense of peace.

132
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:36,390
Your hiccups have stopped.

133
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:40,764
Yeah.

134
00:13:43,484 --> 00:13:45,352
That's what'll give you a peace of mind?

135
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:47,954
No matter how much I tell you
that I'm okay...

136
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:50,306
you still won't be okay with it, will you?

137
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,319
Okay, then let's do that.

138
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:08,094
Episode 16 -The Emperor’s New Clothes

139
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:13,184
Bum Jo, have you heard the news?

140
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:15,714
-That Ha-myung found the black box?
-Yeah.

141
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:18,854
YGN's agreed to share it
so that we can use the footage too!

142
00:14:18,954 --> 00:14:20,264
Isn't that great?

143
00:14:21,464 --> 00:14:22,734
Yeah, that's great.

144
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:34,515
I want to stop that fool from doing it,
but my words don't even register with her!

145
00:14:34,844 --> 00:14:36,725
No matter how many times I tell her
that it's not her fault

146
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:39,534
and that it's okay,
and that she should rest,

147
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:41,424
she doesn't listen to a word I say!

148
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:44,064
It's because those words...

149
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:47,374
would matter only if you were the one
to tell her.

150
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:50,760
Spineless idiot.

151
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:53,793
Dumb, cowardly idiot.

152
00:14:57,684 --> 00:14:59,784
Why don't you make the reservation
for our team's dinner outing?

153
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:01,884
-You know the restaurant, Myung-gyo-gwan?
-Yes.

154
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,234
Reserving a room is
the most important part.

155
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:07,161
The open dining room is a hassle,
so make sure to get a room.

156
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:13,684
The black box you found is being
investigated by the police right now.

157
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:18,704
Jang Hyun-gyu is going to follow
that story report.

158
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:21,434
All our best investigative reporters
will lend their expertise

159
00:15:21,564 --> 00:15:24,054
and we'll work with the police
and the prosecutors on this.

160
00:15:24,144 --> 00:15:26,284
So don't worry
about this case getting buried.

161
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:28,754
Yes, Sir.
Thank you, Captain.

162
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:32,083
Long time no see, Hwang Gyo-dong!

163
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:35,234
Yes, it's been a while, Ms Song.

164
00:15:35,704 --> 00:15:38,755
Even though we've exclusively acquired
the footage from the black box,

165
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:41,049
seeing the importance of it,
we've decided to share it with others.

166
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:43,846
-When will MSC be broadcasting it?
-I'm not sure.

167
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:45,652
I don't have much interest in it.

168
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:48,681
You seem quite excited
after having acquired that footage?

169
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:49,872
Yes.

170
00:15:49,963 --> 00:15:52,418
Because it contains the lost time-frame
that you've edited out.

171
00:15:52,988 --> 00:15:56,455
Which I believe is important enough
to change the flow of this story.

172
00:15:57,418 --> 00:15:58,828
Can't wait to see it.

173
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:02,307
Do you really think that meager footage
is enough to change anything?

174
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:04,234
Yes, we'll make sure of it.

175
00:16:04,961 --> 00:16:07,508
We're putting
the best investigative team together

176
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,229
to ensure the case is brought to justice.

177
00:16:09,588 --> 00:16:11,285
We have no intentions
of being hasty with this.

178
00:16:11,918 --> 00:16:13,358
Sure, whatever.

179
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,825
But do you think that you can revive
the flames of an already dead fire?

180
00:16:18,118 --> 00:16:19,397
I worry about that for you.

181
00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:37,058
Selected: Chairwoman

182
00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:38,698
Delete all?

183
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:41,378
Delete
Deleted

184
00:16:45,298 --> 00:16:48,258
From what I just saw outside,
you and Ms Song seem pretty close.

185
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:50,498
Hey, that's an insult.

186
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:55,205
Yoon Yu-rae, are you just getting in?

187
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:01,332
I was kicked to the curb.

188
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,610
How were you were kicked to the curb?
By whom?

189
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,030
By you.

190
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,100
I was kicked to the curb.

191
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,037
What's wrong with her?
She's scaring me.

192
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:18,589
I was dumped like a fool.

193
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,856
Seriously, what's wrong with her?

194
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,670
I'm not sure.

195
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,747
I'm sure you must've done
something wrong.

196
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,590
-Captain!
-Hello, it's nice to meet you.

197
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,693
"'Hello, it's nice to meet you."

198
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:40,934
What are you doing?
Why are you speaking Russian?

199
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,738
Three from the local news section

200
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,713
are sent over to Sochi
to cover the Olympics.

201
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,679
It just so happens
that I minored in Russian.

202
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,480
You can say that I'm in the top running
to be sent over to Sochi.

203
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,608
Reporters are being sent
to cover the Olympics?

204
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:57,258
Yeah, three people.

205
00:17:57,648 --> 00:17:58,529
Three people.

206
00:18:06,938 --> 00:18:07,858
Ouch, that's hot.

207
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:11,758
-To the Olympics?
-Six reporters will be sent to Sochi.

208
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:17,038
You guys will focus on interviewing
the families of competing athletes.

209
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:19,988
Captain, but what about the black box?

210
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:22,758
We finally have the evidence to prove
who's at blame for the fire.

211
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:25,299
-So what about that?
-We'll have to look into that as well.

212
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:30,958
But the Olympics is a bigger story,
so let's just use their press release.

213
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:32,828
No, we can't just copy
their press release.

214
00:18:33,018 --> 00:18:35,711
Another injured worker
from the fire lost his life yesterday.

215
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:39,341
-The death toll is now 17 from 16.
-Yes, I know.

216
00:18:40,168 --> 00:18:42,028
It upsets me too,
and I don't like it either.

217
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:44,298
But this is the Olympics.

218
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,675
Don't you think assigning three of our best
local news reporters is too much?

219
00:18:50,918 --> 00:18:54,608
We have a ton of leads to follow up on.
Can't we send people from other divisions?

220
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:57,968
-They're being sent out, too.
-No, I won't allow this.

221
00:18:58,068 --> 00:18:59,549
We can't lose a single person on this.

222
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,888
We have more leads to follow
than we can handle.

223
00:19:01,988 --> 00:19:03,938
We have to check
Chanju Environmental Company

224
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:05,878
and its connection to the waste factory.

225
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,118
Also checking to make sure
all the permits were legit.

226
00:19:08,228 --> 00:19:10,888
We've already handed the black box
over to the police.

227
00:19:10,998 --> 00:19:12,955
We've already done our job as reporters.

228
00:19:13,338 --> 00:19:15,272
Those that are responsible for this
will be arrested soon.

229
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:19,948
Once the Olympics start, that will
take up half the news time we have.

230
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:22,069
The local news team has to cover
the Olympics, too.

231
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,120
We have to notify the world
of those getting arrested.

232
00:19:25,308 --> 00:19:27,028
That's our responsibility.

233
00:19:27,128 --> 00:19:31,998
In order to correct a wrong, we need 10...
No, a hundred reports on it.

234
00:19:32,098 --> 00:19:35,468
If we let this go now,
then it'll just be forgotten like this.

235
00:19:35,568 --> 00:19:37,238
It will just get buried
by the Olympics coverage.

236
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:39,111
I know.

237
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,818
It just means that the Olympics
are the bigger issue here.

238
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:45,278
MSC is sending six of their people
over to Sochi.

239
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,558
Compared to that,
we're staying very conservative.

240
00:19:47,658 --> 00:19:50,248
Whether you can revive
the flames of a burned out fire,

241
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:51,808
I worry about that for you.

242
00:20:05,598 --> 00:20:08,878
An explosion erupted from the inside
during a fire rescue mission

243
00:20:08,978 --> 00:20:12,170
and nine firemen have lost their lives
with one reported missing.

244
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:13,690
This is exactly how it happened back then.

245
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:16,928
After the accident,
the rage of the world burned hot

246
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:19,888
and my father and my family
had to face that rage.

247
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:23,038
But as more newsworthy stories
started to spread...

248
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,140
They defeated Samsung
in the third round.

249
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:27,707
...the rage and interest from the world
slowly started to cool down.

250
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,788
And by the time the real culprits
came to light...

251
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:36,457
The two guilty parties responsible
for the explosion at the waste factory

252
00:20:36,557 --> 00:20:40,485
were sentenced to 120 hours
of community service by the court.

253
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:44,320
The rage had already died down,
and no one paid any interest.

254
00:20:46,577 --> 00:20:47,923
To change the flow of the tide...

255
00:20:49,686 --> 00:20:53,137
I was still too young and powerless.

256
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:15,357
Ms Song has never changed.
She's always alone.

257
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:22,457
Help me, Ms Song.

258
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:26,617
You have the power
to change the flow of the tide.

259
00:21:26,717 --> 00:21:28,247
Please change it.

260
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:31,167
-What do you mean?
-We recovered what you've edited out.

261
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:34,807
-We've proved that you lied. So...
-I didn't lie.

262
00:21:34,898 --> 00:21:36,607
I didn't know that it had been edited.

263
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:40,197
-It's a mistake any reporter could make.
-Then you should correct your mistake.

264
00:21:40,297 --> 00:21:42,667
Don't bury it.
If you're a true reporter,

265
00:21:43,107 --> 00:21:45,977
-...that's what you must do.
-Even if I don't, it'll still happen.

266
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:48,707
The real culprits will be caught
with the material you turned in

267
00:21:48,797 --> 00:21:49,772
and they'll be punished.

268
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:53,447
-That sounds like a happy ending to me.
-No.

269
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,179
If we just leave it like this,
then it'll be left forgotten.

270
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,516
Like it was 13 years ago.

271
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:04,833
I know that's what you want, too.
That's why you kept the focus on Chan Soo.

272
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,454
Just like you did
with Fireman Ki Ho Sang 13 years ago.

273
00:22:09,647 --> 00:22:11,709
There you go with your ridiculous
speculations again.

274
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:14,601
Yes. I hope
that they're just speculations.

275
00:22:14,692 --> 00:22:16,609
I hope that it's my mistake,
like you're saying.

276
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:18,739
Because if you'd done it on purpose...

277
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:21,599
...then you don't even have the right
to apologize.

278
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,839
You've already told me to apologize.
Why are you so obsessed with that?

279
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,057
This doesn't even concern you.

280
00:22:28,148 --> 00:22:30,392
But it concerns someone
that I care about.

281
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:38,301
I truly and deeply...

282
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:40,879
like and care for Dal-po.

283
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:46,199
That's why I really want him
to hear a sincere apology from you.

284
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:53,457
What does that mean?

285
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:58,294
Ms Song's daughter
likes YGN's Ki Ha-myung?

286
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:00,830
I guess so.

287
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,705
They're like sworn enemies.

288
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,137
Is that even possible?

289
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:20,880
Don't let the death
of the 17th victim be in vain.

290
00:23:25,459 --> 00:23:27,862
Lee Young-guk
Ki Ha-myung

291
00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:41,414
I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm truly so sorry.

292
00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:44,887
You say that you're a reporter?

293
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:47,023
Please don't say that you're sorry...

294
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:49,984
and just find out the truth.

295
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:52,053
Find out the truth of
what really happened to my husband!

296
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:59,002
I don't even know who to get angry at!

297
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:18,792
What are you doing here?

298
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:20,742
The same reason you're here.

299
00:24:21,112 --> 00:24:24,152
Because I feel so sorry
and humiliated as a reporter.

300
00:24:25,252 --> 00:24:26,362
Yeah.

301
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:31,165
Once the Olympics start,
this case will all be forgotten, won't it?

302
00:24:32,357 --> 00:24:33,707
Yeah.

303
00:24:34,277 --> 00:24:36,167
It does get forgotten.

304
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,495
Way too easily.

305
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:41,505
We're much more powerless
than I thought we were.

306
00:24:43,687 --> 00:24:45,257
It would seem so.

307
00:24:49,091 --> 00:24:50,351
Your reservation for 8 has been
confirmed for 7 pm

308
00:24:51,913 --> 00:24:53,015
What kind of a text was that?

309
00:24:54,507 --> 00:24:56,517
In the midst of all this,
we have a team dinner tonight.

310
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:58,165
It was a text confirming our reservation.

311
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:02,099
I have a team dinner tonight, too.
Where are you guys going?

312
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:05,166
-Myung-gyo-gwan.
-That's where we're going.

313
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:31,559
You've got to be kidding me.
You confirmed our room reservation.

314
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:33,959
It got double booked again.

315
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:36,517
But don't worry, we'll get you
another room right away.

316
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:40,229
Since you double booked us,
you owe us a discount on our bill.

317
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,500
(Russian)

318
00:25:42,589 --> 00:25:43,937
Okay, fine.

319
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,469
-YGN!
-Cheers!

320
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:57,009
Fill up your glasses.

321
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:01,139
-MSC, cheers!
-Cheers!

322
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,756
But I can’t see Choi In-ha.

323
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,527
Here she comes right now.

324
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:15,319
What took you so long?
Come over and sit down.

325
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:16,219
Yes.

326
00:26:17,899 --> 00:26:20,413
Don't they look cute together
even as sworn enemies?

327
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:22,522
They’re even wearing
the matching color clothes.

328
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:24,819
You find that funny?

329
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:27,389
No.

330
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:35,289
-He's with YGN?
-Yes, his name is Ki Ha-myung.

331
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,176
-He's Ki Ki Jae-myung's little brother.
-What?

332
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:39,026
He's Ki Jae-myung's little brother.

333
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,488
Sir, I hear that going abroad
on a foreign assignment can be rough.

334
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:52,210
And Russia is known for being really cold.

335
00:26:52,374 --> 00:26:54,546
I'm really good at handling
the cold weather.

336
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:57,989
I was practically born
to be a foreign correspondent.

337
00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:02,248
It makes me think that this might be
my chance to prove that theory.

338
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,239
I know how hard you've been working
to cover the latest field news lately.

339
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:16,279
Let's liven up the Olympic news coverage
and bring some joy back to our viewers

340
00:27:16,379 --> 00:27:20,099
and continue to make our ratings
climb up through the roof!

341
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:22,429
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

342
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:27,197
Choi In-ha, why aren't you toasting?

343
00:27:27,969 --> 00:27:31,449
Dressed all dark and somber like that.
Were you at a funeral or something?

344
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:35,969
Yes, I was at the funeral of the latest
victim who lost his life to the fire.

345
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,214
Another injured worker
from the fire lost his life.

346
00:27:40,304 --> 00:27:42,784
But I noticed that not a single reporter
came to film it.

347
00:27:45,216 --> 00:27:47,974
You did well.
At least you went, so it's fine.

348
00:27:48,494 --> 00:27:49,814
I'm not sure.

349
00:27:49,904 --> 00:27:51,702
I don't quite agree with that.

350
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:56,056
That's my line.

351
00:27:56,706 --> 00:27:59,166
The family of the deceased says
that they still don't know

352
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:00,299
who's responsible for the explosion.

353
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:03,747
They kept asking, expecting me to know
since I'm a reporter, but I didn't.

354
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,798
So what is it that you're saying,
I did well?

355
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:11,524
Let's not talk about work
while we're out for dinner.

356
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:14,633
Why is she talking like that?
She’s ruining the mood!

357
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:18,557
Why?
She's saying all the right stuff.

358
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:20,778
It's obvious that the case
is going to be forgotten,

359
00:28:20,878 --> 00:28:24,007
so it's normal for a reporter
to be thinking and talking like that.

360
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:26,458
We'll soon be overflowing with happy news
that people will be eager for.

361
00:28:27,045 --> 00:28:31,015
So droning on about some bygone news
isn't what a reporter should do either.

362
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:33,291
Disgusting!

363
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,825
17 people have lost their lives.

364
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:43,697
The person responsible for the fire
hasn't even been found yet.

365
00:28:44,215 --> 00:28:46,015
So how is this bygone news?

366
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:49,706
Even though it may not be happy news,
it's must-see news.

367
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:51,978
This is a dinner outing.

368
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,561
Must-see news?

369
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,461
Who would be the judge of that?

370
00:28:57,551 --> 00:29:01,751
If you keep ignoring what the viewers want
and keep pressing your own opinion,

371
00:29:01,851 --> 00:29:04,277
then that would make you a teacher,
not a reporter.

372
00:29:04,387 --> 00:29:05,494
What a joke!

373
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:11,827
Sir.

374
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:16,364
Between happy news and must-see news,
which of the two would you choose?

375
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:19,710
Well...

376
00:29:21,257 --> 00:29:22,988
Both are important.

377
00:29:24,517 --> 00:29:26,446
But if I had to choose only one...

378
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:30,283
then I'd choose the happy news.

379
00:29:36,893 --> 00:29:39,993
Do you not get
what's being asked right now?

380
00:29:41,035 --> 00:29:45,488
Yes, I agree!
We're finally on the same page!

381
00:29:50,428 --> 00:29:54,665
I guess there's not even a comparison
between the Olympics and the fire case.

382
00:29:59,968 --> 00:30:02,624
By the way, Mr Jang, I almost forgot.

383
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:04,742
But I have something
that I need to tell you.

384
00:30:06,295 --> 00:30:06,975
What is it?

385
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:11,034
I've got good news, and bad news.
Which would you like first?

386
00:30:11,732 --> 00:30:13,858
Yeah?
Okay, give me the good news first.

387
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:18,549
A reporter from the cultural section
gave me some concert tickets for you.

388
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:21,416
He told me that it's a concert with
all the hottest Korean celebrities.

389
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:25,009
Really?

390
00:30:25,415 --> 00:30:27,692
Is A-Pink going to be there?
What about Girls Day?

391
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,335
I think they're all coming.

392
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:32,461
Jackpot!

393
00:30:32,571 --> 00:30:35,456
Today really must be my lucky day!

394
00:30:37,505 --> 00:30:39,415
Then what's the bad news?

395
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:44,861
The results of your medical check-up
came out.

396
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:48,248
You have pancreatic cancer.

397
00:30:53,012 --> 00:30:53,965
What?

398
00:30:54,445 --> 00:30:56,785
-I have cancer?
-Are you serious?

399
00:30:56,885 --> 00:31:00,861
-Hey, why are you telling us that now?
-You should've told us right away.

400
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:03,805
Hey, you shouldn't drink then.
What are we going to do?

401
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:06,910
I have...pancreatic cancer.

402
00:31:08,821 --> 00:31:10,401
I knew it.

403
00:31:11,451 --> 00:31:14,976
Hey, you should've told me
as soon as you found out.

404
00:31:15,271 --> 00:31:18,701
Why? News of pancreatic cancer
isn't happy news.

405
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:21,620
Happy news would be
about those concert tickets, wouldn't it?

406
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:23,123
Then apparently,
that's what should come first.

407
00:31:24,831 --> 00:31:25,822
What?

408
00:31:28,496 --> 00:31:29,931
Ki Ha-myung.

409
00:31:30,031 --> 00:31:31,733
Were you toying with me just now?

410
00:31:34,823 --> 00:31:36,371
I'm sorry for having toyed with you.

411
00:31:38,803 --> 00:31:40,391
But I was just curious.

412
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:45,101
Of which should come first
between happy news and must-see news.

413
00:31:52,431 --> 00:31:54,563
Thank you for giving me my answer,
Mr Jang.

414
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:02,626
I feel like I have been fooled
by him again.

415
00:32:05,001 --> 00:32:10,097
No, he didn't fool you.
He just fooled me.

416
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:37,026
The Opening of Sochi Winter Olympics

417
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,632
Cold yet Hot

418
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:39,776
The Opening of Olympics

419
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:41,607
Locals get excited for Sochi Olympics

420
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:47,332
17 people have lost their lives.

421
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,773
We haven’t found out
who's responsible for the explosion.

422
00:32:51,101 --> 00:32:54,011
-So how is this bygone news?
-I was just curious to know.

423
00:32:54,361 --> 00:32:58,401
Of which should come first between
happy news and must-see news.

424
00:32:58,491 --> 00:33:01,403
Even though it may not be happy news,
it's must-see news.

425
00:33:05,641 --> 00:33:10,391
Pull the local news team from the Olympics
and focus on the fire explosion case.

426
00:33:10,482 --> 00:33:16,222
Find out what sort of waste material
this organization has been authorized for.

427
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:20,891
Get all the apprentices to stake out at
both the police and the fire department.

428
00:33:20,991 --> 00:33:25,011
Bring in any relevant information that
the police brought from the factory.

429
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:30,491
And how the illegal chemical waste got
brought to the factory causing this mess.

430
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:31,911
Find out the truth behind that.

431
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:34,421
Dig around and find out
if any politicians' dirty tricks

432
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:36,811
had a part in any of this.

433
00:33:36,911 --> 00:33:38,081
Yes, Sir.

434
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:43,061
Why don't we just let
Jang Hyun-gyu go to Sochi?

435
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,841
Look at how badly he wants to go.

436
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:53,051
No, don't let him go.

437
00:33:58,101 --> 00:34:00,721
I minored in Russian.

438
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:03,811
For the day when I can go to Sochi.
But I can't go.

439
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:05,491
Why, you ask?

440
00:34:08,701 --> 00:34:10,771
All because of that Ki Ha-myung
over there.

441
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:20,241
Jae-hwan, make sure to dress very warmly.

442
00:34:20,341 --> 00:34:24,348
On a cold day like today, we have
to go around to all the police stations,

443
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,833
prosecutions and politicians' offices
even if it takes us all night to do it.

444
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:39,761
Wow, thanks to you, I feel like
I've finally become a real reporter.

445
00:34:40,241 --> 00:34:41,898
Thanks.

446
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:53,173
-Cha Woo-chul.
-Yes?

447
00:34:53,264 --> 00:34:55,835
Search the land and and waters by
the factory for signs of contamination.

448
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,101
-Check out near City Hall, too.
-Yes, Sir.

449
00:34:58,192 --> 00:35:00,401
Yoon Yu Rae, look into the cause
of fire and Ahn Chan-soo.

450
00:35:00,492 --> 00:35:02,222
-Yes, Captain.
-Ki Ha-myung.

451
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:04,385
Go with Jo Sung-ho
from the political division

452
00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:06,505
...and investigate
every single politician you can.

453
00:35:06,595 --> 00:35:07,513
Yes, Captain.

454
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:16,495
-Hey, Jae-hwan, where are you going?
-We're extremely busy.

455
00:35:16,605 --> 00:35:20,215
We have to visit all the police,
prosecution, and political offices.

456
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:21,325
What about you?

457
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:24,505
I have to do some Olympics related
interviews by going to a local sauna

458
00:35:24,615 --> 00:35:27,714
and a fried chicken restaurant
to interview the parents of an athlete.

459
00:35:29,592 --> 00:35:31,670
What's with that getup?

460
00:35:32,404 --> 00:35:36,805
-This would've been my style at Sochi.
-We already heard.

461
00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:40,215
We heard that you're being assigned
to the waste factory case over Sochi.

462
00:35:41,235 --> 00:35:43,055
Stop acting like such a brat.

463
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,877
Ki Ha-myung, was it?

464
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,755
I knew he'd pull
something like that someday.

465
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:52,290
You'd better watch out for him.
He was toying with you like his puppet.

466
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,810
I'm not sure.

467
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,188
-That's not what I think.
-What?

468
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:03,278
I was really longing for Russia
even just 30 seconds ago,

469
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:06,198
but looking at you now, I think
that maybe Ki Ha-myung was right.

470
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:07,353
Because...

471
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:11,483
you are always wrong
about everything and anything!

472
00:36:13,593 --> 00:36:15,289
Thanks for snapping me back
into my senses.

473
00:36:15,928 --> 00:36:19,245
Thank you, Il-joo!

474
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,270
Let's go, Jae-hwan!

475
00:36:30,558 --> 00:36:31,301
Okay.

476
00:36:36,288 --> 00:36:39,148
Joo-ho, am I always wrong?

477
00:36:41,997 --> 00:36:44,053
2014 Sochi Olympics

478
00:36:44,144 --> 00:36:47,503
The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi
is off to a glittering start.

479
00:36:48,174 --> 00:36:51,174
17 days of the worldwide event
has now begun.

480
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:56,154
We will bring you all the best highlights
from the opening ceremony.

481
00:36:56,245 --> 00:37:01,365
The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi
has lifted its opening curtains.

482
00:37:01,644 --> 00:37:06,390
Let's take a look at the opening ceremony
that took place early this morning.

483
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:12,691
Sochi has begun the first of its
17 day festivities under the spotlight.

484
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:17,455
But we, here at YGN,
believe that our priority lies within

485
00:37:17,684 --> 00:37:21,233
bringing you the news
of the explosion

486
00:37:21,343 --> 00:37:24,363
at the waste factory that occurred
on the last 28th.

487
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,543
We will reveal the identity of those
that are responsible

488
00:37:27,643 --> 00:37:30,009
who may otherwise have remained buried
under the glare of festivities.

489
00:37:30,149 --> 00:37:33,114
We believe that the core of the news

490
00:37:33,224 --> 00:37:36,114
is to convey the voices of
the victims' and their grieving families.

491
00:37:37,194 --> 00:37:41,554
The real cause of the fire and explosion
has finally been revealed.

492
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:45,544
It was a gas explosion caused
by a leak from illegal chemical waste.

493
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:48,604
Reporter Jang Hyun-gyu
brings you the exclusive.

494
00:37:48,695 --> 00:37:49,761
Cause of Factory Fire Revealed

495
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:53,084
I'm on the scene of Hangang-gu factory
which claimed the lives of 40 people

496
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:56,057
and injured many others
through a mysterious explosive fire.

497
00:37:56,444 --> 00:37:59,038
Even though it was speculated
that it was caused by gas vapors,

498
00:37:59,129 --> 00:38:03,849
an explosion was a piece of a mystery
that we initially couldn't solve.

499
00:38:04,328 --> 00:38:08,338
But after looking into the footage found
from a black box that YGN acquired,

500
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:11,928
it was found that a fleet of trucks
containing illegal chemical waste

501
00:38:12,028 --> 00:38:14,718
were seen entering
the site of the factory property.

502
00:38:14,818 --> 00:38:18,728
Are you guys doing a good job
of investigating this case?

503
00:38:18,978 --> 00:38:22,368
YGN is going to continue covering
the case until the culprits are caught.

504
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:25,738
-So stay sharp on the case.
-Yes, Sir!

505
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:30,988
Officer Ahn, who was blamed for not
having thoroughly investigated the site

506
00:38:31,088 --> 00:38:33,798
has been cleared free of any blame
for the factory explosion.

507
00:38:34,448 --> 00:38:37,598
The true cause of the explosion
and the fire at the factory

508
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:42,908
was due to the illegal chemical waste
brought to the factory two hours after.

509
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:45,798
Illegal chemical waste that the factory
tried to get rid of secretly,

510
00:38:45,898 --> 00:38:49,075
was leaked and contaminated
all the nearby land and water.

511
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:50,228
Water Control Team

512
00:38:50,338 --> 00:38:52,173
Go investigate the nearby sites.

513
00:38:52,264 --> 00:38:53,406
Han River Water Control Team

514
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,388
With all the coverage
on the news station,

515
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,228
we'll be in big trouble
if the inspectors decide to visit.

516
00:38:58,328 --> 00:39:01,698
After YGN's report, the prosecution
is now in full investigative mode.

517
00:39:01,918 --> 00:39:05,168
Prosecutors’ Office has summoned.

518
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:08,238
Congressman Kim Kyung-woo
for questioning this afternoon.

519
00:39:08,938 --> 00:39:11,618
Prosecutors’ Office have confiscated
evidence from the residences

520
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:14,198
of 10 individuals who were related
to the factory case

521
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:16,450
and it supports the claim
of Congressman Kim accepting bribery

522
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,191
as hush money
to dump illegal chemical waste.

523
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:24,092
If it is ruled that Senator Kim Kyung-woo
is guilty of accepting these bribes,

524
00:39:24,183 --> 00:39:26,184
then Senator Kim will lose
his senate position.

525
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:32,073
Reporter Ki Ha-myung reporting for YGN.

526
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,969
Senator Kim Kyung-woo

527
00:39:43,863 --> 00:39:45,561
Yes, Sir.

528
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:50,149
It's just an informal summon,
so don't worry about it so much.

529
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:54,388
I did my best to stop this
from leaking out.

530
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,829
Yes, I'll visit you soon.

531
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:04,845
Why is YGN doing this?
Have they lost their minds?

532
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,926
Why are they bothering me with this
instead of focusing on the Olympics?

533
00:40:08,017 --> 00:40:09,869
Did they totally ignore
their viewers’ ratings?

534
00:40:13,054 --> 00:40:14,279
They’re getting on my nerves.

535
00:40:16,736 --> 00:40:20,529
Those people have just cost me
one of my congressmen.

536
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:24,952
We are now halfway through
the Olympics.

537
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:29,009
The fervent cheers and glory of the event
reaches us through the news every day.

538
00:40:29,714 --> 00:40:34,428
But 17 deceased victims and their families

539
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:37,149
cannot join in on this.

540
00:40:37,972 --> 00:40:40,909
There are those who are hoping
that the truth of the injustice done

541
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:43,559
to these victims remains buried under
the fervor of this cheer.

542
00:40:44,004 --> 00:40:46,907
Those are none other than the culprits
that are responsible for this tragedy.

543
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:53,889
Until their identities come to light
and are punished for it,

544
00:40:54,428 --> 00:40:58,419
we will continue to maintain our focus
and bring you all the updates on the case.

545
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:17,041
I wish they would've done this
during dad's case, too.

546
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:24,139
Right?

547
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:30,389
Yes, you're right.

548
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,212
I didn't like reporters.

549
00:41:37,543 --> 00:41:41,889
And I used to wish that all reporters
would just disappear from this earth.

550
00:41:45,535 --> 00:41:46,719
But now I'm glad.

551
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,879
I'm glad that we became reporters.

552
00:41:51,529 --> 00:41:52,669
Yeah.

553
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,579
Is it... all over now?

554
00:41:59,363 --> 00:42:01,509
No, this is only the beginning.

555
00:42:02,793 --> 00:42:05,979
Because I still have
too many questions to ask.

556
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:24,619
The cheer for Athlete Lee Gyu-hyuk?

557
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:27,919
Yes.
I understand.

558
00:42:34,924 --> 00:42:36,289
I can see you back there.

559
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:38,239
Why are you hiding?

560
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:40,644
Because I'm embarrassed.

561
00:42:42,919 --> 00:42:44,253
Embarrassed about what?

562
00:42:44,711 --> 00:42:47,249
You guys are continuing to report
real news updates on the case

563
00:42:47,604 --> 00:42:50,427
and we're just repeating
whatever we're told by the police.

564
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:53,969
-Are you feeling sorry about it?
-Yeah.

565
00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:57,829
I feel sorry to Chan-soo, and
to the grieving families of the victims

566
00:42:57,929 --> 00:42:58,939
And...

567
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:01,400
Leave me out of it.

568
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:04,949
I really can't stand hearing you
telling me that you're sorry anymore.

569
00:43:16,111 --> 00:43:17,453
Ma'am, Sir?

570
00:43:17,544 --> 00:43:20,986
You have to give us the interview
right after the race is over, okay?

571
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:23,009
Go for it, Lee Gyu-hyuk!

572
00:43:23,531 --> 00:43:27,399
Get on that interview with the family
as soon as he wins the gold medal.

573
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:30,954
It's very likely that the mom will cry,
so make sure to catch that moment.

574
00:43:31,054 --> 00:43:33,594
-Okay.
-It's starting!

575
00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:38,234
I've been to the homes
of three separate gold medalists.

576
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,174
It was all for nothing.

577
00:43:41,527 --> 00:43:42,894
I went to four.

578
00:43:43,649 --> 00:43:46,034
I even went to Itaewon yesterday
and asked a bunch of Russians

579
00:43:46,134 --> 00:43:48,524
'do you know kimchi?'
at least a hundred times.

580
00:43:54,892 --> 00:43:57,174
My dear reporters!
Good, you're all here.

581
00:43:57,274 --> 00:43:59,164
Thanks to all of you,
my name has been cleared!

582
00:44:00,154 --> 00:44:01,594
And I can sleep in peace again.

583
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:05,124
Joon-hee, tell everyone
how thankful you are.

584
00:44:05,972 --> 00:44:07,617
Thank you.

585
00:44:08,402 --> 00:44:09,524
Yeah.

586
00:44:09,615 --> 00:44:12,900
Hey, MSC totally ditched your dad
to focus on the Olympics news.

587
00:44:13,242 --> 00:44:16,682
I think only we have earned the right
to accept those oranges.

588
00:44:19,162 --> 00:44:21,755
Knock it off.
We only do what our bosses tell us to do.

589
00:44:21,855 --> 00:44:24,642
We would have had to cover the Olympics
if we had worked for MSC.

590
00:44:24,742 --> 00:44:26,862
Are you taking In-ha's side right now?

591
00:44:27,562 --> 00:44:29,962
Your devotion to her is enough
to bring tears to my eyes

592
00:44:30,062 --> 00:44:31,838
and my self-pity
is bringing on even more tears!

593
00:44:36,852 --> 00:44:39,362
-What is wrong with her?
-I don't know.

594
00:44:39,462 --> 00:44:43,972
-She scares me once in a while.
-No, Yu-rae is right.

595
00:44:44,372 --> 00:44:46,452
I'm too ashamed to even face you,
Chan-soo.

596
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:49,462
I can't believe MSC hasn't said
a single blip about the case.

597
00:44:49,572 --> 00:44:50,852
Does that make any sense?

598
00:44:50,952 --> 00:44:53,742
I know what you're feeling inside,
so don't blame yourself for it, my friend.

599
00:44:54,182 --> 00:44:57,845
And thanks to Mr Seo Bum-jo,
I'm no longer mad at MSC News.

600
00:44:59,352 --> 00:45:00,405
What do you mean by that?

601
00:45:01,651 --> 00:45:07,801
Mr Seo Bum-jo gave us a really big
envelope of cash for our son's party.

602
00:45:08,601 --> 00:45:10,241
Where is he?

603
00:45:14,981 --> 00:45:18,141
I noticed that there are many similarities
to the case from 13 years ago.

604
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:21,351
Also that it was a waste factory
that exploded by illegal chemical waste.

605
00:45:21,451 --> 00:45:24,811
Looking at all these reports together,
they seem very awkwardly put together.

606
00:45:24,911 --> 00:45:27,681
As if the focus was purposely
driven onto your father.

607
00:45:27,781 --> 00:45:30,931
You said Ms Song Cha-ok left her phone
at your place 13 years ago, right?

608
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:32,581
Do you remember the date
of that visit?

609
00:45:32,681 --> 00:45:34,771
October 23rd, 2000.

610
00:45:34,871 --> 00:45:37,731
My mother passed away
on October 22nd, 2000.

611
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:40,551
If it is ruled
that Congressman Kim Kyung-woo

612
00:45:40,651 --> 00:45:43,441
is indeed guilty of
accepting those bribes...

613
00:45:54,861 --> 00:45:55,693
Son!

614
00:45:57,781 --> 00:45:59,542
What are you doing here?

615
00:46:01,771 --> 00:46:04,861
How silly of me to ask such a thing.
Of course my son should come home.

616
00:46:05,655 --> 00:46:07,927
What brings you by?
Do you need something?

617
00:46:08,091 --> 00:46:09,356
No, I don't need anything.

618
00:46:10,441 --> 00:46:11,665
I just had to ask you something.

619
00:46:12,111 --> 00:46:13,689
I wonder what it could be?

620
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:17,341
You're scaring me with that serious look
on your face.

621
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,841
Why would you be scared?

622
00:46:18,931 --> 00:46:21,442
Do you already have a hunch
about what I'm here to ask you?

623
00:46:23,711 --> 00:46:26,817
You had a meeting with Ms Song here
at the house 13 years ago.

624
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:31,839
-Son, I've already told you...
-That wasn't the question.

625
00:46:32,473 --> 00:46:34,311
I'm just here to tell you the truth
which I've verified myself.

626
00:46:36,941 --> 00:46:38,781
The recent factory explosion case...

627
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:41,667
It's extremely similar
to Ki Ho-sang's case from 13 years ago.

628
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,981
An innocent bystander was framed
to be guilty for the accident...

629
00:46:45,121 --> 00:46:48,073
and when the clues were finally found,
other issues came up to bury it.

630
00:46:48,401 --> 00:46:52,001
Ms Song Cha-ok was the one
who directed the flow of the story then

631
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:53,521
and the same has occurred again.

632
00:46:53,864 --> 00:46:57,698
And as the result, Ki Ho Sang's family
was completely ruined.

633
00:46:57,911 --> 00:47:01,290
And the very next day,
on October 23rd, 2000...

634
00:47:02,161 --> 00:47:04,164
you met with Ms Song Cha-ok.

635
00:47:04,841 --> 00:47:08,466
I have evidence that you met with Ms Song
again after the recent accident.

636
00:47:08,811 --> 00:47:10,821
What is it that you're trying to say?

637
00:47:12,481 --> 00:47:15,932
Turns out Congressman Kim Kyung-ho
was pulling the strings behind this case.

638
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:19,149
I'm close enough to him
to address him as an uncle.

639
00:47:19,571 --> 00:47:22,210
And I know that he has
an even closer relationship with you.

640
00:47:22,687 --> 00:47:24,051
So?

641
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:28,401
Are you saying that I'm somehow related
to those cases?

642
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,741
Yes.

643
00:47:31,134 --> 00:47:33,464
Ms Song, Congressman Kim Kyung-ho...

644
00:47:34,497 --> 00:47:35,336
and you.

645
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:40,551
I believe that the three of you
are related to those cases.

646
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:44,091
-Am I wrong?
-Didn't I tell you?

647
00:47:44,871 --> 00:47:47,636
-That you can't treat me like a reporter.
-Mother!

648
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:51,531
Come ask again after you quit
being a reporter, and I'll answer it then.

649
00:47:55,601 --> 00:47:59,979
Asking questions was all that we can do
with nothing but a suspicion.

650
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:05,882
Even though those questions
may have seemed powerless...

651
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:12,510
Yes, it's me. I think we need
to remain cautious for now.

652
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:15,019
Senator Kim was taken in for questioning.

653
00:48:16,165 --> 00:48:19,511
And my son keeps asking me questions
about the case from 13 years ago.

654
00:48:19,611 --> 00:48:21,121
It's starting to get on my nerves.

655
00:48:21,261 --> 00:48:22,589
The more questions that were asked,

656
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,269
the more they tried to hide their answers.

657
00:48:24,592 --> 00:48:27,792
Just in case, get rid of everything
that could incriminate us.

658
00:48:27,892 --> 00:48:29,674
And do not contact me for a while.

659
00:48:30,672 --> 00:48:31,939
Yes, Ma'am.

660
00:48:33,102 --> 00:48:35,912
And in the end, their secrets that
they tried so hard to keep hidden...

661
00:48:40,392 --> 00:48:42,652
would become the key
to unlocking those answers.

662
00:48:51,412 --> 00:48:52,682
It's about Ms Song.

663
00:48:52,782 --> 00:48:54,152
Did she lose something?

664
00:48:54,262 --> 00:48:56,882
-She keeps searching for something.
-I don't know.

665
00:48:57,022 --> 00:49:00,412
She told me that it was nothing,
but I guess it is something.

666
00:49:00,762 --> 00:49:02,482
Whatever it is,
she's still looking for it.

667
00:49:12,962 --> 00:49:14,257
I was pretty surprised.

668
00:49:14,712 --> 00:49:17,032
I didn't think you'd give up
your seat as a news anchor.

669
00:49:17,132 --> 00:49:18,932
No, can't be.

670
00:49:35,812 --> 00:49:38,492
This must be for the upcoming
Olympics news report?

671
00:49:38,602 --> 00:49:39,622
Yes.

672
00:49:39,722 --> 00:49:43,432
By any chance...
have you seen my old cellphone?

673
00:49:43,852 --> 00:49:45,122
Excuse me?

674
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:49,532
I thought maybe you accidentally took it
when you helped me pick up my things.

675
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:55,572
Yes, I guess I must've taken it.

676
00:49:59,438 --> 00:50:03,452
-Why would you have taken it?
-Because I was curious.

677
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,501
I was curious to see what I sent
in those text messages.

678
00:50:06,142 --> 00:50:08,696
That's ridiculous.
When will you bring it back?

679
00:50:08,787 --> 00:50:09,917
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.

680
00:50:11,932 --> 00:50:14,275
There are many awkward phrasings
in here. Go through it again.

681
00:50:21,888 --> 00:50:23,650
-Choi In-ha.
-Yeah?

682
00:50:23,842 --> 00:50:26,256
I need you to give me that cellphone.

683
00:50:26,742 --> 00:50:27,874
Why?

684
00:50:28,627 --> 00:50:30,942
Don't ask, and just give it to me.
It was mine to begin with.

685
00:50:31,042 --> 00:50:32,322
What's wrong?

686
00:50:32,422 --> 00:50:35,502
Why are you and Ms Song both suddenly
so interested in that cellphone?

687
00:50:35,602 --> 00:50:37,092
You don't need to know why.

688
00:50:37,192 --> 00:50:38,729
Just hand it over.

689
00:50:40,742 --> 00:50:42,294
Tell me the reason,
and I'll give it to you.

690
00:50:45,339 --> 00:50:48,189
You know there are manipulation
of the public attention,

691
00:50:48,289 --> 00:50:50,103
in this case and the case
from 13 years ago, right?

692
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:52,597
Yeah.

693
00:50:53,523 --> 00:50:59,593
I believe that Ms Song and my mother
are related to both those cases.

694
00:51:01,493 --> 00:51:04,843
-Yeah, me too.
-And that evidence...

695
00:51:05,273 --> 00:51:09,412
might be on that cellphone.

696
00:51:10,546 --> 00:51:12,403
On the cellphone?
Why do you think that?

697
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,133
When I thought about it,

698
00:51:18,233 --> 00:51:21,221
I thought it weird that only the texts
you sent were on that phone.

699
00:51:21,897 --> 00:51:24,746
Why aren't there any other messages
or call logs other than yours?

700
00:51:25,973 --> 00:51:28,923
I'm sure that Ms Song
had that cellphone even before then.

701
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:35,942
Then are you saying that she
purposely deleted all the other messages?

702
00:51:37,843 --> 00:51:39,463
Maybe.

703
00:52:04,023 --> 00:52:06,133
No more messages

704
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,489
Data Return

705
00:52:37,063 --> 00:52:40,635
Would it be possible to retrieve
all the deleted texts and call logs?

706
00:52:41,564 --> 00:52:43,171
This model is from 1999.

707
00:52:43,403 --> 00:52:44,903
It’s like a piece of cake.

708
00:52:45,003 --> 00:52:47,873
Address book, SNS, MMS messaging,
and all the call logs...

709
00:52:47,973 --> 00:52:49,098
All those can be retrieved.

710
00:52:49,313 --> 00:52:51,183
How long will that take?

711
00:52:51,513 --> 00:52:54,033
I'm not sure.
I won't know until I start the process.

712
00:52:54,133 --> 00:52:57,843
It may take anywhere from a few hours
to a couple of days, at most.

713
00:52:58,353 --> 00:53:00,553
If you're in a rush for it,
then I can email you the results.

714
00:53:01,013 --> 00:53:03,015
Then can you please email it to me?

715
00:53:05,303 --> 00:53:07,283
I just need you to fill out this form.

716
00:53:07,923 --> 00:53:11,783
But you do realize that your name
must match the phone account holder?

717
00:53:11,883 --> 00:53:13,232
If it doesn't, then I can't recover it.

718
00:53:13,603 --> 00:53:14,813
Excuse me?

719
00:53:14,923 --> 00:53:16,343
The account holder?

720
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:33,353
I guess you need to be here for us
to retrieve the contents of this phone.

721
00:53:33,453 --> 00:53:35,053
What did you try to do?

722
00:53:35,343 --> 00:53:37,563
You were trying to retrieve the texts
without me knowing about it?

723
00:53:38,493 --> 00:53:40,263
That's...

724
00:53:41,353 --> 00:53:42,713
If what you're saying is true,

725
00:53:42,813 --> 00:53:44,859
it'll hurt you more than
it will hurt me.

726
00:53:45,828 --> 00:53:49,479
So I thought it would be better
if only I would get hurt from it.

727
00:53:50,943 --> 00:53:54,613
Thanks for worrying about me,
but I'm not that weak of a person.

728
00:53:58,063 --> 00:53:59,514
What forms do I need to fill out?

729
00:54:03,312 --> 00:54:05,763
There's a fellow reporter
whose name is Cha Woo-chul.

730
00:54:05,863 --> 00:54:09,233
He did a report on the contamination,
and I looked into...

731
00:54:10,863 --> 00:54:12,389
You can stop with your explanations.

732
00:54:12,623 --> 00:54:13,983
I can watch the news from in here.

733
00:54:15,203 --> 00:54:17,653
-I saw it all.
-Really?

734
00:54:17,793 --> 00:54:20,987
-You saw me reporting live?
-Yeah.

735
00:54:21,773 --> 00:54:24,433
But you looked a little too stiff.

736
00:54:24,533 --> 00:54:26,543
-I could tell that you were a rookie.
-Jae-myung!

737
00:54:29,029 --> 00:54:30,601
I'm really glad that you're a reporter.

738
00:54:32,213 --> 00:54:34,323
What's this?
You're trying to sweeten your blow?

739
00:54:34,413 --> 00:54:38,873
At the very least, I know that I can
trust the news that you report.

740
00:54:45,193 --> 00:54:46,973
Because it burns hot in there...

741
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:50,289
while it remains cold up there.

742
00:54:52,813 --> 00:54:54,286
The opposite of someone else I know.

743
00:54:55,913 --> 00:54:57,413
Who?

744
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:00,803
-Ms Song?
-Yeah.

745
00:55:15,543 --> 00:55:17,953
Hello? Have you recovered the phone?

746
00:55:18,053 --> 00:55:21,193
Yes, I just emailed it to the address
that you left with me.

747
00:55:21,303 --> 00:55:23,993
-You can check it now.
-Thank you.

748
00:55:30,923 --> 00:55:33,613
-Did you get the phone call, too?
-Yeah.

749
00:55:38,133 --> 00:55:40,653
Are there that many messages
deleted from the phone?

750
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,023
Yeah.

751
00:55:45,623 --> 00:55:47,433
Who is 'The Chairwoman'?

752
00:55:50,923 --> 00:55:52,693
It's my mother.

753
00:55:57,343 --> 00:55:58,593
Are you sure?

754
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:01,193
Yeah.

755
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:04,693
This is my mother's old phone number.

756
00:56:05,203 --> 00:56:07,263
The last four digits are still the same.

757
00:56:14,014 --> 00:56:16,413
Open up the messages and let's see.

758
00:56:27,353 --> 00:56:30,310
We need to divert the attention.

759
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,313
Turn the focus on Ki Ho-sang
and turn him into the bad guy.

760
00:56:35,513 --> 00:56:38,913
Why do you think he ordered such a thing?
Did he have his sights set on a promotion?

761
00:56:39,013 --> 00:56:41,383
-He isn't that type of a man!
-Use his family if needed.

762
00:56:41,513 --> 00:56:43,363
Are you saying that your father
isn't at fault?

763
00:56:43,473 --> 00:56:46,322
How fortunate that
we have found a Pinocchio witness!

764
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:50,133
-Use that unique characteristic...
-The witness said that he saw your father.

765
00:56:50,233 --> 00:56:52,563
The witness is a Pinocchio,
so it couldn't have been a lie.

766
00:56:52,663 --> 00:56:56,983
I'm positive that it was him.
I'm a Pinocchio, so I can't lie.

767
00:56:57,083 --> 00:57:01,563
Do what you can to fan the rage of
the nationwide public as much as possible.

768
00:57:01,663 --> 00:57:03,493
You must be happy your father's alive.

769
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:10,113
But the crowd believes that it's too light
of a sentence for the deaths

770
00:57:10,223 --> 00:57:13,136
of the nine firemen
and are enraged for justice.

771
00:57:43,033 --> 00:57:45,383
Can you call yourself a reporter?

772
00:57:45,483 --> 00:57:47,813
Aside from you, who else knows about this?

773
00:57:48,263 --> 00:57:51,463
-Captain, as of today...
-Are you saying that you'll betray us?

774
00:57:51,563 --> 00:57:53,723
I'll reveal all the connections
between the parties.

775
00:57:53,823 --> 00:57:56,373
-As a mother.
-Who reported this information?

776
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,163
-Miss Choi In-ha!
-Director Yeon has just told it.

777
00:57:59,263 --> 00:58:02,353
Tell me that I did okay.
Tell me I did the right thing, Dad!

778
00:58:02,453 --> 00:58:04,953
Yes, you did the right thing.
My daughter did the right thing!
