1
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:11,721
Pinocchio

2
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,310
Mother. Where are you right now?

3
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,736
Sir.

4
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:52,239
Oh, Ms Choi.

5
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,390
Why are you back already?
Why aren't you at your assigned post?

6
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,780
I'm sorry.
I have something important to do.

7
00:00:57,115 --> 00:00:58,415
Do you know where the Chief is perhaps?

8
00:00:59,021 --> 00:00:59,983
She's in the meeting room.

9
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,246
What's wrong with her?

10
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,422
-Were you this low, Chief?
-What are you doing at this hour?

11
00:01:12,513 --> 00:01:14,210
The cell phone
that you were looking for...

12
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,170
I restored all the deleted messages.

13
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,517
Try to explain to me what these are.

14
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,740
It's been 13 years...
No, it's been 14 years already.

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,079
I thought that you might've misunderstood
the situation because of the media.

16
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,465
I thought that you did it
because of your own conviction.

17
00:01:32,797 --> 00:01:34,120
But was it like this?

18
00:01:34,923 --> 00:01:37,440
Were you someone who just writes down
whatever the Chairwoman orders?

19
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,694
Are you sure...

20
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:41,343
you're a real reporter?

21
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,330
-How did you get this?
-Please explain.

22
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:56,260
The texts that you sent to Ms Song...

23
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:59,440
Telling her to use fireman Ki Ho-sang...

24
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,267
What does this mean?

25
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:08,172
Tell me you're not.

26
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,374
Tell me that you're not this scary.

27
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,740
Tell me that you're not
this horrible please.

28
00:02:15,288 --> 00:02:17,359
Who else knows about this other than you?

29
00:02:24,487 --> 00:02:27,673
-Did you really do this, mother?
-I said who else knows about this?

30
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:29,790
What if someone else knows?

31
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,420
Just why did you do this?

32
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,750
Either explain it to me
or at least make excuses.

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,420
I told you before right?

34
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,645
I'll tell you
when you quit being a reporter.

35
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:49,838
Captain. This is Seo Bum-Jo.

36
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,030
Starting today...

37
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:55,496
I'm quitting MSC.

38
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,296
Is that good?

39
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:06,358
I think I'm qualified to listen
to you answer.

40
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,983
Episode 17 - The Scarlet Letter

41
00:03:20,353 --> 00:03:21,540
That's right.

42
00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:23,413
I did send all these texts.

43
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,869
Because of that incident at that time.

44
00:03:27,617 --> 00:03:30,890
The Assemblyman that was looking after
my business was in a difficult situation.

45
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:34,477
Issues with the plant
and the chemical disposal business...

46
00:03:34,577 --> 00:03:36,468
He was looking after all of them.

47
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:41,753
But he was in a sensitive time
because of his by-elections...

48
00:03:42,137 --> 00:03:43,607
So...

49
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:47,167
You framed fireman Ki Ho-sang
to cover that person?

50
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:51,817
We just had to divert the attention
until the election was over.

51
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:56,117
But I didn't even know
that the matter would get that big.

52
00:03:58,228 --> 00:04:02,409
If you consider everything,
what I did wasn't exactly illegal.

53
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:06,801
I just did a small favor for someone
who was helping my business.

54
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:09,982
This business is the same as farming.

55
00:04:10,147 --> 00:04:12,936
Things don't just grow
because you planted the seeds.

56
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:16,117
You have to grow them
while getting your hands dirty

57
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,211
with smelly fertilizer and pesticides

58
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:20,432
until you can finally hold the fruit
with your hands.

59
00:04:20,847 --> 00:04:23,457
Next month, I'll have the grand opening
at the Duty Free shop

60
00:04:23,557 --> 00:04:26,547
and the new shopping mall permit
in Yeonjoo.

61
00:04:26,677 --> 00:04:28,921
They're all businesses worth
several hundred million dollars.

62
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:31,937
Those are all the farms
that I worked hard on for 20 years

63
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:35,197
while I fertilized and nurtured.

64
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:37,277
I just have to harvest now,

65
00:04:37,368 --> 00:04:40,740
but it keeps getting infested with bugs
so I'm really about to get irritated.

66
00:04:43,107 --> 00:04:44,707
What if...

67
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:47,681
What if these texts
are revealed to the world?

68
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:51,201
Well, I'm sure we'll get criticized a bit.

69
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:54,537
But it's already been 14 years.

70
00:04:54,637 --> 00:04:56,977
There's no law to apply
and even if there is one...

71
00:04:57,077 --> 00:04:59,517
the statutes of limitation must be over.

72
00:04:59,617 --> 00:05:01,257
I don't think
there's going to be any problems.

73
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:09,817
By granting these kinds of favors...

74
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,452
what did you gain for yourself?

75
00:05:13,392 --> 00:05:15,451
All the things that
you've been enjoying until now.

76
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:17,217
And...

77
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,337
And all the things
that you'll enjoy in the future.

78
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:32,157
I just thought that you made a mistake
as a reporter.

79
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:36,147
That you and Bum-jo's mom
were simply friends.

80
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:37,537
No.

81
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:40,322
I wanted to believe that.

82
00:05:42,257 --> 00:05:44,967
But how could you do such a thing?

83
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:48,015
As a reporter... No. How could you do
such a thing as a human being?

84
00:05:48,787 --> 00:05:50,377
Where...

85
00:05:50,987 --> 00:05:52,336
Where did you get that?

86
00:05:55,504 --> 00:05:57,515
You told me to argue with proof,
didn't you?

87
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:00,830
I don't think there will be
any definite proof than this.

88
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:04,467
Please answer me.
Just why did you do such a horrible thing?

89
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:07,470
-Lower your voice. Don't make a fuss.
-No.

90
00:06:08,071 --> 00:06:09,370
I am going to make a fuss.

91
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:11,777
What Bum-jo's mother and you, mom...

92
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:14,148
no, Chief, have committed...

93
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:16,516
The atrocity you have committed...

94
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,207
I'm going to report it no matter what.

95
00:06:19,307 --> 00:06:21,291
I'm going to reveal it
to the world in detail!

96
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:24,845
I will reveal them all.

97
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:27,389
February, 2000

98
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,367
Now that I'm aware of the truth,
I can't keep my mouth shut as a reporter.

99
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:34,287
I'll report everything on the connection
between the Chairwoman and Chief.

100
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,255
Do you think that I will let you do that?

101
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:39,851
Do you think that's possible?

102
00:06:40,677 --> 00:06:43,866
No. I'm sure it will be impossible at MSC.

103
00:06:44,257 --> 00:06:46,740
The report will go out from YGN.

104
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:48,567
What?

105
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:51,127
I think that it's only right to report it
no matter what.

106
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:55,477
So I decided to give
all the proof and files to YGN.

107
00:06:55,577 --> 00:06:57,289
Are you saying
you're going to be a whistle-blower?

108
00:06:58,457 --> 00:07:03,537
Are you aware of the consequences
of your action?

109
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:07,927
I am prepared, to some degree.

110
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:11,026
You won't be a reporter ever again.

111
00:07:11,677 --> 00:07:15,193
I'm curious to see
if you're prepared to that degree.

112
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:22,447
Do you think that
you have the strength to report this?

113
00:07:22,547 --> 00:07:25,546
There's no way
this will be reported at MSC.

114
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:26,907
I know.

115
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:29,718
-The report will be given at YGN...
-So you'll be a whistle-blower...

116
00:07:31,227 --> 00:07:35,195
Are you aware that once you become
a whistle-blower, you'll be fired?

117
00:07:35,717 --> 00:07:37,152
I'm not afraid.

118
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:40,747
The company where I can't say what I want
and has dirty connections...

119
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:42,518
I'm not sorry to let it go.

120
00:07:42,737 --> 00:07:46,217
I'm going to start over
as a reporter at a proper company.

121
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:49,350
Do you think you'll be able
to be a reporter again?

122
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:50,281
Yes.

123
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:55,083
Who will hire someone
who has been branded as a whistle-blower?

124
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:58,267
What organization will welcome someone
who tattles

125
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,744
about the internal problems to the world?

126
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:02,327
There aren't any companies
in the world...

127
00:08:02,758 --> 00:08:03,917
that are that innocent...

128
00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:08,398
and righteous.

129
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:15,877
14 years ago...

130
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:19,681
I was exactly like you.

131
00:08:20,677 --> 00:08:21,699
Think about it very carefully.

132
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:25,071
You just have to change your choice.

133
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:29,426
If you cover this up,
I can have you gain more power.

134
00:08:29,863 --> 00:08:33,880
I can bring you up a position
where you will have a greater voice.

135
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:39,637
For example...

136
00:08:39,737 --> 00:08:44,096
you can be the first woman captain
in the press.

137
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:47,716
Opportunities like that...

138
00:08:50,606 --> 00:08:53,482
That decision brought me where I am.

139
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:57,350
Of course, it's possible for you
to make a different choice.

140
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,380
You can give up being a reporter

141
00:08:59,597 --> 00:09:02,487
and live as a part-timer
at a convenience store.

142
00:09:02,597 --> 00:09:04,272
Following your conscience and purely...

143
00:09:05,717 --> 00:09:07,187
Now...

144
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:10,957
you're almost done with the internship.

145
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,488
Don't you want to be a full-time employee?

146
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:15,960
-Ms Song!
-Think about it.

147
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:17,837
Just once...

148
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:19,932
you can speak about one thing they want...

149
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,567
and then speak about 99 right things.

150
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,097
Or...

151
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:30,838
a powerless person
who doesn't have a voice in the world.

152
00:09:37,106 --> 00:09:40,398
I don't want you
to become a powerless person.

153
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,201
I'm telling you this not as a Chief...

154
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:47,885
but as your mom.

155
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:55,642
I saw how someone can be destroyed...

156
00:09:56,784 --> 00:09:58,286
when they become a whistle-blower.

157
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:01,507
Who?

158
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:02,666
Your father.

159
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:09,287
You probably don't remember
because you were young.

160
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:11,457
But your father...

161
00:10:12,217 --> 00:10:14,576
he was a pretty successful manager
at a bank.

162
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:17,807
But he found out
about the president's illegal loans...

163
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,818
and got fired
after reporting it to the newspaper.

164
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:24,057
What do you think?

165
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,747
From what you can see...

166
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:28,814
which is more pathetic,
between your father's life and mine?

167
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:36,862
I've never thought
that dad's life was pathetic.

168
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:39,906
If that's the consequence
of telling the truth, I'm rather proud.

169
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:44,417
I'm going to make
a different choice than you.

170
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:03,029
That bastard.
How could he date some other girl so soon?

171
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:08,047
Hello?

172
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:10,306
Can you come see me briefly?

173
00:11:16,257 --> 00:11:18,179
-I'm here.
-Are you bragging about being tall?

174
00:11:19,037 --> 00:11:20,111
If you came, sit down.

175
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,328
Your face looks good.

176
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:27,914
Did something good happen?

177
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:32,162
There's nothing special going on.

178
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:35,344
Does In-ha know that you got another girl?

179
00:11:35,637 --> 00:11:36,907
Excuse me?

180
00:11:37,007 --> 00:11:38,548
What do you mean another girl?

181
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:41,407
I saw it when I went
to your house recently.

182
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:44,147
There was a long strand of woman's hair
in your room.

183
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:46,297
Even if you're in a hot-blooded age,

184
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:48,232
how could you bring another girl
to your room?

185
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:50,267
A strand of woman's hair?

186
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:52,927
-That's...
-Or...

187
00:11:53,037 --> 00:11:55,607
Are you going to tell me
that it's a guy friend with long hair?

188
00:11:55,707 --> 00:11:58,487
How can your heart be that shallow?

189
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,397
How can you change your heart so easily

190
00:12:02,507 --> 00:12:04,012
when you liked In-ha
for such a long time?

191
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,359
That was In-ha's.

192
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:10,917
-What?
-In-ha came to my house that day.

193
00:12:11,017 --> 00:12:13,407
-It's not some other woman's.
-Really?

194
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:15,447
That's what happened?

195
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:19,287
I just thought perhaps...

196
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:24,616
That was In-ha's?

197
00:12:28,737 --> 00:12:31,487
The more I think about it,
the more disgraceful I think it is.

198
00:12:31,577 --> 00:12:35,327
How could In-ha go in and out
to a guy's room like that?

199
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:38,257
Dad.

200
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,809
-Where are you, dad?
-You brat. I got you now.

201
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:46,857
-Dad, I have something to ask you.
-I'm the one with something to ask you.

202
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:49,577
I heard it from Dal-Po that
you went to his house before, right?

203
00:12:49,677 --> 00:12:52,207
Although you guys grew up
as uncle and niece,

204
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:53,984
he's still a guy.

205
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:57,938
I never thought
that your life was pathetic.

206
00:12:58,197 --> 00:13:00,498
If that's the consequence
of telling the truth, I'm rather proud.

207
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,118
Why are you looking at me like that?

208
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:07,943
It doesn't feel good.

209
00:13:08,597 --> 00:13:10,677
No. It's nothing.

210
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:12,277
What did you want to ask me?

211
00:13:12,377 --> 00:13:15,137
I'm not going to ask you.

212
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:17,998
In-ha! In-ha!

213
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:33,267
Are they crazy?

214
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:35,541
Who do they think they are
to manipulate the public opinion?

215
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:40,280
This is NTS, isn't it?
This is clearly NTS from what I can see.

216
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:42,867
Captain. Don't try to stop me.

217
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:45,717
-I'm going to expose them all.
-You stand aside.

218
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:48,035
I'm going to be the one to expose them.

219
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,057
No. I'll do it.

220
00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:52,802
We have to show them
what public opinion is.

221
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:54,833
It's not NTS but our company.

222
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:58,745
These are the texts between Ms Song and
our second major shareholder, Park Rosa.

223
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:02,114
-What?
-Really?

224
00:14:02,357 --> 00:14:05,573
Yes. The chief mentioned in the texts
are the current Director Yeon Doo-young.

225
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,461
They're our chief and director?

226
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,101
You should've said that sooner.

227
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:14,684
Captain, you can report this, right?

228
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:15,817
Right?

229
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:18,962
Well, that's...

230
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,027
Hey, this is a different story.

231
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:26,037
You have to go through the chief
and the director.

232
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:28,514
There's no captain that can go through it.

233
00:14:29,546 --> 00:14:31,210
What if I give the information
over to YGN?

234
00:14:31,677 --> 00:14:33,727
It's worse because
it will be whistle-blowing.

235
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:36,961
Once you're marked as a whistle-blower,
you can't work anywhere else.

236
00:14:37,537 --> 00:14:40,316
It will be the end of the reporter's life.

237
00:14:40,657 --> 00:14:42,275
Captain, you said it all the time.

238
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:44,823
The blade of criticism has to be sharper
the higher you aim.

239
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:50,617
Hey, but I can't be stabbed by that blade.

240
00:14:52,027 --> 00:14:56,200
My life would be on the line.
My kids are studying overseas.

241
00:14:56,847 --> 00:14:59,252
And it will be a while
until my kids go to college.

242
00:15:01,177 --> 00:15:02,683
I'm still renting.

243
00:15:03,183 --> 00:15:06,069
And there are 37 more
monthly payments left on my car.

244
00:15:07,217 --> 00:15:08,700
Captain. Il-joo.

245
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:12,921
I'm too ashamed to look at you.

246
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,077
But...

247
00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:18,105
Do you know when a dog gets eaten?

248
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:21,525
It's when they don't recognize their owner
and bark at them.

249
00:15:22,677 --> 00:15:24,687
I know this is cowardly...

250
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:30,400
but I don't want to be eaten yet.

251
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:36,689
-Captain.
-Are you able to become a whistle-blower?

252
00:15:37,468 --> 00:15:39,643
Is it okay for you to give up
on becoming a reporter?

253
00:15:40,927 --> 00:15:43,437
Yes, I can.

254
00:15:47,418 --> 00:15:48,997
You can't.

255
00:15:49,437 --> 00:15:50,677
See?

256
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,625
Just keep your mouth shut.

257
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:06,731
By granting these favors,

258
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:08,937
what did you gain for yourself?

259
00:16:09,147 --> 00:16:11,557
All the things you have enjoyed until now.

260
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:12,907
And...

261
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:15,747
And all the things
that you will enjoy in the future.

262
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,467
What is it?

263
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,261
What do you have to give to us in secret?

264
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:37,447
February 2000

265
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:38,387
Is this it?

266
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:41,317
No.

267
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:45,897
Never mind.

268
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:55,477
I can do it.

269
00:16:56,452 --> 00:16:58,805
Even if I lose everything,
I must still reveal it to the world.

270
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:26,867
What is it?
What brings you all the way here?

271
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:32,596
Why are you looking at me like that?

272
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:35,123
It's just amazing.

273
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,200
-What is?
-I had a lot to worry about,

274
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,881
but they're gone now that I see you.

275
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:41,225
What were you worried about?

276
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,880
Just some ridiculous worries.

277
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:59,567
So ridiculous that I'm sorry
for even worrying about them.

278
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:06,477
-Are you lying with the enemy?
-It must be nice.

279
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:10,064
Whoa.

280
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:12,938
Hey, what's the matter?
This is my workplace.

281
00:18:15,449 --> 00:18:17,167
What's wrong? Did something happen?

282
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:21,185
I have something to tell you.
Should we go get some tea?

283
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:23,735
Sure.

284
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:33,923
You're so strange today.

285
00:18:34,097 --> 00:18:35,537
What did you have to tell me?

286
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:39,931
I came to give you an amazing exclusive.

287
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:41,786
An exclusive? What is it?

288
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:45,816
This is it.

289
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:51,404
Why are you giving it to me?
Why don't you do it yourself?

290
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,723
Because I can't do it, but you can.

291
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:00,715
What is it?

292
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:06,575
It's the cell phone that my mom
was using in 2000.

293
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:10,526
And those are the restored
deleted text messages.

294
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:14,357
Take a look.

295
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:17,747
Those are the text messages between
my mom and Bum-jo's mother.

296
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:21,705
Bum-jo's mother?

297
00:19:25,238 --> 00:19:26,537
Restored Text MMS Messages

298
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:41,967
I need somewhere
to avert the attention to.

299
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:46,017
Highlight fireman Ki Ho-sang
in a negative light.

300
00:19:46,107 --> 00:19:47,863
Even his family if you need to...

301
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:50,767
You're saying your father isn't at blame?
Was he interested in promotion?

302
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,987
It's fortunate
that we have a Pinocchio witness.

303
00:19:54,087 --> 00:19:57,207
-A witness saw that he was alive.
-Use that characteristic.

304
00:19:57,307 --> 00:19:59,447
The witness is a Pinocchio, he can't lie.

305
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:01,497
I'm a Pinocchio. I can't lie...

306
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:05,527
To the direction that
enrages the nation the most...

307
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:08,367
You must be happy your father's alive.
Because of the unreasonable...

308
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:12,636
Afraid of nine deaths...
The public's rage...

309
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,707
These text messages are...

310
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,747
between Ms Song and Bum-jo's mother?

311
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:30,424
Yeah.

312
00:20:35,577 --> 00:20:37,267
Just because of these texts...

313
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:42,047
my father became a criminal.

314
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:45,543
Just because of few lines of these texts.

315
00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:49,207
Yeah.

316
00:20:49,946 --> 00:20:51,441
They made it that way...

317
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,337
with just few lines of texts.

318
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:07,194
Oh, no!

319
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:12,396
Dal-Po, your hand...

320
00:21:15,426 --> 00:21:16,266
Are you alright?

321
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:19,007
You're bleeding too much.

322
00:21:47,316 --> 00:21:48,442
Does Bum-Jo know about this too?

323
00:21:50,872 --> 00:21:53,242
Yeah. It seemed like he was quite shocked.

324
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:56,564
What about you?

325
00:21:57,837 --> 00:21:59,127
Are you alright?

326
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:02,987
I'd be lying if I said I was.

327
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:07,344
I'm sure you're angry right now
but calm down and listen.

328
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,467
It's impossible to report this from MSC.

329
00:22:11,132 --> 00:22:12,307
As you can see,

330
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:14,464
it concerns both the chief
and the director.

331
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:18,037
It's too difficult to go through
all that and report it.

332
00:22:21,854 --> 00:22:23,177
So you do it.

333
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:25,037
Please do it for me.

334
00:22:28,651 --> 00:22:30,079
What did Chief Song Cha-ok say?

335
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:32,617
She admitted that all of it was true.

336
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:35,667
But she said I can't report it
at MSC no matter what.

337
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,357
That's I'm handing it over to you.

338
00:22:41,357 --> 00:22:42,623
You can do it, right?

339
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,547
I have to.

340
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:51,287
No matter what... At all cost...

341
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:57,609
Thank you.

342
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:02,707
Thank you for handing it over to me.

343
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:14,547
-Bum-Jo.
-Yeah.

344
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:16,935
Did you ask your mother
about the text messages?

345
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:17,927
What did she say?

346
00:24:18,656 --> 00:24:20,144
Why should I tell you?

347
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,087
Should I give you an advice?

348
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:29,817
No matter what you and Ha-myung do,
it won't really affect my mother.

349
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,386
So don't waste your energy
on useless things

350
00:24:32,477 --> 00:24:34,017
and keep your positions.

351
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:38,457
-What?
-I'm going to return to where I belong.

352
00:25:09,212 --> 00:25:11,218
-Captain.
-Let me drink this.

353
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,187
Yes, sir.

354
00:25:17,498 --> 00:25:18,481
Thanks.

355
00:25:26,406 --> 00:25:29,297
-Who reported these texts to you?
-It was reporter Choi In-ha.

356
00:25:30,092 --> 00:25:32,697
I heard that she confirmed it
with Chief Song Cha-ok.

357
00:25:33,183 --> 00:25:35,067
If these texts are true...

358
00:25:35,556 --> 00:25:38,568
the connections between MSC executives,
Chairwoman Park Rosa

359
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:41,384
the Assemblymen started
at least 14 years ago.

360
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:43,058
Yes.

361
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:46,429
Ki Ha-myung, leave your assigned position
for now.

362
00:25:46,656 --> 00:25:48,870
You cover the story
and report it yourself.

363
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:49,801
Yes, Captain.

364
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:52,495
Jang Hyun-gyu.
Yoon Yoo-Rae and Cha Woo-chul.

365
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:54,731
-You guys come here and work on this also.
-Yes, Captain.

366
00:25:54,822 --> 00:25:56,418
-Yes, Captain.
-Yes, Captain.

367
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:03,327
This is an incident from 14 years ago.
It will be a long and difficult coverage.

368
00:26:03,844 --> 00:26:07,987
We'll be criticizing our competitor,
so be very cautious.

369
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:14,247
Ki Ha-myung. Go see Chairwoman Park Rosa
and confirm that she exchanged the texts.

370
00:26:14,829 --> 00:26:16,105
Jang Hyun-gyu.

371
00:26:16,196 --> 00:26:20,093
Find out the cause of the fire
and see how Chairwoman Park was involved.

372
00:26:20,184 --> 00:26:21,597
Yoon Yoo-Rae and Cha Woo-chul.

373
00:26:21,688 --> 00:26:24,907
Find out how the direction of reporting
changed after these texts were exchanged.

374
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,977
We must report...

375
00:26:27,162 --> 00:26:31,757
how these few texts changed
the truth of the case and shook the world.

376
00:26:37,744 --> 00:26:38,584
Ms Choi In-ha.

377
00:26:42,548 --> 00:26:45,962
Congratulations.
Director Yeon just notified the HR team.

378
00:26:46,053 --> 00:26:48,142
You are now a permanent employee.

379
00:26:51,874 --> 00:26:54,717
He started to the appeasement process
to prevent whistle-blowing.

380
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,503
So forget about whistle-blowing
and report about other things.

381
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:03,103
There are a lot of things to report
in the world other than whistle-blowing.

382
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:10,700
What is this?

383
00:27:12,024 --> 00:27:12,964
It's my resignation letter.

384
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:17,884
Thank you for everything.

385
00:27:25,957 --> 00:27:26,797
Why?

386
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,583
I just told you that you became
a permanent employee.

387
00:27:29,674 --> 00:27:31,186
A permanent employee!

388
00:27:31,277 --> 00:27:33,177
A permanent employee
that can receive all four insurances.

389
00:27:35,777 --> 00:27:36,617
Follow me.

390
00:27:40,985 --> 00:27:43,104
What are you doing?
Didn't you hear just now?

391
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,776
-You're a permanent employee now.
-Yes, I heard.

392
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:47,287
I was so excited.

393
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:49,532
I almost asked
for my resignation letter back.

394
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,447
Are you saying that you'll hand that
over to YGN?

395
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,897
-You'll really be a whistle-blower?
-I already am.

396
00:27:56,037 --> 00:27:57,267
What?

397
00:27:57,564 --> 00:27:59,857
I already handed the files
over to YGN yesterday.

398
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,478
That's why I submitted my resignation.

399
00:28:02,787 --> 00:28:04,596
Are you crazy? Just why?

400
00:28:04,687 --> 00:28:06,677
So that I could make the decision
without regrets.

401
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:09,559
I think it's the right decision.

402
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,346
Just why do you have to go this far?

403
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:14,433
-Why don't you listen to me!
-I'm trying to apologize instead of you.

404
00:28:14,524 --> 00:28:15,744
What?

405
00:28:16,202 --> 00:28:17,887
Mom, you should've done this then.

406
00:28:18,306 --> 00:28:21,217
But you didn't do it and you aren't now,
so I'm doing it instead.

407
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:23,457
Why do you have to apologize for me?

408
00:28:27,002 --> 00:28:28,528
Because I'm your daughter.

409
00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:37,106
I promised myself so many times...

410
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:38,805
to think of you as a stranger.

411
00:28:39,988 --> 00:28:41,277
Since you abandoned me already,

412
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,467
I just have to let go
and that will be the end.

413
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:46,737
But I just can't do it.

414
00:28:49,746 --> 00:28:51,427
I just have to let go of this hand.

415
00:28:54,393 --> 00:28:56,878
But I can't. Like a fool...

416
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:18,847
Where are we going first today?

417
00:29:19,478 --> 00:29:21,222
We have to interview Chairwoman Park Rosa.

418
00:29:21,313 --> 00:29:24,281
We have to barge in without an appointment
so it might get a little rough.

419
00:29:24,372 --> 00:29:25,502
That's my specialty.

420
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,527
Captain wanted me to give this to you.

421
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:33,141
Is this a hidden camera?

422
00:29:33,232 --> 00:29:35,619
We might have to put down
the cameras for the interview.

423
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:40,317
Wow, you can't tell at all.

424
00:29:40,787 --> 00:29:41,910
Let's go.

425
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,281
MSC
YGN NEWSQUARE

426
00:29:57,304 --> 00:29:58,967
I'm going to interview
Chairwoman Park Rosa.

427
00:29:59,107 --> 00:30:00,538
It has begun.

428
00:30:05,168 --> 00:30:09,527
Dig up properly until the end.
If you come up empty, you're dead. Cheers!

429
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:14,677
Dad, I'm home.

430
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,057
What are you doing here at this hour?

431
00:30:18,182 --> 00:30:21,459
-What is that bag for?
-I quit.

432
00:30:27,596 --> 00:30:29,489
What? You quit?

433
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:31,339
Yeah.

434
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,308
You hated that I became a reporter.

435
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:35,199
I did well, right?

436
00:30:36,906 --> 00:30:38,772
Were you fired?

437
00:30:39,565 --> 00:30:41,555
No. I quit.

438
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:47,077
I quit so that I can tell the truth,
like you.

439
00:30:56,265 --> 00:30:57,433
How did you feel, dad?

440
00:30:58,177 --> 00:31:00,557
Did you regret after you quit?

441
00:31:03,806 --> 00:31:04,646
In-ha.

442
00:31:06,203 --> 00:31:07,367
You didn't regret it, did you?

443
00:31:08,522 --> 00:31:09,737
Tell me you didn't regret it.

444
00:31:11,944 --> 00:31:13,318
Tell me I did the right thing.

445
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:19,435
Please, tell me
I did the right thing, dad.

446
00:31:29,328 --> 00:31:30,347
You did the right thing.

447
00:31:31,586 --> 00:31:32,867
My daughter did the right thing.

448
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:41,787
Mom...

449
00:31:45,227 --> 00:31:47,327
Mom...

450
00:32:13,274 --> 00:32:14,842
Chairwoman Park Rosa.
I have something to ask you.

451
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:17,323
-You can't do this.
-No interviews. Please move aside.

452
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,078
You can't do this.

453
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:21,025
Oh, my? Who is this?

454
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:22,573
Aren't you reporter Ki Ha-myung?

455
00:32:22,856 --> 00:32:25,070
-It's your friend, right?
-Yes.

456
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:27,707
It's alright since he's my son's friend.

457
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:36,327
Do you remember the texts between
you and Chief Song Cha-ok from MSC?

458
00:32:36,418 --> 00:32:38,472
I heard about you a lot from Bum-Jo.

459
00:32:38,563 --> 00:32:40,589
But this is the first time
we've met, right?

460
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,811
Yes. I'll continue to ask you.

461
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:46,205
You said that this person in the text
should be hidden.

462
00:32:46,295 --> 00:32:48,297
You asked for this person
to not be mentioned as guilty.

463
00:32:48,616 --> 00:32:49,852
Who is this person here?

464
00:32:50,364 --> 00:32:52,657
I don't know what you're talking about?

465
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:55,237
What is he talking about?

466
00:32:58,674 --> 00:33:01,227
"We should avert the attention.
Frame him in a negative light."

467
00:33:01,327 --> 00:33:02,777
"Even his family if you need to."

468
00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:04,871
Do you not remember this either?

469
00:33:04,962 --> 00:33:07,359
I don't remember. What is that?

470
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,215
"We're fortunate
to have a Pinocchio witness."

471
00:33:11,306 --> 00:33:14,814
"Use that characteristic.
To enrage the nation the most."

472
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:16,127
Oh, no.

473
00:33:16,854 --> 00:33:18,063
Since it's been such a long time,

474
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:20,765
I just can't remember
what you're talking about.

475
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,286
I didn't say that it was a long time ago.

476
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:32,337
We got her.

477
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:34,530
You said you can't remember,

478
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:36,879
but you do remember
that this is from a long time ago.

479
00:33:37,868 --> 00:33:39,018
I'll ask you again.

480
00:33:39,703 --> 00:33:43,474
Did you exchange texts with
Chief Song Cha-ok of MSC 14 years ago?

481
00:33:44,936 --> 00:33:46,727
-Get rid of him.
-Please move.

482
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:07,067
-Did you get it, Jae-hwan?
-Yeah.

483
00:34:07,414 --> 00:34:08,483
I got it clean.

484
00:34:26,725 --> 00:34:28,850
We should meet.

485
00:34:38,097 --> 00:34:39,417
In-ha.

486
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:42,753
I made Bibimbap. Don't you want to eat?

487
00:34:42,844 --> 00:34:45,694
I'm not going to eat.
I don't have an appetite.

488
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,662
I got an interview with Bum-jo's mother.
She admitted that she sent the texts.

489
00:35:04,697 --> 00:35:06,177
Good job.

490
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:09,857
I knew you could do it.

491
00:35:09,957 --> 00:35:12,357
You still have a long way to go,
so stop bragging.

492
00:35:12,457 --> 00:35:14,021
This blunt witch.

493
00:35:15,097 --> 00:35:16,507
Who is it?

494
00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:21,622
That friend from that time?

495
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:24,430
No, sir.

496
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:27,489
It's a good time.

497
00:35:28,435 --> 00:35:30,605
I guess spring is not that far away.

498
00:35:40,297 --> 00:35:43,567
Even though I'm dying inside,
I guess I didn't lose my appetite.

499
00:35:58,597 --> 00:35:59,717
Dad.

500
00:35:59,817 --> 00:36:01,801
I'm going to start practicing
driving tomorrow.

501
00:36:02,442 --> 00:36:03,909
Ji-hee said she'll teach me with her car.

502
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,947
I'll look into government testing job test
and private sector also.

503
00:36:07,192 --> 00:36:10,421
I'm still young so it won't be hard
to look for another career. Right?

504
00:36:11,832 --> 00:36:15,207
I was also thinking about registering
for English lessons.

505
00:36:16,265 --> 00:36:19,437
Grandpa. Grandpa. Grandpa.

506
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:23,077
Tell me. How much do you need?

507
00:36:23,177 --> 00:36:26,567
Are you going to pay for my lessons?
Thanks, Grandpa.

508
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:29,187
It's not a crime to say
what needs to be said.

509
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:32,037
It's a crime to say
what you shouldn't say.

510
00:36:32,147 --> 00:36:37,827
So don't be so defeated

511
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:39,882
and cheer up.

512
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:41,687
You got it?

513
00:36:42,832 --> 00:36:44,052
Grandpa...

514
00:36:44,143 --> 00:36:47,264
I heard everything from your dad.

515
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:50,431
You did well, In-ha.

516
00:36:52,518 --> 00:36:56,177
-My baby... Yes. Yes.
-Thank you, Grandpa.

517
00:37:00,807 --> 00:37:02,707
Did you know about the relationship

518
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:04,930
between Assemblyman
and Chairwoman Park Rosa?

519
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:06,985
I'm not sure. I don't know.

520
00:37:07,076 --> 00:37:08,506
In-ha!

521
00:37:08,597 --> 00:37:10,437
Just sit still.
I can't focus because of you.

522
00:37:10,597 --> 00:37:13,667
-Be careful!
-Be quiet!

523
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:16,067
-Hey, you need to watch out!
-Just stay still.

524
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,317
Reporter Song Cha-ok.

525
00:37:17,407 --> 00:37:19,087
Factory Explosion Cause and casualty

526
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:23,795
Hey!

527
00:37:23,886 --> 00:37:25,278
If they are to go stronger...

528
00:37:30,245 --> 00:37:32,012
Letter of Resignation
I couldn't say what I wanted to.

529
00:37:37,832 --> 00:37:39,104
Whose resignation is this?

530
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,762
It's Choi In-ha's.

531
00:37:42,247 --> 00:37:44,982
Choi In-ha resigned? Why?

532
00:37:45,073 --> 00:37:47,471
She didn't want to be mistreated
because of whistle-blowing.

533
00:37:49,385 --> 00:37:50,913
She submitted this and left.

534
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:54,813
Is it because of the report
she gave to us?

535
00:37:54,904 --> 00:37:57,588
Yes. I tried to stop her
but she wouldn't listen to me.

536
00:38:01,257 --> 00:38:04,108
Are you really going to report it?

537
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,701
Did you accept that resignation yet?

538
00:38:07,414 --> 00:38:08,570
I haven't yet.

539
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,793
I got goose bumps all over me.

540
00:38:16,057 --> 00:38:20,097
I matched the date of the texts
with the news reports from MSC.

541
00:38:20,286 --> 00:38:22,604
Yoon Yoo-Rae. That's pretty good.

542
00:38:24,107 --> 00:38:25,041
Captain!

543
00:38:25,267 --> 00:38:28,668
I organized the direction of reporting
after the texts into charts.

544
00:38:28,759 --> 00:38:30,977
-If we request for CGI..
-That's enough.

545
00:38:31,077 --> 00:38:32,552
Put a hold on making the connections
for now.

546
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:35,585
Why?

547
00:38:36,602 --> 00:38:37,820
Ki Ha-myung. I want to see you.

548
00:38:38,637 --> 00:38:39,539
Yes.

549
00:38:42,457 --> 00:38:44,165
Why is Captain like that?

550
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:46,337
Why does he keep changing his mind?

551
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:47,792
It's so irritating.

552
00:38:51,191 --> 00:38:52,437
I'm sorry.

553
00:38:52,887 --> 00:38:55,637
-I got mad without realizing...
-I understand.

554
00:38:56,147 --> 00:38:58,334
I completely understand how you feel.

555
00:39:00,673 --> 00:39:04,241
Do you want to join me
on the path of a Nitpicker?

556
00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:12,199
The content of those texts,

557
00:39:12,577 --> 00:39:15,368
you said you got them
from Choi In-ha, right?

558
00:39:15,927 --> 00:39:18,953
Yes. I even received a request
from her asking me to report it.

559
00:39:19,044 --> 00:39:20,891
Did you check to see if she's okay?

560
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,494
This is whistle-blowing.

561
00:39:23,797 --> 00:39:24,878
Whistle-blowing?

562
00:39:25,979 --> 00:39:30,027
It's criticizing the chief, director,
and major shareholder of her own company.

563
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:33,907
The fact that she gave this to us means
she's prepared to quit.

564
00:39:34,107 --> 00:39:35,096
Did you not know?

565
00:39:36,997 --> 00:39:40,997
I had a lot to worry about,
but they all disappeared when I saw you.

566
00:39:44,087 --> 00:39:45,358
I didn't know.

567
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:53,810
I confirmed with her captain today.
She submitted her resignation letter.

568
00:39:54,832 --> 00:39:55,697
A resignation letter?

569
00:39:55,956 --> 00:39:58,953
Go see her find out she's really alright.

570
00:39:59,937 --> 00:40:03,186
You have to put your life on the line
when whistle-blowing.

571
00:40:03,337 --> 00:40:07,284
You have to be ready to lose your company,
your colleague and even your future.

572
00:40:10,104 --> 00:40:12,224
Don't think that it's simply reasonable.

573
00:40:17,337 --> 00:40:19,417
-Ki Ha-myung.
-Yes.

574
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:23,306
I know how angry you must've been
because of this connection.

575
00:40:24,727 --> 00:40:27,819
And I know that you want to satisfy
your grudge through this report.

576
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:30,671
But don't be so blinded
by satisfying your grudge

577
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:34,013
that you forget about the things
you must think about as a reporter.

578
00:40:36,029 --> 00:40:37,242
Yes, Captain.

579
00:40:37,891 --> 00:40:39,460
I'll be out for a little while.

580
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,977
Choi In-ha, where are you?

581
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,907
I stayed up all night making this.

582
00:40:52,194 --> 00:40:53,623
He didn't even acknowledge it...

583
00:41:08,629 --> 00:41:09,887
This is...

584
00:41:15,087 --> 00:41:16,139
Let me drink this.

585
00:41:20,904 --> 00:41:24,359
Hey, Captain just flirted with me, right?

586
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,440
What are you talking about? What flirting?

587
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:29,591
He stole my drink from me that time.
This is the same drink from that time.

588
00:41:31,737 --> 00:41:32,947
So?

589
00:41:33,047 --> 00:41:35,809
He remembered that he stole it
from me that time and bought me this.

590
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:37,160
It's 100 percent flirting.

591
00:41:38,433 --> 00:41:40,149
Don't you think he's amazingly detailed?

592
00:41:42,221 --> 00:41:45,267
Or did he steal my drink intentionally?

593
00:41:45,367 --> 00:41:46,722
To kiss me indirectly?

594
00:41:48,247 --> 00:41:50,217
Then...

595
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:52,383
Did the Captain flirt with me too?

596
00:41:53,187 --> 00:41:55,847
-You got one too?
-Yeah.

597
00:41:57,342 --> 00:41:58,557
Really?

598
00:41:59,421 --> 00:42:01,627
-Then am I the only who is strange?
-Yeah.

599
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,492
You're the only one who's strange.
You're really strange.

600
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:06,806
Go see a doctor.

601
00:42:09,687 --> 00:42:11,067
I guess...

602
00:42:12,484 --> 00:42:15,077
Even when I think about it,
I think I'm a little narcissistic.

603
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:18,607
Even though I was taken advantage of,
here I go again.

604
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,542
For a beginner,
wasn't my driving pretty great?

605
00:42:38,002 --> 00:42:42,268
It's not great, but it's crazy.

606
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,907
Every time you had to turn left,
you made a u-turn...

607
00:42:45,007 --> 00:42:47,667
Wow, it'll only be a matter time
until I make Chan-soo

608
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:50,023
a single dad, if I keep giving you
driving lessons.

609
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:53,821
Choi In-ha.

610
00:42:54,227 --> 00:42:56,297
-You're here.
-You came, my friend?

611
00:42:56,397 --> 00:42:58,917
-You're here.
-Come out and talk with me.

612
00:42:59,237 --> 00:43:02,307
-What is it about? Talk to me here.
-Hey, you!

613
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:04,347
Okay, I'm coming out.

614
00:43:05,427 --> 00:43:08,017
Teach me tomorrow too.
Chan-soo, I'll come by again next time.

615
00:43:18,326 --> 00:43:20,026
Why didn't you tell me
about the resignation letter?

616
00:43:21,227 --> 00:43:24,347
Look at yourself. I knew that
you would just get mad for no reason.

617
00:43:24,447 --> 00:43:26,083
You think that I'm getting mad
without reason?

618
00:43:26,718 --> 00:43:29,404
No. I know that you're mad
because you're worried about me.

619
00:43:29,495 --> 00:43:32,375
I know what you're going to say too.
But I'm completely fine.

620
00:43:32,828 --> 00:43:35,927
I'm practicing driving
and I'm taking English classes too.

621
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:39,077
I'll be submitting my resumes again
starting tomorrow.

622
00:43:39,642 --> 00:43:42,638
Your resignation hasn't been processed yet
so hurry up and return to your company.

623
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:44,882
I don't want to.

624
00:43:48,117 --> 00:43:51,173
I'm going to pretend that
I didn't receive those texts from you.

625
00:43:52,737 --> 00:43:53,694
What?

626
00:43:54,582 --> 00:43:56,119
You won't report them?

627
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,240
No.

628
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:01,347
I must've heard you wrong.
If not, you must've gone crazy.

629
00:44:01,447 --> 00:44:03,841
Don't you know what I was feeling
when I gave it to you?

630
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:04,874
I didn't know.

631
00:44:04,965 --> 00:44:07,517
I was so focused on revealing
what happened 14 years ago

632
00:44:07,637 --> 00:44:09,727
that I didn't realize
that it was whistle-blowing,

633
00:44:09,817 --> 00:44:11,607
or what would happen to you.

634
00:44:11,747 --> 00:44:14,080
If I knew that you gave up on
being a reporter to give me the report...

635
00:44:14,687 --> 00:44:15,808
I wouldn't have accepted it.

636
00:44:16,997 --> 00:44:18,357
Are you crazy?

637
00:44:18,578 --> 00:44:22,014
With that you can reveal to the world
how unjustly your family was destroyed.

638
00:44:22,105 --> 00:44:23,243
So why would you give up on it?

639
00:44:26,217 --> 00:44:29,487
If you were me,
would you accept this report?

640
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,967
Even if my life would be ruined?

641
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:33,263
Could you really do it?

642
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:42,667
Answer me.

643
00:44:43,157 --> 00:44:44,766
I'll do it according to your answer.

644
00:44:46,437 --> 00:44:47,737
Yeah.

645
00:44:47,827 --> 00:44:48,955
I can do it.

646
00:44:49,898 --> 00:44:52,637
Whatever happens to your life,
I would've accepted that report.

647
00:44:59,837 --> 00:45:01,397
See?

648
00:45:01,924 --> 00:45:03,247
You can't do it either.

649
00:45:04,256 --> 00:45:06,423
Why are you telling me to do something
that you can't do yourself?

650
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:08,880
Then you answer me too.

651
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,837
What would you do if you were me?

652
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:13,721
Would you just bury this?

653
00:45:17,987 --> 00:45:19,457
No.

654
00:45:19,557 --> 00:45:20,750
I won't bury it.

655
00:45:21,575 --> 00:45:23,567
I'm going to do whatever
it takes to reveal the connections

656
00:45:23,677 --> 00:45:25,010
using other ways than using your report.

657
00:45:26,847 --> 00:45:28,887
What other way?

658
00:45:28,997 --> 00:45:32,182
-What other way is there than this?
-There is.

659
00:45:32,273 --> 00:45:35,413
Of course it will take longer
and it will be hard but there is a way.

660
00:45:36,453 --> 00:45:38,055
So return to your company for now.

661
00:45:39,051 --> 00:45:40,629
Let's look for another way together.

662
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:46,758
But it's such a waste.

663
00:45:48,168 --> 00:45:50,239
We can reveal it all with this.

664
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:58,955
I'm not saying that I won't do it.

665
00:45:59,827 --> 00:46:01,567
I'm just saying that
I'm going to find another way.

666
00:46:20,304 --> 00:46:23,031
I found out while I was talking to my mom
about the texts.

667
00:46:23,206 --> 00:46:27,231
She tried to be a whistle-blower
on connection 14 years ago too.

668
00:46:27,957 --> 00:46:30,629
But because of the threat
of getting fired...

669
00:46:31,299 --> 00:46:33,600
...she went along
with Bum-jo's mother's appeasement.

670
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:38,154
This is Song Cha-ok,
a promising reporter of MSC.

671
00:46:38,377 --> 00:46:40,224
She's a talented reporter.

672
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:41,932
It's nice to meet you.

673
00:46:45,784 --> 00:46:47,191
I think that was when she started...

674
00:46:48,607 --> 00:46:50,728
to be a blower for Bum-jo's mother.

675
00:46:50,977 --> 00:46:54,497
It seems like after she made that decision
she started to get continual success.

676
00:46:55,178 --> 00:46:57,596
The first female reporter captain
and special correspondent.

677
00:46:57,687 --> 00:46:59,083
And even the youngest chief.

678
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,289
Don't you think it's incredible?

679
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:05,125
Yeah.

680
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,041
But I didn't want to make
the same decision that my mom made.

681
00:47:10,087 --> 00:47:11,966
That's why handed the texts over to you.

682
00:47:12,727 --> 00:47:13,877
I know.

683
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,141
But truth be told, I was scared.

684
00:47:19,163 --> 00:47:23,981
My dad was the opposite of my mom.
His life was ruined by whistle-blowing.

685
00:47:25,981 --> 00:47:28,447
-Your dad?
-Yeah.

686
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:32,627
My dad used to be
a successful bank manager.

687
00:47:33,857 --> 00:47:35,217
Your dad?

688
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,287
Yes. This is Choi Dal-pyung
from Loans Department.

689
00:47:40,387 --> 00:47:41,717
Yes.

690
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,277
Loan consultation?

691
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:48,757
Yes, it's possible.
Please visit us. Thank you.

692
00:47:50,657 --> 00:47:53,207
I can't believe it either but it was true.

693
00:47:56,397 --> 00:47:57,963
But what did he report?

694
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:01,597
He reported the bank president's
illegal loans to the newspaper.

695
00:48:02,467 --> 00:48:04,737
Because of that report,
the bank president was fired

696
00:48:04,837 --> 00:48:06,619
and the loan corruption decreased. But...

697
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:09,510
I knew it since he started to brag
about being the youngest manager.

698
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:11,449
Everyone should watch their words
around him.

699
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,630
Hello. Good morning.

700
00:48:14,977 --> 00:48:16,047
Let's go.

701
00:48:19,718 --> 00:48:21,977
I think his work life became
really difficult.

702
00:48:22,622 --> 00:48:25,367
Everyone stopped talking in front of him
and they didn't eat together with him.

703
00:48:25,812 --> 00:48:27,667
He said he felt like
he was an invisible man.

704
00:48:29,257 --> 00:48:33,752
In the end, he thought that it wasn't
a job but a waste of life, so he quit.

705
00:48:34,564 --> 00:48:37,817
But he was marked as a whistle-blower,
so it was difficult getting a new job.

706
00:48:37,917 --> 00:48:41,747
And IMF crisis happened,
so he was forced to stay jobless.

707
00:48:42,032 --> 00:48:44,650
He was in conflict over that with my mom
and ended up getting a divorce.

708
00:48:46,297 --> 00:48:47,917
I see.

709
00:48:49,717 --> 00:48:50,896
But I'm curious.

710
00:48:51,977 --> 00:48:52,888
About what?

711
00:48:53,537 --> 00:48:56,627
Whether the two of them
regret their decisions.

712
00:49:00,797 --> 00:49:03,010
I know. I'm getting curious too.

713
00:49:12,859 --> 00:49:16,287
Recently my son wanted
to slowly start studying business,

714
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:19,339
so he quit being a reporter
and is traveling with me.

715
00:49:22,407 --> 00:49:23,627
How do you find the painting?

716
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:25,567
I  heard Assemblyman Shin's wife
painted these.

717
00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:28,087
I'm not sure.
I don't know much about paintings.

718
00:49:28,187 --> 00:49:30,007
I don't either.

719
00:49:30,474 --> 00:49:32,364
They all seem like a waste of paint.

720
00:49:36,722 --> 00:49:38,621
The purpose of these exhibitions
is obvious.

721
00:49:39,214 --> 00:49:42,523
They're saying that someone like me should
open up their wallet, so what can I do?

722
00:49:42,614 --> 00:49:44,571
I have to go along with
what the Assemblymen want.

723
00:49:45,306 --> 00:49:46,747
Would this be enough?

724
00:49:51,808 --> 00:49:54,656
If our Assemblymen hold exhibitions,
I buy paintings.

725
00:49:54,747 --> 00:49:57,934
If they hold a publication party,
we give congratulatory money.

726
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:01,647
If there's a problem,
we use the news to keep it covered.

727
00:50:03,898 --> 00:50:07,451
Ms Song, you know how much I did
for those Assemblymen too, right?

728
00:50:08,184 --> 00:50:09,326
Yes, ma'am.

729
00:50:09,417 --> 00:50:13,077
But all that hard work is being shaken,
so I'm a little worried.

730
00:50:13,937 --> 00:50:18,112
These days you have to be careful
about trivial gossip even.

731
00:50:19,636 --> 00:50:22,132
A little while ago, was it Ki Ha-myung?

732
00:50:22,223 --> 00:50:24,581
That guy even brought the camera crew

733
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:27,097
and asked about what happened
14 years ago.

734
00:50:27,327 --> 00:50:28,467
Yes.

735
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,187
Since he's not from our side,
he'll be difficult to appease.

736
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:34,287
He didn't even seem like the kind
you can easily persuade.

737
00:50:35,424 --> 00:50:36,737
That's why I'm saying this.

738
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,327
Your daughter...

739
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,657
Choi In-ha.

740
00:50:44,473 --> 00:50:46,977
Can you arrange a meeting with her?

741
00:50:50,234 --> 00:50:51,435
Why do you want to meet my daughter?

742
00:50:53,707 --> 00:50:56,447
You know that she is very close
with Ki Ha-myung, right?

743
00:50:57,347 --> 00:51:00,517
I think it might be easier to target her.

744
00:51:01,614 --> 00:51:02,497
Ma'am.

745
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,247
Don't worry. I won't treat her badly.

746
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:09,997
You know me.

747
00:51:10,406 --> 00:51:13,307
I only make good suggestions
that you can't refuse.

748
00:51:13,844 --> 00:51:16,614
I treated you so well 14 years ago too.

749
00:51:19,973 --> 00:51:24,094
I just want to make another
good relationship, like the one we have.

750
00:51:25,284 --> 00:51:26,747
You understand what I mean, don't you?

751
00:51:30,027 --> 00:51:31,577
Yes.

752
00:51:39,117 --> 00:51:41,647
I didn't know that you'd wear
those rotten sweats again.

753
00:51:42,778 --> 00:51:46,248
I'm going to rip it up or burn it
next time I do laundry.

754
00:51:46,339 --> 00:51:48,106
What? It's perfectly fine.

755
00:51:50,955 --> 00:51:51,940
But I'm curious.

756
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:53,855
About what?

757
00:51:54,174 --> 00:51:57,055
Whether the two of them
regret their decisions.

758
00:51:58,825 --> 00:52:00,135
Dad.

759
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:03,668
Don't you regret reporting
the bank president?

760
00:52:04,063 --> 00:52:05,256
No, I don't regret.

761
00:52:06,216 --> 00:52:09,554
If I didn't do it and hold it in,
I would've died of repressed anger.

762
00:52:10,402 --> 00:52:14,069
So you would've made the same decision
even if you went back to the past?

763
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:16,685
No. I wouldn't make the same decision.

764
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:19,785
What? I thought you didn't regret?

765
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:23,538
I do regret.

766
00:52:23,629 --> 00:52:26,029
After I quit,
I was jobless for over 10 years.

767
00:52:26,933 --> 00:52:29,455
Then you don't want to report it
and live like mom?

768
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:32,345
-Is that right?
-No. I would hate that even more.

769
00:52:33,203 --> 00:52:35,722
Then what is it? What are you regretting?

770
00:52:37,085 --> 00:52:40,975
I should not have quit and endured longer.
That kind of regret...

771
00:52:45,107 --> 00:52:46,665
Although they were nasty and
petty toward me,

772
00:52:46,765 --> 00:52:49,365
I should've endured in the company.

773
00:52:49,726 --> 00:52:53,096
I regret most about giving up so easily
and leaving.

774
00:53:21,705 --> 00:53:23,491
Are you going to practice driving?

775
00:53:23,745 --> 00:53:24,825
No.

776
00:53:25,628 --> 00:53:27,124
I'm going to the company.

777
00:53:31,335 --> 00:53:32,562
The company?

778
00:53:36,107 --> 00:53:39,707
My mom tried to be a whistle-blower
because of that connection 14 years ago.

779
00:53:54,075 --> 00:53:55,355
Choi In-ha.

780
00:53:57,677 --> 00:53:58,955
-Did you decide to return?
-Yeah.

781
00:53:59,055 --> 00:54:01,348
I called the captain, he told me to come.

782
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:03,118
So I'm going to try to endure
no matter what.

783
00:54:03,209 --> 00:54:06,442
Just like you said, I think
I'll have to look for a way inside there.

784
00:54:11,855 --> 00:54:13,055
Cheers.

785
00:54:15,715 --> 00:54:16,865
Cheers.

786
00:54:22,897 --> 00:54:25,427
You need to go over there.
This is my company.

787
00:54:27,476 --> 00:54:29,435
I have a business over here too.
Let's go.

788
00:54:35,374 --> 00:54:39,574
I just want to make another
good relationship like the one we have.

789
00:54:40,718 --> 00:54:42,076
You understand what I mean, don't you?

790
00:54:59,795 --> 00:55:01,005
Reporter Song.

791
00:55:02,578 --> 00:55:03,804
I have something to tell you.

792
00:55:03,895 --> 00:55:05,545
Please let me have a brief moment.

793
00:55:14,249 --> 00:55:17,551
-What is this?
-The texts I received from In-ha.

794
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,545
The cell phone is inside too.

795
00:55:21,768 --> 00:55:23,487
I'll pretend that I didn't receive them.

796
00:55:23,578 --> 00:55:26,256
If I do this,
In-ha didn't blow the whistle.

797
00:55:26,671 --> 00:55:30,099
So I hope there won't be any
negative results for In-ha because of it.

798
00:55:32,505 --> 00:55:33,605
Why are you doing this?

799
00:55:34,313 --> 00:55:36,472
-Don't you know what this is?
-I know.

800
00:55:36,899 --> 00:55:40,236
Those are the files
that can reveal the people

801
00:55:40,327 --> 00:55:41,675
who framed my father 14 years ago.

802
00:55:42,262 --> 00:55:45,217
These files can also
bring you down as well.

803
00:55:46,153 --> 00:55:47,302
So why are you doing this?

804
00:55:48,146 --> 00:55:50,962
I thought you desperately wanted these.

805
00:55:51,053 --> 00:55:54,151
Yes. I do want it desperately.

806
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,022
It's my wish to report this to the world.

807
00:55:57,463 --> 00:56:00,272
But I can't ruin someone else's life,

808
00:56:00,363 --> 00:56:02,253
because of that wish and greed.

809
00:56:04,098 --> 00:56:06,096
Is that why you're giving up
on reporting this?

810
00:56:07,755 --> 00:56:09,015
No.

811
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:13,210
I'm asking you to report it.

812
00:56:19,325 --> 00:56:21,725
I heard that you gave up
on blowing the whistle

813
00:56:21,816 --> 00:56:24,187
and accepted Chairwoman Park's
appeasement 14 years ago.

814
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:26,282
And because of that decision...

815
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,755
my family was horribly destroyed.

816
00:56:32,235 --> 00:56:33,915
In-ha doesn't have the power
to report that.

817
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:37,056
But if I report it,
In-ha will be hurt too.

818
00:56:39,165 --> 00:56:40,095
So?

819
00:56:40,569 --> 00:56:43,700
The person responsible for that tragedy
is not In-ha, but you.

820
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:47,122
So you have to be the one
to reveal this to the world.

821
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:56,006
Do you think that I would report this
for that reason?

822
00:56:56,745 --> 00:56:58,476
So you're handing these over to me?

823
00:56:59,979 --> 00:57:01,650
Aren't you too naive?

824
00:57:01,741 --> 00:57:05,302
Yes. I know that
this is a ridiculous gamble.

825
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:07,525
But I want to believe in my craziness.

826
00:57:08,374 --> 00:57:09,815
There was a moment...

827
00:57:10,253 --> 00:57:12,190
that you were determined to
become a whistle-blower.

828
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,174
You were once a reporter.

829
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:17,380
And maybe you might regret the decision
you made 14 years ago.

830
00:57:17,918 --> 00:57:19,871
I wanted to naively believe in that.

831
00:57:24,465 --> 00:57:25,596
I'm asking you.

832
00:57:26,224 --> 00:57:29,785
Please report it yourself.

833
00:57:34,805 --> 00:57:38,345
In-ha and also you, Ki Ha-myung...

834
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,702
You both are so reckless
to the point that I'm irritated.

835
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,212
Why should you be sorry?

836
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:05,859
Because my mom is not apologizing
or correcting it.

837
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:10,671
Why don't the people believe you
even when you're telling the truth?

838
00:58:11,023 --> 00:58:13,439
They're whining so much
that I'm really irritated.

839
00:58:14,505 --> 00:58:15,427
You're a fraud.

840
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:18,025
You abandoned me anyway.

841
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:21,578
President Joo Sang-ho. You fabricated
this death certificate, right?

842
00:58:21,669 --> 00:58:23,756
Our relationship will end
if I just let it go.

843
00:58:24,926 --> 00:58:26,223
But I just can't do it.

844
00:58:26,314 --> 00:58:29,150
Why couldn't you even believe in yourself?

845
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,423
I'm stressed to the point of irritation.

846
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,065
-Are you even a reporter?
-I just need to let go of this hand.

847
00:58:41,081 --> 00:58:43,663
But I just can't. Like a fool.

848
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:50,701
Embarrassing me to the point
that I'm irritated.

849
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:18,306
When will I be able to see Choi In-ha?

850
00:59:18,397 --> 00:59:21,176
Could it be a warning?
To watch your mouth.

851
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:23,747
I have an informant.
I wonder if we were too reckless.

852
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:25,441
Dig up without the director knowing.

853
00:59:25,532 --> 00:59:29,940
It's so annoying to have bugs in my farms
that I've worked on for 20 years!

854
00:59:30,031 --> 00:59:32,021
I'm going to give the report.
Just cover it properly.

855
00:59:32,112 --> 00:59:33,988
Now that I think about it,
this is a first.

856
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,582
That you added a condition on my request.

857
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:40,713
I dreamt that Dal-Po asked me
for permission to date In-ha.
