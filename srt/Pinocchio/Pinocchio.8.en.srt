1
00:00:09,054 --> 00:00:11,843
Pinocchio

2
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,060
I told Mr Han that you don't
need to pay for the bumper,

3
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,230
but he insisted to take it for me instead.

4
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,930
I forgot to introduce myself.

5
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,460
My name is Ki Jae-myung.

6
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,730
What did you say...

7
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,000
your name was?

8
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,700
It's Jae-myung.

9
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,260
Ki Jae-myung.

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,560
I thought I would cry a lot
when I meet my brother.

11
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,260
I missed him so much

12
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,200
that I'd hug him and cry a lot.

13
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,057
I thought all the tears
I held in for over 10 years

14
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,886
would just shed like a river.

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,230
But...

16
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,630
Isn't that case already been solved?

17
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,700
It's a murder case disguised
as fire accident.

18
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,874
There's motive and the suspect
Moon Duk-soo is on the run.

19
00:01:31,988 --> 00:01:33,388
You know the factory explosion news?

20
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,136
Remember Mr Moon from the interview?

21
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:37,808
You're now looking for Moon
Duk-soo's accomplice, aren't you?

22
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:40,007
You never know, he can be an accomplice.

23
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:42,857
Even if he isn't, he could possibly
know where Moon Duk-soo is.

24
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:46,557
What is your name again?

25
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:52,597
I had a very bad feeling.

26
00:01:58,297 --> 00:02:00,827
A feeling that my brother
would've made a choice...

27
00:02:01,827 --> 00:02:02,827
he shouldn't have made.

28
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:07,627
I was afraid.

29
00:02:11,357 --> 00:02:12,197
So I...

30
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:13,397
My name is...

31
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:17,027
Choi Dal-Po.

32
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:22,097
I couldn't tell my real
name to my brother.

33
00:02:31,897 --> 00:02:34,697
Episode 8 -A Lucky Day

34
00:02:43,557 --> 00:02:45,627
I was thinking about meeting
you at a warmer place.

35
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:48,457
It's quite cold now that the sun has set.

36
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:50,827
-Let's move somewhere quiet.
-Pardon?

37
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:52,757
Where do we...

38
00:03:00,157 --> 00:03:01,076
Choi Dal-Po?

39
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:09,927
Ahn Chan-soo

40
00:03:11,397 --> 00:03:12,567
Please get a table first.

41
00:03:12,657 --> 00:03:14,139
I'll take this call and come right in.

42
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:16,257
Sure.

43
00:03:21,757 --> 00:03:22,567
Yeah, what?

44
00:03:22,657 --> 00:03:23,527
It's me.

45
00:03:23,727 --> 00:03:24,697
Where are you now?

46
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:27,357
It's obvious.

47
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:28,457
At the TV station?

48
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:29,497
Yeah. Why?

49
00:03:30,157 --> 00:03:31,327
Never mind. I'll call you later.

50
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:32,627
Okay.

51
00:03:42,227 --> 00:03:44,097
You must've been surprised
when I called you?

52
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:45,797
Yes.

53
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,449
But it's good that you called.

54
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:52,157
Here.

55
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:53,657
What is this?

56
00:03:54,657 --> 00:03:55,718
It's the bumper repair cost.

57
00:03:56,957 --> 00:04:00,669
Mr Han insisted on the money
without even talking to me.

58
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:03,330
I had no intention to accept this money.

59
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:06,697
No.

60
00:04:06,857 --> 00:04:08,407
You'll need more money
to repair the bumper,

61
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:09,927
but I didn't give you enough.

62
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:17,997
Then let's do this.

63
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:20,397
We didn't give...

64
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:22,625
...or accept each other's.

65
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,197
Ah, okay.

66
00:04:25,957 --> 00:04:28,191
But wouldn't your company rebuke you
if you don't repair the bumper?

67
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:31,680
That's my car.

68
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:34,627
It will be 10 years for me
to deliver water next year.

69
00:04:35,227 --> 00:04:36,495
You think I'd drive someone else's car?

70
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:39,857
What about you?

71
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:41,757
Seeing how you dress...

72
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:43,131
I don't think you're an office worker.

73
00:04:45,378 --> 00:04:47,312
I was a taxi driver until
just a little while ago.

74
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:50,497
We were both in transportation business.

75
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:52,097
What about now?

76
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:58,233
I stopped being a taxi driver
and taking a break now.

77
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:00,723
You're an unemployed young man.

78
00:05:02,357 --> 00:05:03,827
I'll treat you today.

79
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:06,327
No. Let me...

80
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:09,997
Let me treat you.

81
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:11,910
How old are you?

82
00:05:13,257 --> 00:05:14,327
I'm 27.

83
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:16,127
I'm 30.

84
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,227
Since I'm older, I'll treat you.

85
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:19,192
Is that good?

86
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:22,257
Yes.

87
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:23,762
Hyung.

88
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:26,322
Let's see...

89
00:05:26,991 --> 00:05:28,397
They have a lot of things.

90
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:36,227
I want to have Quince Tea.

91
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:37,997
What about you, Dal-Po?

92
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:40,697
I'll have the same.

93
00:05:42,557 --> 00:05:43,683
We'll have two Quince Tea.

94
00:05:51,027 --> 00:05:51,933
Wait a minute.

95
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:01,957
Do we look alike?

96
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:03,957
Excuse me?

97
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:06,897
Mr Han said that...

98
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:08,297
we looked alike.

99
00:06:10,827 --> 00:06:11,657
What do you think?

100
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,357
Do we look alike?

101
00:06:14,697 --> 00:06:15,657
I can't tell it...

102
00:06:18,557 --> 00:06:19,427
We do look alike.

103
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:23,697
We look quiet alike.

104
00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:28,675
Really?

105
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:31,548
Anyway,

106
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:33,357
it was nice meeting you today.

107
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:39,657
Me too.

108
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:41,757
Choi Dal-Po...

109
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:43,497
You seem like a real good guy.

110
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:47,237
You could've just driven away
after scratching my bumper,

111
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:48,628
but you left your phone number.

112
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:53,536
You'll find a good job soon.

113
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:01,497
Can I...

114
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:04,957
call you 'hyung'?

115
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:08,027
W-well...

116
00:07:08,697 --> 00:07:09,697
It's fine but...

117
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:12,946
do we have any reason to meet again?

118
00:07:14,897 --> 00:07:17,025
We might see each other by coincidence.

119
00:07:18,097 --> 00:07:18,927
Alright then.

120
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:41,527
If I met my brother...

121
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:44,257
I had hundreds, even thousands
of things to ask.

122
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:52,220
Sir.

123
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:54,257
Please follow that blue truck stealthily.

124
00:07:56,457 --> 00:07:57,857
How he lived.

125
00:07:58,497 --> 00:07:59,827
Whether he is sick.

126
00:08:00,657 --> 00:08:01,997
Whether he is married.

127
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:19,797
But now that I met him...

128
00:08:20,557 --> 00:08:23,327
those questions that come to
my mind scares me a lot.

129
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:28,827
Why is the man who framed
my father missing?

130
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:31,227
Why is my brother's phone number...

131
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:33,357
in that person's call log?

132
00:08:35,357 --> 00:08:38,357
Is this bad coincidence
merely a coincidence?

133
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:40,557
What if...

134
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,297
If this is not a coincidence...

135
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:48,127
would I really able to handle that truth?

136
00:08:57,827 --> 00:08:59,065
That possibility of 'if'...

137
00:09:00,212 --> 00:09:01,561
is burdensome and cruel enough for me...

138
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:04,020
to look the other way.

139
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:15,227
Hey, man.

140
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:16,871
Who caused the problem this time?

141
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:18,769
Is it the gamecock or the stalker?

142
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,606
It's the gamecock.

143
00:09:20,097 --> 00:09:21,997
That brat is a total mess!

144
00:09:22,297 --> 00:09:24,497
He left his assigned district on his own,

145
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:25,896
and now he didn't even answer my call.

146
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:28,285
He is mocking his superior!

147
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:29,327
Hey!

148
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:32,358
It's because you're acting too soft.

149
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:34,128
Don't let it slide this time.

150
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,597
He disregarded the system too far.

151
00:09:47,228 --> 00:09:48,643
I'm late. I'm sorry.

152
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:49,564
You're late?

153
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:53,557
Do you think being late is the
only thing you did wrong?

154
00:09:53,697 --> 00:09:54,567
Huh?!

155
00:09:54,657 --> 00:09:56,427
You're a reporter not a detective.

156
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,531
-If you're a reporter...
-I have something to ask.

157
00:09:59,057 --> 00:09:59,816
You, brat!

158
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:02,267
It's not a time for you to ask questions,

159
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:03,967
but to be scolded.

160
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:07,230
What do I have to do if I find the
suspect before the police does?

161
00:10:08,527 --> 00:10:09,357
What?

162
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:11,236
-If you find the suspect?
-Then...

163
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:13,439
That'd be a jackpot.

164
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:17,157
Hey, hurry up contact the police
and request to...

165
00:10:17,757 --> 00:10:19,467
accompany them to cover the case.

166
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:20,657
Accompany them?

167
00:10:20,747 --> 00:10:21,432
Of course.

168
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:22,506
It's a golden opportunity

169
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:26,162
to film the moment of arrest exclusively.

170
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:28,878
Wow, Choi Dal-Po.

171
00:10:29,693 --> 00:10:30,956
You've finally did it.

172
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:34,028
I knew as soon as I saw you
do whatever you wanted.

173
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:37,789
Sometimes a reporter has to follow
his sense rather than his superior.

174
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,480
-Right, Chief?
-Of course.

175
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:42,466
You have to pursue no matter
what in this kind of case.

176
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:44,386
That's what reporter is.

177
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:45,786
Oh, you're so... oh my...

178
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,868
So who is the person you identify?

179
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,313
Is he a suspect? Or he's an accomplice?

180
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:53,195
No.

181
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:54,255
He was neither.

182
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:58,458
What? Then you mean
you barked up the wrong tree?

183
00:10:58,548 --> 00:10:59,271
Yes.

184
00:11:00,263 --> 00:11:02,071
However, as you said,
there was suspicion...

185
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,487
so I pursued no matter what.

186
00:11:03,762 --> 00:11:05,202
From now on, I'll keep that in mind.

187
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,502
I'll become a reporter that follows
his sense than his superior.

188
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:09,609
Thank you for your advice.

189
00:11:16,032 --> 00:11:16,862
Chief.

190
00:11:17,592 --> 00:11:18,852
How did this happen?

191
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:20,598
I think we just got played...

192
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,490
by that gamecock.

193
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:24,898
Bingo!

194
00:11:31,092 --> 00:11:31,932
Excuse me?

195
00:11:32,062 --> 00:11:33,772
You want me and In-ha to
do mawari separately?

196
00:11:33,862 --> 00:11:35,462
-Why? Why?
-Yes.

197
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:39,042
Since you both hired with connections,
I didn't think you can carry out the duty.

198
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,302
But you're pretty good.

199
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:42,192
I think you'd be okay to work separately.

200
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:43,259
Seonbae.

201
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,859
I don't think that's right.

202
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,388
I'm still so far from
becoming a reporter.

203
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:49,349
I lack quite a lot.

204
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,027
Even the Captain still worried about me.

205
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:52,648
Why did you bring him up right now?

206
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:56,446
Who do you think will work here
longer between Captain and me?

207
00:11:58,448 --> 00:12:00,248
-That's...
-I'm listening.

208
00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:01,361
Answer it well.

209
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:03,583
Captain, were you inside?

210
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:07,785
Do you really want to ask
such a petty question?

211
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,778
To such a young junior, at that.

212
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:16,761
About Choi In-ha...

213
00:12:17,031 --> 00:12:19,392
How long does she have to work in
a group of two with Seo Bum-Jo?

214
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:21,176
Keep them work together.

215
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:23,152
She's a Pinocchio. You think
she can carry out her duty?

216
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,103
Why not?

217
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:26,752
However, she contributed a lot
in the fitness center case.

218
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:28,236
Is that Choi In-ha's contribution?

219
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:30,581
She can make it because
they did it together.

220
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:34,751
Chief Song could possibly gave her a tip
secretly to take care of her own daughter.

221
00:12:36,318 --> 00:12:37,755
She didn't give me a tip.

222
00:12:38,097 --> 00:12:39,697
She didn't take care of me either.

223
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:40,757
Ugh!

224
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:49,137
No way.

225
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,997
In-ha wouldn’t take it
even if Chief gave her.

226
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:54,027
In fact, I feel bad for her since
Chief Song seems drawing a line.

227
00:12:54,227 --> 00:12:56,967
Hey, what kind of person do you think
she is? She wouldn't show it off.

228
00:12:57,057 --> 00:12:57,907
She'll do it secretly.

229
00:12:57,997 --> 00:13:00,207
Don't you think you're
looking down at us too much?

230
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:01,237
People with connection...

231
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:03,067
-could have skills, too.
-If she had skills,

232
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,540
she would've make it officially.

233
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:05,928
What makes her different?

234
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:09,255
She's no more or no
less than that of a PR.

235
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:16,297
Please explain it to the Captain.

236
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:19,057
That you never took care of
me and never gave me a tip.

237
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:22,597
Please tell him that I found out the
fitness center case all on my own.

238
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:25,307
Why should I?

239
00:13:25,397 --> 00:13:26,797
-Mom.
-Chief!

240
00:13:28,697 --> 00:13:30,157
Call me Chief when in the office.

241
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:32,876
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:34,357
Chief.

243
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:38,227
Can't you just praise me
for doing something well?

244
00:13:40,657 --> 00:13:42,433
I didn't even hope for
you to take care of me.

245
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:44,423
Praise me if I did something
praiseworthy and...

246
00:13:44,653 --> 00:13:46,753
if there's something to criticize,
please do so.

247
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:50,123
Please just treat me like other people.

248
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:53,192
You're a Pinocchio and get
hired with connections.

249
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:55,560
You have a weakness, and you
even get the privilege.

250
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:58,091
But now you want to be treated
just like other employees?

251
00:13:58,283 --> 00:13:59,896
Isn't that too much of
a shameless request?

252
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,178
She's going too far.

253
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:07,553
And since you told me to
criticize, I'll say it.

254
00:14:08,123 --> 00:14:09,023
I still think...

255
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:10,583
that you're too uneasy...

256
00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:12,423
to be a reporter.

257
00:14:21,996 --> 00:14:23,123
That's cruel.

258
00:14:23,853 --> 00:14:24,683
It seems like...

259
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,178
Chief Song hired her daughter
just to insult her.

260
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:38,123
Hey, Choi Dal-Po.

261
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:39,410
Come here.

262
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:40,410
Yes, Captain.

263
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,053
I got this earlier...

264
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:46,883
from Jeongwoo Police Station.

265
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:48,450
It's your brother's phone number.

266
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:49,885
Pardon me?

267
00:14:51,853 --> 00:14:52,723
Is that true?

268
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:55,605
Is this... really my
brother's phone number?

269
00:14:55,823 --> 00:14:57,842
That's right.

270
00:14:59,138 --> 00:15:00,086
Thank you, Captain.

271
00:15:00,186 --> 00:15:01,610
Thank you so much.

272
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:02,541
Hey.

273
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:04,453
Hey.

274
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:07,916
I'm so nervous.

275
00:15:08,453 --> 00:15:10,798
I can hear my brother's voice
if I call this number, right?

276
00:15:11,183 --> 00:15:12,123
That's right.

277
00:15:15,116 --> 00:15:17,483
-Thank you, Captain.
-Hey, get off.

278
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:19,083
You're the best, Captain.

279
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:20,246
Thank you, Captain.

280
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:22,391
Thank you so much.

281
00:15:22,482 --> 00:15:23,342
Please save...

282
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:30,660
Yoon Yoo-Rae.

283
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:32,645
-Yes, Sir.
-Come here.

284
00:15:34,853 --> 00:15:36,608
Give this to Choi Dal-Po.

285
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:37,757
Yes, Captain.

286
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:41,188
What is this?

287
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:42,110
Ki Jae-myung

288
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,538
What the...

289
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,578
Is that all?

290
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,078
Choi Dal-Po.

291
00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:14,098
That note...

292
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:15,808
is your brother's phone number.

293
00:16:17,908 --> 00:16:19,406
Yes, I know it.

294
00:16:19,538 --> 00:16:20,378
This...

295
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:23,112
I had to call all my
connections to find this out.

296
00:16:27,238 --> 00:16:28,178
Thank you.

297
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:32,548
Well, I...

298
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:34,979
I'm not being condescended about it,

299
00:16:35,238 --> 00:16:37,938
but I thought you really wanted
to look for your brother so I...

300
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:40,362
I overdid myself to find that out.

301
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:41,593
Hurry up and call him.

302
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,758
I'll call him later.

303
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:48,656
Didn't' you say that you
wanted to find your brother?

304
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:51,315
It's just...

305
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:52,825
I'm afraid.

306
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:55,778
It's just because I'm thinking,
what if my brother...

307
00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:57,638
wasn't the person I used to know?

308
00:16:57,878 --> 00:16:58,648
Why?

309
00:16:58,738 --> 00:17:00,698
What makes you think like that?

310
00:17:04,408 --> 00:17:05,472
13 years...

311
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:07,433
is a really long time.

312
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,595
I still think...

313
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:28,051
that you're too uneasy...

314
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:29,951
to be a reporter.

315
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:31,898
It's pissing me off!

316
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:34,281
I'm hungry!

317
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:51,411
You said you're hungry?

318
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:53,951
I won't say anything, so
don't avoid me and come eat.

319
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:05,711
Did you order this, uncle?

320
00:18:06,881 --> 00:18:07,711
Yeah.

321
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:09,151
You like that, right?

322
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:15,051
You knew that I'd come?

323
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:17,751
Yeah.

324
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:22,791
Why are you eating by yourself?
You look miserable.

325
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:24,414
You should've called your
girlfriend, at least.

326
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:27,611
Girlfriend?

327
00:18:28,251 --> 00:18:28,966
Who?

328
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:32,111
You know...

329
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:35,829
The person who has a nice
voice, smart, and kind.

330
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,311
That's my GPS.

331
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:56,451
Don't you think my mom is too much?

332
00:18:56,651 --> 00:18:58,151
How is that a shameless request?

333
00:18:58,281 --> 00:18:59,611
Do you think so too, uncle?

334
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:01,281
No.

335
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:03,251
You're asking to be treated fairly.

336
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:05,223
How come she didn't understand that?

337
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:06,373
That's what I'm saying.

338
00:19:09,143 --> 00:19:10,313
Just like you said,

339
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:12,627
I think I had a high expectation
on my mom.

340
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:16,661
I grew my expectation for so long,
that comes great disappointment, too.

341
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:18,413
It's so hard for me.

342
00:19:18,843 --> 00:19:19,673
Yeah.

343
00:19:20,473 --> 00:19:21,813
I know how that feels.

344
00:19:23,713 --> 00:19:24,973
How do you know that?

345
00:19:26,143 --> 00:19:26,973
I know.

346
00:19:27,573 --> 00:19:29,576
You think that it'd be better
before you met her, right?

347
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:32,114
You thought you'd be
happy if you met her...

348
00:19:32,273 --> 00:19:34,413
but she was too different
than what you imagined.

349
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,743
The more you know her,
the more it hurts and ails you.

350
00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:39,913
Right?

351
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,213
Yeah. Exactly.

352
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:45,143
It feels like you're
coming into my heart.

353
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:46,973
Really?

354
00:19:49,643 --> 00:19:51,773
Do you think we can get
along like we used to?

355
00:19:52,673 --> 00:19:55,073
We can schmooze like this
as an uncle and niece...

356
00:19:55,513 --> 00:19:56,613
as a family.

357
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:58,713
Can't we?

358
00:20:00,143 --> 00:20:01,513
I can't do that now.

359
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:18,213
I'm sorry, but I can't.

360
00:20:19,713 --> 00:20:20,643
Do you think you can?

361
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:26,213
Yeah.

362
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:27,643
I can.

363
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,913
I can do... it.

364
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:46,468
Hey this is...

365
00:20:49,113 --> 00:20:50,643
These hiccups are...

366
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,480
How much did it snow?

367
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:25,332
There isn't much snowfall,

368
00:22:25,423 --> 00:22:29,053
but the problem is that it melted then
froze again from the cold wave since dawn.

369
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:31,132
In all probability,

370
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:32,762
I think there will be icy road.

371
00:22:32,862 --> 00:22:36,042
Can't we make about a minute and
half news for icy road accident?

372
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:38,792
If we use trainees and get a lot
of footage of pedestrians falling,

373
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:40,042
we can make it two minutes.

374
00:22:40,132 --> 00:22:43,692
It'd be worth it since it's predicted that
there will be a lot of snow this year.

375
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:51,142
Spread all trainees to get the
footage of icy road accidents.

376
00:22:51,232 --> 00:22:52,162
Deploy all cameras, too.

377
00:22:52,262 --> 00:22:55,892
Tell them to get the footage of
people falling on icy roads properly.

378
00:22:56,132 --> 00:22:57,262
And assign the report...

379
00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:00,262
to Choi In-ha.

380
00:23:00,532 --> 00:23:01,992
Assign the report to Choi In-ha?

381
00:23:02,092 --> 00:23:03,502
She's still a trainee.

382
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:04,702
Just do what I tell you.

383
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:05,762
Why did you...?

384
00:23:07,232 --> 00:23:10,143
Are you trying to ingratiate yourself
by taking care of Chief Song's daughter?

385
00:23:11,632 --> 00:23:12,462
You shallow man.

386
00:23:12,732 --> 00:23:15,062
Do I look like I'm kissing
up to Chief Song?

387
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:18,462
I'm being disobedient to Chief Song now.

388
00:23:18,692 --> 00:23:20,872
I'm trying to show that a
Pinocchio can be a reporter.

389
00:23:20,962 --> 00:23:22,932
Ah, really?

390
00:23:24,732 --> 00:23:25,562
Right.

391
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:26,692
Did you know this?

392
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:28,832
I heard today is Chief Song's birthday.

393
00:23:29,532 --> 00:23:31,412
Hey! Why didn't you tell that earlier?

394
00:23:32,232 --> 00:23:33,099
Did you buy cake?

395
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:36,692
-You said you're not kissing up to her?
-Man, this is manners.

396
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:39,232
Don't twist my sincerity.

397
00:23:43,192 --> 00:23:46,592
Are you telling me
to make the report right now?

398
00:23:46,862 --> 00:23:47,997
-No way.
-Really?

399
00:23:48,087 --> 00:23:49,283
-Cool.
-Already?

400
00:23:49,374 --> 00:23:50,983
That must be nice.

401
00:23:51,578 --> 00:23:52,293
Why?

402
00:23:52,383 --> 00:23:53,313
You can't do it?

403
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:54,323
No.

404
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:55,253
I will.

405
00:23:55,453 --> 00:23:56,383
I can do it.

406
00:23:57,183 --> 00:23:59,171
Of course. Icy road accidents?

407
00:23:59,383 --> 00:24:01,113
Yes. I'll try to make it properly.

408
00:24:03,013 --> 00:24:04,626
I'm finally giving my first report!

409
00:24:07,453 --> 00:24:09,423
Hey, Choi In-ha. You really
give your first report?

410
00:24:09,513 --> 00:24:12,178
Yeah, they want me to give a
report for the icy road accidents.

411
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:13,613
What do I do?

412
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:15,323
I look a total mess, right?

413
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:16,453
Not only a total mess.

414
00:24:16,553 --> 00:24:17,783
I can't even open my eyes.

415
00:24:18,313 --> 00:24:19,563
Where do I have to wash my hair?

416
00:24:19,653 --> 00:24:21,813
Does the police station
bathroom has hot water now?

417
00:24:22,513 --> 00:24:23,549
What about clothes and heels?

418
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:25,132
I'll have to ask dad to bring them.

419
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:27,653
Congrats, Choi In-ha.

420
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:29,153
Thanks, Seo Bum-Jo.

421
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:36,753
What's wrong with you?

422
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:42,453
What happened with him?

423
00:24:45,983 --> 00:24:46,813
Chan-soo.

424
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:48,683
Yeah.

425
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:50,563
Do you have any case
good to report today?

426
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:51,813
Not yet.

427
00:24:52,613 --> 00:24:55,613
By the way, did you perhaps
go to Zenon Square yesterday?

428
00:24:56,613 --> 00:24:57,713
No. Why?

429
00:24:57,953 --> 00:25:01,353
I went to Zenon Square yesterday
and I thought I saw you.

430
00:25:02,013 --> 00:25:03,713
It must've been someone
who looked like me.

431
00:25:04,553 --> 00:25:05,973
Why did you go to Zenon Square anyway?

432
00:25:06,613 --> 00:25:08,283
A near by base station...

433
00:25:08,453 --> 00:25:10,266
detected Moon Duk-soo's
cell phone signal.

434
00:25:11,753 --> 00:25:13,593
Moon... Duk-soo's cell phone?

435
00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:14,553
Yeah.

436
00:25:14,644 --> 00:25:17,023
That bastard only turns it on
and off at crowded places.

437
00:25:17,113 --> 00:25:18,407
It's not like he's trying to tease us.

438
00:25:20,683 --> 00:25:22,078
Shall we have lunch together later?

439
00:25:23,513 --> 00:25:25,820
I have to cover the icy road story today.
Let's have it later.

440
00:25:26,753 --> 00:25:28,153
Okay, I'm going.

441
00:25:33,713 --> 00:25:35,253
-Yeah, what?
-Where are you now?

442
00:25:36,353 --> 00:25:37,453
It's obvious.

443
00:25:38,183 --> 00:25:39,470
Why did he lie?

444
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:49,283
-My name is Ki Jae-myung.
-A near by base station...

445
00:25:49,613 --> 00:25:51,463
detected Moon Duk-soo's
cell phone signal.

446
00:25:51,553 --> 00:25:52,513
No way.

447
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:54,953
No way.

448
00:25:56,853 --> 00:25:57,913
Dal-Po. Dal-Po.

449
00:25:59,283 --> 00:26:01,823
Captain told me to make the report
about the icy road accidents.

450
00:26:01,913 --> 00:26:03,253
I'm finally make my first report.

451
00:26:04,053 --> 00:26:04,883
That's great.

452
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:06,283
What?

453
00:26:06,553 --> 00:26:07,214
Is that all?

454
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:10,483
You know how much I dreamed
about this moment.

455
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:12,683
I'm finally going to appear
on TV as a reporter.

456
00:26:13,183 --> 00:26:14,100
You won't congratulate me?

457
00:26:17,313 --> 00:26:19,153
Are you crazy? What if someone sees us?

458
00:26:21,183 --> 00:26:22,053
Congratulations.

459
00:26:23,283 --> 00:26:24,353
I'll congratulate you...

460
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,818
so you tell me that
everything will be okay.

461
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:28,713
What's wrong with you?

462
00:26:28,983 --> 00:26:29,853
Did something happen?

463
00:26:30,983 --> 00:26:32,596
Tell me everything will be okay.
Hurry up.

464
00:26:40,813 --> 00:26:41,813
It's okay.

465
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:43,113
It's gonna be okay.

466
00:26:44,013 --> 00:26:44,853
Don't worry.

467
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:57,053
Thanks.

468
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:01,053
Tell me.

469
00:27:01,283 --> 00:27:02,183
What's going on?

470
00:27:04,953 --> 00:27:06,283
I have an upset stomach again.

471
00:27:07,383 --> 00:27:08,163
Why all of a sudden?

472
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:10,087
Did you eat something bad?
Should I go buy you medicine?

473
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:11,783
Medicine won't work.

474
00:27:12,283 --> 00:27:15,118
People says medicine won't work for
stomachache caused by jealousy.

475
00:27:16,113 --> 00:27:17,211
What are you talking about?

476
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:21,630
My stomach seems twisted more as
I heard you'll have your first report.

477
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:24,313
What? Hey, you...!

478
00:27:27,183 --> 00:27:29,288
You're not planning to give a
report in this state, are you?

479
00:27:29,683 --> 00:27:30,801
You look quite hideous right now.

480
00:27:31,653 --> 00:27:32,553
I know.

481
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:49,783
Wait. Why the water went off?

482
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:51,413
Is the water cut off?

483
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:54,953
Hey, you can't do this to me now!

484
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,053
This is Choi In-ha from MSC News.

485
00:28:15,813 --> 00:28:17,293
Hey, how did you wash your hair?

486
00:28:17,383 --> 00:28:18,653
The water was cut off earlier.

487
00:28:21,053 --> 00:28:22,313
You even shampooed your hair.

488
00:28:22,413 --> 00:28:23,283
That's awesome.

489
00:28:23,513 --> 00:28:26,283
It's a piece of cake for a reporter
who's giving her first report.

490
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,353
I'm not sure...

491
00:28:29,683 --> 00:28:33,013
what great thing she's doing on this cold
day that she made us bring her clothes.

492
00:28:33,353 --> 00:28:35,183
It is a great thing.

493
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:38,053
Among her colleagues...

494
00:28:38,713 --> 00:28:39,753
In-ha is...

495
00:28:40,383 --> 00:28:41,283
What is it...

496
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:43,983
She is the first one... Oh my.

497
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:45,613
Be careful, Father.

498
00:28:45,813 --> 00:28:48,783
...the first one to appear on TV.

499
00:28:49,183 --> 00:28:52,553
We can brag that kind
of thing to everybody.

500
00:28:52,713 --> 00:28:54,953
What's there to brag about
appearing on TV earlier?

501
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:58,363
We are here to meet...

502
00:28:58,453 --> 00:29:01,983
Reporter Choi In-ha who is going to give a
report faster than any of her colleagues.

503
00:29:02,113 --> 00:29:03,387
Where is the pressroom?

504
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,327
That darn Choi In-ha.

505
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:07,666
She should've done just a
moderately good work. Moderately.

506
00:29:08,057 --> 00:29:10,063
We're here to see reporter Choi In-ha...

507
00:29:10,153 --> 00:29:14,535
You know, the reporter who set the
record for giving report the fastest.

508
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,931
We're here to see reporter Choi In-ha...

509
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:21,090
You know, the reporter who's going to give
report the fastest among her colleagues.

510
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:30,420
This is Choi In-ha's
father and grandfather.

511
00:29:30,591 --> 00:29:31,821
-Hello, Sir.
-Hello, Sir.

512
00:29:34,391 --> 00:29:35,064
Hello.

513
00:29:35,351 --> 00:29:36,901
Father, and grandfather.

514
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:39,391
Hello, Sir.

515
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:41,451
Does my daughter sleep here?

516
00:29:42,591 --> 00:29:44,391
With all these young men...

517
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:45,721
Of course.

518
00:29:46,221 --> 00:29:47,221
Well, but...

519
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:49,521
there's nothing you need
to be worried about.

520
00:29:49,951 --> 00:29:53,091
Everyone is so tired that there's
no chance to do anything.

521
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:54,092
What about Dal-Po?

522
00:29:54,721 --> 00:29:56,121
Does Choi Dal-Po sleep here too?

523
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:56,671
Yes.

524
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:00,991
Right. I guess you should
be worried about Dal-Po.

525
00:30:01,191 --> 00:30:03,291
That guy has a woman that he likes.

526
00:30:03,391 --> 00:30:04,547
She likes Yoon Yoo-Rae.

527
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:07,851
Me?

528
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:09,282
Really?

529
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,639
-I thought the girl that he likes is...
-It's Yoon Yoo-Rae!

530
00:30:13,051 --> 00:30:15,216
Dal-Po asked me for an advice recently.

531
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:17,221
He said he has a girl he likes...

532
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:19,251
and that it's Yoon Yoo-Rae.

533
00:30:21,391 --> 00:30:22,221
It's her.

534
00:30:23,191 --> 00:30:23,968
Yoon Yoo-Rae.

535
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:31,863
She's a very pretty young lady.

536
00:30:33,691 --> 00:30:37,591
Please take good care of our Dal-Po.

537
00:30:39,216 --> 00:30:39,915
Yes.

538
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:51,421
Are you alright?

539
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,451
That's why back then...

540
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:56,555
All I got was a trashy partner who makes
me do all the hard work by myself.

541
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:57,851
I'm sorry...

542
00:30:58,351 --> 00:30:59,651
for being a trashy partner.

543
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:03,191
He must've been hurt back then.

544
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,251
I completely understand now.

545
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:11,651
How did I not realize
when he was so obvious?

546
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:14,445
Yoon Yoo-Rae, where have you been?
I've been looking for you for a while.

547
00:31:15,921 --> 00:31:17,202
Of course you did.

548
00:31:17,421 --> 00:31:18,915
You must've desperately looking for me.

549
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:21,161
We have to get the footage of
people falling on icy roads, too.

550
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:22,151
The car is here downstairs.

551
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:24,821
What are you doing?

552
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:28,106
What's wrong?

553
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,091
First, I'm sorry.

554
00:31:31,551 --> 00:31:32,821
I was insensitive, wasn't I?

555
00:31:32,912 --> 00:31:34,060
You must've had a hard time.

556
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:35,891
-What are you talking about?
-But I...

557
00:31:36,451 --> 00:31:38,695
I'm not attracted to you as a man.

558
00:31:39,144 --> 00:31:40,961
It doesn't mean that
you're not attractive...

559
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:43,723
but that I don't have the time
to pay attention to another guys.

560
00:31:46,762 --> 00:31:48,051
I have someone I like.

561
00:31:50,751 --> 00:31:53,191
-Hey, I think you've misunderstood...
-Listen to me first.

562
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,456
I won't ask you to settle
your feelings or something.

563
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:59,461
Because that's your feelings,
and I'm going to respect it.

564
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:00,391
But...

565
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:03,567
I hope you respect my feelings, too.

566
00:32:03,742 --> 00:32:04,691
Is that good?

567
00:32:04,782 --> 00:32:05,912
What's good? We have to...

568
00:32:07,521 --> 00:32:10,221
I hope you don't mention
about this matter from now on.

569
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:13,445
Let's go.

570
00:32:19,276 --> 00:32:21,291
What just happened to me?

571
00:32:24,321 --> 00:32:25,151
I told her.

572
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:26,861
I said you like Yoo-Rae.

573
00:32:26,951 --> 00:32:28,501
You crazy bastard. Why did you...

574
00:32:28,591 --> 00:32:31,791
In-ha's father and grandfather
is at the pressroom.

575
00:32:32,991 --> 00:32:35,201
Seong-hak was about to tell
them about you and In-ha,

576
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:36,191
so I interjected.

577
00:32:38,191 --> 00:32:39,463
Do you think I did something crazy?

578
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:43,751
How do I look? Do I look nice?

579
00:32:44,021 --> 00:32:46,151
What about my make up?
I put a lot of effort on it.

580
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:47,661
It's amazing.

581
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:49,961
There's a kind of a make up
that makes you look uglier.

582
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:50,815
Dad!

583
00:32:54,221 --> 00:32:56,231
Hey, when is it going to air?

584
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:57,501
Main news at 10 PM.

585
00:32:57,591 --> 00:32:59,178
-Make sure to watch it.
-Alright.

586
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,400
We don't even have a TV at home.
How could we watch it?

587
00:33:02,151 --> 00:33:03,391
You have to watch it though.

588
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,864
You can re-watch it with the computer,
so make sure to watch it.

589
00:33:07,121 --> 00:33:08,191
Where is Dal-Po?

590
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:09,591
Uncle Dal-Po?

591
00:33:10,091 --> 00:33:11,051
Uncle is...

592
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:13,531
Choi In-ha, let's go.

593
00:33:13,621 --> 00:33:15,021
The car just arrived downstairs.

594
00:33:15,121 --> 00:33:16,021
Okay, I got it.

595
00:33:16,321 --> 00:33:18,351
Grandfather, Dad. I'll get going.

596
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:20,751
I'm going, Grandfather.

597
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:22,051
Father.

598
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:25,261
Grand... grandfather?

599
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:26,191
Father?

600
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:31,851
-Mother!
-My son.

601
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:35,821
I heard you'll cover the icy roads news.
It's so cold outside.

602
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:39,591
Earmuffs.

603
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,491
It may look outdated,

604
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:43,491
but I chose the most stylish ones.

605
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:45,301
Here, put it on too, In-ha.

606
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:46,421
Thank you.

607
00:33:48,421 --> 00:33:51,101
-How do I look?
-It's cold. It's okay to be outdated.

608
00:33:51,191 --> 00:33:52,091
You're alright.

609
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:57,691
Hot packs.

610
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:01,221
Hey there.

611
00:34:02,521 --> 00:34:04,791
Who is that badger over there?

612
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:07,991
-You know Bum-Jo Department Stores, right?
-Yeah.

613
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:09,691
She's the Chairwoman.

614
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:12,991
And that guy who looks like a pole...

615
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:14,221
is the Chairwoman's son.

616
00:34:14,491 --> 00:34:16,121
A department store Chairwoman's son?

617
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:18,991
Why did he ask for
trouble when he's rich?

618
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:20,251
I know.

619
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:21,791
I'm curious about that, too.

620
00:34:22,151 --> 00:34:23,591
-Thank you.
-Yes.

621
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:28,291
A department store Chairwoman's son?

622
00:34:29,021 --> 00:34:31,854
New police of hope carries
out duty to the fullest

623
00:34:35,872 --> 00:34:37,551
Hurry come over! Quickly!

624
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:41,351
Icy roads at Han River are obvious. We'll
be over if we don't get there first!

625
00:34:41,794 --> 00:34:43,051
-Get in quickly!
-Yes.

626
00:34:44,021 --> 00:34:45,091
Hurry up! Hurry!

627
00:34:45,891 --> 00:34:46,891
Let's do our best.

628
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:49,621
Seonbae.

629
00:34:50,551 --> 00:34:53,379
We call shotgun on the hills in front
of the kindergarten at Gaehwa-dong.

630
00:34:56,991 --> 00:34:58,051
Let's go, hyungnim.

631
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:06,221
Is she a child? There's no
such thing as call shotgun.

632
00:35:07,451 --> 00:35:09,451
Why aren't these guys coming out yet?

633
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:10,621
Run!

634
00:35:11,221 --> 00:35:13,251
-I'm Choi In-ha from 26th class.
-I'm Seo Bum-Jo.

635
00:35:13,851 --> 00:35:15,321
-She will give the report?
-Yes.

636
00:35:16,691 --> 00:35:17,501
Wear this and get in.

637
00:35:17,591 --> 00:35:18,851
Is this the company jacket?

638
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:20,751
Did I just get the company jacket?

639
00:35:25,221 --> 00:35:26,651
-Great!
-Hey!

640
00:35:26,951 --> 00:35:28,491
-Hurry up and get her inside.
-Yes.

641
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:33,021
Hey!

642
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:36,351
If you say “Ohhh” one more time,
I'm going to throw you out.

643
00:35:36,491 --> 00:35:37,351
I'm sorry.

644
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,691
Did you look into which icy roads
we're going to cover today?

645
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:48,901
Yes. First...

646
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:50,661
I picked the area with the most slope.

647
00:35:50,751 --> 00:35:53,321
The circled area gets a lot of shades
so the roads become icy often.

648
00:35:53,421 --> 00:35:54,731
When did you do this research?

649
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:57,621
My dad is a real estate agent
so he knows the area very well.

650
00:35:57,721 --> 00:35:58,658
I got it from him earlier.

651
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:04,101
The slope in front of
Yeongcheon-dong playground,

652
00:36:04,191 --> 00:36:06,991
nearby park, T-junction and
Seochon Police Station are steep.

653
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:08,221
The cars also slide often.

654
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:09,991
I've never took footage there.

655
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:11,591
You look into it in that short time?

656
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:13,791
I've been a taxi driver for 5 years.

657
00:36:14,221 --> 00:36:16,270
I'm familiar with most
of the slopes in Seoul.

658
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:19,061
That experience is pretty
useful at a time like this.

659
00:36:20,421 --> 00:36:21,251
First,

660
00:36:21,491 --> 00:36:23,274
the point of taking icy road footage...

661
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:25,451
is to get the ideal spot.

662
00:36:26,421 --> 00:36:27,526
The ideal spot is...

663
00:36:27,766 --> 00:36:29,485
A place that many people...

664
00:36:29,785 --> 00:36:31,922
fall down realistically.

665
00:36:32,855 --> 00:36:34,025
All TV stations

666
00:36:34,155 --> 00:36:38,023
cover icy roads as a seasonal item, so the
report itself is pretty much the same.

667
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:38,670
The key is...

668
00:36:39,483 --> 00:36:41,494
who gets a stronger footage.

669
00:36:41,913 --> 00:36:44,263
Last year, NTS luckily
got footage of a man...

670
00:36:44,353 --> 00:36:46,693
fell down so realistically
that they make a huge hit.

671
00:36:46,783 --> 00:36:49,361
That's why ideal spot is important.

672
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:52,331
The problem is that those ideal
spots are becoming hard to find.

673
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:56,386
People nowadays remove snows right away

674
00:36:56,477 --> 00:36:58,925
and the district office installed
a lot of snow removal boxes.

675
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:01,656
So, competing for the ideal
spot is becoming fierce.

676
00:37:04,261 --> 00:37:05,370
We lost today.

677
00:37:05,461 --> 00:37:06,334
Let's go somewhere else.

678
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:12,341
I've told you to look for somewhere else.

679
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:15,611
Why don't we go to the spots Choi In-ha
picked than these obvious places?

680
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,526
I'm not really sure with new place...

681
00:37:30,071 --> 00:37:32,473
We'll have to shoot a few more places,

682
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:34,932
so one of you, go and survey the area.

683
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:36,665
Yes, I'll do it.

684
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:38,148
I'll do it, so you stay here.

685
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,640
I know this are better than you.

686
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:40,571
Okay.

687
00:37:45,122 --> 00:37:46,392
He's being too obvious.

688
00:37:47,222 --> 00:37:48,322
What am I going to do?

689
00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:17,062
I'm Choi Dal-Po, reporter from YGN.

690
00:38:17,322 --> 00:38:19,062
Where can I find slippery icy roads?

691
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:21,162
Try over there.

692
00:38:39,522 --> 00:38:40,662
Why is he...?

693
00:38:54,662 --> 00:38:55,622
Mr Reporter!

694
00:38:58,522 --> 00:38:59,392
Yes, Grandmother.

695
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:01,292
I went there...

696
00:39:01,492 --> 00:39:04,862
and the housing development
road is very slippery now.

697
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:06,692
-The housing development road?
-Yeah.

698
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:07,792
He's a reporter?

699
00:39:08,422 --> 00:39:10,462
I know where it is.
Should I take you there?

700
00:39:10,722 --> 00:39:11,892
Yes. That would be nice.

701
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,222
We were both in transportation business.

702
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:16,992
-How about now?
-I stopped being a taxi driver,

703
00:39:17,392 --> 00:39:18,492
...and taking a break now.

704
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:20,692
What's with that guy?

705
00:39:22,562 --> 00:39:23,392
Did he perhaps...

706
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,792
approach me on purpose?

707
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:41,922
Ta-da!

708
00:39:42,122 --> 00:39:42,932
What do you think?

709
00:39:43,022 --> 00:39:44,562
The slopes are steep.

710
00:39:44,822 --> 00:39:45,662
It's perfect, right?

711
00:39:46,422 --> 00:39:47,692
You picked the right one.

712
00:39:48,062 --> 00:39:49,222
Let's set up the camera.

713
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,692
Hey, there's no escalator here?

714
00:39:52,362 --> 00:39:53,769
It's all frozen. How do people walk?

715
00:39:53,962 --> 00:39:56,122
That's why it's an ideal spot.

716
00:39:57,222 --> 00:39:58,062
It's cold.

717
00:40:03,822 --> 00:40:04,722
That was close.

718
00:40:06,062 --> 00:40:07,272
It was perfect but we missed it.

719
00:40:07,362 --> 00:40:08,892
-Argh, my back.
-Hey, Trainee.

720
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:10,792
You picked this place well.

721
00:40:11,962 --> 00:40:12,792
Yes.

722
00:40:13,822 --> 00:40:14,662
Are you alright?

723
00:40:15,262 --> 00:40:16,092
This won't do.

724
00:40:16,362 --> 00:40:17,662
Hold my hand as you go down.

725
00:40:19,992 --> 00:40:20,822
Thank you.

726
00:40:21,692 --> 00:40:22,522
Hey.

727
00:40:22,662 --> 00:40:23,802
Tell him not to do that.

728
00:40:23,892 --> 00:40:26,272
We have to take footage
of people falling down.

729
00:40:26,362 --> 00:40:27,192
Yes, Sir.

730
00:40:33,592 --> 00:40:34,422
Seo Bum-Jo!

731
00:40:36,992 --> 00:40:38,122
No, I'm alright.

732
00:40:38,322 --> 00:40:39,478
It's alright. I'm fine.

733
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,392
Did you get me falling down?

734
00:40:41,492 --> 00:40:42,322
No. Not yet.

735
00:40:43,322 --> 00:40:45,399
You should've gotten it. It looked great.

736
00:40:45,592 --> 00:40:48,962
Seonbae... wanted me to tell you not
to help the people walking down.

737
00:40:50,022 --> 00:40:52,092
He said it interrupt with them shooting.

738
00:40:52,692 --> 00:40:53,622
I forgot.

739
00:40:55,062 --> 00:40:56,092
Are you hiccuping?

740
00:40:58,092 --> 00:40:59,362
-Yeah.
-Why?

741
00:41:00,722 --> 00:41:01,592
It's nothing.

742
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:02,822
It will stop soon.

743
00:41:14,022 --> 00:41:15,492
Please fall down.

744
00:41:15,862 --> 00:41:18,062
The weather is cold...

745
00:41:24,662 --> 00:41:26,162
We finally got one.

746
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:32,622
Captain assigned the icy
road report to Choi In-ha?

747
00:41:33,362 --> 00:41:36,022
Well, that's the easiest
report a trainee can do.

748
00:41:36,192 --> 00:41:37,022
I'm not sure.

749
00:41:37,192 --> 00:41:40,219
That's for a normal person
It won't be easy for a Pinocchio.

750
00:41:40,662 --> 00:41:42,062
What's so difficult about it?

751
00:41:42,722 --> 00:41:45,546
She just need to get the footage
of people falling down.

752
00:41:45,662 --> 00:41:47,502
It's like sit still under
a persimmon tree

753
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:49,746
and eat the persimmon that falls down.

754
00:41:49,922 --> 00:41:50,862
I'm not sure.

755
00:41:52,522 --> 00:41:54,392
That "sit still"...

756
00:41:54,892 --> 00:41:56,492
won't be easy for a Pinocchio.

757
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,562
Choi In-ha.

758
00:41:57,892 --> 00:41:58,842
Can't you just stay still?

759
00:41:59,522 --> 00:42:01,422
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

760
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:03,892
But students are coming down...

761
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:07,692
I'm so unlucky today.

762
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:10,022
How did I get involved
with guys like you?

763
00:42:10,122 --> 00:42:10,962
Hey.

764
00:42:11,692 --> 00:42:13,419
Did you forget what we came to shoot?

765
00:42:13,692 --> 00:42:15,461
No. I know it.

766
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,862
But just watching them, knowing that
they'll fall, bothers me so much...

767
00:42:18,962 --> 00:42:19,922
that I'm hiccuping.

768
00:42:20,862 --> 00:42:23,002
I can't give a report
while I'm hiccuping.

769
00:42:23,092 --> 00:42:27,022
There's no report if we don't shoot
even though we know they'll fall.

770
00:42:27,492 --> 00:42:30,222
How can we do the news
when we have no footage?

771
00:42:34,236 --> 00:42:34,966
Huh?

772
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:38,462
Huh?

773
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,522
-Oh no...
-Choi In-ha.

774
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:48,762
Don't you do anything
useless and stay still.

775
00:43:03,662 --> 00:43:04,492
Hey Seo Bum-Jo!

776
00:43:04,922 --> 00:43:06,092
Don't you understand?

777
00:43:06,662 --> 00:43:08,062
Take off your earmuffs!

778
00:43:12,462 --> 00:43:13,322
You understand?!

779
00:43:25,162 --> 00:43:26,392
So, they eventually...

780
00:43:26,492 --> 00:43:27,992
giving up on shooting the icy roads?

781
00:43:28,092 --> 00:43:31,562
Yes. They couldn't continue any
further because of her hiccups.

782
00:43:31,722 --> 00:43:33,792
It seems it was going
against her conscience...

783
00:43:33,892 --> 00:43:35,762
to just watch people fall down.

784
00:43:36,862 --> 00:43:38,222
That's why she was hiccuping.

785
00:43:38,622 --> 00:43:39,462
So...

786
00:43:39,892 --> 00:43:41,722
are we going to kill this item?

787
00:43:42,192 --> 00:43:44,322
No. I sent another team just in case...

788
00:43:44,462 --> 00:43:46,362
so there won't be any
problem with the item.

789
00:43:46,922 --> 00:43:48,992
Are you saying you knew
this would happen?

790
00:43:50,392 --> 00:43:51,222
Yes.

791
00:43:51,622 --> 00:43:52,822
I think Choi In-ha...

792
00:43:53,062 --> 00:43:55,492
will cause this kind of
problems again in the future.

793
00:43:55,922 --> 00:43:57,762
Do you think she'll
can become a reporter...

794
00:43:58,292 --> 00:44:00,162
when she can't even do
simple thing like this?

795
00:44:02,062 --> 00:44:03,592
I'll take care of her soon.

796
00:44:10,592 --> 00:44:11,892
The atmosphere doesn't look good.

797
00:44:11,992 --> 00:44:14,222
I think Choi In-ha's internship
will end at this rate.

798
00:44:14,422 --> 00:44:15,502
What should I do then?

799
00:44:15,592 --> 00:44:16,692
Should I scold them?

800
00:44:17,592 --> 00:44:18,392
I mean...

801
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:21,872
Since you don't like yelling at
people because of your temperament.

802
00:44:21,962 --> 00:44:22,962
So I'll do it instead...

803
00:44:26,822 --> 00:44:28,092
We're back.

804
00:44:29,362 --> 00:44:30,722
Hey you crazy bastards!

805
00:44:31,322 --> 00:44:32,362
Are you reporters!

806
00:44:33,822 --> 00:44:37,332
For the next 24 hours, you two go
around all the icy roads in Seoul...

807
00:44:37,422 --> 00:44:40,483
and scatter briquette ashes then send
me the picture of it every hour.

808
00:44:42,492 --> 00:44:43,822
We're sorry.

809
00:44:44,392 --> 00:44:45,222
Choi In-ha.

810
00:44:45,662 --> 00:44:47,762
Why are you hiccuping?

811
00:44:48,622 --> 00:44:50,092
Are you saying that you're not sorry?

812
00:44:53,762 --> 00:44:54,592
Yes.

813
00:44:55,162 --> 00:44:57,314
I honestly don't know what I did wrong.

814
00:44:58,122 --> 00:45:00,332
The road was frozen and the
kids were coming down.

815
00:45:00,422 --> 00:45:04,022
Are you telling me to just watch when
it's obvious that people might get hurt?

816
00:45:04,222 --> 00:45:06,062
-Is that what reporter is?
-That's right!

817
00:45:06,392 --> 00:45:07,382
That's what a reporter is.

818
00:45:08,262 --> 00:45:11,357
If you want to save people that much, quit
being a reporter and do volunteer work.

819
00:45:11,448 --> 00:45:13,419
Or you can rather be a Spider-Man.

820
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,280
The two of you can put on tights
and go around everywhere...

821
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:18,632
providing the world peace. That's nice!

822
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,980
The world peace has come true,
but why am I this angry?

823
00:45:22,071 --> 00:45:23,684
A reporter should save people too.

824
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,927
Reporters should think
about public service, too.

825
00:45:26,017 --> 00:45:27,717
Observing is providing
public service for reporters.

826
00:45:28,887 --> 00:45:31,087
It's public service to make news with it.

827
00:45:31,178 --> 00:45:33,324
To make government workers watch it.

828
00:45:33,415 --> 00:45:34,917
To make the president watch it.

829
00:45:35,008 --> 00:45:36,817
To make the world watch it.

830
00:45:37,057 --> 00:45:38,387
That is reporter's public service.

831
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:48,451
While you guys breaking
couples of briquettes,

832
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:50,641
if we made news about
the icy road problems,

833
00:45:50,811 --> 00:45:54,081
the City workers would have installed
snow removal box after they see our news!

834
00:45:54,581 --> 00:45:56,504
People would've cleared the snow
in front of their houses.

835
00:45:56,594 --> 00:45:58,234
People who walk with hands
in their pockets

836
00:45:58,324 --> 00:46:00,061
would've taken them out thinking that

837
00:46:00,151 --> 00:46:01,681
they would get hurt if they fall.

838
00:46:02,451 --> 00:46:05,736
While you did useless thing by breaking
few briquettes to save few people,

839
00:46:05,826 --> 00:46:07,996
we lost the chance to save
several thousand people.

840
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:09,096
Do you understand?

841
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:11,653
Do you understand or not?

842
00:46:14,596 --> 00:46:15,496
I understand.

843
00:46:16,296 --> 00:46:17,306
Did you do wrong or not?

844
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:18,966
We did wrong.

845
00:46:19,066 --> 00:46:20,636
From now on, I want you
to report to me...

846
00:46:20,726 --> 00:46:22,966
directly every 30 minutes
instead of your supervisor.

847
00:46:23,066 --> 00:46:23,750
Do you understand?

848
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:25,196
Yes.

849
00:46:25,626 --> 00:46:26,466
You can go.

850
00:46:40,366 --> 00:46:41,196
What?

851
00:46:41,296 --> 00:46:42,566
No. I just...

852
00:46:44,626 --> 00:46:46,166
I'll do better from now on, Captain.

853
00:46:50,396 --> 00:46:51,226
Captain.

854
00:46:53,266 --> 00:46:55,326
-What?
-I will go out again to get coverage.

855
00:46:56,596 --> 00:46:57,726
-Right now?
-Yes.

856
00:46:58,026 --> 00:46:58,926
You should stop.

857
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:02,466
-You must got greedy to do the report...
-I don't have to do the report.

858
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:06,466
I'll get the footage just
like the other trainees.

859
00:47:06,896 --> 00:47:09,466
I will just watch and not intervene.

860
00:47:09,996 --> 00:47:11,496
Are you sure you won't hiccup?

861
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:13,096
Yes.

862
00:47:13,226 --> 00:47:14,426
Because I understand now.

863
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:18,466
Go ahead, then.

864
00:47:31,996 --> 00:47:33,366
If she fails again this time,

865
00:47:33,496 --> 00:47:34,526
get rid of Choi In-ha.

866
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:36,066
Yes, Ma'am.

867
00:47:40,026 --> 00:47:42,666
But I don't think you need to do that.

868
00:47:53,696 --> 00:47:55,296
The briquette angels are back again.

869
00:47:55,726 --> 00:47:57,996
Do you join to break the
briquettes again this time?

870
00:47:58,126 --> 00:47:58,966
No.

871
00:47:59,166 --> 00:48:00,776
We will never break the
briquettes anymore.

872
00:48:00,866 --> 00:48:02,026
How can I believe that?

873
00:48:02,466 --> 00:48:03,596
She's not lying.

874
00:48:04,296 --> 00:48:05,126
Look.

875
00:48:05,366 --> 00:48:06,696
She's not hiccuping now.

876
00:48:06,866 --> 00:48:08,196
Just take off that earmuffs.

877
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:10,896
It's such an unlucky day.

878
00:48:11,426 --> 00:48:12,266
Get in!

879
00:48:31,196 --> 00:48:32,066
Hey, are you okay?

880
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,029
Don't touch!

881
00:48:36,566 --> 00:48:37,666
I can get up by myself.

882
00:48:41,766 --> 00:48:42,596
Let's go.

883
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:49,966
Hey, what's going on with you guys?

884
00:48:50,366 --> 00:48:51,696
Did you get dumped by a woman?

885
00:48:53,996 --> 00:48:54,966
It looks like it.

886
00:49:16,766 --> 00:49:19,096
Should I call and check if
they do the job properly?

887
00:49:19,266 --> 00:49:21,366
It's fine. Why do we
have to check on that?

888
00:49:23,096 --> 00:49:26,326
You did talk big to Chief Song but
you're feeling anxious inside, right?

889
00:49:27,226 --> 00:49:28,006
Me?

890
00:49:28,096 --> 00:49:29,026
Not at all.

891
00:49:33,626 --> 00:49:34,806
Where are you? Are you shooting now?

892
00:49:34,896 --> 00:49:37,066
What about her hiccups?
Did she break the briquettes?

893
00:49:37,296 --> 00:49:38,366
She's doing it properly.

894
00:49:38,996 --> 00:49:40,906
She's interviewing
the residents cooperatively.

895
00:49:40,996 --> 00:49:43,036
She didn't break the briquettes
and she's not hiccuping.

896
00:49:43,126 --> 00:49:45,026
Snows falls early...

897
00:49:48,196 --> 00:49:48,976
Seonbae.

898
00:49:49,066 --> 00:49:50,866
-People are coming down over there.
-Okay.

899
00:49:51,096 --> 00:49:52,166
I'm hanging up.

900
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,166
-Did they do the job properly?
-Yeah.

901
00:50:09,226 --> 00:50:10,226
Is that right?

902
00:50:10,726 --> 00:50:11,996
She's doing it properly?

903
00:50:13,466 --> 00:50:17,226
She's not breaking the briquettes
or hiccuping at all...

904
00:50:18,026 --> 00:50:20,176
I thought she can't do it
since she's a Pinocchio,

905
00:50:20,266 --> 00:50:21,126
but she's doing well.

906
00:50:21,596 --> 00:50:22,876
There's nothing to worried about.

907
00:50:22,966 --> 00:50:24,426
Yes, keep up the good work.

908
00:50:26,696 --> 00:50:27,826
Choi In-ha and Seo Bum-Jo

909
00:50:27,966 --> 00:50:29,966
are covering the story
without any problems.

910
00:50:30,966 --> 00:50:31,688
So?

911
00:50:32,826 --> 00:50:34,259
I think there's no reason
to get rid of her.

912
00:50:34,896 --> 00:50:37,336
Do you think this problem won't
happen again in the future?

913
00:50:37,426 --> 00:50:38,276
As a reporter,

914
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:40,500
there are many times she need to
give up her conscience for news.

915
00:50:41,226 --> 00:50:44,466
Don't you think it will be too slow to
teach her and have her understand

916
00:50:44,766 --> 00:50:45,996
every time that happens?

917
00:50:46,496 --> 00:50:48,666
I also learned a lot
from Choi In-ha today.

918
00:50:50,396 --> 00:50:53,666
As a reporter, we shouldn't break
the briquettes in that situation.

919
00:50:53,996 --> 00:50:55,196
But also as a reporter,

920
00:50:55,396 --> 00:50:58,396
I think we have to, of course,
concerned about what Choi In-ha did.

921
00:50:58,996 --> 00:51:00,806
If we just get the footage
without hesitating,

922
00:51:00,896 --> 00:51:01,966
we're not making news

923
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,166
but a tabloid.

924
00:51:04,326 --> 00:51:05,866
Are you trying to lecture me?

925
00:51:06,726 --> 00:51:07,566
No.

926
00:51:07,826 --> 00:51:09,926
I'm saying that you
should praise Choi In-ha.

927
00:51:10,866 --> 00:51:12,526
You should praise her
for doing a good thing.

928
00:51:17,826 --> 00:51:20,366
I think Choi In-ha might be slow,

929
00:51:21,026 --> 00:51:22,966
but she'll become quite
a useful reporter.

930
00:51:44,126 --> 00:51:45,776
You'll go to the police
station directly, right?

931
00:51:45,866 --> 00:51:46,696
Yeah.

932
00:51:49,426 --> 00:51:50,566
Aren't you going to get in?

933
00:51:52,896 --> 00:51:54,926
I want us to go around
separately for a while.

934
00:51:55,896 --> 00:51:57,966
This kind of situation
is quite burdensome.

935
00:52:00,796 --> 00:52:01,626
Alright.

936
00:52:01,826 --> 00:52:03,796
You go first. I'll take the next one.

937
00:52:04,626 --> 00:52:05,466
Okay then.

938
00:52:12,266 --> 00:52:13,496
Seriously.

939
00:52:14,426 --> 00:52:15,266
Oh my goodness.

940
00:52:21,226 --> 00:52:22,466
Hyu.. hyung.

941
00:52:24,996 --> 00:52:25,866
Choi Dal-Po.

942
00:52:26,196 --> 00:52:27,266
Were you a reporter here?

943
00:52:28,226 --> 00:52:29,066
Excuse me?

944
00:52:35,096 --> 00:52:35,926
Yes.

945
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:40,726
It's a good job enough to brag about,
but why did you lie?

946
00:52:43,896 --> 00:52:45,096
Why did you...

947
00:52:48,696 --> 00:52:49,696
come to my house?

948
00:52:51,966 --> 00:52:52,826
Why did you...

949
00:52:53,596 --> 00:52:54,705
peek into my car?

950
00:52:57,226 --> 00:52:59,336
I was covering a story and saw
your truck by coincidence.

951
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,466
So I was glad to see...

952
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:02,996
Don't ever...

953
00:53:03,526 --> 00:53:05,676
call me 'hyung' anymore
and don't even come near me!

954
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:06,472
All the reporters...

955
00:53:07,626 --> 00:53:08,626
are horrifying...

956
00:53:10,366 --> 00:53:11,466
and nauseating.

957
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,396
It doesn't make sense.

958
00:53:47,696 --> 00:53:49,406
I only drank half glass of beer.
Just a half.

959
00:53:49,496 --> 00:53:51,476
But you're revoking my license?

960
00:53:51,566 --> 00:53:54,596
Look here. It came out as 0.107.

961
00:53:55,396 --> 00:53:58,366
Your license revoked since it's over 0.1.

962
00:53:58,696 --> 00:53:59,966
I said I didn't.

963
00:54:00,096 --> 00:54:01,566
I really didn't.

964
00:54:01,666 --> 00:54:02,496
I understand...

965
00:54:02,626 --> 00:54:04,136
so let's go to the station and talk.

966
00:54:04,226 --> 00:54:05,696
-Okay, let's go.
-Open the door.

967
00:54:06,766 --> 00:54:07,596
Wait a minute.

968
00:54:07,896 --> 00:54:08,676
My cell phone.

969
00:54:08,766 --> 00:54:10,726
Let me get my cell... my cell phone.

970
00:54:12,896 --> 00:54:14,166
Hurry up. Hurry.

971
00:54:22,566 --> 00:54:24,566
Hey, come here! Stop right there!

972
00:54:42,026 --> 00:54:44,296
Let's shoot for 10 more
minutes and wrap it up.

973
00:54:44,866 --> 00:54:46,226
We've got enough.

974
00:54:46,766 --> 00:54:47,596
Yes.

975
00:54:49,066 --> 00:54:49,896
By the way, seonbae,

976
00:54:50,326 --> 00:54:53,666
don't you hesitate like us
when you get footage of an accident?

977
00:54:54,526 --> 00:54:56,066
Of course I did. How could I not?

978
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:57,826
But a reporter

979
00:54:58,066 --> 00:55:00,631
gets a footage as much
as you move and wait.

980
00:55:01,796 --> 00:55:04,466
It was so hard that the more I did it,

981
00:55:04,966 --> 00:55:07,060
I began to wish for really bad things.

982
00:55:08,426 --> 00:55:09,266
Seonbae.

983
00:55:09,426 --> 00:55:10,766
I think he's going to fall down.

984
00:55:17,626 --> 00:55:19,706
If it's an accident
going to happen anyway,

985
00:55:19,796 --> 00:55:23,526
I wish to be lucky enough for
it to happen before my eyes.

986
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:25,576
Have you been that lucky before?

987
00:55:25,766 --> 00:55:27,666
No. It hasn't happened once yet.

988
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:41,766
Don't come. Don't come.

989
00:55:45,626 --> 00:55:46,896
4134. 4134.

990
00:55:47,426 --> 00:55:48,926
Stop! Stop the car!

991
00:55:51,226 --> 00:55:52,326
Stop to the side.

992
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:53,726
Stop the car! Hurry up!

993
00:56:01,266 --> 00:56:02,866
No left-turn signal

994
00:56:17,296 --> 00:56:18,166
What is that sound?

995
00:56:25,996 --> 00:56:26,926
Is it an accident?

996
00:56:38,426 --> 00:56:39,796
-Seonbae!
-I'm shooting.

997
00:56:45,826 --> 00:56:47,126
It's dangerous!

998
00:57:38,926 --> 00:57:40,296
-No!
-No!

999
00:58:11,926 --> 00:58:12,926
Drag him.

1000
00:58:13,726 --> 00:58:15,026
Get him! Get him.

1001
00:58:22,626 --> 00:58:23,696
Are you okay, Ha-myung?

1002
00:58:28,466 --> 00:58:29,896
I'm fine.

1003
00:58:32,866 --> 00:58:34,696
What... What a relief, Ha-myung.

1004
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:37,596
I'm glad you're safe.

1005
00:58:41,026 --> 00:58:41,866
Mister!

1006
00:58:42,466 --> 00:58:43,366
Mister!

1007
00:58:44,366 --> 00:58:45,426
Wake up, please!

1008
00:58:45,866 --> 00:58:48,026
Mister! Mister!

1009
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,284
We have a real exclusive.

1010
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:12,508
It depends on how we expand.

1011
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:14,706
-Why does it have to be Bum-Jo and not me?
-Yes. I understand.

1012
00:59:14,796 --> 00:59:16,606
-My son, Seo Bum-Jo?
-Don't you think...

1013
00:59:16,696 --> 00:59:18,119
it's enough to set the table?

1014
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:20,381
He came and asked me if I was alright.

1015
00:59:20,472 --> 00:59:22,823
I heard you met your brother.
Did you find out anything?

1016
00:59:23,866 --> 00:59:24,583
What is that?

1017
00:59:24,996 --> 00:59:26,041
Will you be okay by yourself?
