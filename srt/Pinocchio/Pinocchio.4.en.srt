1
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,530
Pinocchio

2
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,610
Leave it.

3
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,860
-I'm going to burn them all.
-Those kids...

4
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,370
You decided to give up?

5
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,730
Your mom, and reporter.

6
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:49,870
Yeah.

7
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,910
Why do you keep trying to lie
when you know you can't?

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,910
What should I do then?

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,430
I made a promise to my dad.

10
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,140
I can't waste the rest of my 20s
as an unemployed bum.

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,400
I can't...

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,300
I'm too ashamed to face you.

13
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,940
Me?

14
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,030
Do you think I'm stupid?

15
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,100
An idiot?

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,800
I know you obviously gave up
on college because of me.

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,200
Do you think it's comfortable for me
to live off the money you earn? I...

18
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,460
I have conscience, too.

19
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,000
So throw these all.

20
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,460
I feel much better knowing
that this is over.

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,600
You're lying.

22
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,450
Fine.

23
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,750
That was a lie.

24
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,610
It's a lie, but what can I do about it?

25
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,700
I don't need all these!

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,770
Let go of me.

27
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,860
That bastard...

28
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,620
I need it.

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,400
What?

30
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,360
These books...

31
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,960
I need it.

32
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,000
Why do you need these books?

33
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
You're going to... sell them?

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,920
No.

35
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,630
I suddenly want to become a reporter.

36
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,240
Just like you.

37
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,870
What?

38
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,080
Let's be a reporter together, In-ha.

39
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,240
Alright.

40
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,540
It stops.

41
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,950
Your hiccups.

42
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,380
Episode 4 - Romeo and Juliet

43
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,380
I'll let you borrow all
my notes and books.

44
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,950
I organize them while
I was preparing for 3 years.

45
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,130
Consider yourself lucky.

46
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,530
There are many people in my study group
who want to pay for my notes.

47
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,300
Yeah, thank you so much.

48
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,910
By the way, what about grandfather?

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,120
Even you can secretly study
to become a reporter,

50
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,560
when you become a one,
he'll find out that you're smart.

51
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,340
He's going to be shocked and collapse.

52
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,680
Do you think I can become a reporter
once I said I want to?

53
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,160
Have you ever heard
a taxi driver becomes a reporter?

54
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,020
Why not? Driver and reporter...

55
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,740
They're only one syllable difference.

56
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,640
Going down.

57
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,420
It's fine.

58
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,370
Possibility of me become
a reporter is zero,

59
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,300
so you don't need to worry in advance.

60
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,390
I just need to prepare secretly
from my father.

61
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,180
Are you going to quit
being a taxi driver?

62
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,690
Are you crazy? It's my livelihood.

63
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,110
I'll make some time to study,

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,020
-since my possibility is zero.
-No.

65
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,140
It's half and half.

66
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,650
-What is?
-Whether it's you, who's a taxi driver

67
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,500
or me, who's Pinocchio, the probability to
become a reporter is not zero but 50 percent.

68
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,760
It's whether can make it, or not.
One of the two.

69
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,440
You're right.

70
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,480
It's 50 percent because
there are two options.

71
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,090
Right.

72
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,740
Grandpa.

73
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,540
I'd be in trouble if I tell dad
that I don't give up

74
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,930
on being a reporter, right?

75
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,540
What's the use of saying it again?

76
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,010
You'll just run out of breath.

77
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,050
Then how do I get his permission?

78
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,130
Why do you need permission?

79
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,070
If you've made a decision,
you just have to do it.

80
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,680
But still...

81
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,350
It's harder to put your thoughts
into someone else's head,

82
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,860
than trying to put someone else's money
into your own pocket.

83
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,640
Even parents can't do it.

84
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,050
Here.

85
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,550
Dad.

86
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,990
You must've worried a lot.

87
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,310
I didn't pass the final interview.

88
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,960
It was so close,

89
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,060
but I have something to tell you.

90
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,790
Please don't be shocked and listen to me.

91
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,290
Hyungnim, let's talk privately.

92
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,250
You want to talk with Dal-Po?

93
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,780
Not In-ha?

94
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,050
Hurry and come out.

95
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,750
Yes.

96
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,100
Why uncle? Not me?

97
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,720
I'm not sure.

98
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,340
Don't worry. I'll talk to him for you.

99
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,000
But...

100
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,880
Why would uncle talk
to my father about me?

101
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,030
Grandpa, is it only strange to me?

102
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,960
Why am I excluded?

103
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,630
Sir.

104
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,490
In-ha wants to defy
to be a reporter again.

105
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,180
In-ha made up her mind
to give up because of you,

106
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,750
but she can't, I guess.

107
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,400
You know, there's a saying

108
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,490
that says "It's harder to put your
thoughts into someone else's head"

109
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,839
"`than trying to put someone else's money
into your pocket."

110
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,880
I didn't call you to talk about that.

111
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,670
Sorry?

112
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,173
I saw the two of you
on the rooftop earlier.

113
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,590
-That's...
-Just like last time.

114
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,290
If my hunch is correct,

115
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,710
it seems like you
have feelings for In-ha.

116
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,510
Do I get it wrong again?

117
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,720
Does In-ha, too?

118
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,560
No, In-ha doesn't.

119
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,575
She doesn't even know about my feeling.

120
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,957
When did it start?

121
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,790
I'm not really sure.

122
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,226
Only that it's been a long time.

123
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,298
In-ha...

124
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,200
is my one and only precious daughter.

125
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,870
She's the most beautiful girl
in the world, for me.

126
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,400
So, I don't want her to get hurt

127
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,720
and I want her to live
happily being treated well.

128
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,680
I understand.

129
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,030
So whoever came as In-ha's
potential spouse, I won't be satisfied.

130
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,662
Just like any other dad in the world.

131
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,990
Even if she brings someone
who's better than Im Mong Ryong,

132
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
I'd still nitpick and argue against him.

133
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,270
Moreover you...

134
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,450
You...

135
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,100
I know I lack many things.

136
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,020
I'm just a random orphan...

137
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,987
have no money nor academic
background to be proud of.

138
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,990
I know very well
that I'm having a preposterous feeling.

139
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,950
That's why I...

140
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,960
I've never been greedy about it.

141
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,050
And I'll keep it that way.

142
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,710
-Dal-Po...
-What you're worried about

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,060
will not happen.

144
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,847
For me, this family comes first.

145
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,950
I will never do anything to break this.

146
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,940
I'll settle my feeling,
so please don't worry.

147
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,580
Thanks.

148
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,140
Dad, why did you leave me
who's directly involved and talk to uncle?

149
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,850
So dirty. Brush your teeth first
before talking to me, you brat.

150
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,920
No. Talk to me now.

151
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,080
-Dad, I can't keep my promise...
-In-ha...

152
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,290
is my one and only precious daughter.

153
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,170
She's the most beautiful girl
in the world, for me.

154
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,840
It's harder to put your thoughts
into someone else's head...

155
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,290
So, I don't want her to get hurt

156
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,990
and I want her to live happily

157
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,300
-being treated well.
-Dad. Look at me.

158
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,520
You're listening, right?

159
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,740
So, I'd like you to respect my decision.

160
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,580
Stop talking. Go inside.
It's embarrassing.

161
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,810
Embarrassing? Who?
Me? What wrong with me?

162
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,130
-Everything about you!
-Dad.

163
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,160
-I really want to be a reporter.
-Do it. Just do it!

164
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,670
Really? Really?

165
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,820
Did you hear that, uncle?
I got his permission.

166
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,880
I said brush your teeth first
before you talk!

167
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,220
Hey, I think you should get it replaced.

168
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,110
Are you sure you won't get it repaired?

169
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,350
It's alright.

170
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,710
The bumpers are there to be crushed.

171
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Darn, you carefree brat.

172
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,070
Come on and get it.

173
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,050
You should be able to get $100 easily.

174
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,680
-I know.
-This kid.

175
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,480
Oh and Jae-myung.

176
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,570
You know the waste disposal
facility you mentioned before?

177
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,340
The demolition date has been set.

178
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,420
Really?

179
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,710
-When is it?
-Fifth of next month.

180
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,280
The work will use blasting powder.

181
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,870
-Do you still want to do it?
-Yes.

182
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,040
Please let me do it.

183
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,200
You might hurt your back
because it's dangerous.

184
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,880
Anyway, keep that day open.

185
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,850
Thank you.

186
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,470
Hey.

187
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
There's a rumor that the
place was haunted.

188
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,260
Aren't you scared?

189
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,410
-Haunted?
-Yeah.

190
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
I hope I can see my dad,

191
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,260
even he's a ghost.

192
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,820
Dal-Po, come here.

193
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,440
Why?

194
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,660
Read this.

195
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,980
What is this?

196
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,900
YNG Vacancy Information?

197
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,290
Yeah. It's the last TV
station for this year.

198
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,290
No education needed.

199
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,080
Their decision are based on written test,
interview, camera test and debate.

200
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,130
It's a perfect place for a taxi driver
like you and a Pinocchio like me.

201
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,180
A blind test.

202
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,240
I didn't know there's a
place like this too...

203
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,440
You're planning to hide
that you're Pinocchio?

204
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,170
-Yeah.
-Do you think that would work?

205
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,720
If they just don't ask,
I can hold out without hiccuping.

206
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,790
You can start with these books
for the writing test.

207
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,160
Will one month be enough
for you to read them all?

208
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,950
I'm not sure.

209
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,610
But I think one week will be enough.

210
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,082
Hey, don't talk nonsense.
How can you read these in a week?

211
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,270
Purified water, decyl glucoside, glycerin,

212
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,220
betaine, sodium chloride,
citric acid, lactoperoxidase,

213
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,360
limonene, and then...

214
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,680
What are you doing?

215
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,098
Shampoo ingredients I memorized
while brushing my teeth, since I'm bored.

216
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,260
When it comes to memorizing, I'm faster
than anyone else, so don't worry.

217
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,360
One week is enough.

218
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,500
Well, it might be possible
since you did memorize

219
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,157
the entire books
in the library eight years ago.

220
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,340
This is the note I told you before.

221
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,562
These are the sample
questions I gathered.

222
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,227
These are newspaper columns I gathered.

223
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,910
Here are some more.

224
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,110
So, I won't be satisfied with whoever
came as In-ha's potential spouse.

225
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,880
Just like any other dad in the world.

226
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,730
Moreover you..

227
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,130
I know very well
that I'm having a preposterous feeling.

228
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,404
That's why I...

229
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,338
I've never been greedy about it.

230
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,146
And I'll keep it that way.

231
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,860
The Foreign Minister of France,
Laurent Fabius...

232
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,880
The Foreign Minister of France,
Laurent Fabius...

233
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,260
The Foreign Minister of France,
Laurent Fabius...

234
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,840
France submit the UN Security...

235
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,870
-France submit the UN Security...
-France submit the UN Security...

236
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,440
Pull it wide. Wide!

237
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,660
- Council resolution.
- UN Security Council resolution.

238
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,770
Press Information Research

239
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,680
Sir, I want to buy this book please.

240
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,130
But Sir, that's a magazine
young people read.

241
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,360
I know.

242
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,720
Dal-Po?

243
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,300
Do you have some time right now?

244
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,620
Father, wait a minute.

245
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,840
Wait a minute, father. Wait...

246
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,390
Father, why here instead of a barbershop?

247
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,902
Just do as I say. Hurry up.

248
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,940
Come here and sit down.

249
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,170
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

250
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,241
-How would you like it?
-Yes.

251
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,800
Clean...

252
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,620
and tidy look.

253
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:08,680
Give a dandy two block cut
to make it look active.

254
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,880
Styling by keeping the hair texture.

255
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:19,070
As for the color ash brown.

256
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,650
Do you think you can do that?

257
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,580
Pardon me?

258
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,740
-Yes, I can.
-I leave him to you.

259
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,380
-Sure.
-Father...

260
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,040
Just be quiet.

261
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,040
From 2013 FW collection,
the charcoal Grey,

262
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,000
color minimum two button suit.

263
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Solid color tie.

264
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,930
Okay. Complete dandy man look

265
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,440
by matching with black
antique leather shoes.

266
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,860
Oh, my!

267
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,280
Who are you?

268
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,730
One, two.

269
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,060
You're too nervous.

270
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,120
Smile.

271
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,480
Let's start.

272
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,120
What's wrong?

273
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,870
Father.

274
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,820
Are you alright?

275
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
What do you mean?

276
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,684
Seeing me like this,
I don't look like your son anymore.

277
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,030
You are my son.

278
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,790
Look.

279
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,690
You look just  like me.

280
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,150
You...

281
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,120
look just  like me...

282
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,690
That you're good enough to make a living,

283
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,425
just with your face.

284
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,020
So, what I'm saying is,
don't hide things...

285
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:17,570
just because you're thinking about me.

286
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,827
What would I be hiding?

287
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,690
You don't have to lie.

288
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,140
I know...

289
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,250
that you're hiding yourself...

290
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,280
and pretend to be my son...

291
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,400
because you were thinking about me.

292
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,920
-Father.
-The bus is coming.

293
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,830
Father...

294
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,540
When did you find out?

295
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,790
I knew for a long time.

296
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,440
About a year after you came.

297
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,860
Then why did you pretend not to know?

298
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,380
Because I was worried...

299
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,920
that Dal-pyung...

300
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,630
would tell you to leave if I found out.

301
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,737
Father.

302
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,030
At first...

303
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,710
I lied because you were so pitiful,

304
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,270
but now I lied...

305
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,980
because I want to keep you by my side.

306
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,750
So...

307
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,960
don't mind me...

308
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,090
and live as you please.

309
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
Okay?

310
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,070
Your good looking face...

311
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,380
smart brain...

312
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,010
Don't hide them.

313
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,640
You can live as you please.

314
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,790
Do you understand?

315
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,319
I'm fine.

316
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,425
Father.

317
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,060
I'm sorry, Dal-Po.

318
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:40,960
Thank you.

319
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,730
Dal-Po.

320
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,460
We're back.

321
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,100
Father, you're ho...

322
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,510
Who is...?

323
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,070
-Sir...
-What?

324
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,640
Who do you think it is?

325
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,810
It's your older brother.

326
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,900
-What?
-You're home.

327
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,170
Who is this?

328
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,760
My uncle became a prince.

329
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,790
In-ha.

330
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,190
Don't look down on your uncle.

331
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
And Dal-pyung, you too.

332
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:26,450
He's so smart and more handsome...

333
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,108
than an actor because he takes after me.

334
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
Don't you think so?

335
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,760
Father. That's nonsense.

336
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,170
How am I...

337
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,650
more handsome than an actor?

338
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,450
In-ha...

339
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,260
is the most beautiful
girl in the world, for me..

340
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,220
You should've dressed up
like this a long time ago.

341
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,190
Your looks aren't so bad after all!

342
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,530
I admit it, uncle.

343
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,370
Unbelievable!

344
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,280
Your clothes is more unbelievable.

345
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,810
Why do you wear those all the time?
Please throw away that training suit.

346
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,160
It's going to rot.

347
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,550
Why? You bought me this
for my graduation gift.

348
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,560
Really?

349
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,190
Then I should be killed.

350
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,780
I didn't know you'd wear
that for a thousand days.

351
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,670
So please throw that suit away!

352
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,010
Those guys are at it again.

353
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,730
-Go in.
-Yes.

354
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,280
Dad, you're strange.

355
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,720
You said I was prettier
than the Miss Korea last month.

356
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,590
I was drunk.

357
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,580
Completely drunk.

358
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,830
There is truth in wine.

359
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,830
You said I was so pretty
and it won't hurt to stick me in the eye.

360
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,040
It hurts! Hurts!

361
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,180
It hurts even a dust goes in.
What do you think if I put you in my eyes?

362
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,290
Look at yourself.

363
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,530
You're a beast not a human.

364
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,600
Are you displeased with me these days?

365
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,480
Hey, you brat.

366
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,990
If you keep dress up like this...

367
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,700
To put it crudely, what if Dal-Po thinks
light of you and starts liking you?

368
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,210
What?

369
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,210
Dad, no way.

370
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,300
-That's such a nonsense.
-It does make sense.

371
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,170
A man will look easy at a woman,

372
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,110
if she looks empty headed like you.
You look exactly like that.

373
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,270
I raised you up preciously.
How can I see man like Dal-Po hit on you?

374
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,400
Oh, my goodness. What a nonsense.

375
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,430
That will never happen.

376
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,630
There is no such thing as
“That will never happen.”

377
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,650
Anything can happen in the world.

378
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,650
Dad.

379
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,880
Dal-Po has never thought of me as a woman.
Not even an ant's pee's worth.

380
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,690
And I have never thought of Dal-Po
as a man other than an uncle, as well.

381
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,720
That's an inappropriate remark that will
never happen so don't even worry about it.

382
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,490
Wait.

383
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,890
Someone like Dal-Po?

384
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,800
Dad, let's make this clear.

385
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,200
Dal-Po isn't someone that you can talk
so thoughtlessly about.

386
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,850
It mads me, but Dal-Po is smart enough
to achieve what I can't for 3 years

387
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,900
just in a month.

388
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,120
There isn't anyone who has their head
on straight like Dal-Po these days.

389
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,780
With Dal-po's level,
he'd be considered as a top dog

390
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,550
because of his looks,
personality and even his brain.

391
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,610
Of course, I'm a top dog too.

392
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,530
This mouth!

393
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,030
It hurts!

394
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,990
That doesn't even hurt.

395
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,100
Logic of Journalism Writing

396
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,160
Why is dad taking out his anger
on me with such nonsense?

397
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,130
Dal-Po and me?

398
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,210
What a nonsense.

399
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,750
Why is it so hot?

400
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,940
This is all because of dad's nonsense.

401
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,530
One month later

402
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,100
Anyone. Anyone... Reporter... Academic.

403
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,170
Anyone. Anyone...

404
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,750
Is this a news, huh?

405
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,170
Does picking out our new employees
considered a news?

406
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,260
It's embarrassing to say
even three lines, but a minute?

407
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,750
And two weeks consecutively?

408
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,770
Are they insane?

409
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,510
Starting next month, MSC's News Times
will go against us at 10 PM.

410
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,720
They're trying to boost competitiveness
by highlighting new employees.

411
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,780
Why don't they just make
an audition program like KPop Star?

412
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,490
Aren't they embarrassed
for their own shameless news?

413
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,620
-Just take off your headband.
-No.

414
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,883
Cap said a news reporter
should show his eyebrows.

415
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,947
I'm being obedient to my boss right now.

416
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,860
You're not being obedient but whining
about what you want.

417
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,580
Cut your hair please.

418
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,852
That's why he's called a Nitpicker Jang.

419
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,712
Stop being wayward and start now!

420
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,520
Anyone can become a reporter
but not just anyone can become a reporter.

421
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,170
The final evaluation
of YGN new reporters 2013

422
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,370
will take place for those who pass
the interview and written test.

423
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,250
YGN has moved away from names
and indiscreet qualification competition.

424
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,400
In order to verify the talent
and practical application ability,

425
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,960
YGN got rid of document screening,
so that all 2523 applicants

426
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,050
can take the writing test.

427
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,950
Furthermore, to select new reporters
fairly with only their talent

428
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,510
regardless of academic background,
YGN applied a blind test method

429
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,260
by keeping the personal information
of all applicants undisclosed.

430
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,870
The right person that YGN thinks of

431
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,845
is not someone who has good
academic background, but someone

432
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,426
who can communicate with the era
and deliver voices of the society.

433
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,730
Applicants who pass final recruitment get
selected through camera test and debate

434
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,810
and will be announced by
the middle of this month.

435
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,030
YGN News...

436
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,400
They're sure trying so hard.

437
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,750
How can selecting their own reporters
become a news?

438
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,050
Don't you think they did that because
we start new program at 10 PM next month?

439
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,780
I see it as a good promotion.

440
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,730
I don't think news
program need promotion.

441
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,920
If we put out a fair report
it should naturally...

442
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,080
Is there any promotion we've prepared?

443
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,770
Advertisement time start
changing next week,

444
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,551
but that won't be enough
to turn the table up.

445
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,429
Besides, we have a certain difference
of viewer ratings with YGN.

446
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,440
What if we make our new reporters appear
on entertainment programs?

447
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,150
Like on talk shows?

448
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,080
Promotion idea that can
turn the tables up...

449
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,200
Greta Gruber grab...

450
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,780
I hope they don't ask me to do this.

451
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,490
I've tried for an hour but I can't.

452
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,680
Yoshihide Suga... Japanese tourism...

453
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,360
Tourism. Minister...

454
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,840
Tourism.

455
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Good evening, MSC News...

456
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,870
I must be crazy!

457
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,410
YGN! YGN!

458
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,200
Why do I keep saying MSC?

459
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,920
How about taking off that necklace?

460
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,030
What's wrong with this?

461
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,990
Somehow I think that dream
wasn't a good dream.

462
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,000
You wore that last time
and you didn't pass.

463
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,010
Take that off. I'll return your money.

464
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,370
It was a good dream.

465
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,560
Think about it.

466
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,420
After I bought your dream,
I got dad's permission.

467
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,900
We make it all the way here, pass writing
test and a full-of-pressure interview.

468
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,330
And they haven't found out
that I'm a Pinocchio.

469
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,920
They're all good things.

470
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,860
You can never take it back.

471
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,510
Alright.

472
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,480
Anyway, do I just need to focus
on pronunciation for the camera test?

473
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,950
I'm not sure.

474
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,680
I don't think it's going to be
a simple pronunciation test.

475
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,260
Group 4.

476
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:02,830
Number 19, 103, 211, 444

477
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,250
-and 467, please come in.
-Yes.

478
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,800
-Put your bags over here.
-Okay.

479
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,580
We've ever met before, right?

480
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,210
Really? I think it's the first time.

481
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,570
Really?

482
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,560
My features are common,
so I hear that often.

483
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:37,890
I see.

484
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,480
She's shameful.

485
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,600
Is there reporter Song Cha-ok
among the interviewers?

486
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,610
Yes. She's a total Ice Witch.

487
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,610
Really?

488
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,730
What a relief.

489
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,490
Thank you. Thank you so much.

490
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,160
She's a real threat, too.

491
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,480
The Foreign Minister of France,
Laurent Fabius

492
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,450
hold a press conference in Paris...

493
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,045
Shameful, a real threat
and slow in visual learning.

494
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,780
I will recognize her face right away.

495
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:55,160
Pinocchio didn't only sent the texts,
but also her selfies.

496
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,120
Really?

497
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,520
That's good, then.

498
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:00,280
But do you think she passed
the writing test, too?

499
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,790
You won't able to see
her if she didn't pass.

500
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,780
Right. That could happen.

501
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,860
Oh, my.

502
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,000
Should I check it for you?

503
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,170
Can you do that?

504
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,190
If she failed,
I have no reason to go, then.

505
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,310
Okay, I'll check to YGN HR Department.

506
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,370
Wait just a bit.

507
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,000
Never mind.

508
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,130
You don't need to do that.

509
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,060
Why?

510
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,271
I just found her.

511
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,980
Oh, my God. That man must be crazy.

512
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,980
It seems he doesn't feel cold at all.

513
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,760
That must be really cold.

514
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,230
He's cool.

515
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
What's with him?

516
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,460
I think he's looking at you.

517
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,420
I do think so.

518
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,370
-Is he someone you know?
-No.

519
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,150
What's that? Did he just wink at me?

520
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,710
You should wipe your nose.

521
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,820
It will soon be time for the camera test.

522
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,220
Was my nose runny?

523
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,770
I would've been in big trouble.
Thank you.

524
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,660
All applicants, please stand in front of
the microphone according to your numbers.

525
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,220
You should've shaved
since you came as an interviewer.

526
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,260
He's wearing a suit.

527
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:33,090
That shows much effort of his.
Just let him off.

528
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,940
You think broadcast is a joke?

529
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,920
Going back to a TV station

530
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,560
is something I hate more than death.

531
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,380
I'm getting crazy. Why of all people...

532
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,450
Nice to meet you.

533
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,700
I'm YGN News Department
Director, Lee Young-tak.

534
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Now you will have a camera test.

535
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,540
You only need to see a short video
from the monitor

536
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
and make a news report.

537
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,810
Are all of us given the same video?

538
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,050
Yes, that's right.

539
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,980
What?

540
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,070
Then it's unfair for the person
who goes first.

541
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,220
The next person just need
to intensify the report.

542
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,210
I'm not sure.

543
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,600
I don't see it that way.

544
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,540
It doesn't seem that unfair.

545
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,630
Really?

546
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,980
Then first, number 19...

547
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,000
Let's start with number 19.

548
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,470
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

549
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,450
I'm candidate number 19. I will begin.

550
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,790
Daytime at a residential area,

551
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,210
there is a fight
between a cat and a bird.

552
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,130
As the bird flies in and attacks the cat

553
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,797
the cat cowers as if it was shocked.

554
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,850
The bird continues to attack.

555
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,143
But the cat was sitting still...

556
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,320
and catches the bird in a flash.

557
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,500
The fight between the cat and the bird
went around 30 seconds,

558
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,691
ended with the cat as the victor.

559
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,760
That sounds a little flat.
He only describes the situation.

560
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,850
I'm not sure. I don't see it that way.

561
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,780
Next.

562
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,960
I'm candidate number 103. I will begin.

563
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,530
A bird flies in and
begins to attack the cat.

564
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,960
Not realizing it's natural predator,
the bird continues to attack.

565
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,630
The gentle cat continues
to take the bird's attack.

566
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,390
The cat can't stand of it
any longer, and then,

567
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,110
the bird becomes the food of the cat
by it's counterattack.

568
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,850
This situation remind us of the proverb
"fools rush in where angels fear to tread".

569
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,320
She's better.

570
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:55,170
Good voice tone and the idea
to add proverb was interesting, too.

571
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,470
I'm not sure. I don't see it that way.

572
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,950
Next.

573
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,660
I'm candidate number 211. I will begin.

574
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,410
A bird is attacking a cat.

575
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,830
The reason that the bird risks death
attacking its natural predator

576
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,410
is because the nest
of that bird is nearby.

577
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,240
The mother bird that desperately attacked
the cat to protect its babies,

578
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:17,170
ends up becoming the
food of the cat in vain.

579
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,000
That's all.

580
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,200
My goodness. The nest.

581
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,310
That's right.

582
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,920
The bird did that because of the nest.

583
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:28,960
He's pretty good.

584
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,120
I'm not sure. I don't see it that way.

585
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,080
I'm sure it's true.

586
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,940
Number 444 is lucky.

587
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,560
The answer came out before her.
She has it easy.

588
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,550
I'm not sure.

589
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,330
Let's see...

590
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,140
if she'll take it.

591
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,340
I'm sorry.

592
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,100
I'm candidate number 444.

593
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,640
I will begin.

594
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,730
Daytime at a residential area,

595
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,400
a bird flies in and attacks
the back of a cat.

596
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,100
The cat which was attacked cowers
as if it was shocked.

597
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:17,100
After receiving several attacks,
the cat jumps in a flash...

598
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,327
and caught the bird.

599
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,400
What's wrong with her?

600
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,610
-Why didn't she take the answer?
-I'm not sure.

601
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,120
She might think that
it wasn't the answer.

602
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,370
Why are you making that expression?

603
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,830
It's because I think I
messed up this test.

604
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,920
Why do you think you messed it up?

605
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,120
Because I think that number
211's report was good.

606
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,340
Then...

607
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,710
why didn't you follow his answer?

608
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,940
I wanted to...

609
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,420
-but I couldn't.
-Why couldn't you do it?

610
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,456
It's because I can't lie.

611
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,872
Why couldn't you lie?

612
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,080
-That's because...
-Because she's a reporter.

613
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,450
I think a reporter
should not report a lie.

614
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,340
Are you saying that number
211's report is a lie?

615
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,450
Yes.

616
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,770
Just by that video, we don't know
whether the cat is gentle

617
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,260
or it's a situation like “Fools rush
in where the angels fear to tread”.

618
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,000
Unless we verify, we won't know
if there's a nest nearby

619
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,455
or the mother bird was attacking
to protect its babies, as well.

620
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:38,860
Of course, I do think that his report
was convincing and discerning.

621
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,160
But as a reporter,

622
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,210
I don't think we should report
a fact that hasn't been verified.

623
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,830
Even if there could be a problem with
broadcasting if you don't give a report?

624
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,460
Excuse me?

625
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,110
Yes.

626
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,700
I understand. Next, number 467.

627
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,835
I won't make a report.

628
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,730
Just as number 444 said,

629
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,806
I think we can't make any assumption
or conclusion with just that video.

630
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,945
I will not give a report because
there is no value in the news.

631
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,270
Just like number 444,

632
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,724
I think having problem
with broadcasting...

633
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,260
is better than exaggerating.

634
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,040
Isn't he a wacko?

635
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,580
I'm not sure. I don't...

636
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,610
I know! I know!

637
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,040
You don't see it that way.

638
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,890
No, I think you're right.

639
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,840
He a total wacko among all wackos.

640
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,000
Funny!

641
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,360
We just need to select
double the amount, right?

642
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,400
Yes.

643
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,870
There were quite a few unique ones.

644
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,340
It's a bit frustrating that we
don't know their backgrounds

645
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,760
-since it's a blind test.
-HR Department head told me

646
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,580
that there is a taxi driver
among the applicants.

647
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:00,910
I heard that too.

648
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,720
There's a sasaeng
and a conglomerate family, too.

649
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:04,650
Sasaeng?

650
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,840
You mean the kids who follow
celebrities like a stalker?

651
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,640
-Yes.
-Who is that?

652
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,830
Of course I don't know.
Since it's a blind test.

653
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,140
Can get rid of those three?

654
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,910
Or did we get rid of them already?

655
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,030
Oh, my God.

656
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,250
Oh, my God.

657
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,110
There's another one
doing stuff like that.

658
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,770
Did someone do that before?

659
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,430
He's right next to me.

660
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,750
That's most likely...

661
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,750
I'm sure it's sasaeng.

662
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,800
I want to interpret that as
a persistent mindset of reporter.

663
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,270
Alright.

664
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,860
I might have failed, right?

665
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,940
Probably.

666
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,170
What should I do?

667
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,980
Aren't you going to fail
for no reason because of me?

668
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,570
Why is it because of you?

669
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,850
And unless we pass,
it's better to fail together.

670
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:16,800
No. It's better at least one of us pass,
whether it's you or me...

671
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,200
Whether you or me?

672
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:25,360
Hey, you mean it's okay
if I fail and you pass?

673
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,270
No, I mean...

674
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,386
Tell me. Is that right?

675
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,640
It must be true.

676
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,460
I mean...

677
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,550
I also feel that it would be best
if both of us pass.

678
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,110
But if that's not possible,

679
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,870
it's better for at least one
of us to pass, to be realistic.

680
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,450
Not me.

681
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,010
There's no meaning if both
of us do not pass the test.

682
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,670
If you fail, I'm going to quit too.

683
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,050
Don't do that.

684
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,190
If you pass, you should at least do it.
Why would you quit? It'd be a waste.

685
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,000
Don't you think it's too hot here?

686
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,470
Is it just me?

687
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,538
The camera test results announced!

688
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:32,100
Where! Where! Where is it?

689
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,920
Yay!

690
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,220
Dal-Po?

691
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,260
How did it go?

692
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,350
You both pass?

693
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,730
I'm proud of you.

694
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,850
Oh, my goodness, you've worked hard.

695
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,460
Then...

696
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,714
what's the last test left?

697
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,138
Debate evaluation?

698
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:11,140
Try your best until the end.

699
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,940
Alright. Alright.

700
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,100
Oh, my God.

701
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,730
Dal-pyung! Dal-Po and In-ha,

702
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,350
both passed the camera test.

703
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,670
That's great.

704
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,630
If they did good,

705
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,880
the uncle and niece...

706
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,560
will be working in the same company.

707
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,910
Same company?

708
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,640
Hey, eat your breakfast before we go.

709
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,920
Thanks.

710
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,120
Why is your necktie so untidy?

711
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:11,420
I don't know. Wearing neck tie
is the hard for me.

712
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,280
-Oh, my God!
-Don't even think about it!

713
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,730
Oh, my God. What's this? Oh, my goodness!

714
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,060
Oh, my God.

715
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,180
Father!

716
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,150
Father, father, father!

717
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,240
You rotten bastard!

718
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,390
You come here!

719
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,310
Just wait until you become my age

720
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,860
-and see if you can do that.
-I'm sorry, father.

721
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,600
You rude little bastard!

722
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,290
-How could you do it to me?
-I love you, father. I love you.

723
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,800
Hey.

724
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,310
We don't have to take the debate?

725
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,840
We can't air that even we take it.

726
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:57,780
Why?

727
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,500
It'd be very intense
since a survival debate.

728
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,560
They have to take other down to survive.

729
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,450
They'll slander and piss each other off.

730
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,540
They'll cry and make others cry.

731
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,430
Sure it is. Since the results
will be decided based on that,

732
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,490
they'll put their lives on the line.

733
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,190
Hey, what should we eat?

734
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,383
Why you didn't ask me, too?

735
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,930
You want to eat together?

736
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:33,810
I'm not sure.

737
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,900
I don't have an appetite, so... pass!

738
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,840
That Nitpicker Jang.

739
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:44,150
Thank you.

740
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,260
Biscuit.

741
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,040
Coffee. Biscuit.

742
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,190
Thank you for waiting a long time.

743
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,450
The last hurdle

744
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,950
is a debate over the topic
of the past incident

745
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,756
that was reported as news.

746
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,770
This is breaking news from NTS.

747
00:45:08,861 --> 00:45:10,870
A total of nine firemen lost
their lives due to explosion...

748
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,390
- while trying to put out...
-Nine firemen died...

749
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,640
A total of nine firemen,
including Im Moon-gwan died,

750
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:21,050
while Chief Ki Ho-sang
is still missing.

751
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:23,040
But the Chief kept arguing...

752
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,210
that they still needed to go in.

753
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,190
According to the witness who saw
Mr. Ki Ho-sang, police will...

754
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,380
I saw him with my two very own eyes.

755
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,040
I'm sure that it was him.

756
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:35,340
I have Pinocchio Syndrome,
so I can't ever lie!

757
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:39,220
Even though Mr. Ki was able to escape from
the fire, his fear for legal punishment...

758
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,910
But Mr. Ki's family is decisively
denying Mr. Ki's fault.

759
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,680
Those are just false rumors!
What are you guys doing!

760
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:48,020
The police plan to arrest
Ki Ho-sang for negligent homicide

761
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:49,260
upon his arrest.

762
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,711
But the public is wondering,

763
00:45:50,802 --> 00:45:56,180
if that would be enough
punishment for the crime

764
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:57,959
of dragging nine firefighters to death.

765
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:01,740
This morning around 7:20 AM on the beach
in Wongyung, Jeollabuk-do,

766
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:04,100
Mr. Ki Ho-sang's wife,
Mrs. Park, was discovered dead

767
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:06,090
by the nearby citizens.

768
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:08,520
The deceased Mrs. Park,
the wife of fugitive Ki Ho-sang,

769
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:11,170
could not withstand the police
investigation and criticism

770
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,040
and it's presumed to have
taken an extreme choice.

771
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,750
The police believe that Mrs. Park
drowned herself with her son,

772
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,905
so they are continuing to search for
the son that hasn't been discovered yet.

773
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
As you can see...

774
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,600
it was a very tragic incident.

775
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,170
Even we consider that it
happened 13 years ago,

776
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,240
the reporting method and
public opinion were not mature.

777
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:44,130
So...

778
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,450
Please speak freely that if all
of you reported this incident

779
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:51,903
from 13 years ago,
how would you have reported this?

780
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,717
I have a question before we start.

781
00:46:53,808 --> 00:46:56,790
What happened to Mr. Ki Ho-sang?
Is he still missing?

782
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,132
His skeletal remains
discovered few days ago.

783
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,390
What is that?

784
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,300
What is that?

785
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,820
Hey! What is that?

786
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,300
Look at this.

787
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,180
-What is that?
-Hurry up!

788
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:52,460
What is that?

789
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:54,720
What is that?

790
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:00,640
During the demolition of the factory, the
skeletons discovered on the hill behind.

791
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:04,030
After examining the article remains,
it was Mr. Ki Ho-sang

792
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,638
who was missing 13 years ago.

793
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:33,700
What is that?

794
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,730
Step aside.

795
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,010
What is that?

796
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,840
That's a corpse. What the heck...?

797
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:45,640
What happened?

798
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:49,640
Just what happened?

799
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:54,110
Who is it?

800
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,300
How long has it been
that it looks like that?

801
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:05,410
It looks like a fireman.

802
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:29,210
Father.

803
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,720
Father...

804
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:41,640
One, two, three.

805
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,940
What are you doing? Applaud.

806
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,270
Award Certificate

807
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:50,810
Jae-myung.

808
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:52,130
Look at this.

809
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,860
Aren't you proud of your dad?

810
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:57,170
You're the best, father.

811
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,490
Father!

812
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,920
Father...

813
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,730
I think reporters have a great
responsibility for this incident.

814
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:22,120
It is inexcusable that reporters concluded
Ki Ho-sang was guilty of professional

815
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:23,940
negligence and
manipulated public opinion.

816
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:25,960
That conclusion wasn't made by reporters

817
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,750
but the police and prosecution.

818
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,670
Reporters could only receive
and write based on their report.

819
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,110
That kind of dictation
is what elementary students do.

820
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:36,190
If you're a reporter, you should've
investigated and verified the facts.

821
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:39,710
I think reporters gave the news
they could give in that situation.

822
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:41,580
They have a witness

823
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,756
-and manager's testimony.
-Have you heard from your father?

824
00:50:44,176 --> 00:50:47,230
Why is he stay hiding?
Is it because he feels guilty?

825
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,820
You're happy that your
father is alive, right?

826
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:52,600
I think the biggest cause
of this tragedy is,

827
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,353
what the Pinocchio saw was delusion.

828
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,790
And it was a problem
that the prosecution,

829
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,430
police, and reporters believed
that testimony.

830
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:03,112
However, they probably didn't have
any choice but to believe it.

831
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:07,160
Because a testimony from a person
who can't lie is stronger than anything.

832
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,920
It's regrettable that Mr. Ki Ho-sang
was discovered deceased,

833
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,610
but I think this is a very
unfortunate accident

834
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,700
that we can't ask anyone
to take responsibility.

835
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,300
You said, there are no one...

836
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:25,446
to take responsibility?

837
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:32,760
People think that Pinocchio
can only tell the truth.

838
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,310
And people believe...

839
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,760
that reporters only deliver the truth.

840
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,610
Pinocchio and reporters
should have known that.

841
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,860
That the people believe whatever they say.
That's why!

842
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,390
They should've known that their words
are scarier than words of others.

843
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,000
They should've been
more and more careful.

844
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,280
The fact that they didn't know
it is their fault!

845
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:01,990
That carelessness...

846
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,330
destroyed one family.

847
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,000
That's why they must be asked
to take responsibility.

848
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,410
At that time, the Pinocchio
only said what he saw.

849
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,327
He probably couldn't stay silent just
because he thought he might be wrong.

850
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:35,730
After I see you, number 444...

851
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,450
now I understand why a Pinocchio...

852
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,330
can't be a reporter.

853
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:52,960
How dangerous it'd be
if someone who ignores

854
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:55,550
the fact that they could make mistake,
to become a reporter.

855
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,070
How scary the person who doesn't know

856
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,880
the weight of their words
and speaks recklessly can be.

857
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,740
Now I understand it.

858
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:14,430
Are you...

859
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,286
referring to me?

860
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,300
Yes.

861
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,950
What does this mean?

862
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,280
Are you saying that number 444
is a Pinocchio?

863
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,210
Number 444.

864
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,099
Are you perhaps a Pinocchio?

865
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:40,390
Yes.

866
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,910
She really is a Pinocchio?

867
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:46,710
-She was hiding it all this time?
-Sure she will fail.

868
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:49,380
Shameful, a real threat,
slow in visual learning

869
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:50,520
and even a Pinocchio?

870
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,590
That's a big jackpot.

871
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:05,580
Number 444, we still have time left
for the debate. Please take your seat.

872
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,210
Please open.

873
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,510
I'm going to stop here.

874
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,380
I don't think broadcasting is a joke.

875
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:45,490
You can kill a person
with one word from a broadcast.

876
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:49,430
How dare I think
that broadcasting is a joke?

877
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:55,360
Why? Do you also think
that he's impressive?

878
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,130
Rather than impressive,

879
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,000
I think he's someone I know a bit.

880
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,010
What floor?

881
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:39,950
Seriously.

882
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,340
What happened with me?

883
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:44,330
Shall I just press the first floor?

884
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,010
You must be really upset.

885
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,160
Is it because number 99
stab you in the back?

886
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:53,580
No, I'm not.

887
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,760
It's a debate so it's natural
to speak up your opinion.

888
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,300
It doesn't mean backstabbing just because
his opinion is different than mine.

889
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,640
Then why?

890
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:03,510
Because you messed up the test?

891
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,370
No, I just...

892
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,788
I just wanted him to be on my side.

893
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:10,820
My side?

894
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:12,420
No. No.

895
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:13,860
What am I saying right now?

896
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:16,170
We shouldn't take sides during a debate.

897
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:19,050
It's natural to have different opinions.

898
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:23,550
But I still wanted Dal-Po
to be on my side.

899
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,290
Because he's Dal-Po.

900
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:29,770
It's not anyone else but it's Dal-Po,
so no matter what...

901
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:31,020
No.

902
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:31,990
That can't be.

903
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,550
Why am I so bad? It's so annoying.

904
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,640
You must like that guy named Dal-Po.

905
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,250
No. Not at all!

906
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,760
I must be crazy.

907
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,720
Why happened to me?

908
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:52,110
No, I'm not.

909
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,880
No, I really don't.

910
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:45,010
Father.

911
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,520
Father.

912
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,130
Father.

913
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:28,810
Father.

914
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:31,210
Father.

915
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:44,810
What's wrong with me?

916
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,880
He's my uncle.

917
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:50,490
He even has a girlfriend,
so I shouldn't be like this.

918
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,270
This is not right.

919
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,440
There's no way.

920
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,200
I shouldn't be like this.

921
00:58:58,290 --> 00:58:59,520
If I do this...

922
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:15,480
I thought I might be jealous if I fail
and you passed, but I'm not.

923
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:18,030
-You're hiccuping.
-I'm not hiccuping because of that.

924
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,770
-Did you commit a crime?
-Oh, my God!

925
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,740
He picks on every word,
so he is Nitpicker Jang.

926
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,410
If you cry, you're his target.
If you're...

927
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,930
You will all die!

928
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:27,370
What will happen if a Pinocchio
becomes reporter?

929
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,460
My son is strange these days.

930
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,830
Do you know why these hiccups started?

931
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,800
I will try give up on
my feelings somehow.

932
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,400
If you can't...

933
00:59:37,734 --> 00:59:38,901
what's going to happen...

934
00:59:40,133 --> 00:59:41,133
to us?
