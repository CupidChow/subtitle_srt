1
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,811
Pinocchio

2
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,260
I heard that a body was found
at an abandoned factory site recently.

3
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,440
I'd like to know if someone
has taken that body.

4
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,260
That one? Give me a second.

5
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,900
Yes, what happened to the body
found at the old factory site?

6
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,500
Yes, I see. Thank you.

7
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,260
-Someone has taken the body.
-Excuse me?

8
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,530
-Who took the body?
-A family member came and took it.

9
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,700
Who's the family member?

10
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:02,940
May I know who it was?

11
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,820
Any contact number? Where's the address?

12
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,340
But who are you?

13
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,090
I'm a family member as well.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,940
The one who took the body
possibly my brother.

15
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,370
Do you have any document to prove
your family relation to the deceased?

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,880
That's...

17
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,160
I've been adopted, so I don't
have anything to prove it.

18
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,430
Then, I won’t be able to help you.

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,000
I remember my family member's names.

20
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,610
-I also remember my old address, and...
-I'm sorry.

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,090
Unless you have document
to prove your family relation,

22
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,960
I can't tell you anything else.

23
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,520
That's the rule for giving out
personal information.

24
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,081
Police Station

25
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,470
Father...

26
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,340
I wasn't alone.

27
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,880
Am I really all alone, father?

28
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,970
I am also the only one in
this world who knows...

29
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,680
how unjustly you passed away.

30
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,910
Father.

31
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,770
Please answer me.

32
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,900
Where should I go...

33
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,500
what should I do...

34
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,160
to find my brother?

35
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,170
How?

36
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,630
Congratulations for passing
YGN New Reporter 2013

37
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,499
Let's be a reporter together, In-ha.

38
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,140
I used to want to be a reporter
because of In-ha.

39
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,430
I wanted to show that woman,
that we could be a reporter.

40
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,400
Number 444.

41
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,320
Are you a Pinocchio?

42
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,220
Yes.

43
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,170
But that determination comes to nothing.

44
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,650
And...

45
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,220
His skeletal have been found
a few days ago.

46
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
But now I have another determination.

47
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,490
The fact that being alive
was a humiliation for my father.

48
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,510
I'm now determined

49
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,090
to tell the world the story
of your unjust death.

50
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,430
And I will find Jae-myung,
the only other person...

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,376
who knows about this story.

52
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,990
The person who led my path
to be a reporter

53
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,420
might not In-ha...

54
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,510
but it was possibly you, Father.

55
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,030
Aren't you going to work?

56
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:57,930
Yeah.

57
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,990
Yes.

58
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,770
In-ha, you're not going to work.

59
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,260
Work means having a regular job.

60
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,450
But what you do
at the convenience store is part-time.

61
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,900
-Yeah.
-One of you is a TV reporter,

62
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,490
and the other one
is a shameless 27 year old

63
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,770
who works a part-time job at a
convenience store like a college student.

64
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,350
Now that I look, you finally look
like a proper uncle and niece.

65
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,220
I’m going to work.

66
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,960
I'll head out first.

67
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,770
Heading out already?

68
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,100
What about breakfast?

69
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,310
I don't have appetite.

70
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,720
-I'm not hungry.
-You didn't even eat dinner last night.

71
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,090
What is it?

72
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,450
Did something happen again
between you two?

73
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,760
Why are you guys in such a bad mood?

74
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,400
No, nothing happened.

75
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,910
A bad mood would be the normal response,

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,380
since one passed and one didn't.

77
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,810
How about you being a tutor?

78
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,480
If people know you made a taxi driver
into a reporter in a month,

79
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,488
everyone in the country
would fling their money at you.

80
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,530
Stop making big fuss
and go fix the toilet.

81
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,300
It's filthy how the toilet
won't even flush properly!

82
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,740
I’m going to work.

83
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,900
I’m going to work.

84
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,880
Yeah.

85
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,570
Don't bother to what my dad said.

86
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,800
I'm really happy
that you became a reporter.

87
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,550
I thought I'd be jealous
if you get the job when I fail,

88
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,608
but I don't feel that at all.

89
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,687
Amazingly, I don't feel
the least bit jealous.

90
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,310
I really mean it!

91
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,930
You're hiccuping.

92
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,270
Well, that's...

93
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,960
That's not the reason why I'm hiccuping.

94
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,990
Then, what is it?

95
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,820
This is...

96
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,340
It's because...

97
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,560
Anyway, I'm fine.

98
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,953
If you're uncomfortable being around me

99
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:51,681
because of what happened
during the debate,

100
00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:53,370
there's no need for you to feel that way.

101
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,440
Opposing someone else at a debate
is a given, isn't it?

102
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,320
I know that you had no other choice.

103
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,100
It wasn't because I had no other choice.

104
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,180
I don't believe...

105
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,550
that you should be a reporter.

106
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,600
I mean it.

107
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,400
What?

108
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,640
What do you mean by that?

109
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,750
Why shouldn’t I be a reporter?

110
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,500
I've already explained during the debate.

111
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,260
Listening to number 444,

112
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,990
I now realize the reason
why a Pinocchio...

113
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,940
can't become a reporter.

114
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,500
The danger of someone who can't admit
that they could be wrong to be a reporter.

115
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,890
The danger of speaking recklessly,

116
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,360
while unaware of the weight
their words carry.

117
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
I see it now.

118
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,500
You were being sincere about it?

119
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,870
About everything you said?

120
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,600
Your mother was right.

121
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,500
A Pinocchio shouldn't become a reporter.

122
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,190
Don't become a reporter, In-ha.

123
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,980
Hey!

124
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,040
What’s wrong with you?

125
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,529
You said you wanted both of us
to become reporters together.

126
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,340
Don't become a reporter, In-ha.

127
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,590
Was that just a lie?

128
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,480
When I think of you as a reporter...

129
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,970
it reminds me of your wicked mother.

130
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,134
Tell me, was that all just a lie?

131
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,205
It reminds me of your mother who framed
my poor father of unjust wrongdoings.

132
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,910
Hey!

133
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,500
You, crazy little bastard!

134
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,000
If you become a reporter...

135
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,700
it would be torture for me
to even look you in the face...

136
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,410
and that scares me.

137
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,960
That'll be 4 dollars and 80 cent.

138
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,790
Oh, my. I forgot to use my point card.

139
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,410
Can you please ring it up again?

140
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,160
Yes.

141
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,900
You keep hiccuping.

142
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,130
Plug your nose and bend your waist
at a 90 degree angle.

143
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,060
That'll stop the hiccups immediately.

144
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,560
It won't work.

145
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,510
Just give it a try.

146
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,790
-I guarantee it.
-It won't stop.

147
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,660
I said, it won't stop!

148
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,090
Hey, student...

149
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,870
I'm not a student!

150
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,120
I graduated three years ago,
but I'm still unemployed.

151
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Come on, don't cry.

152
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,210
It is said that young people
should ask for trouble.

153
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,170
I don't want any trouble.

154
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,150
Get in trouble yourself if you want.

155
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,390
I failed at the second test, you know.

156
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,220
This was my...36th attempt.

157
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,960
You girls better study hard.

158
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,170
Otherwise, you'll just end up like me.

159
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,460
That'll be 3 dollars and 80 cent.

160
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,470
Isn't that just absurd?

161
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,680
My uncle got hired after only a month!

162
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,490
I've been preparing
for the past three years,

163
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,610
but I failed.

164
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,500
Show me your ID, please.

165
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,150
Here you go.

166
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:46,770
It's possible...

167
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,830
that I may keep hiccuping
for the rest of my life.

168
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,910
I have to confess my feelings for him

169
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,990
to stop my hiccups.

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
-But the person I like...
-Choi Dal-Po.

171
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,940
It's him, isn't it?

172
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,090
Your uncle?

173
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,370
You're...

174
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,860
Keep talking. I'll listen to it.

175
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,570
I've got nothing but time.

176
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,300
Episode 5 - The King
with Donkey Ears

177
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,630
Am I here too early?

178
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,610
No, I'm not early.

179
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,840
What's that?

180
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,580
Did you memorize all the names?

181
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,330
Of course.

182
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,560
-What are you guys doing?
-Oh, my God!

183
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,000
You surprised me!

184
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,950
Why are you acting so startled?
Did you do something wrong?

185
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,950
Why are you speaking honorifics?
As coworkers, we should speak casually.

186
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,010
We've lowered our speech with him, too.

187
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,130
Hi.

188
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,300
Nice to meet you.

189
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,690
Nice to meet you.

190
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,310
Okay, let's share our information.

191
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,560
I got the information on our seniors.

192
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,180
I did, too. You just need to be
careful with Jang Hyun-gyu

193
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,600
from the Han River district.

194
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,180
According to my source,

195
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,240
he picks on every word,
so he is Nitpicker Jang.

196
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,140
The worst amongst all lead reporters.

197
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,840
He is such a scumbag.

198
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,370
When he picks on you,
you should never ever cry.

199
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,870
Crying will get you targeted,
and if you targeted...

200
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,240
You all dead!

201
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,170
Oh my God!

202
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,670
That surprised me!

203
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,970
Stop with all the crap, and follow me!

204
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,150
Yes!

205
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,760
It's okay, Yu-Rae.

206
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,590
You haven't cried yet.

207
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,000
So, you're not targeted.
You haven't been targeted.

208
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,200
Yoon Yu-Rae. What did you saw earlier?

209
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,270
What were you two chattering on about?

210
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,760
Player Jang Hyun-gyu.

211
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,500
He's already trying
to domesticate the rookies.

212
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,190
I'm curious which of them will fall victim
to Nitpicker Jang's wrath this year.

213
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,200
It'll be those two
with the arms in the air.

214
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,000
Looks like they've already been targeted.

215
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,780
I think it'll be that tall guy.

216
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,900
Why?

217
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,280
He looks okay to me.

218
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,720
He's the one who compared
TV stations to raw sewage.

219
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,166
He told me that he finds
reporters repulsive.

220
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,870
-What?
-Really?

221
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,400
-Does your head itch?
-That's right.

222
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,880
The aggressive guy at the interview?

223
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,130
What was his name again?

224
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,010
He's Choi Dal-Po.

225
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,600
-Do you feel wronged?
-No, Sir!

226
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,080
Are you crying?

227
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
No, Sir.

228
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,140
I was just yawning.

229
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,000
But you didn’t even open your mouth.

230
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,490
I yawn with my mouth closed.

231
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,100
Why are you staring at me like that?

232
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,160
Do you feel that my scolding of
your coworkers is unjustified?

233
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,170
Player Nitpicker Jang is re-starting up
to unleash his wrath.

234
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,830
The glint in Player Choi Dal-po's eyes
is giving me a pause.

235
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,130
Answer me!

236
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,780
No, Sir. I believe the scolding
is more than justified.

237
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,530
What a cold-hearted rascal.

238
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,250
Don't you have any sense of solidarity?

239
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,920
Raise your arms up in the air!

240
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,950
Jang Hyun-gyu is attempting to get
a rise based on ridiculous reasoning.

241
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:43,590
Will Player Choi Dal-Po react?

242
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,560
I apologize. It won’t happen again.

243
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,020
What unexpected turn of events!

244
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,120
Player Choi Dal-Po is seen standing down.

245
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,150
He's not a game cock,

246
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,160
but just a gentle chick.
What's going on here?

247
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,750
What happened there?

248
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,640
You sure he's the one
who stood up to you?

249
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,830
Yes.

250
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:10,970
I'm positive.

251
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,860
Pick them up.

252
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,990
From now on, you will make your rounds
around each department

253
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,460
to observe and learn
how the news is created.

254
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,590
Once the week is over,

255
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,250
you'll be assigned to each district
and start your official training.

256
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,210
Is that understood?

257
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,300
-Yes, Sir!
-Yes.

258
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,310
Oh my goodness.

259
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,230
The name tag comes out well.

260
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,730
What does it mean to 'snoop'?

261
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,000
Number 3.

262
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,110
We go around to different police stations

263
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,219
and see if there are any
newsworthy cases going on.

264
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,580
Isn’t there any other word for it?

265
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,020
I know.

266
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,370
So did they tell you
when you'd be on the news?

267
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,930
It'll be a long time.

268
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,627
Even after training period,
it's not guaranteed we'd get to go on.

269
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,970
Oh, my.

270
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,140
I don't believe that you should become
a reporter.

271
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,150
I mean that.

272
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,394
Cheers!

273
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:25,540
It’s so good.

274
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:30,110
The drinks are on me tonight!

275
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,160
Hyungim.

276
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,540
How nice is it to have things cleared up
by signing a paper like this?

277
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,640
Don't worry.

278
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,580
I just invested some money
into acquiring a few boats in Vietnam.

279
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,970
They say the boat is full,

280
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,600
so as soon as it enters the port,

281
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,100
I'll pay back twice your interest amount.

282
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,180
Want me to sign a paper
for the interest, too?

283
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,030
No, it's okay.

284
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,731
Just don't forget to pay the principal.

285
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,550
By the way,

286
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,770
have you heard it?

287
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,990
You know that fire chief
who went missing?

288
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,350
His remains have been found recently.

289
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,310
Really?

290
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,090
-Was it on the news?
-No.

291
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,050
It's already 13 years ago.
Why would it make on the news?

292
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,000
I just heard from a friend who works
on the demolition of the building.

293
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,350
What a relief!

294
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,540
I've been in great anxiety
because of his possible return.

295
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,490
I told you.

296
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,560
I told you that he was dead by explosion.

297
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,640
We can all finally sleep in peace.

298
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,100
That’s what I was saying.

299
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,820
This is so good.

300
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,810
I'm sorry.

301
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,960
I'm sorry.

302
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,090
Geez!

303
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,060
What a terrible drinking habit!

304
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,130
Just let it go.

305
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,860
It's a good day.
Let's just sit back down.

306
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,800
Ma'am, can we get another glass over here?

307
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,490
This is the control room
where the news is created.

308
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,510
Report footage out.

309
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,060
The man giving out
the cue is the news PD.

310
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,200
And next to him is...

311
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,130
Next to him is Technical Director and
Director in charge of captioning.

312
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,280
Raise your arms facing the wall.

313
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,520
Yes, Sir.

314
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,410
The next is...

315
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,490
There's audio after sync.

316
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,050
-Cut.
-According to a viewer survey

317
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,980
of the news broadcasting,

318
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:29,360
YGN came in at first place for being
the most influential and credible.

319
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,660
YGN came out very strong in the lead
from any other stations

320
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,590
with 45 percent of the votes
in the credibility category.

321
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,660
Amongst cable TV station,

322
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,900
MSC is on a steady decline
in their influence and credibility,

323
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,200
while NTS is showing a slight increase
in those categories.

324
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,474
Both stations have received a rating

325
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:50,039
of seven percent and nine percent
in credibility respectively.

326
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:52,319
Credibility of only seven percent.

327
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:55,049
How did it get so low?

328
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,769
I am afraid that the octopus crisis news
last month caused a great impact.

329
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:02,399
Soon, our prime time news will be going up
against YGN in the same time slot.

330
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:04,499
And at this rate,
they're going to crush us.

331
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:06,659
It means we’ll never be able to beat them.

332
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:10,339
YGN is doing various PR work

333
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:12,949
as well as advertising
in subway stations and theaters.

334
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:14,629
Don't we have anything like that?

335
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:18,029
Some of our new reporters have left,
is that correct?

336
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:21,689
Yes, we've had a couple new hires
that couldn't endure their training

337
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:24,659
and wound up quitting their jobs.

338
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:25,889
Why do you ask?

339
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:36,579
Dal-Po definitely said we should
become reporters together.

340
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:38,319
Then, he tells me not to be one.

341
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:41,219
I asked him to give me a reason,
but he didn't tell me anything.

342
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:43,339
Am I the weird one here?

343
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:45,889
No, Dal-Po is the weird one.

344
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,419
No one wants to take my side.

345
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:51,459
My dad, Dal-Po, and my mom...
They all tell me not to become a reporter.

346
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:52,909
How does this even happen?

347
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:56,089
Is the world going to end or something
if a Pinocchio becomes a reporter?

348
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:57,529
No, that won't happen.

349
00:20:57,829 --> 00:20:58,669
Never.

350
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,449
If it hadn't been for these hiccups,
things wouldn't have gotten this bad.

351
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:04,939
Come on, hiccups are considered cute.

352
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:07,939
What if you were to fart
instead every time you lied?

353
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:09,009
That'd be disgusting.

354
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:10,009
Fart?

355
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,389
My goodness. You're right.

356
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:15,809
It's a relief that I only resort
to hiccuping not farting.

357
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:19,559
That's comforting to hear.

358
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:20,689
Really?

359
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,059
That's good to hear.

360
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:24,669
Thank you.

361
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:27,089
After all the talking I just did,
I feel better...

362
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,249
...as if I went to confession.

363
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:32,429
I enjoy listening to you talk.

364
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:35,209
You look better than I thought.

365
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:43,679
I thought you'd be moping around
after failed at all the stations,

366
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,169
but you look quite okay.

367
00:21:58,019 --> 00:21:59,699
How did you know that I'd be here?

368
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:02,679
You had written it all down
in your cover letter,

369
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:04,669
as if you wanted me to come to visit.

370
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:05,949
You even wrote your address.

371
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,879
That was because...

372
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:11,733
-That was...
-I'll just get right to the point.

373
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:14,949
I'm not interested in hearing
whatever you say.

374
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,319
Your desire to become a reporter...

375
00:22:18,689 --> 00:22:19,899
do you still feel that way?

376
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:21,374
Reporter?

377
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:27,289
-Why?
-We've had some slots open up.

378
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:29,179
Interested?

379
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,489
Seems you regret your decision?

380
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:34,199
Or am I fail but came a close second?

381
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:35,129
Or...

382
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:39,739
It's neither.

383
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,629
It's just for PR.

384
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:44,059
PR?

385
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:49,449
The recent survey shows
that MSC's weak point is our credibility.

386
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:51,549
We have to do something to change that

387
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:53,229
and it reminds me of you.

388
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:56,219
If we promote that we've hired
a reporter who can't lie,

389
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,099
then it may help boost our credibility.

390
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:06,279
Are you saying
that I'm not being chosen...

391
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:10,969
as a reporter but as a promotional doll?

392
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:12,779
Yeah.

393
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:15,855
Think of it as a three month internship,
rather than a permanent.

394
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:17,884
But if you do a good job,

395
00:23:17,975 --> 00:23:19,442
we may consider you
for a full time position.

396
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:22,209
I'm not interested.

397
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:25,629
Considering your current situation...

398
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:28,829
I don't think you're in any position
to refuse my offer.

399
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,009
Does honor or pride have any importance
in this matter?

400
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:34,259
Yes.

401
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,889
Those things do matter to me.

402
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,379
In your current situation...

403
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:42,689
I doubt you'd find any other way to become
a reporter while caring for such things.

404
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:49,409
That's what decision making is.

405
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:52,709
In order to gain something,
you have to throw something else away.

406
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:54,009
Then...

407
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:57,201
what did you throw away
when you chose to become a reporter?

408
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:00,799
You.

409
00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:05,969
Did you...

410
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:08,939
ever regret it?

411
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:11,969
I did regret it.

412
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:22,999
But seeing how you're dwelling
on that fact,

413
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:24,749
I wonder if my regrets were in vain.

414
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:30,690
If you decide to come, then get rid
of that hiccup before coming.

415
00:24:58,019 --> 00:24:58,899
Let's go.

416
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:04,149
Sung Cha-ok - Local News Department Head

417
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,609
I thought she came
because it's my birthday.

418
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:31,229
So...

419
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:33,869
do you think she'll work for MSC?

420
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:36,809
Yes, I think so.

421
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:42,829
Doesn’t she have any pride?

422
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:46,319
She still wants to become a reporter
even after the way her mom treated her?

423
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:47,679
That's what I'm saying.

424
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,739
I thought...

425
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:54,309
all mothers in this world
were as wonderful as my mom.

426
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,459
I guess that's not it.

427
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,639
Did you just figure that out?

428
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:01,049
I'm curious about, Mother.

429
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:02,019
About what?

430
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:03,809
What's so important

431
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:06,389
about being a reporter that she's willing
to endure that kind of treatment?

432
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:08,979
And what made her mom become so cruel?

433
00:26:09,249 --> 00:26:10,639
But more than anything else,

434
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,349
what would happen if a Pinocchio
become a reporter?

435
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:14,739
And also...

436
00:26:14,829 --> 00:26:15,949
My son.

437
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:17,539
You're acting very strange lately.

438
00:26:17,629 --> 00:26:19,569
-How so?
-You're curious...

439
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:21,091
...about way too many things lately.

440
00:26:22,469 --> 00:26:23,469
Am I?

441
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:25,719
That's weird.

442
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:28,269
Drink it.

443
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:29,269
Okay.

444
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,729
Drink it up.

445
00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:34,749
Eonni, sorry I'm late.

446
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:36,039
I'm here.

447
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:41,179
There you are.

448
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:42,529
You surprised me.

449
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:43,909
Why were you doing that?

450
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:45,299
I have a lot on my mind.

451
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:47,239
And I have a lot of decisions
to make, too.

452
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:49,059
Have you made your decision, then?

453
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:50,329
Yeah.

454
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:53,779
I've organized almost everything,
so just check kimbap expiration dates.

455
00:26:53,889 --> 00:26:54,879
Bye.

456
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:27,089
Crazy little thing.

457
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:28,719
You can't even give it to her.

458
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:41,109
Excuse me, Grandmother.
Take this, it's a gift.

459
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:43,569
Why would you give this to me?

460
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:13,139
We need to talk.

461
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:28,499
It's cold.

462
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,599
If you have something
to say, make it quick.

463
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:36,679
I'm not jealous of you.

464
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:40,529
I'm happy about you becoming a reporter,
and I don't resent you at all.

465
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,349
You bringing that up again?

466
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:44,449
You're hiccuping right now.

467
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:47,079
Do you know

468
00:28:47,949 --> 00:28:48,949
why I started hiccuping?

469
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:52,989
It started when I denied
having feelings for you.

470
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,599
What?

471
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:00,599
I said, I like you.

472
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,359
I like you.

473
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:09,239
I denied when I realized it.

474
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:12,669
Because that's just absurd,
and not allowed,

475
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:17,569
but my hiccups haven't stopped since then.

476
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:25,089
You're lying.

477
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:26,859
That's ridiculous.

478
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,649
It's not a lie.

479
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:41,249
See?

480
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,109
My hiccups have stopped.

481
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:49,949
You know that I can't lie.

482
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:54,129
That's why I can't hide it
when I have a crush on someone

483
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:56,269
and I can't play hard to get,
like everyone else do.

484
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,599
Even though the answer's obvious.

485
00:29:58,719 --> 00:30:01,829
Even though I'm perfectly aware that
this isn't right since you're my uncle.

486
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:05,687
I still have to confess my feelings
because of this lousy hiccups.

487
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,949
So just pretend that you never heard it.

488
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:18,959
I'll do anything to get
over my feelings for you.

489
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,689
I'll address you as my uncle all the time.

490
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:26,449
I'll go on lots of dates with other men.

491
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:28,019
I'll do whatever I can.

492
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:32,959
Please forget what I just told you.

493
00:30:34,189 --> 00:30:35,209
Then, it'll be fine.

494
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:39,469
Okay.

495
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:44,009
Thanks.

496
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:52,599
What if that doesn't work?

497
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,429
What if you make all the effort you can...

498
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:04,819
and do everything you can think of...

499
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:09,429
but it still remain the same
for a long time?

500
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:23,549
What happens...

501
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:25,939
to us then?

502
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,459
That's not allowed to happen.

503
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:35,069
Because we're family.

504
00:31:41,389 --> 00:31:43,029
Don't worry, because my feelings...

505
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:46,269
aren't that deep yet.

506
00:31:48,469 --> 00:31:49,999
I can get over these feelings soon.

507
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:15,139
Must be nice for you...

508
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:17,939
to be able to do that.

509
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:25,449
I'm home.

510
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:26,629
You're home?

511
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:31,169
Geez, what's this?
You haven't forgotten my birthday?

512
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:34,209
-Is today your birthday?
-It's her birthday today?

513
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:35,939
Oh, my. You didn't know?

514
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,719
Then why did you buy the cake?

515
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:38,949
Come in.

516
00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:42,269
What is it?

517
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:45,559
No, it's nothing.

518
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:49,184
There's a grandmother looking for a place
for her and her grandson a while back.

519
00:32:49,274 --> 00:32:51,054
So I helped her with no charge.

520
00:32:51,145 --> 00:32:54,146
Then, she came by a while ago
and gave me this cake as a thank you.

521
00:32:54,237 --> 00:32:55,793
Really? What a perfect timing!

522
00:32:57,028 --> 00:32:58,001
Use fork.

523
00:32:58,454 --> 00:33:00,394
I'll just wash my hands after.

524
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:03,624
You're acting strange lately.
You're suddenly obsessed with being clean?

525
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:09,034
It's because I’m so embarrassed of you.

526
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,484
Dal-Po, come sit down and eat.

527
00:33:12,584 --> 00:33:13,424
Sure.

528
00:33:14,054 --> 00:33:16,054
This is my favorite strawberry cake.

529
00:33:16,214 --> 00:33:17,984
Maybe she was an angel.

530
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:21,624
An angel who remembered my birthday,
when the rest of my family didn't.

531
00:33:30,734 --> 00:33:31,574
So good!

532
00:33:35,884 --> 00:33:37,244
That's not allowed to happen.

533
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:38,934
We're family.

534
00:33:58,064 --> 00:33:59,064
I can do this.

535
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,204
I can do this.

536
00:34:09,694 --> 00:34:10,694
Have you decided?

537
00:34:11,934 --> 00:34:12,774
Yes.

538
00:34:18,374 --> 00:34:19,537
Seonbae.

539
00:34:19,914 --> 00:34:21,413
Are you back from the police station?

540
00:34:21,504 --> 00:34:22,344
Yeah.

541
00:34:24,734 --> 00:34:25,794
Have you heard the news?

542
00:34:25,974 --> 00:34:27,724
The new hire position that just opened up

543
00:34:28,074 --> 00:34:29,954
will be filled by someone
with connections.

544
00:34:37,394 --> 00:34:39,784
Yes, I heard one is through Ms Song

545
00:34:40,004 --> 00:34:42,534
and the other is through Mr Yeon.

546
00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:44,194
Do they think it's the air force?

547
00:34:44,284 --> 00:34:45,894
Who gets parachuted in like that?

548
00:34:46,764 --> 00:34:47,954
Don't try to stop me.

549
00:34:48,144 --> 00:34:49,874
I'm not going to sit back and accept this.

550
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,024
I'll complain about it
to the internal board.

551
00:34:52,684 --> 00:34:55,434
I'm going to show them
what insubordination truly means.

552
00:34:55,974 --> 00:34:58,744
Even they get in through connection,
they do have good qualification.

553
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:00,874
Both of them made it
to the final round at YGN.

554
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,454
-And nice visuals, too.
-How do visuals matter...

555
00:35:03,544 --> 00:35:04,664
for reporters?

556
00:35:05,114 --> 00:35:07,184
Good looks don't write the news
and good looks

557
00:35:07,284 --> 00:35:08,666
don't get you exclusive news either.

558
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:13,224
Hello.

559
00:35:13,314 --> 00:35:14,444
-Are you heading up?
-No.

560
00:35:14,534 --> 00:35:15,684
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

561
00:35:15,774 --> 00:35:16,694
Excuse me.

562
00:35:18,274 --> 00:35:19,844
-What are you doing...?
-You came.

563
00:35:20,924 --> 00:35:22,114
-Hello.
-Hello.

564
00:35:23,844 --> 00:35:24,864
Say hello.

565
00:35:24,974 --> 00:35:27,013
This is Kim Gong-joo,
Captain in charge of the police station.

566
00:35:27,434 --> 00:35:29,974
And that's Reporter Lee Il-joo,
in charge of Han River district.

567
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:32,874
These are our new intern reporters.

568
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:34,334
Choi In-ha and Seo Bum-Jo.

569
00:35:35,744 --> 00:35:36,834
Nice to meet you.

570
00:35:37,324 --> 00:35:39,084
Welcome to MSC.

571
00:35:40,774 --> 00:35:44,114
One thing that we lacked in comparison
to YGN is our reporters' good looks.

572
00:35:44,624 --> 00:35:47,164
But the situation seems turned in
with the arrival of these two.

573
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:50,504
Choi In-ha, let's go down directly
to the studio.

574
00:35:50,594 --> 00:35:51,434
Yes, Ma'am.

575
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,644
I need to talk to you for a bit.

576
00:35:58,814 --> 00:35:59,654
Yes, Sir.

577
00:36:01,944 --> 00:36:04,094
Is your mother doing well?

578
00:36:06,534 --> 00:36:07,984
I thought you were going
to insubordinate?

579
00:36:08,074 --> 00:36:09,164
I just did.

580
00:36:09,784 --> 00:36:10,624
Pardon?

581
00:36:12,444 --> 00:36:14,874
I only mentioned their looks,
not their skills at all.

582
00:36:15,404 --> 00:36:17,334
Unless they're stupid, they'll realize

583
00:36:17,424 --> 00:36:19,644
that was a form of disrespect
to their skills.

584
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,874
I bet Mr Yeon and Ms Song
both took note of it.

585
00:36:26,474 --> 00:36:28,184
Whatever!

586
00:36:36,504 --> 00:36:37,824
This is a draft of the PR shoot.

587
00:36:38,084 --> 00:36:39,724
Let me know if you don't understand.

588
00:36:39,914 --> 00:36:40,754
Yes.

589
00:36:41,354 --> 00:36:43,444
When will these start airing?

590
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:46,254
Maybe some time within the week.

591
00:36:46,494 --> 00:36:47,664
-Why do you ask?
-Nothing.

592
00:36:47,754 --> 00:36:48,594
Just asking.

593
00:36:50,184 --> 00:36:52,334
Did you not tell your father
about you coming here?

594
00:36:53,904 --> 00:36:55,394
No, not yet.

595
00:36:56,124 --> 00:36:57,904
I'm going to tell him soon.

596
00:36:58,994 --> 00:37:00,384
Are those the only shoes you have?

597
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:01,394
Excuse me?

598
00:37:03,234 --> 00:37:04,074
Yes.

599
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:11,954
Wear those for now.

600
00:37:12,184 --> 00:37:13,344
Yours are too shabby.

601
00:37:15,364 --> 00:37:17,254
This is Choi In-ha, from MSC News.

602
00:37:17,344 --> 00:37:18,224
Ms In-ha.

603
00:37:18,364 --> 00:37:19,744
Let's give it a try one more time.

604
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,514
As you have just seen,

605
00:37:21,604 --> 00:37:23,514
I'm a Pinocchio,
and thus, cannot tell a lie.

606
00:37:23,604 --> 00:37:25,794
And I'm the first Pinocchio reporter
in Korea.

607
00:37:25,884 --> 00:37:28,044
-There are two promises...
-Let's go one more time.

608
00:37:31,364 --> 00:37:32,524
Ready, Cue!

609
00:37:32,704 --> 00:37:34,314
I'm a Pinocchio, and thus, cannot lie.

610
00:37:34,404 --> 00:37:36,444
And I'm the first Pinocchio
reporter in Korea.

611
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:38,414
This is Choi In-ha, from MSC News.

612
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:44,024
Your core as a trainee reporter
is the National Forensics Lab.

613
00:37:44,204 --> 00:37:46,334
Here, a single strand of hair
or fingerprint found

614
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,314
at a crime scene,
determines a person's life.

615
00:37:48,404 --> 00:37:49,894
The same applies to over a news case.

616
00:37:50,154 --> 00:37:52,694
You must think of everything found
at a crime scene as evidence

617
00:37:52,784 --> 00:37:54,414
and be able to bet your life on it.

618
00:37:55,094 --> 00:37:56,754
The power of science that reveals truth.

619
00:37:57,004 --> 00:37:58,214
You must know that power

620
00:37:58,584 --> 00:38:00,584
in order for you to decode your own truth.

621
00:38:00,964 --> 00:38:01,994
And also...

622
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:06,404
you will be able to attend
the human autopsy.

623
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:08,204
The highlight of this whole tour.

624
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:09,614
You can look forward to it.

625
00:38:12,764 --> 00:38:15,284
This is the corpse of a 41-year-old male.

626
00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:18,464
Even though it may appear
that he was burned to death,

627
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:22,134
there's no indication
of any smoke inhalation in the lungs.

628
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:24,414
It means, he's already dead
before his body burned.

629
00:38:24,504 --> 00:38:27,734
From the condition of the esophagus
and the gastro-intestines,

630
00:38:27,824 --> 00:38:29,859
it seems that poisoning
was the real cause of death.

631
00:38:30,384 --> 00:38:31,654
Are you okay?

632
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,834
I have to get through this
even if I'm not.

633
00:38:34,224 --> 00:38:35,724
I can't get targeted again.

634
00:38:36,254 --> 00:38:39,242
Should we have ox blood soup,
or intestine soup for lunch?

635
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:40,783
Intestine soup sounds good.

636
00:38:41,544 --> 00:38:42,644
What the...

637
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:45,334
What the... What...

638
00:38:46,054 --> 00:38:46,894
Yu-Rae!

639
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:48,784
Yu-Rae.

640
00:38:51,004 --> 00:38:53,004
Don’t look back!

641
00:39:06,014 --> 00:39:07,423
Have you told your father?

642
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:13,654
I'm home.

643
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:15,274
Come, sit down.

644
00:39:15,524 --> 00:39:16,444
Let's have dinner.

645
00:39:16,664 --> 00:39:17,504
Okay.

646
00:39:18,044 --> 00:39:20,214
Why do you wear a suit when you work
at a convenience store?

647
00:39:20,304 --> 00:39:22,004
Did they hire you as a full-time employee?

648
00:39:22,144 --> 00:39:24,344
Stop irritating her. That’s enough.

649
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,964
Dad, Grandfather.

650
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,264
-The truth is...
-I'm home.

651
00:39:29,464 --> 00:39:31,124
Welcome home, Dal-Po.

652
00:39:31,384 --> 00:39:33,084
Let's all sit down to dinner.

653
00:39:34,174 --> 00:39:35,014
Sure.

654
00:39:38,304 --> 00:39:39,614
What is this?

655
00:39:39,704 --> 00:39:41,994
I made your favorite tripe soup.

656
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:45,284
I put lots of tripe and intestines,

657
00:39:45,434 --> 00:39:46,611
so it has a very deep flavor.

658
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:49,574
What's wrong?

659
00:39:50,414 --> 00:39:51,483
Uncle, what's wrong?

660
00:39:53,294 --> 00:39:54,484
It's nothing.

661
00:39:56,124 --> 00:39:57,204
Oh, my.

662
00:39:58,314 --> 00:39:59,154
Here.

663
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:07,824
Dal-Po.

664
00:40:09,334 --> 00:40:10,274
Dal-Po.

665
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:11,684
-What's wrong with him?
-Oh, my.

666
00:40:11,774 --> 00:40:13,194
Does man get morning sickness, too?

667
00:40:26,934 --> 00:40:28,344
Don't get any wrong ideas!

668
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:37,754
It's cold out.

669
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:39,814
Dal-Po.

670
00:40:44,254 --> 00:40:45,354
How do you feel?

671
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,000
Here, I've bought medicine.

672
00:40:50,234 --> 00:40:51,084
I'm fine.

673
00:40:51,174 --> 00:40:52,904
You're making yourself sick
from exhaustion.

674
00:40:53,234 --> 00:40:54,874
The job is stressful, isn't it?

675
00:40:55,814 --> 00:40:56,654
No.

676
00:40:56,844 --> 00:40:58,114
It's okay. I like it.

677
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,574
Keeping things bottled
in will make you sick.

678
00:41:03,034 --> 00:41:04,614
You can't do anything if you get sick.

679
00:41:04,914 --> 00:41:07,284
You have to tell people if you're ill

680
00:41:07,514 --> 00:41:08,844
in order to treat the illness.

681
00:41:09,084 --> 00:41:11,104
And let others know
when you're struggling,

682
00:41:11,254 --> 00:41:13,244
so that people can help you.

683
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:14,804
Do you understand?

684
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:16,274
Yes.

685
00:41:16,454 --> 00:41:17,374
I know.

686
00:41:17,614 --> 00:41:19,034
I'll let you know if I'm struggling.

687
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:20,424
Alright.

688
00:41:20,574 --> 00:41:22,334
-Just keep that in mind.
-Hyungnim.

689
00:41:23,964 --> 00:41:24,824
Eat this.

690
00:41:25,284 --> 00:41:26,774
Take one dose 30 minutes after meal.

691
00:41:27,294 --> 00:41:28,934
I'm the only one who care of you, right?

692
00:41:29,214 --> 00:41:30,674
Geez.

693
00:41:31,964 --> 00:41:33,934
You're several steps too late.

694
00:41:34,694 --> 00:41:36,264
I already got him some medicine.

695
00:41:40,424 --> 00:41:41,264
Thanks.

696
00:42:23,454 --> 00:42:24,964
Dad still not out yet?

697
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:33,894
Yeah, he's taking his time.

698
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:38,464
I'm late.

699
00:42:38,654 --> 00:42:40,654
I'll wash up first.

700
00:42:41,704 --> 00:42:42,984
Where do you think you're going?

701
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,374
I'm late, too.

702
00:42:44,804 --> 00:42:47,354
But I won't take long.

703
00:42:50,084 --> 00:42:51,272
I said, I'm late, too.

704
00:42:53,424 --> 00:42:54,654
Move your hand.

705
00:42:55,054 --> 00:42:55,994
No!

706
00:43:01,024 --> 00:43:03,334
It will be really hard for you
if you go in right now.

707
00:43:09,224 --> 00:43:10,434
-You go first
-No!

708
00:43:10,764 --> 00:43:11,614
No!

709
00:43:11,864 --> 00:43:13,274
No, you go in first.

710
00:43:13,364 --> 00:43:14,284
Seriously!

711
00:43:21,174 --> 00:43:23,884
You said you're running late,
so I'm letting you go first.

712
00:43:23,974 --> 00:43:27,034
Dad! What did you eat last night?

713
00:43:27,284 --> 00:43:29,435
This smells like trash!

714
00:43:38,394 --> 00:43:40,614
These are papers from a trash can
of Homicide department.

715
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:41,864
Put these back together

716
00:43:42,264 --> 00:43:44,064
and see if you find something newsworthy.

717
00:43:44,294 --> 00:43:45,314
Understood?

718
00:43:45,604 --> 00:43:46,624
-Excuse me?
-Excuse me?

719
00:43:47,774 --> 00:43:50,314
It's almost time to go home.
When are we ever going to...

720
00:43:51,884 --> 00:43:53,474
We can get it done.

721
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,934
No one goes home until this is finished.

722
00:43:57,624 --> 00:43:58,684
Understood?

723
00:43:59,124 --> 00:44:00,234
-Yes, Sir!
-Yes, Sir!

724
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:15,864
I heard that Nitpicker Jang takes the
lowest scoring trainee under his wing.

725
00:44:16,304 --> 00:44:18,774
And I currently have
the lowest score, don't I?

726
00:44:19,904 --> 00:44:20,994
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

727
00:44:22,544 --> 00:44:24,654
That means I'll be with
Nitpicker Jang's, will I?

728
00:44:25,284 --> 00:44:26,124
Yeah.

729
00:44:26,494 --> 00:44:28,214
Are you crying?

730
00:44:28,364 --> 00:44:30,202
No, it's because I was yawning.

731
00:44:37,774 --> 00:44:38,614
Hey.

732
00:44:38,904 --> 00:44:40,524
You still haven't fixed the bumper?

733
00:44:41,044 --> 00:44:41,884
Why?

734
00:44:42,004 --> 00:44:43,764
Is the person responsible refused to pay?

735
00:44:43,854 --> 00:44:45,854
I'm just going to let him off the hook.

736
00:44:46,264 --> 00:44:47,304
It's just a slight dent.

737
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,444
No.

738
00:44:48,534 --> 00:44:50,694
Don’t let it slide even for that person.

739
00:44:50,914 --> 00:44:52,294
If a person commits a wrongdoing,

740
00:44:52,384 --> 00:44:54,164
then they have to be responsible for it.

741
00:44:54,384 --> 00:44:57,244
Do you think he's going to be grateful
for you letting him off the hook?

742
00:44:57,334 --> 00:44:58,984
It'll just make him more irresponsible.

743
00:44:59,164 --> 00:45:00,014
Is that true?

744
00:45:00,104 --> 00:45:01,774
You have to make him pay for it.

745
00:45:01,864 --> 00:45:04,166
I told you that you can get 100 dollars
for the damage.

746
00:45:04,257 --> 00:45:05,097
Yes.

747
00:45:05,474 --> 00:45:06,394
I'll keep that in mind.

748
00:45:06,484 --> 00:45:07,484
Yeah, right.

749
00:45:08,744 --> 00:45:10,264
-Make sure to get the money.
-Okay.

750
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:36,144
We could never ever finish this.

751
00:45:37,004 --> 00:45:37,844
I feel like...

752
00:45:38,334 --> 00:45:40,584
aged 10 years putting these back together.

753
00:45:41,254 --> 00:45:42,314
What are we going to do?

754
00:45:47,694 --> 00:45:48,534
Hello?

755
00:45:48,774 --> 00:45:49,614
Yes.

756
00:45:50,184 --> 00:45:52,304
The bumper? Of course, I remember.

757
00:45:52,744 --> 00:45:54,314
Of course, I'll
reimburse you for it.

758
00:45:54,674 --> 00:45:55,724
I'm glad you called.

759
00:45:56,264 --> 00:45:57,264
When would you...

760
00:45:59,564 --> 00:46:00,564
Right now?

761
00:46:02,294 --> 00:46:03,334
No, it's not that...

762
00:46:05,344 --> 00:46:06,624
Yes, I understand.

763
00:46:06,754 --> 00:46:07,864
I'll be right there.

764
00:46:08,594 --> 00:46:10,474
Hey, where do you think you're going?

765
00:46:10,794 --> 00:46:12,374
I have to step out real quick.

766
00:46:12,734 --> 00:46:14,024
Hey, are you out of your mind?

767
00:46:14,114 --> 00:46:16,134
Nitpicker Jang will kill you
if you get caught.

768
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:18,814
Yes, where should I meet you?

769
00:46:18,994 --> 00:46:19,884
Hey, Dal-Po.

770
00:46:20,164 --> 00:46:21,914
How about somewhere around my house?

771
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:24,874
Yes, my address is...

772
00:46:25,134 --> 00:46:25,974
Yes.

773
00:46:26,224 --> 00:46:27,314
Yes, I know where that is.

774
00:47:04,894 --> 00:47:06,744
Yes, I'm here.

775
00:47:06,934 --> 00:47:08,134
How far away are you?

776
00:47:08,964 --> 00:47:10,114
Please wait for a while.

777
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:11,644
I'm almost there myself.

778
00:47:14,344 --> 00:47:15,184
Yes.

779
00:47:15,354 --> 00:47:16,324
I think I see the car.

780
00:47:32,054 --> 00:47:33,084
This isn't the truck.

781
00:47:33,244 --> 00:47:35,684
I'm a good friend of the truck owner.

782
00:47:36,004 --> 00:47:37,464
I was getting frustrated with him,

783
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:39,104
so I called you myself.

784
00:47:39,334 --> 00:47:42,164
This is what his bumper looks like,

785
00:47:42,354 --> 00:47:43,794
yet he still won't get it fixed.

786
00:47:44,134 --> 00:47:44,984
Yes.

787
00:47:51,564 --> 00:47:53,314
He's just a big softie,

788
00:47:53,644 --> 00:47:55,224
so he'd never ask for compensation.

789
00:47:55,474 --> 00:47:56,774
But it frustrates me,

790
00:47:56,864 --> 00:47:59,143
so instead, I'm asking in his place.

791
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:00,301
That's why I'm here.

792
00:48:00,664 --> 00:48:03,154
I just felt business is business.

793
00:48:03,734 --> 00:48:05,174
Yes, I'm glad you did.

794
00:48:11,304 --> 00:48:13,474
-Mr Moon Duk-soo?
-Yes.

795
00:48:16,084 --> 00:48:18,924
Are you the one who called
about my missing wallet?

796
00:48:19,244 --> 00:48:21,684
Yes, but I don't have the wallet
on me right now.

797
00:48:22,284 --> 00:48:24,444
I came straight here after work,
so it's still at home.

798
00:48:25,634 --> 00:48:26,904
Okay.

799
00:48:27,534 --> 00:48:30,004
My house is around the corner.
Why don't you come with me?

800
00:48:31,604 --> 00:48:32,604
Well... sure.

801
00:48:41,304 --> 00:48:42,874
I didn't know anyone lived around here.

802
00:48:43,604 --> 00:48:45,569
Everything looks demolished.

803
00:48:46,194 --> 00:48:47,894
My house is just around that corner.

804
00:48:51,074 --> 00:48:52,984
Sorry, but may I borrow your cellphone?

805
00:48:53,904 --> 00:48:55,254
Mine just ran out of battery.

806
00:48:58,834 --> 00:49:00,464
-Make it short.
-Thank you.

807
00:49:00,984 --> 00:49:02,074
We can just keep walking.

808
00:49:06,184 --> 00:49:07,184
It's cold.

809
00:49:54,114 --> 00:49:55,864
Was I not clear about no one going home

810
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:57,884
until you put all the papers
back together?

811
00:49:58,024 --> 00:49:58,864
Yes, you were.

812
00:49:59,184 --> 00:50:00,024
I'm sorry.

813
00:50:00,454 --> 00:50:02,644
Everyone, pack your belongings
and go home.

814
00:50:04,324 --> 00:50:05,254
Get up!

815
00:50:05,364 --> 00:50:06,224
That startled me.

816
00:50:07,664 --> 00:50:08,524
And also!

817
00:50:10,054 --> 00:50:13,234
Choi Dal-Po will finish putting the rest
of these together before going home.

818
00:50:13,994 --> 00:50:15,174
Yes, I understand.

819
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:22,944
That’s too bad for Choi Dal-Po.

820
00:50:23,034 --> 00:50:25,374
I think he's definitely been targeted
by Nitpicker Jang.

821
00:50:26,234 --> 00:50:29,224
I feel bad for Choi Dal-Po,
but thanks to him

822
00:50:29,524 --> 00:50:31,180
we've escaped being assigned
under Nitpicker Jang.

823
00:50:31,764 --> 00:50:33,064
I feel really bad for Dal-Po.

824
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:39,664
Hey, are you smiling right now?

825
00:50:42,064 --> 00:50:43,584
-No.
-No, I think you were.

826
00:50:43,884 --> 00:50:45,014
No, I didn't.

827
00:50:45,364 --> 00:50:47,574
Dal-Po goes to Han River district...

828
00:50:47,934 --> 00:50:49,017
God! I must've lost my mind.

829
00:50:49,474 --> 00:50:52,624
It's just that I feel bad
about Dal-Po falling

830
00:50:53,544 --> 00:50:55,114
under Nitpicker's jurisdiction.

831
00:51:05,174 --> 00:51:06,714
Wow, your connection is the Director?

832
00:51:06,804 --> 00:51:07,824
Cool!

833
00:51:07,914 --> 00:51:09,784
Just lower your speech
since we're coworkers now.

834
00:51:09,874 --> 00:51:10,714
Should I?

835
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:13,934
But the name, Bum-Jo, sounds familiar.
Where have I heard that name before?

836
00:51:14,024 --> 00:51:16,634
It's the name of a department store.
'Bum-Jo Department Store'.

837
00:51:17,294 --> 00:51:18,474
The store was named after me.

838
00:51:19,224 --> 00:51:20,164
Is that right?

839
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:22,634
There's a university
that's been named after me, too.

840
00:51:23,044 --> 00:51:24,124
I'm being serious.

841
00:51:24,704 --> 00:51:25,954
Hey, want this?

842
00:51:26,954 --> 00:51:28,354
This is what I like the most.

843
00:51:29,394 --> 00:51:31,614
But doesn't it seem like
we see each other quite often?

844
00:51:32,064 --> 00:51:33,174
Is it just coincidence?

845
00:51:33,264 --> 00:51:34,894
How can it be just coincidence?

846
00:51:35,824 --> 00:51:36,834
The truth is...

847
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:41,334
The inability to lie can be a weakness
as a reporter.

848
00:51:41,424 --> 00:51:42,264
No.

849
00:51:42,554 --> 00:51:44,234
I see it as a positive merit.

850
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:46,354
Reporters are supposed to tell the truth.

851
00:51:46,574 --> 00:51:49,624
News reports being created and told
by a reporter who can't lie

852
00:51:50,004 --> 00:51:51,824
will lend more credibility to the viewers.

853
00:51:52,224 --> 00:51:53,064
No.

854
00:51:53,154 --> 00:51:54,144
I can guarantee it.

855
00:51:54,434 --> 00:51:57,724
As you have just seen,
I'm a Pinocchio, and thus, cannot lie.

856
00:51:58,074 --> 00:52:00,824
And I'm also the first Pinocchio reporter
in this country.

857
00:52:00,924 --> 00:52:05,384
As your new MSC news reporter,
I can promise you two things.

858
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:07,264
First.

859
00:52:07,364 --> 00:52:09,194
I will only relay the truth.

860
00:52:09,554 --> 00:52:10,394
Second.

861
00:52:10,504 --> 00:52:13,614
I promise to keep my first promise.

862
00:52:15,194 --> 00:52:17,274
I'm Choi In-ha from MSC News.

863
00:52:18,004 --> 00:52:19,204
I'm Choi In-ha...

864
00:52:20,184 --> 00:52:21,574
from MSC News.

865
00:52:25,954 --> 00:52:27,874
Who cares whether
it was coincidence or not?

866
00:52:29,194 --> 00:52:30,874
All that matters
is that we've finally met.

867
00:52:41,334 --> 00:52:42,294
Hello, Sir.

868
00:52:42,574 --> 00:52:43,574
Carry on.

869
00:52:46,724 --> 00:52:49,854
It'll be no joke once Jang Hyun-gyu
makes up his mind to pick on someone.

870
00:52:50,354 --> 00:52:51,774
Don't you find this to be a vicious?

871
00:52:52,004 --> 00:52:54,314
No, I don't think of it that way.

872
00:52:55,194 --> 00:52:56,714
If my memory serves me right,

873
00:52:57,014 --> 00:52:58,884
you're not someone
who'd be here doing this.

874
00:52:59,694 --> 00:53:02,784
And you're especially not someone
who'd listen to your senior

875
00:53:03,174 --> 00:53:04,374
just to become a reporter.

876
00:53:05,184 --> 00:53:06,294
I'm not sure what you're saying.

877
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:07,714
Give me a straight answer.

878
00:53:07,874 --> 00:53:10,735
Because I remember every single word
that you said to me eight years ago.

879
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:12,954
I'm not sure.

880
00:53:13,264 --> 00:53:15,084
I don't really remember.

881
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:17,924
Why did you walk
into this sewage of a place?

882
00:53:18,434 --> 00:53:21,983
What made you become a reporter who
wields their mic and camera like weapons?

883
00:53:34,714 --> 00:53:35,844
Don't worry.

884
00:53:36,814 --> 00:53:38,094
It's just you and I in here.

885
00:53:38,354 --> 00:53:39,374
So...

886
00:53:39,534 --> 00:53:41,504
tell me the truth mano-a-mano.

887
00:53:42,474 --> 00:53:44,044
Because nothing you say in here...

888
00:53:44,534 --> 00:53:46,874
will be held against you,
and will be kept confidential.

889
00:53:48,374 --> 00:53:50,344
What do you want to be
a reporter all of a sudden?

890
00:53:50,854 --> 00:53:51,904
Did you suddenly...

891
00:53:52,674 --> 00:53:54,224
come to like reporter or something?

892
00:53:58,994 --> 00:54:00,054
Of course...

893
00:54:01,214 --> 00:54:02,244
that is not possible.

894
00:54:11,354 --> 00:54:13,354
I still find this place stifling

895
00:54:13,624 --> 00:54:15,294
and find reporters to be disgusting.

896
00:54:15,494 --> 00:54:16,334
Then...

897
00:54:17,084 --> 00:54:18,344
why are you here?

898
00:54:21,144 --> 00:54:22,194
It's because of my name.

899
00:54:23,234 --> 00:54:25,714
-Your name?
-I will do anything to get through

900
00:54:26,145 --> 00:54:28,145
this training period, and once I get

901
00:54:28,324 --> 00:54:30,674
my own mic in my hands,
I want to announce my real name.

902
00:54:33,484 --> 00:54:34,464
Your real name?

903
00:54:34,764 --> 00:54:36,944
Then, are you saying that...

904
00:54:37,564 --> 00:54:38,917
That your current name is a fake?

905
00:54:41,664 --> 00:54:42,504
Yes.

906
00:54:42,974 --> 00:54:44,444
What are you doing?

907
00:54:44,724 --> 00:54:46,404
Who the heck are you?

908
00:54:47,054 --> 00:54:49,124
You've got some impressive voice.

909
00:54:50,594 --> 00:54:51,964
But your efforts are useless.

910
00:54:52,594 --> 00:54:54,344
Like you said, this is a demolition site,

911
00:54:54,504 --> 00:54:55,664
so no one ever comes here.

912
00:54:56,694 --> 00:54:59,914
What wrong have I ever done
to you to deserve this?

913
00:55:00,624 --> 00:55:03,264
Answer me. Tell me who you are.

914
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:06,084
What's your real name?

915
00:55:13,074 --> 00:55:15,034
I'm Firefighter Ki Ho-sang's son.

916
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,264
Ki Ha-myung.

917
00:55:23,294 --> 00:55:24,134
What?

918
00:55:24,574 --> 00:55:26,374
Firefighter Ki Ho-sang?

919
00:55:28,054 --> 00:55:30,764
Do you remember...that name?

920
00:55:32,544 --> 00:55:34,664
The skeletal remains
that have recently been found.

921
00:55:35,764 --> 00:55:37,394
I'm that Firefighter Ki Ho-sang's son.

922
00:55:39,354 --> 00:55:40,194
What?

923
00:55:46,814 --> 00:55:47,654
What...

924
00:55:48,024 --> 00:55:49,769
What are you going to do to me?

925
00:55:51,904 --> 00:55:52,874
I want to...

926
00:55:54,144 --> 00:55:56,054
make you aware...

927
00:55:56,964 --> 00:55:58,374
of how my father passed away.

928
00:56:00,134 --> 00:56:03,534
You're that firefighter’s...son?

929
00:56:05,834 --> 00:56:06,674
Yes.

930
00:56:08,324 --> 00:56:09,494
Because of you people...

931
00:56:10,664 --> 00:56:12,374
I've lost both my mother and father,

932
00:56:12,724 --> 00:56:13,984
as well as my older brother.

933
00:56:16,644 --> 00:56:18,064
And I've also lost my own name.

934
00:56:19,864 --> 00:56:21,254
And very recently,

935
00:56:21,874 --> 00:56:25,174
I've also discovered how unjustly my
father passed away because of you people.

936
00:56:32,064 --> 00:56:35,364
I have so much to say
and just as many questions to ask.

937
00:56:35,924 --> 00:56:37,624
And there's a person
that I'd like to find.

938
00:56:41,904 --> 00:56:43,834
I thought long and hard...

939
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,864
about who could accomplish
all those tasks.

940
00:56:51,334 --> 00:56:52,174
And...

941
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,841
the answer I found left me astonished.

942
00:57:02,074 --> 00:57:03,804
You're going to die down in there.

943
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:08,704
But no one will find out
about your death.

944
00:57:09,684 --> 00:57:11,894
They'll just believe
that you're hiding away somewhere.

945
00:57:12,654 --> 00:57:15,264
Don’t let me die in here!

946
00:57:15,444 --> 00:57:16,284
And...

947
00:57:19,314 --> 00:57:20,434
everyone in this world...

948
00:57:21,544 --> 00:57:24,574
will remember you as the devil
that killed your friends for their money.

949
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,174
What do you mean by that?

950
00:57:29,854 --> 00:57:32,034
I've never killed anyone in my life!

951
00:57:37,194 --> 00:57:38,064
I know.

952
00:57:39,104 --> 00:57:40,654
But the world won't know that.

953
00:57:41,684 --> 00:57:43,344
Not even your own families.

954
00:57:46,574 --> 00:57:47,474
The world...

955
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:50,914
will remember you as a murderer
and heinous criminal.

956
00:57:51,444 --> 00:57:54,704
Your family will live
the rest of their lives

957
00:57:54,794 --> 00:57:56,874
being taunted and insulted by others.

958
00:57:57,684 --> 00:58:00,554
They'll come to realize death isn't
the only way to experience pure hell.

959
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:01,644
And was that answer...

960
00:58:02,994 --> 00:58:04,014
to become a reporter?

961
00:58:08,034 --> 00:58:09,064
Forgive me!

962
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:11,684
I'm so sorry for my wrongdoing!

963
00:58:11,774 --> 00:58:12,914
Later on...

964
00:58:14,034 --> 00:58:16,974
even if you're lucky enough to have
your skeletal remains discovered...

965
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:19,864
no one will have
even the slightest interest

966
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,924
in finding out how wrongful
your death was!

967
00:58:22,224 --> 00:58:24,114
Just like my father!

968
00:58:33,924 --> 00:58:34,764
Yes.

969
00:58:36,954 --> 00:58:38,374
That's why I became a reporter.

970
00:58:39,094 --> 00:58:40,984
Because a reporter
can do all those things.

971
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:43,384
So...

972
00:58:46,664 --> 00:58:49,624
Local News

973
00:58:51,834 --> 00:58:53,364
I'll try my best to learn the skills...

974
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:54,604
Cap.

975
00:59:16,104 --> 00:59:17,054
Run immediately!

976
00:59:17,144 --> 00:59:18,964
I'm running, but I'll run faster!

977
00:59:19,054 --> 00:59:20,164
Yes, I understand.

978
00:59:20,374 --> 00:59:21,214
Uncle.

979
00:59:21,404 --> 00:59:23,764
-Why are you coming from there?
-He looked a lot like you.

980
00:59:23,854 --> 00:59:26,964
-Like me?
-You can use me as your helper.

981
00:59:27,104 --> 00:59:29,594
Ahn Chan-soo? We were never
