1
00:00:09,763 --> 00:00:11,926
Pinocchio

2
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,442
I don't have any other reason either.

3
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,320
I'm doing this because
I want to reveal the truth.

4
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,573
The good and the bad. As they are.

5
00:00:47,571 --> 00:00:48,499
In my own way...

6
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:51,762
I just wanted to let the world...

7
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,138
Bum-Jo.

8
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:58,624
Although it was brief,
I was a reporter too.

9
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,170
Just why do you have to go this far?

10
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,666
Just why...

11
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,617
I told you before.

12
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,115
That I'm on your side.

13
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,988
Why would I be doing this...

14
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,290
if I wasn't on your side?

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,890
Do you believe me now?

16
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,950
I believed you from the beginning,
you crazy bastard.

17
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,310
Final Episode -Peter Pan

18
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:50,803
Sir, please let us see Bum-Jo.

19
00:01:50,894 --> 00:01:52,654
We have to see him.

20
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:56,522
People have lined up to see him.

21
00:01:56,622 --> 00:01:59,301
But he doesn't want to see anyone
so what do you want me to do?

22
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,402
I don't know about other people
but he'll see us.

23
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:02,529
I already asked him.

24
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,492
But he said he doesn't want
to see you guys especially.

25
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:08,522
You know that Bum-Jo is not the culprit.

26
00:02:08,622 --> 00:02:11,142
-So...
-I do think that it's odd, too.

27
00:02:11,242 --> 00:02:12,522
But there's nothing I can do.

28
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,072
There's evidence that he met
with Cho Dae-good

29
00:02:15,172 --> 00:02:16,862
and a prison officer testified for it.

30
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:19,232
His motive is all matching up.

31
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:21,372
-So how can I just release him?
-Sir!

32
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:23,022
What?

33
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:26,362
He gave a false confession.
He's not the real culprit.

34
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:29,022
That's why the real culprit
has to turn himself in

35
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,782
or Seo Bum-Jo has to confess
who the real culprit is.

36
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,833
I can't release him until then.

37
00:02:37,602 --> 00:02:39,622
Yes, Captain.

38
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:41,362
Excuse me?

39
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:45,472
Park Rosa is going to report
to the police tonight?

40
00:02:53,332 --> 00:02:55,582
At 8 PM tonight, Chairwoman Park Rosa

41
00:02:55,682 --> 00:02:58,642
will report to Han River police,
so have everyone get ready.

42
00:02:58,732 --> 00:03:01,902
The guy who turned himself in as the one
who ordered the terror on reporters

43
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:03,372
is Chairwoman Park Rosa's son.

44
00:03:03,512 --> 00:03:06,482
This case is really important
so make sure to get everything.

45
00:03:06,582 --> 00:03:08,352
Seniority doesn't matter.
Just get in there.

46
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:11,672
There's a rumor that she's coming
to turn herself in as the real culprit.

47
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:15,412
-Make sure to get her movements.
-Confirm if she ordered it or not.

48
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:17,292
Everyone in Han River District,
stay alert.

49
00:03:17,392 --> 00:03:18,642
Since she's a conglomerate,

50
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:21,232
all the TV stations, media
and reporters will be there.

51
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:22,732
Go there and get ready right now.

52
00:03:22,832 --> 00:03:24,762
Get a good place in the photo line.
Alright?

53
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:30,552
Is she really reporting to the police
to turn herself in?

54
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:31,902
We'll find out.

55
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:33,742
Yes, Chief. It's me.

56
00:03:35,722 --> 00:03:39,382
She's going to turn herself in.
That's the only way to get her son out.

57
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:43,852
-Really?
-She is crazy about her son at least.

58
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:48,202
Seo Bum-Jo turned himself in
because he knew that.

59
00:03:48,302 --> 00:03:51,362
He turned himself in to make
Chairwoman Park report to the police?

60
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:53,602
More than that...

61
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:56,233
Perhaps he did that to have her stand
before the reporters?

62
00:03:58,212 --> 00:04:01,258
To let you guys to ask questions properly.

63
00:04:04,697 --> 00:04:06,782
What time is Chairman Park
going to report to the police?

64
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:10,872
-Are you going to come?
-I have to see it.

65
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:12,942
I gave up everything to get here...

66
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:15,061
...just to see Chairwoman Park
stand before the reporters.

67
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:18,372
Go ask your questions properly.

68
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:21,251
Since this is a precious chance
your friend made for you guys.

69
00:04:51,182 --> 00:04:52,972
Ma'am.

70
00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:55,456
It's not too late to turn the car around.

71
00:04:55,772 --> 00:05:00,685
We can get your son released
even if you don't do this.

72
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:03,262
If we pass this without the reporters,

73
00:05:03,362 --> 00:05:06,622
we can wrap this up with
just community service for your son.

74
00:05:06,722 --> 00:05:07,949
I told you already!

75
00:05:08,714 --> 00:05:11,062
I can not leave my son in jail
for even one minute.

76
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:13,556
Didn't you say that I have to go
to have my son released?

77
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:17,415
Yes, I understand.

78
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:21,492
Then you absolutely cannot

79
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:25,147
respond emotionally
in front of the reporters.

80
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:26,776
I know. Do you think I'm stupid?

81
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:38,206
Wrap it around one more time please.

82
00:05:51,772 --> 00:05:53,322
Trusted & Beloved Han River Police

83
00:05:57,422 --> 00:05:58,944
Why are you erasing the questions?

84
00:05:59,372 --> 00:06:03,862
Il-joo gave me these questions
but they're too embarrassing to use.

85
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:05,400
What are the questions?

86
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:11,597
Why are you, a conglomerate, showing
a good example of conforming to the law?

87
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:14,201
It's known that your love
for your son is very deep.

88
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:16,651
Are you suspicious that the investigation
might have targeted that?

89
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:22,059
Why don't you just yell,
“Cheer up, Chairwoman”?

90
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:24,446
Mom.

91
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:29,300
Make sure you know this.

92
00:06:29,582 --> 00:06:32,890
There are only two things that
Ms Park will say to the reporters.

93
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:37,416
That she will cooperate with
the police examination faithfully.

94
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,492
"I'll cooperate with
the police examination faithfully."

95
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:42,832
"I'm sorry to have concerned you."

96
00:06:42,932 --> 00:06:44,665
You just have to reply with
these two statements.

97
00:06:45,532 --> 00:06:47,482
Lower your stance no matter what.

98
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:50,202
You must not get agitated.

99
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:52,922
Other than these two,
everything else will be found faulty

100
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,332
and it will work against you.

101
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,962
You cannot give them a reason at all.

102
00:07:03,852 --> 00:07:05,819
I'm sorry to have concerned you.

103
00:07:07,664 --> 00:07:09,548
I will cooperate with
the police examination faithfully.

104
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,141
I'm sorry to have concerned you.

105
00:07:14,796 --> 00:07:17,912
What you have to do is to get her to
say things other than those two things.

106
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:21,640
Keep asking her questions
and draw the answer.

107
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,450
Until she admits that
she came to turn herself in,

108
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,214
and that she's the real culprit.

109
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,187
Keep asking her questions.

110
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:39,410
I think you must have a lot of things
you want to ask her, don't you?

111
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:46,716
Chairwoman Park is the one who ordered me
to do all those things.

112
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,279
She's the one who ordered me to
slander your father and press your family.

113
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:53,480
Yes. I know it well.

114
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:57,706
The questions that you wanted to ask me...

115
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,669
Ask her all you want this time
so there will be no regret.

116
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:02,929
I will be with Chairwoman Park

117
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:05,109
and listen to all your questions

118
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:08,563
without leaving a single word out.

119
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:10,839
Mom.

120
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:22,569
Whoa, both brothers are
so tall and handsome.

121
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,889
It will be finished quickly.

122
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:27,099
So please relax your facial expressions.

123
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:31,799
The younger brother's face expression
is kind of dark.

124
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:33,205
Brighten up, okay?

125
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,529
Try to brighten up, will you?

126
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:45,705
How are you going to give reports
with that kind of a face?

127
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:47,273
Jae-myung.

128
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:49,457
I'll promise you.

129
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,779
I'm going to drag down Reporter Song
no matter what.

130
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:55,199
And the day I drag her down,

131
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:58,001
I'm going to question her about
everything in front of the world.

132
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:01,745
Yes. Okay.

133
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:06,364
-Please do that.
-What would you want to ask her then?

134
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,259
When that time comes...

135
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,309
what would you want to ask her the most?

136
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,214
I'll ask her for you.

137
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:21,769
Yes. Please listen to all of them.

138
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,581
All the questions I'll ask you.

139
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:37,606
I'm sorry to have concerned you.

140
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:40,937
I will cooperate with
the police examination faithfully.

141
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,402
I'm sorry to have concerned you.

142
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:48,076
I will cooperate with
the police examination faithfully.

143
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:14,889
I'm sorry to have concerned you.

144
00:10:15,387 --> 00:10:19,109
I will cooperate with
the police examination faithfully.

145
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:24,049
People are appalled by the fact that
a son of a conglomerate has committed

146
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:25,945
a crime of instigating a murder.

147
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:27,885
Why did your son commit such a crime?

148
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:30,275
There are rumors that your son
is connected to gangsters.

149
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:33,205
-Is that true?
-Were you not aware of his crime at all?

150
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:35,705
As a former reporter, why did he terrorize
the reporters?

151
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:39,715
I'm sorry to have concerned you.

152
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:43,034
I will reveal everything
at the police examination.

153
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:49,944
What did he promise to the terrorist
as a reward?

154
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,733
What would you want to ask her then?

155
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:10,143
When that time comes...

156
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:12,613
what would you want to ask her the most?

157
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:14,541
I'll ask her for you.

158
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:17,274
When that times comes...

159
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:21,909
I wouldn't want to ask the questions
that you and I want to ask.

160
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:24,656
What?

161
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,500
You're a reporter.

162
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:34,043
Like a real reporter,

163
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:37,592
I would want you to ask her
what the people are curious about.

164
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:39,919
That's how...

165
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,663
you can be a different reporter
than Reporter Song.

166
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,469
Did you know that your son
ordered it beforehand?

167
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:50,639
I'm sorry to have concerned you.

168
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:52,793
I will cooperate with
the police examination faithfully.

169
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:55,323
Why did you slander my father?

170
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:58,433
Chairwoman Park.

171
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:00,813
Do you think that your son is innocent?

172
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:03,153
Yes. My son is innocent.

173
00:12:05,843 --> 00:12:07,213
Dal-Po.

174
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,102
Why did you slander my family?

175
00:12:13,877 --> 00:12:16,383
When you saw the reporters reporting
your innocent son as a criminal,

176
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:18,145
how did it make you think?

177
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,355
I'm sorry to...

178
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,499
I think it's wrong.

179
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,803
Ma'am, you can't do this.
Just say what you've prepared to say...

180
00:12:45,913 --> 00:12:49,533
Why did you not repent
when you did such things?

181
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,654
Then do you think that
the wrongs should be made right.

182
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,023
Yes.

183
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,483
Of course.

184
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,990
Ma'am. You can't do this.

185
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,053
You need to say that you're sorry
to have...

186
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:05,594
Concerns? What concerns?

187
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:09,020
Just how did I concern everyone!

188
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:19,300
It seems like you feel that this is wrong.

189
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,790
-Please make it right.
-My son is innocent.

190
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,840
-He can even live without the law.
-Then why did he turn himself in?

191
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,520
-He didn't do anything wrong.
-I said my son is innocent.

192
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,220
Before turning himself in,
your son has said that

193
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,440
he'll take the responsibility with you.
What does that mean?

194
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,290
Why would he say that if he's innocent?

195
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,110
-Does that mean your an accomplice?
-Did you conspire together?

196
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,790
-Did you conspire together?
-Did you conspire with your son?

197
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,637
I said no! My son is innocent!

198
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,886
My son is a good person.

199
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,920
He's so good that,

200
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,115
he took it upon himself to go to jail
to protect his mother.

201
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,750
Just what do you know about my son
to slander him like that?

202
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,260
Oh, my gosh.

203
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,190
Did you just admit to the crime?

204
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,850
You just admitted to the crime, right?

205
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,470
-Why did you attack the reporters?
-To hide the connections?

206
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,250
Even as a major shareholder of a station,

207
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,720
isn't it wrong to meddle
in the direction of reporting?

208
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,640
Is it true that major politicians are
connected to this?

209
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,208
At this rate, the shopping mall
at Yeonjoo,

210
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:18,869
no, Bumjo Department store will be ruined.

211
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,335
Now. Let's go.

212
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,430
Please give us one more statement.

213
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,223
Please give us one more statement.

214
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,337
Please give us one more statement.

215
00:14:59,761 --> 00:15:02,434
With this today, this should be top news
for most broadcasting stations, right?

216
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,180
Yeah. With so many eyes focused on this,

217
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,272
it would be really difficult for her
to get out of it.

218
00:15:10,204 --> 00:15:12,863
I'm sure Bum-Jo made this happen
for that reason.

219
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,760
Why didn't you ask her the questions
you wanted to ask?

220
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,078
It was a good opportunity.
It's such a waste.

221
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:21,804
I'm not sure.

222
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,093
Why did I do that?

223
00:15:40,021 --> 00:15:43,473
He really has a talent
for embarrassing people.

224
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:55,527
What are you looking at?

225
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,970
About Bum-Jo...

226
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:02,779
I think he must've have regretted
seeing my texts and coming to see me.

227
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,450
If it wasn't for that,

228
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,753
his mother would've stayed
as a good mother to Bum-Jo...

229
00:16:09,872 --> 00:16:12,044
and he wouldn't have gone to jail.

230
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:17,962
I think I'm a terrible person to Bum-Jo.

231
00:16:26,212 --> 00:16:28,812
Even if it wasn't for you,
he probably would've known at some point.

232
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,990
No matter how much you want to hide it,
the truth always comes out somehow.

233
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,984
No matter what.

234
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:00,648
Cheapskate Dal-Po

235
00:17:02,674 --> 00:17:05,524
My friend. Please give me your autograph.

236
00:17:05,614 --> 00:17:07,356
Your face is on the top news.

237
00:17:08,304 --> 00:17:10,635
-Are you watching the news?
-Yeah, why?

238
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:13,930
-Did you call to brag?
-No. I have something to ask you.

239
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,270
What is it?
Who should I sue for you this time?

240
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,010
Chan-soo.

241
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,414
Do you remember saying that
you started this fight because of me?

242
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,203
Of course. I said it.

243
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,857
-Then, please stop it now.
-What?

244
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,461
Please withdraw your defamation suit
you filed against Chief Song.

245
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,182
Hey, why?

246
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,051
The trial hasn't even started yet.

247
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,295
Did you get the apology?

248
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,054
Yes.

249
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,161
I got it.

250
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,165
Yoon.

251
00:17:46,793 --> 00:17:48,844
Share something that I can present
at today's item meeting.

252
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,344
I only have one.

253
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,279
I can't. I got an amazing item
related to Chairwoman Park's case today.

254
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:56,559
Yoon Yoo-Rae.

255
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,410
I look forward to hear that amazing item.

256
00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:02,247
Captain.

257
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:07,244
Why is he only looking forward to yours?
What about me? What about me?

258
00:18:09,095 --> 00:18:11,519
Oh, my goodness.

259
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,583
I was thinking there's no way,
but I think it's true.

260
00:18:15,683 --> 00:18:16,452
What is?

261
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:19,992
Captain is giving me a sign right now,
right?

262
00:18:20,423 --> 00:18:21,361
Yeah.

263
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:27,395
Why does he keep showing it so much?
It's troublesome at work.

264
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:33,563
What are you doing?
We should go to the meeting.

265
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:41,475
From today, the connection
between Chairwoman Park

266
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:43,466
and the Assemblymen will be covered
by the political desk.

267
00:18:43,808 --> 00:18:47,854
Our team will focus on Chairwoman Park's
attempted murder case related items.

268
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:49,709
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

269
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,473
Let's start with the youngest.

270
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:53,611
-Ki Ha-myung.
-Yes.

271
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:57,013
Chairwoman Park mobilized all legal teams
when she reported to the police.

272
00:18:57,113 --> 00:18:59,981
For her defense counsel, all the attorneys
in the teams will be in it.

273
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,406
If that's true,

274
00:19:01,902 --> 00:19:03,713
it means that she's is using her position

275
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:06,224
to use the company personnel
for her personal use.

276
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:10,091
That could be a story. Go ahead with it.

277
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:12,161
Next. Yoon Yoo-Rae.

278
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,957
I thought about Chairwoman Park
from a different angle.

279
00:19:20,078 --> 00:19:23,637
I analyzed the outfit she was wearing
when she reported to the police.

280
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:26,243
She looks plain at first sight.

281
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:27,807
But if you add up what she's wearing,

282
00:19:27,898 --> 00:19:29,292
it's about the cost of a foreign car.

283
00:19:29,873 --> 00:19:31,422
The handbag is a Swedish luxury brand

284
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:33,431
made with alligator skin
worth 34,000 dollars.

285
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:36,636
The shoes are Iceland luxury brand
worth 4300 dollars.

286
00:19:36,727 --> 00:19:38,923
And the diamond in her brooch is 5 carat.

287
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:40,082
Really? Amazing.

288
00:19:42,106 --> 00:19:45,072
On top of that, her hair was done at
the Collection Shop in Chungdamdong.

289
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:48,206
-It costs at least 1000 dollars to...
-Yoon Yoo-Rae.

290
00:19:49,394 --> 00:19:52,703
What does her fashion got to do
with instigating a murder?

291
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:55,813
Excuse me?

292
00:19:56,758 --> 00:19:59,363
A lot of people are interested in this.

293
00:19:59,454 --> 00:20:01,743
Don't cloud the essence of this case.

294
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:05,370
There are many more important things
than her fashion.

295
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:08,962
Why did she attack the reporters?
What did she try to hide with it?

296
00:20:09,972 --> 00:20:14,065
Focus on what she's trying to do
to get out of police investigation.

297
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:17,943
And watch carefully and see

298
00:20:18,043 --> 00:20:20,835
if this case somehow covering up
an even bigger case or not.

299
00:20:20,926 --> 00:20:25,185
Keep your eyes open and watch carefully.
Do you understand?

300
00:20:25,276 --> 00:20:27,072
Yes Captain.

301
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:42,809
Hey, Yoon.

302
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:48,832
I think you misunderstood
the signs that Captain sent you.

303
00:20:49,473 --> 00:20:50,823
I know!

304
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:56,393
-Hyun-gyu.
-What?

305
00:20:56,493 --> 00:20:58,019
Please give me that hair band.

306
00:20:58,978 --> 00:21:01,606
Starting today, I'm going to start
on the path of a Nitpicker.

307
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:05,039
Good choice.

308
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:11,597
I knew this day would come.

309
00:21:20,735 --> 00:21:21,883
What are you doing?

310
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,575
Don't waste time and get to work.

311
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,109
There are so many stories
you have cover today.

312
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:28,947
Especially...

313
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,745
Those assigned to Han River District,
if you come back empty, you're dead.

314
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:35,223
Yes, sir.

315
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:38,367
Regarding the recent attack
at the TV station,

316
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:40,437
Chairwoman Park revealed she ordered

317
00:21:40,537 --> 00:21:42,377
and planned it during
the police examination.

318
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:44,887
But she stated that she only wanted
to warn the reporters

319
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:47,497
who were covering
the political lobbying of Bumjo Group.

320
00:21:47,617 --> 00:21:50,927
She insisted that she did not order
to murder or harm anyone.

321
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,007
As soon as the police finds out the truth
about the incident

322
00:21:54,107 --> 00:21:56,767
through the cross examination
of Chairwoman Park and her son,

323
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:58,901
they plan to decide who to punish
and the level of punishment.

324
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,770
MSC reporters have started a petition.

325
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,050
As the truth about
the media manipulation conspired

326
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,470
by the major shareholder and
the executives are revealed

327
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,300
voice of self-examination,
was raised within the company.

328
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,686
In the end, even the MSC reporters
are rebelling.

329
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,875
I think Director Yeon will be fired soon.

330
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:22,909
Our Gong-joo's face doesn't look so good.

331
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,971
Will we be able to see him again?

332
00:22:26,143 --> 00:22:29,756
Once MSC returns to normal,
he will return to his position too.

333
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,930
Bumjo Group Chairwoman Park Rosa,
a major shareholder of MSC

334
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,400
who has been unjustly involved
with the reporting,

335
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,523
has announced that she'll dispose
all the shares that Bumjo group owns.

336
00:22:39,623 --> 00:22:42,913
Last week's search and seizure of
Bumjo Group by the prosecutor

337
00:22:43,013 --> 00:22:46,033
and MSC's internal rebellion
have affected the result.

338
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:48,563
As the investigation of the Chairwoman
went into high gear,

339
00:22:48,663 --> 00:22:51,473
Yeonjoo shopping mall which recently
had a groundbreaking ceremony

340
00:22:51,573 --> 00:22:52,553
has halted completely.

341
00:22:52,653 --> 00:22:54,364
It seems inevitable that Bumjo Group

342
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:56,447
will suffer an astronomical
financial loss.

343
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:01,683
Hey.

344
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:04,478
-You came?
-Crazy bastard.

345
00:23:06,203 --> 00:23:09,073
-You don't look so good.
-Really?

346
00:23:09,593 --> 00:23:11,452
It wasn't too bad in jail.

347
00:23:12,213 --> 00:23:13,977
Then, have you been acquitted
and released?

348
00:23:14,903 --> 00:23:15,792
Yeah.

349
00:23:16,183 --> 00:23:18,143
I just got scolded by the team leader.

350
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:22,008
-That's a relief.
-I saw the news.

351
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:27,259
I thought you would question
my mother more harshly...

352
00:23:27,925 --> 00:23:30,913
-But you just acted like a reporter.
-Of course, I'm a reporter.

353
00:23:31,013 --> 00:23:32,906
But it took a lot of me
to give you that chance.

354
00:23:32,997 --> 00:23:34,020
Why didn't you try to vent?

355
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,381
I did more than enough.

356
00:23:38,804 --> 00:23:39,477
Thanks.

357
00:23:40,173 --> 00:23:42,335
What can I do for you?
I'll do anything for you.

358
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:46,182
Seo Bum-Jo, are you alright?
Is it over now?

359
00:23:46,953 --> 00:23:47,571
Yeah.

360
00:23:50,455 --> 00:23:52,671
You said you'll do anything for me, right?

361
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,429
Of course. Just tell me.

362
00:23:56,683 --> 00:23:59,075
Then let me borrow her
for just 30 minutes.

363
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:06,046
Hey. That's...

364
00:24:06,137 --> 00:24:08,725
Let me have just 30 minutes.
I have something to tell you.

365
00:24:11,142 --> 00:24:11,894
That's...

366
00:24:12,722 --> 00:24:14,082
I want to say goodbye.

367
00:24:15,093 --> 00:24:15,998
My final goodbye.

368
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:28,082
Do you remember this place?

369
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:30,593
Of course.
This is the worst memory of my life.

370
00:24:30,683 --> 00:24:32,883
This is where I worked part-time
after I failed the reporter exams.

371
00:24:33,363 --> 00:24:37,783
-But why did you bring me here?
-There's a moment that I regretted.

372
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:39,814
It's about 30 seconds.

373
00:24:40,702 --> 00:24:41,499
30 seconds?

374
00:24:41,623 --> 00:24:46,509
I think it was your birthday.
Your mother came here too.

375
00:24:47,744 --> 00:24:48,681
I remember.

376
00:24:49,443 --> 00:24:51,640
I thought she came
to wish me a happy birthday.

377
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,876
She just told you that she'll hire you
for promotional purposes and left.

378
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:57,784
Yeah.

379
00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:02,243
That birthday was horrible.
No one remembered my birthday that day.

380
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:04,056
I remembered.

381
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:11,852
I came here to give you
your birthday gift that day.

382
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:19,281
But I couldn't give it to you.
Like a fool...

383
00:25:21,193 --> 00:25:21,821
Really?

384
00:25:22,836 --> 00:25:26,741
This is the 30 seconds I regret the most.

385
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:29,163
This is what I wanted to do.

386
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:36,670
Happy birthday, Choi In-ha.

387
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:41,243
I really wanted to see you, Choi In-ha.

388
00:25:44,195 --> 00:25:47,317
I'm glad that I met you, Choi In-ha.

389
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,612
What do you think? I look cool, right?

390
00:25:55,683 --> 00:25:59,310
Do you still think that?
Are you glad you met me?

391
00:25:59,483 --> 00:26:00,511
Of course.

392
00:26:03,203 --> 00:26:05,290
Thank you for saying that.

393
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:09,550
If I keep you any longer,
Ha-myung is going to kill me.

394
00:26:10,043 --> 00:26:11,186
I'm going to go. Bye.

395
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:12,352
Okay.

396
00:26:15,943 --> 00:26:17,121
Hey!

397
00:26:22,203 --> 00:26:23,972
It felt a little unfair to just leave.

398
00:26:25,427 --> 00:26:26,771
I'm really leaving now.

399
00:26:27,783 --> 00:26:28,399
Goodbye.

400
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,919
Notice of dismissal

401
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:47,071
What's that?

402
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:50,647
No indictment.

403
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:55,170
Then it means that
Officer Ahn withdrew the suit.

404
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:56,762
It looks like it.

405
00:26:58,203 --> 00:27:01,833
Isn't that something to be congratulated?
There's no reason to go to the court.

406
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:05,179
-It was resolved cleanly.
-Was it?

407
00:27:06,173 --> 00:27:09,176
Of course. Just endure a little longer.

408
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:14,805
According to some trustworthy sources,
there's a rumor...

409
00:27:15,853 --> 00:27:17,773
that the Director
will be replaced very soon.

410
00:27:19,186 --> 00:27:20,615
Give this to the Director for me.

411
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:22,762
Letter of Resignation

412
00:27:27,702 --> 00:27:28,544
Chief.

413
00:27:29,123 --> 00:27:31,373
The HR meeting was cancelled too.

414
00:27:31,473 --> 00:27:33,845
You just have to endure
for couple more days. So why?

415
00:27:34,743 --> 00:27:37,263
Even that couple of days
are difficult for me.

416
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:38,988
Chief.

417
00:27:40,863 --> 00:27:41,882
You...

418
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:46,746
try to endure to the end.

419
00:27:55,043 --> 00:27:57,220
Did you meet with the legal department?

420
00:27:57,723 --> 00:28:00,226
You're released completely, right?

421
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:02,231
Yes.

422
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,009
That's a relief.

423
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,811
But son...

424
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:10,450
How did you sleep when you were in jail?

425
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:12,843
Your back must've hurt. How did you sleep?

426
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:20,371
I'm alright since I have a lot of fat
on my back,

427
00:28:21,144 --> 00:28:23,826
but it must've been hard for you
since you don't.

428
00:28:26,744 --> 00:28:28,818
I'm alright, mother.

429
00:28:29,471 --> 00:28:30,878
I'm alright.

430
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:33,499
That's right. Everything will be alright.

431
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:35,914
I'm going to be released soon.

432
00:28:36,605 --> 00:28:40,689
It will just be a fine
or community service at most.

433
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:43,093
If I'm unlucky, I might get jail time.

434
00:28:43,193 --> 00:28:45,253
But it won't be longer than 3 years.

435
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:48,061
I've provided so much
for the country's economy.

436
00:28:57,513 --> 00:28:59,584
My son, why are you crying?

437
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:03,540
I'm fine.

438
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:06,823
I know this really well.
It will be forgotten quickly.

439
00:29:06,923 --> 00:29:09,831
Then starting again will be easy.

440
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:14,529
So just study management and wait...

441
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,354
Mother.

442
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:18,941
I have something else I want to study...

443
00:29:20,373 --> 00:29:21,942
other than management.

444
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:25,265
You want to study something else?

445
00:29:38,463 --> 00:29:40,735
Chief Song. Can I talk to you?

446
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:44,403
The prosecution just issued my subpoena.

447
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:46,985
How much did you tell them?

448
00:29:48,143 --> 00:29:49,912
I think I said pretty much everything.

449
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,883
That's right.

450
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:54,843
I forgot to say that you opened
a borrowed-name bank account

451
00:29:54,953 --> 00:29:57,680
and received shares
from Chairwoman Park some time ago.

452
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:01,421
Who is the prosecutor
in charge of your cease?

453
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,831
-I still have information to give.
-Won't you shut up!

454
00:30:10,365 --> 00:30:14,218
-You shut up.
-What? You?

455
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:16,106
Open the door. Open this door!

456
00:30:16,197 --> 00:30:17,813
Open it right now!

457
00:30:17,913 --> 00:30:20,793
Open the door! Open it!

458
00:30:20,893 --> 00:30:22,903
Hey, stop!

459
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,963
I did my duty as a reporter.

460
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:31,825
This is what you should've done
13 years ago.

461
00:30:32,982 --> 00:30:33,853
Yes it is.

462
00:30:33,953 --> 00:30:35,297
I have something to ask you.

463
00:30:35,388 --> 00:30:38,737
Why don't people believe you
even when you tell the truth?

464
00:30:40,761 --> 00:30:42,049
Because I'm a liar.

465
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:45,868
Why can't you even believe yourself?

466
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,433
I've told too many lies.

467
00:30:53,871 --> 00:30:55,633
Are you really a reporter?

468
00:30:57,568 --> 00:30:58,405
No.

469
00:31:16,886 --> 00:31:18,770
By the way,
where did you go with Bumjo last time?

470
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,653
-To the convenience store. Why?
-Because it took longer than I thought.

471
00:31:23,032 --> 00:31:25,722
-Didn't take exactly 30 minutes?
-42 minutes.

472
00:31:27,382 --> 00:31:29,206
You were timing that? That's so petty.

473
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:34,303
No.
I usually don't like not being punctual.

474
00:31:34,403 --> 00:31:35,290
You know that.

475
00:31:36,113 --> 00:31:37,667
No. This is the first time hearing it.

476
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:43,329
Oh, Ji-hee sent the pictures
from the housewarming party.

477
00:31:43,463 --> 00:31:45,263
Send it to me too.

478
00:31:49,138 --> 00:31:50,707
Chan-soo came out really funny.

479
00:31:59,683 --> 00:32:02,433
The baby is so pretty.

480
00:32:02,533 --> 00:32:04,673
-I know.
-What are you looking at?

481
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:07,006
Dad.

482
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:13,199
I want to talk to you both.

483
00:32:15,423 --> 00:32:17,223
-Okay.
-Yes.

484
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:28,858
That picture was taken at
Chan-soo's housewarming party.

485
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:32,059
The baby is Chan-soo's baby.
It came out weird, right?

486
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,465
Why did Ji-hee take a picture like that?

487
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:38,653
The picture was taken coincidentally
without any intention.

488
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:40,617
It's the truth.
We didn't even ask her to take it.

489
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:43,001
I'm not talking about the picture.

490
00:32:47,146 --> 00:32:50,464
A little while ago, I used my dream as
an excuse to ask my father

491
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,284
about you guys seeing each other
as a man and a woman

492
00:32:52,463 --> 00:32:54,560
instead of an uncle and a niece.

493
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:58,171
He said there's no way that could happen.

494
00:32:58,897 --> 00:33:03,275
He told me that it's a nonsense dream
that I should never mention again.

495
00:33:05,265 --> 00:33:07,063
-Mr Choi, we...
-Dal-Po.

496
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:10,313
I think you're too precious
as a son to father.

497
00:33:10,743 --> 00:33:13,722
When you asked him to un-adopt you,
he wouldn't do it.

498
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,634
He said he couldn't lose his son twice.

499
00:33:20,094 --> 00:33:24,133
Whether you hate or like your family,
it's still your family.

500
00:33:24,566 --> 00:33:27,206
Even if you leave this house,
we just have to find you.

501
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,893
This is a connection that we can't sever
for the rest of our lives.

502
00:33:30,352 --> 00:33:32,075
But a romantic relationship
isn't like that.

503
00:33:33,217 --> 00:33:35,793
If you don't like each other,
you become worse than a stranger.

504
00:33:36,003 --> 00:33:37,654
That's why father is against it.

505
00:33:38,824 --> 00:33:41,323
Dad. We'll try to convince grandpa.

506
00:33:41,423 --> 00:33:45,723
-If we talk to him...
-What if he collapses?

507
00:33:46,033 --> 00:33:47,333
What are you going to do?

508
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:49,483
His blood pressure
has gotten high recently too.

509
00:33:49,756 --> 00:33:51,256
Don't you remember the time
at Hyangri Island?

510
00:33:54,253 --> 00:33:56,938
Then you want us to deceive grandpa?
Do you want us to lie?

511
00:33:57,029 --> 00:33:57,741
What if we do?

512
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:01,121
You guys can get along well as
an uncle and niece like before.

513
00:34:01,212 --> 00:34:02,919
Dal-Po,
you don't have to live on your own.

514
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,033
There's nothing bad for my father.

515
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,114
So what's wrong with lying
about something like that?

516
00:34:10,097 --> 00:34:14,583
It won't harm anyone. What's wrong
with lying about something like that?

517
00:34:18,705 --> 00:34:19,877
Dad, please...

518
00:34:26,677 --> 00:34:27,833
Please...

519
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:30,543
Please give us some time to think.

520
00:34:31,776 --> 00:34:33,640
-Dal-Po.
-Alright.

521
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:35,743
Thank you.

522
00:34:42,215 --> 00:34:43,878
To me, this family comes first.

523
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,273
I will never do anything
that will break that.

524
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:52,093
I'll settle it well so please don't worry.

525
00:35:18,528 --> 00:35:21,243
-In-ha. I have something to tell you.
-Wait.

526
00:35:21,844 --> 00:35:23,509
I need to go the bathroom...

527
00:35:32,189 --> 00:35:34,189
You're back immediately after
the Director has been replaced.

528
00:35:36,156 --> 00:35:38,963
Gyo-dong. It's the first time
I've seen you smile that brightly.

529
00:35:39,063 --> 00:35:41,767
Did you miss me that much?

530
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,434
Not at all.

531
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,353
When did you change the passcode
for the entrance door?

532
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:55,537
-That was so petty.
-You know it's changed periodically.

533
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:58,421
Since he's been away,
he's become kind of rude.

534
00:36:01,478 --> 00:36:03,923
But it's such a mystery.

535
00:36:04,014 --> 00:36:07,313
That female reporter from YGN
who came in here drunk and made a mess.

536
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,017
Yoon Yoo-Rae, was it?

537
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:14,972
How did she crawl in here
when she doesn't know the passcode?

538
00:36:16,112 --> 00:36:18,443
-That's true.
-How did she?

539
00:36:28,548 --> 00:36:29,916
Hey, Hwang Gyo-dong!

540
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:34,693
If you're going to be like this,
why did you give me hope?

541
00:36:35,585 --> 00:36:36,751
What was that drink for?

542
00:36:37,183 --> 00:36:39,173
Why did you follow me
to the housewarming party!

543
00:36:39,273 --> 00:36:43,282
Don't toy with me!
You chicken skewer bastard!

544
00:36:46,534 --> 00:36:47,694
Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency

545
00:36:53,933 --> 00:36:57,508
Tell Hwang Gyo-dong to come out.
Hwang Gyo-dong.

546
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,015
This girl really came again.

547
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,802
How did I cloud the essence of the case?

548
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,580
It's become a habit.

549
00:37:11,264 --> 00:37:14,583
-What should we do?
-Call Hwang Gyo-dong.

550
00:37:14,683 --> 00:37:17,042
Tell Hwang Gyo-dong to come out.

551
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:26,877
I'm sorry again.

552
00:37:27,823 --> 00:37:29,219
Please take care of this fast.

553
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,454
It's cold.

554
00:38:29,213 --> 00:38:33,173
Tell Hwang Gyo-dong to come out.
Hwang Gyo-dong.

555
00:38:33,273 --> 00:38:35,595
You shouldn't have given me hope.

556
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:48,814
I'm here.

557
00:38:49,153 --> 00:38:52,388
Wow, you reek of alcohol.
Yoon Yoo-Rae, did you drink?

558
00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:53,763
Yeah.

559
00:38:54,403 --> 00:38:56,303
Looking at your clothes,
you've been here since yesterday.

560
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,054
Did you go into the reporter room
for captains again?

561
00:39:00,461 --> 00:39:03,573
It must be a habit.
Whenever I drink, I go in there.

562
00:39:03,683 --> 00:39:06,053
-How did you get in there?
-I don't know.

563
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:09,400
Do I get the power of teleportation
whenever I drink?

564
00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:15,111
-Where have you been?
-Kiha Police Station.

565
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,447
If you have a case, tell me.

566
00:39:23,043 --> 00:39:25,325
In-ha. I want to talk to you.

567
00:39:26,952 --> 00:39:29,537
Oh, no. I have to go to
Kiha Police Station right now.

568
00:39:30,313 --> 00:39:31,783
See you later.

569
00:39:33,093 --> 00:39:34,040
What's with her?

570
00:39:34,423 --> 00:39:37,113
She just said she came back
from Kiha Police Station.

571
00:39:47,173 --> 00:39:48,433
Choi In-ha.

572
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:49,544
Talk with me.

573
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,763
No. I have to go to
Kiha Police Station right now.

574
00:39:54,371 --> 00:39:55,138
I know that's not true.

575
00:39:56,283 --> 00:39:57,690
-So let's talk...
-No.

576
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,498
No. I don't want to. I won't listen.

577
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:03,321
-I know what you're going to say.
-In-ha.

578
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:06,177
How could you say that so easily?

579
00:40:06,553 --> 00:40:08,136
It was so hard for us to get here.

580
00:40:08,977 --> 00:40:11,731
-How can you give up so easily?
-I'm not giving up.

581
00:40:13,015 --> 00:40:15,557
-What?
-I'm going to tell father everything.

582
00:40:16,284 --> 00:40:18,107
I'm going to try my best
to get his permission.

583
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:22,817
I won't lie now.
It took 14 years for me to understand.

584
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,157
Being happy through deception
will have an end.

585
00:40:27,378 --> 00:40:28,349
Dal-Po.

586
00:40:30,552 --> 00:40:33,527
I thought about that
when I was looking at Bum-Jo like you.

587
00:40:33,997 --> 00:40:35,351
Don't worry too much.

588
00:40:35,442 --> 00:40:39,197
Would he have been happier when
he didn't know his mother's real face?

589
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:41,196
I'm Ki Jae-myung.

590
00:40:41,287 --> 00:40:44,927
But even if you hide out of fear

591
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:46,777
or cover your eyes...

592
00:40:46,887 --> 00:40:48,040
What?

593
00:40:48,388 --> 00:40:52,142
I'm your younger brother, Ki Ha-myung.

594
00:40:53,308 --> 00:40:54,650
What's there doesn't just disappear.

595
00:40:57,722 --> 00:40:58,917
You're right.

596
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,018
When I met my mom again...

597
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:04,956
I thought the world was ending...

598
00:41:06,287 --> 00:41:08,126
when I found out that
she wasn't the mom that I thought.

599
00:41:10,548 --> 00:41:12,212
But in the end, I needed to face her.

600
00:41:13,186 --> 00:41:14,814
Even though it was painful...

601
00:41:17,304 --> 00:41:19,046
I had to bear it.

602
00:41:23,534 --> 00:41:26,531
What can I do when that's the truth?

603
00:41:27,774 --> 00:41:29,577
If insisting on it makes it true,

604
00:41:29,998 --> 00:41:31,677
I would want to insist on it
no matter what.

605
00:41:32,629 --> 00:41:33,707
But...

606
00:41:34,282 --> 00:41:35,457
it's not like that.

607
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:38,142
So I can't lie anymore.

608
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:40,684
Even if it's hard,
I'll tell father everything

609
00:41:40,775 --> 00:41:42,378
and try my best to get his permission.

610
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:46,149
What if you don't get his permission?

611
00:41:51,419 --> 00:41:52,327
Then...

612
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,215
I'll have to accept it. What can I do?

613
00:42:05,311 --> 00:42:09,374
Father is the one who saved and raise me.

614
00:42:10,091 --> 00:42:11,677
He also made it possible
for me to meet you.

615
00:42:17,206 --> 00:42:19,166
Even if the world gives me permission...

616
00:42:20,713 --> 00:42:22,326
I can't go against it...

617
00:42:23,356 --> 00:42:24,747
if father say's no.

618
00:42:28,775 --> 00:42:29,797
I know.

619
00:42:30,376 --> 00:42:31,571
I know all that but...

620
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:37,947
Let's try.

621
00:42:55,026 --> 00:42:56,737
-Father.
-Grandpa.

622
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,107
What?

623
00:43:04,021 --> 00:43:07,108
What brings the two of you
in here together?

624
00:43:15,545 --> 00:43:17,080
We have something to tell you.

625
00:43:27,727 --> 00:43:29,447
January 2015

626
00:43:29,537 --> 00:43:32,079
This is news? Is this news?

627
00:43:32,774 --> 00:43:35,601
Does it make sense to choose
new employees? Aren't they crazy?

628
00:43:35,692 --> 00:43:39,379
-Hey. Just take that hair band off.
-No.

629
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:46,068
-Don't do it. Don't do it.
-Oh my...

630
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:49,059
How can you not improve at all
even after a new year?

631
00:43:49,972 --> 00:43:52,857
-Aren't sick of that Nitpicker?
-Me?

632
00:44:00,593 --> 00:44:03,021
No, not at all.
I married him because he is a nitpicker.

633
00:44:03,638 --> 00:44:06,787
Hey, what are you doing?
People are watching.

634
00:44:07,584 --> 00:44:10,967
I know. People are watching.

635
00:44:17,053 --> 00:44:19,637
If you get it done in one shot,
I'll give you another kiss.

636
00:44:21,657 --> 00:44:22,677
Okay!

637
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:29,317
Lucky bastard.

638
00:44:30,057 --> 00:44:31,830
Did he save the universe
in his previous life?

639
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:40,080
Anyone one can try to be a reporter
but not everyone can't become one.

640
00:44:40,171 --> 00:44:43,694
The final evaluation to select
the 2015 new reporters of YGN...

641
00:44:43,785 --> 00:44:45,165
In-ha

642
00:44:47,389 --> 00:44:48,853
What time do I have to come pick you up?

643
00:44:49,952 --> 00:44:50,968
Hmm.

644
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,223
Maybe around 8?

645
00:44:54,014 --> 00:44:56,627
Your company is having the
new employees' interview today, right?

646
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:58,707
Yeah. Your company too?

647
00:45:00,338 --> 00:45:01,257
Don't even talk about it.

648
00:45:01,609 --> 00:45:04,387
I'm in charge of the main site
so it's going to be crazy.

649
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:05,450
Me too.

650
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,828
Are the youngest ones
put in charge of it normally?

651
00:45:12,224 --> 00:45:15,197
I met Bum-Jo recently and he said
he's going to take the exam at MSC.

652
00:45:15,288 --> 00:45:18,240
I got the text too. But it's going to be
horrible if he gets in.

653
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:19,765
He'll go through the rounds again.

654
00:45:19,856 --> 00:45:22,051
It's horrible just thinking about it.

655
00:45:22,529 --> 00:45:24,557
It's more horrible
than going to the military twice.

656
00:45:25,747 --> 00:45:27,234
I see you.

657
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:46,346
Hey, are you wearing a suit everyday
just because you're on the legal desk?

658
00:45:46,437 --> 00:45:49,204
What about you? Are you dressing formally
just because you're on the business track?

659
00:45:51,439 --> 00:45:52,267
That's one reason.

660
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:55,427
I put more attention to it since
it's the new employees' interview today.

661
00:45:55,527 --> 00:45:58,547
When I saw the profile photos
there were a lot of good looking men...

662
00:45:58,647 --> 00:46:00,707
-Hey, you...
-I'm sorry.

663
00:46:13,946 --> 00:46:16,535
-Number 13.
-Yes.

664
00:46:16,626 --> 00:46:17,186
Number 24.

665
00:46:18,322 --> 00:46:20,100
-Number 441.
-Yes.

666
00:46:20,191 --> 00:46:21,289
We'll start the interview now.

667
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:29,183
-Wait a moment.
-Yes?

668
00:46:36,198 --> 00:46:37,510
What's your name?

669
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,240
It's Shin Jae-ha.

670
00:46:41,311 --> 00:46:42,497
Oh, I see.

671
00:46:43,773 --> 00:46:46,697
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

672
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:58,127
-Number 13.
-Yes.

673
00:46:58,588 --> 00:47:01,367
If you are choosing the order,
which one would you choose

674
00:47:01,467 --> 00:47:05,347
between the news you want to watch
and the news you need to watch?

675
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:08,134
I will choose the news
that you want to watch.

676
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:12,135
It's because I think that news that
people don't watch is not news.

677
00:47:12,947 --> 00:47:14,607
Next, number 24.

678
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:16,677
I'll give an example.

679
00:47:17,364 --> 00:47:23,087
How would you feel if someone gave you
a ticket to a concert

680
00:47:23,187 --> 00:47:24,877
where all the famous Korean stars
will be on?

681
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:28,955
That's what you said
at the company dinner.

682
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:31,087
I know.

683
00:47:32,023 --> 00:47:36,079
Are you going to talk about
the pancreatic cancer next?

684
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:40,680
-How did you know...?
-That's what we want to ask you.

685
00:47:40,771 --> 00:47:41,951
Where did you hear that?

686
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:49,647
A lecturer told us at my college
during a special lecture before.

687
00:47:50,214 --> 00:47:53,877
That example was so intense
that I still remember it.

688
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,357
A lecturer.

689
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,594
Who could it be?

690
00:47:58,622 --> 00:48:00,142
Former MSC Chief Song Cha-ok
Special Lecture

691
00:48:00,233 --> 00:48:01,615
Let me give you an example.

692
00:48:02,556 --> 00:48:04,807
Would the student
wearing the blue jacket stand up?

693
00:48:05,204 --> 00:48:05,917
Yes.

694
00:48:06,418 --> 00:48:09,087
If someone gave you a ticket to a concert

695
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:12,227
where all the famous
Korean stars will be on...

696
00:48:12,317 --> 00:48:15,910
-How would you feel?
-Wow. I would feel ecstatic.

697
00:48:18,856 --> 00:48:20,017
Then...

698
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:24,147
what if I said
you have pancreatic cancer?

699
00:48:24,673 --> 00:48:27,715
I would be quite shocked.

700
00:48:28,802 --> 00:48:30,769
The news that you want to watch
would be the concert ticket.

701
00:48:31,556 --> 00:48:33,337
The news you need to watch
would be pancreatic cancer.

702
00:48:33,926 --> 00:48:40,395
Which news would you give to
that student in a blue jacket first?

703
00:48:43,778 --> 00:48:47,073
Miss. I saw you on the commercial.

704
00:48:47,164 --> 00:48:50,037
You're the first Pinocchio reporter
in the country, aren't you?

705
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:54,177
-You're prettier in real life.
-Of course.

706
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:57,957
I also think that my beauty is
wasted on being a reporter.

707
00:48:58,603 --> 00:48:59,594
Amazing.

708
00:49:01,533 --> 00:49:04,847
Hey. Can a Pinocchio really be a reporter?

709
00:49:04,947 --> 00:49:07,987
What can she do? They say they picked her
because she has a pretty face.

710
00:49:08,428 --> 00:49:11,447
They say even the reporter award
they gave her was just promotional.

711
00:49:11,547 --> 00:49:15,947
Pinocchio is the perfect title
for a truthful reporter.

712
00:49:16,047 --> 00:49:17,987
Those brats!

713
00:49:18,257 --> 00:49:19,967
-Hey!
-Oh my goodness.

714
00:49:20,067 --> 00:49:24,007
-That's right. I was chosen for my looks.
-Really?

715
00:49:24,107 --> 00:49:25,457
See. I was right.

716
00:49:25,557 --> 00:49:27,287
But where did you confirm

717
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:29,669
I received the reporter award
for promotional purposes?

718
00:49:29,977 --> 00:49:34,628
-That's what everyone said so...
-So you didn't confirm it?

719
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,137
No.

720
00:49:37,065 --> 00:49:38,707
But doesn't it make sense?

721
00:49:38,807 --> 00:49:42,147
If you were chosen for your face,
then it's probably same for the award.

722
00:49:43,862 --> 00:49:46,541
You should go straight home.

723
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:48,657
Saying that nonsense

724
00:49:48,757 --> 00:49:53,347
without confirming the facts
is not news but a rumor.

725
00:49:54,315 --> 00:49:57,557
Since reporter Choi In-ha is a Pinocchio,
she won't write about rumors at least.

726
00:49:57,657 --> 00:49:59,086
No. She is not able to write it.

727
00:50:00,517 --> 00:50:03,756
Of course, her success rate is a bit low.

728
00:50:04,257 --> 00:50:05,937
-Sir!
-Choi In-ha.

729
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:08,626
-Aren't you going to send the applicants?
-Yes.

730
00:50:10,592 --> 00:50:12,797
-Number 331.
-Yes.

731
00:50:12,897 --> 00:50:14,927
-Number 334.
-Yes.

732
00:50:15,027 --> 00:50:16,817
-Number 421.
-Yes.

733
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:20,787
-Number 444.
-Yes.

734
00:50:22,437 --> 00:50:23,947
Seo Bum-Jo!

735
00:50:24,047 --> 00:50:25,557
It's been a while.

736
00:50:25,657 --> 00:50:27,477
Has it been a year?

737
00:50:27,777 --> 00:50:28,967
That was too much.

738
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,313
You only met with Ha-myung
and left me out.

739
00:50:31,707 --> 00:50:33,547
Hey. It's totally unfair.

740
00:50:33,647 --> 00:50:38,227
I always begged him to bring you along
but he kept coming by himself.

741
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:41,822
Really? Anyway, good luck today.

742
00:50:45,735 --> 00:50:46,707
Alright, cheers!

743
00:51:06,868 --> 00:51:08,587
What is this?

744
00:51:11,407 --> 00:51:14,177
He left his wallet again.

745
00:51:14,606 --> 00:51:17,367
Again? He did that before too.

746
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:21,427
But...

747
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:23,777
what is this?

748
00:51:24,272 --> 00:51:27,257
Oh, that? It's a picture
from Chan-soo's housewarming party.

749
00:51:27,357 --> 00:51:28,786
This is Chan-soo's child.

750
00:51:29,584 --> 00:51:31,457
It was taken coincidentally
Coincidentally...

751
00:51:35,417 --> 00:51:36,937
What in the world...

752
00:51:37,377 --> 00:51:39,874
I thought it would be absurd but...

753
00:51:41,672 --> 00:51:43,827
It could be possible.

754
00:51:43,927 --> 00:51:47,046
Don't you think so?
I also thought it would be absurd.

755
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:53,137
When I look at the two of them sometimes,
they look cute and cozy.

756
00:51:54,116 --> 00:51:56,447
He said it's been more than 10 years
since he started liking In-ha.

757
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:58,597
He's quite noble and pure, right?

758
00:52:00,224 --> 00:52:04,107
Still, they decided to obey you
and give it up.

759
00:52:04,197 --> 00:52:05,987
They decided to live as
an uncle and a niece.

760
00:52:06,826 --> 00:52:10,121
They make me proud and a bit sad too.

761
00:52:23,928 --> 00:52:26,027
Now. Should we share information?

762
00:52:26,127 --> 00:52:27,807
If you cry, you're marked
and if you are...

763
00:52:27,907 --> 00:52:29,777
You're dead, you brats!

764
00:52:33,277 --> 00:52:35,407
Stop talking and follow me.

765
00:52:38,714 --> 00:52:39,957
I've raised her well.

766
00:52:40,047 --> 00:52:41,466
Nitpicker Yoon.

767
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:52,247
It's alright.

768
00:52:56,067 --> 00:52:59,282
I'll be right back after
seeing my father for a bit.

769
00:52:59,373 --> 00:53:00,382
Okay.

770
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,627
-Father.
-Hey.

771
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,854
What brings you here?

772
00:53:08,777 --> 00:53:11,497
I had something to do over here

773
00:53:11,597 --> 00:53:14,967
and I saw the station vehicle.

774
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:17,577
So I came over.

775
00:53:18,116 --> 00:53:19,207
Something to do?

776
00:53:20,424 --> 00:53:22,097
This is a court
so what did you have to do?

777
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:26,661
Yeah. Your adoption.

778
00:53:27,675 --> 00:53:32,742
I came to submit papers
to dissolve your adoption.

779
00:53:36,657 --> 00:53:37,585
Father.

780
00:53:38,747 --> 00:53:42,747
I want to stop lying

781
00:53:43,367 --> 00:53:46,269
and let you find your real name.

782
00:53:49,888 --> 00:53:51,044
I'm sorry.

783
00:53:52,617 --> 00:53:58,495
I was stubborn for too long

784
00:53:59,017 --> 00:54:05,228
because I cherished you too much.

785
00:54:06,761 --> 00:54:07,860
Father.

786
00:54:09,035 --> 00:54:10,267
Now...

787
00:54:12,272 --> 00:54:14,524
you can live with your real name.

788
00:54:16,949 --> 00:54:21,671
You can throw away the name Choi Dal-Po.

789
00:54:22,778 --> 00:54:24,074
Do you understand?

790
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:35,939
And cherish our In-ha...

791
00:54:38,424 --> 00:54:40,471
with all your strength.

792
00:54:42,287 --> 00:54:43,445
I will.

793
00:54:44,717 --> 00:54:45,983
I will, Father.

794
00:54:53,867 --> 00:54:55,234
Thank you...

795
00:54:57,533 --> 00:55:02,403
for being my son all this time.

796
00:55:03,987 --> 00:55:06,595
Thank you so much, Ha-myung.

797
00:55:07,467 --> 00:55:08,841
Alright?

798
00:55:12,082 --> 00:55:13,374
Thank you...

799
00:55:14,627 --> 00:55:16,153
for raising me, father.

800
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:46,497
The Supreme Court rejected the appeal by
the former Chairwoman of Bumjo Group

801
00:55:46,597 --> 00:55:49,287
Park Rosa who was arrested for
of attempted murder of reporters

802
00:55:49,377 --> 00:55:51,537
and bribing the politicians.

803
00:55:51,637 --> 00:55:53,857
And confirmed
the original verdict of 3 years sentence.

804
00:55:54,157 --> 00:55:55,365
That's strange.

805
00:55:55,987 --> 00:56:00,450
If it's 3 years sentence,
5 years probation has to be offered.

806
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:02,347
Why wasn't I offered
the 5 years probation?

807
00:56:02,447 --> 00:56:06,447
Why are they only doing this to me?
This is a reverse discrimination.

808
00:56:07,207 --> 00:56:09,737
Bumjo Group achieved
management normalization

809
00:56:09,827 --> 00:56:11,724
after being managed
by creditors for one year.

810
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:15,527
The creditors not only instituted
Bumjo Group to professional management

811
00:56:15,677 --> 00:56:18,957
but settled the former
Chairwoman Park Rosa's shares...

812
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:26,987
The Supreme Court confirmed
the original sentence

813
00:56:27,087 --> 00:56:28,561
of six month-prison sentence

814
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:30,152
and two year-probation
for the six Assemblymen

815
00:56:30,242 --> 00:56:32,817
including Mr Kim Kyung-woo
who was arrested for receiving bribes

816
00:56:32,927 --> 00:56:35,239
from former Chairwoman Park,
at a court of appeal.

817
00:56:40,512 --> 00:56:44,492
Drawing the attention with
off shoulder that highlights femininity

818
00:56:44,897 --> 00:56:47,117
and the mermaid line in silk.

819
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:50,337
A dress that is luxurious but
expresses a strong image.

820
00:56:50,437 --> 00:56:55,541
A classic tuxedo with narrow lapel.

821
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,113
The youthfulness upgraded
the casual sense.

822
00:57:08,847 --> 00:57:10,797
Who is this?

823
00:57:10,907 --> 00:57:14,827
My Ki Ha-myung is so handsome.

824
00:57:14,927 --> 00:57:17,917
-Is that In-ha?
-It's your daughter.

825
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,887
Then try on other ones.

826
00:57:19,987 --> 00:57:22,265
Since we're here, try on everything.

827
00:57:26,057 --> 00:57:27,753
I'm curious about something
all of a sudden.

828
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:30,697
-What is it?
-Back in high school,

829
00:57:30,797 --> 00:57:32,772
why did you want to go on
that quiz program so badly?

830
00:57:33,387 --> 00:57:35,831
I kept asking you then but...

831
00:57:39,667 --> 00:57:40,703
Because I liked you.

832
00:57:41,537 --> 00:57:44,301
Because I liked you.

833
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:28,401
Pinocchio

834
00:58:59,813 --> 00:59:01,931
