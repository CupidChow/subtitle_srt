1
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,922
Pinocchio

2
00:00:35,073 --> 00:00:37,293
-How did you know that story earlier?
-I'm sorry?

3
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:38,973
My father's promise
about taking us to the fireworks

4
00:00:39,063 --> 00:00:41,463
and my mother not being able
to buy anything at the market.

5
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:44,433
How did you know all that?
No one would know aside from my family!

6
00:00:48,753 --> 00:00:50,063
I can't tell you...

7
00:00:50,763 --> 00:00:53,313
Tell me who you heard it from!

8
00:01:00,113 --> 00:01:02,413
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

9
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:06,923
Move!

10
00:01:11,983 --> 00:01:12,873
Jae-myung...

11
00:01:12,963 --> 00:01:14,773
Jae-myung, please.

12
00:01:14,863 --> 00:01:16,663
I told you not to call me that.

13
00:01:19,853 --> 00:01:21,493
Jae-myung, it's me.

14
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,913
It's me, Ha-myung.

15
00:01:25,743 --> 00:01:27,123
What?

16
00:01:30,543 --> 00:01:32,153
Dal-Po...

17
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:38,303
I'm your little brother, Ki Ha-myung.

18
00:01:44,673 --> 00:01:45,953
Shut up!

19
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:47,743
Ha-myung is dead.

20
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,163
He's dead because of reporters like you!

21
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:53,713
It's true.
It was Dal-Po who told me those stories.

22
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,433
Shut up!

23
00:01:57,623 --> 00:01:59,533
Don't lie to me.

24
00:02:01,573 --> 00:02:03,633
You're the one who lied.

25
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,143
You told me that father would come back!

26
00:02:06,523 --> 00:02:08,173
You told me that when father comes back...

27
00:02:08,263 --> 00:02:10,983
we would resolve all the misunderstandings
and we'd go see the fireworks

28
00:02:11,073 --> 00:02:13,173
and things would go back
to the way they used to be!

29
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:15,233
You promised me.

30
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:19,733
When father comes back,
all the misunderstandings will be resolved

31
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:21,793
and things will go back
to the way they used to be.

32
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:23,540
We'll even go see the fireworks together.

33
00:02:25,283 --> 00:02:27,053
-Really?
-Of course.

34
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:28,673
I promise you.

35
00:02:29,123 --> 00:02:32,415
-Want to pinky swear?
-You're not lying, right?

36
00:02:34,623 --> 00:02:36,873
You promised me.

37
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,282
But look at what's happened!

38
00:02:56,983 --> 00:02:58,967
Look at what's happened!

39
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:31,003
Episode 11  Midsummer Night's Dream

40
00:03:44,283 --> 00:03:45,503
Go ahead and eat.

41
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:48,333
You said it was your dream
to eat a whole pizza by yourself.

42
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:54,487
Maybe that was too long ago.

43
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:58,474
You've grown really tall.

44
00:03:58,923 --> 00:04:01,393
You were such a short little thing
when you were younger.

45
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:07,003
Tell me.

46
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:08,783
How have you been?

47
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,768
What's up with the name Choi Dal-Po?

48
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:15,843
A kind old man rescued me.

49
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:20,573
He lost one of his sons
in the ocean 40 years ago

50
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:23,183
and his name was Choi Dal-Po.

51
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:29,353
Believing that his son
had come back alive,

52
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:31,573
he adopted me as his son.

53
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:33,593
And...

54
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:53,633
They must still be talking.

55
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,668
Are you okay? Is your mother okay?

56
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:01,433
Yeah, we're both fine.

57
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:03,856
Where's Ki Jae-myung?
Did you see Ki Jae-myung?

58
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:05,543
Yeah.

59
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:07,402
He didn't hurt you, did he?

60
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,893
What's that mark on your neck?

61
00:05:11,463 --> 00:05:13,423
It's nothing, so stop asking me questions.

62
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,553
Tell me!
Joo-ho told me what happened briefly.

63
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:18,480
Ki Jae-myung did that to you, didn't he?

64
00:05:19,673 --> 00:05:21,215
I told you to stop asking me questions.

65
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:24,843
Okay, fine.

66
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,892
Then I'll just go ask Choi Dal-Po.

67
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,863
Don't!

68
00:05:30,953 --> 00:05:33,463
Bum-Jo,
don't even think about asking Dal-Po.

69
00:05:33,553 --> 00:05:34,868
If you do, I won't forgive you.

70
00:05:36,263 --> 00:05:37,323
What?

71
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:39,643
Don't ask Dal-Po anything
about Ki Jae-myung.

72
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,463
Don't even try to know either.

73
00:06:06,843 --> 00:06:08,423
Okay, fine.

74
00:06:08,763 --> 00:06:10,343
Let's just end this.

75
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:15,513
I'm so sick of this being one-sided,
and I'm just going to end it!

76
00:06:18,973 --> 00:06:20,783
I'm seriously a huge fan of yours.

77
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:23,353
-Can I please have your autograph?
-Yes, of course.

78
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:25,373
Thank you! He's giving me his autograph.

79
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:28,073
You're really good looking.
Can I have your autograph, too?

80
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:33,073
-Ha-myung, can I borrow a pen?
-Sure.

81
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:52,113
Thank you. You really are great!

82
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:53,443
You’re my hero!

83
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:57,823
Sorry, but our guest is here to dine,
so please return to your seats.

84
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,243
Here, Ha-myung.

85
00:07:09,793 --> 00:07:13,043
Thanks to that accident,
I've become a celebrity.

86
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,728
I've even been asked
to ring the new year's bell.

87
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,353
Isn’t it funny?

88
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:25,423
After everything that Song Cha-ok
has done to our father,

89
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,073
she's turned me into a hero.

90
00:07:32,313 --> 00:07:33,711
Where were we with your story?

91
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:37,623
I was just saying that I'm sorry.

92
00:07:37,713 --> 00:07:41,504
That I ignored you at Zenon Square
even though I recognized you.

93
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,323
No, you did the right thing.

94
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:46,789
Continue to live your life that way.

95
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:52,853
The fact that you're Ki Ha-myung,
and that I'm your older brother...

96
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:54,659
Don't ever tell anyone the truth.

97
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:58,513
And just live your life as Choi Dal-Po.

98
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:04,213
Why would I have to do that?

99
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:23,013
You...

100
00:08:24,613 --> 00:08:26,713
You already know the reason for that.

101
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,853
But I still want you to tell me.

102
00:08:49,743 --> 00:08:51,193
I...

103
00:08:58,993 --> 00:09:00,903
I've killed people.

104
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:02,933
Ha-myung.

105
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:33,983
-She’s something else.
-She was totally ripping into her.

106
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:38,323
-I heard she just laid it into her.
-I heard that she was her own mother.

107
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:42,293
Seriously, that Choi In-ha.

108
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:44,543
We've been so nice to her
because of her exclusive items,

109
00:09:44,643 --> 00:09:46,223
how can she stab us in the back like this?

110
00:09:46,743 --> 00:09:48,157
As her direct superior,

111
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:51,197
I'm really going to let her have it,
so don't even try to stop me.

112
00:09:53,063 --> 00:09:54,403
Choi In-ha!

113
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:57,423
Yes?

114
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:05,983
-Choi In-ha, as a reporter for MSC...
-Choi In-ha!

115
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:09,373
Even though it was the truth,
there's still a time and a place for it.

116
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:11,313
The truth?

117
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,833
Even though I'm sure it was said
with a reporter's belief

118
00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:16,283
that you should be tougher
when criticizing a higher person.

119
00:10:16,593 --> 00:10:18,393
A reporter's belief?

120
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:21,633
You should've know that
there's a time and a place for everything!

121
00:10:21,723 --> 00:10:25,773
Choi In-ha, I cannot just overlook
your disrespectful behavior.

122
00:10:25,863 --> 00:10:29,703
From now on, report directly to me
instead of Il Joo.

123
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:33,083
-Understood?
-Yes, Sir.

124
00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:39,433
You can go.

125
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:50,273
Captain Kim,
how often should I report to you?

126
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:55,438
Hey, must I still receive reports
from rookies like you at my rank?

127
00:10:55,803 --> 00:10:58,845
Just go home for the rest of the day,
and get plenty of rest at home tomorrow.

128
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:00,593
Huh? Yes, okay.

129
00:11:01,553 --> 00:11:03,103
Excuse me, Captain Kim.

130
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:07,252
Am I being disciplined right now?

131
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:12,765
Does it feel like it?

132
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:16,598
It's a reward.
For speaking up for the truth.

133
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:22,883
Yes, thank you.
You really are a wonderful boss.

134
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:31,608
Be more specific. How am I wonderful?

135
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:39,703
Aren't you so excited to finally be able
to present your ideas?

136
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:42,293
-Is Captain Hwang is leading this?
-Yes.

137
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:45,733
It's a weekly recap meeting,
so he'll definitely be leading it.

138
00:11:45,823 --> 00:11:48,693
You don't think Cap Hwang will ask us
to present anything, do you?

139
00:11:48,783 --> 00:11:50,973
I doubt he'll ask
the rookies to present anything.

140
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:54,276
But just in case,
I did bring a list of a few story leads.

141
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:56,592
Here they come.

142
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,823
-Okay, let's get started.
-Yes, sir.

143
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,229
You guys are so full of enthusiasm.

144
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,183
Then how about we switch it up
and ask the rookies to present first?

145
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,937
I want you to present one idea each.

146
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,142
-I didn't prepare anything.
-What are we going to do?

147
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:27,850
Let's start with Choi Dal-Po.

148
00:12:30,653 --> 00:12:31,611
Yes.

149
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:35,280
How about a story on electrostatic
accidents at gas stations?

150
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,163
With the dry winter weather,
sparks from electrostatic are common.

151
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:40,386
If anything goes wrong,
it could even lead to an accidental fire.

152
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:44,503
A likely lead from a former taxi driver.
Can you gather examples?

153
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:48,133
Yes, I've checked with the fire department
and I got three cases.

154
00:12:48,223 --> 00:12:50,278
But none of them was serious.

155
00:12:50,363 --> 00:12:53,369
But we can easily find video clips of it
having happened overseas.

156
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,564
Will the spark
start a fire from the vapor?

157
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:56,542
Yes.

158
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:59,795
People should gas up only after rubbing
their hand on the anti-static pad,

159
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:01,593
but most drivers ignore it.

160
00:13:02,473 --> 00:13:04,332
It's a fitting story for the season.

161
00:13:04,673 --> 00:13:07,592
Write a story to help raise
more awareness. Next, Yoon Yu-Rae.

162
00:13:08,723 --> 00:13:11,493
It’s about the nation's hero,
Ki Jae-myung.

163
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,438
Ki Jae-myung lost all his family members
from the factory explosion case.

164
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:18,840
There are three factory workers who lied
and framed Ki Ho-sang of wrongdoing

165
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,513
and two of them are now dead,

166
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:22,837
and the suspect for their deaths,
Moon Duk-soo, is on the run.

167
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,954
But the interesting fact is that according
to Moon Duk-soo's phone record

168
00:13:26,045 --> 00:13:28,084
he spoke to Ki Jae-myung
right before he disappeared.

169
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:34,171
I'm not sure about that.
What is wrong with that?

170
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:37,213
Well, don't you think
that's too big of a coincidence?

171
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:39,351
That's not enough to turn it into a story.

172
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:42,057
Everyone in this country loves him

173
00:13:42,148 --> 00:13:45,238
and people may end up thinking
that we're trying to get back at MSC-

174
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:46,688
I think it can be something.

175
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:49,611
Yoon Yu-Rae, look into it some more.

176
00:13:50,223 --> 00:13:51,141
Cap.

177
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:55,041
Captain Hwang, you told me
to take the lead on Ki Jae-myung.

178
00:13:57,123 --> 00:13:59,585
You can look into
the gas station static accidents,

179
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:01,433
and Yoon Yu-Rae can take Ki Jae-myung.
Who's next?

180
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:04,943
Yes!

181
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:12,973
Your first news article will follow you
for the rest of your reporting career.

182
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,024
Mr Nitpicker's first news report
was an interview on colored peppers.

183
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:23,403
-Colored Pepper, aren't you going home?
-Don't call me that, and I'm not.

184
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:27,044
-Okay... Colored Pepper.
-I told you not to call me that.

185
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:28,831
No one knows about that.

186
00:14:32,103 --> 00:14:34,273
So that's why the others call him that
once in a while.

187
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:37,353
I heard that's what hurt his relationship
with Captain Hwang, too.

188
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,193
Because Captain Hwang gave him
the lead on the colored pepper interview.

189
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:44,613
Is that why he always wears that headband
just to annoy Captain Hwang?

190
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:46,780
-Yeah.
-Geez, now I'm thinking about it again.

191
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,363
Anyway, I think I've managed
to avoid Mr Nitpicker's fate.

192
00:14:49,647 --> 00:14:53,821
My first news article is going to be,
'The two faces of our nation's hero.'

193
00:14:54,913 --> 00:14:56,303
Isn't it awesome?

194
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,093
Captain Hwang.

195
00:14:59,183 --> 00:15:00,876
You told me that you'd give me more time.

196
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,647
I think I've given you plenty of time.

197
00:15:02,738 --> 00:15:06,528
Leave Ki Jae-myung to Yoon Yu-Rae, and
look into the gas station story yourself.

198
00:15:07,603 --> 00:15:11,736
-You left it up to me to make the choice.
-That's when Ki Jae-myung's story was yours.

199
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:18,378
But this lead on Ki Jae-myung
was presented by Yoon Yu-Rae.

200
00:15:25,887 --> 00:15:29,521
I'll do whatever it takes
to get my brother to turn himself in.

201
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,092
Please.

202
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:33,798
Turn himself in?

203
00:15:36,263 --> 00:15:37,973
What's wrong with Dal-Po?
He's making me feel nervous.

204
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,390
Hey, what if he's trying
to steal your lead?

205
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,948
He wouldn't dare!

206
00:15:45,093 --> 00:15:47,713
Seriously, what is he doing?
This is really making me nervous.

207
00:15:54,123 --> 00:15:55,271
Turn himself in?

208
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:56,473
What do you mean by that?

209
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,820
Are you saying that
he really killed someone?

210
00:16:00,523 --> 00:16:01,601
Yes.

211
00:16:02,543 --> 00:16:04,664
He told me that himself earlier.

212
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:10,149
You were just going to bury it
even after having heard that?

213
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:12,793
No, that's not what I meant.

214
00:16:13,603 --> 00:16:16,003
I'm going to convince him
so that he’ll turn himself in.

215
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:17,883
But if he were to get arrested
right now...

216
00:16:18,423 --> 00:16:21,057
then he'll just become a murderer without
taking his circumstances into account.

217
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:25,963
How much...

218
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:27,905
time would you need?

219
00:16:30,193 --> 00:16:32,043
I can't hear anything.

220
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:36,991
Yoon Yu-Rae.

221
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:41,777
What are you doing?

222
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:45,553
Hand your lead on Ki Jae-myung
over to Choi Dal-Po

223
00:16:45,644 --> 00:16:47,233
and you can take the lead
on the gas station story.

224
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:48,713
Why!

225
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,473
Choi Dal-Po, how could you do this to me?

226
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:56,593
You steal my story,
and hand your lousy one over to me?

227
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,113
'Your lousy one?'

228
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:02,623
Well...

229
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:06,121
But that gas station article is too weak
for my first news article story.

230
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,093
It won't be easy to find any videos
since it hasn't even happened yet.

231
00:17:09,183 --> 00:17:11,327
Then isn't it a reporter's job to find it?

232
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,113
How could you do this to me!

233
00:17:21,343 --> 00:17:22,713
I'm sorry.

234
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:26,243
Choi Dal-Po! Captain Hwang!

235
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,153
Both of you, how could you do this to me!

236
00:17:59,983 --> 00:18:01,203
But...

237
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,073
But what is this?

238
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:05,846
Look at what's happened!

239
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,799
Ma'am, another bottle of soju over here.

240
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,225
How could you do this to me, huh?

241
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:24,106
How can you steal my story away from me?
Do you want me to hate you?

242
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:27,103
-Isn't that Yoon Yu-Rae?
-Then why did you do it?

243
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:32,183
-You're totally dead to me now.
-Hey, Yoon Yu-Rae.

244
00:18:32,273 --> 00:18:34,093
What are you doing here?

245
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:37,683
It's Choi In-ha!

246
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:39,723
Sit down, sit down.

247
00:18:41,563 --> 00:18:44,973
Ma'am, you can bring my soju here.

248
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:54,903
Nation's Hero, Ki Jae-myung!
Protect the earth!

249
00:19:02,623 --> 00:19:05,881
-What brings you here?
-I have something to talk to you about.

250
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,454
Let's go talk inside. It's cold out here.

251
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:12,603
Come in.

252
00:19:16,773 --> 00:19:18,003
I'm glad you're here.

253
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:20,193
I've been getting
a ton of presents from my fans lately.

254
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:21,664
You should take them all with you.

255
00:19:26,023 --> 00:19:27,235
What size shoes do you wear?

256
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,063
Do you like flowers?

257
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:34,711
Turn yourself in, Jae-myung.

258
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:41,433
What?

259
00:19:42,903 --> 00:19:44,874
Your revenge needs to stop here.

260
00:19:48,193 --> 00:19:49,598
Stop?

261
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:52,683
That woman framed our father
of a false wrongdoing

262
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:54,251
and killed our mother.

263
00:19:55,103 --> 00:19:56,770
So how can you tell me to stop?

264
00:20:00,123 --> 00:20:02,733
Do you think that our mother died
because of Song Cha-ok?

265
00:20:02,823 --> 00:20:03,983
No.

266
00:20:04,073 --> 00:20:05,907
I believe that you're partially
responsible for it, too.

267
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:07,179
What?

268
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:10,128
Why did you abandon mother and I
to run away by yourself?

269
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:12,236
Why didn't you stay and protect us?

270
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,593
Did you say...

271
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:19,759
that I ran away?

272
00:20:21,673 --> 00:20:22,803
If...

273
00:20:23,243 --> 00:20:25,777
you had been at home that day, mom
wouldn't have made that terrible decision.

274
00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:28,463
Just where did you run off to
after having abandoned us?

275
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:31,136
I went to see Song Cha-ok!

276
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,243
What?

277
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,053
I wanted to declare
our father's innocence to the world

278
00:20:38,143 --> 00:20:41,243
and protect you and mother.
So I went to see that woman.

279
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:47,423
I still thought of that woman...

280
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:51,083
as a reporter,
and that's why I went to see her.

281
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:52,953
Like a fool.

282
00:21:01,523 --> 00:21:03,633
But that woman still used my interview...

283
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:08,593
to further slander our father.

284
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:15,969
We can just use parts of what he said
about just wanting his father to be alive.

285
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:20,393
You're not even a reporter.
You're just a monster!

286
00:21:20,483 --> 00:21:22,763
-What are you doing!
-Let's give him a break.

287
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:24,233
If we just send him off like that,

288
00:21:24,323 --> 00:21:28,183
he won't even be able to go home,
he'll spend the night in a cold cell.

289
00:21:28,313 --> 00:21:29,793
Let him go.

290
00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:31,443
Because that's what I want.

291
00:21:32,143 --> 00:21:33,943
This is all your fault.

292
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:37,711
Had I been with my mother last night,
this never would've happened!

293
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:40,838
No, had you been with your mother,
then you would've died with her.

294
00:21:50,023 --> 00:21:51,845
Let me ask you something, Ha-myung.

295
00:21:53,463 --> 00:21:55,153
If you were in my place...

296
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,155
would you be able to stop right now?

297
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:26,863
-No, I don't want to.
-Why wouldn't you want to?

298
00:22:26,953 --> 00:22:29,723
Who knows? Maybe seeing you on TV
will help you find your real family.

299
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:31,599
I don't want to find them!

300
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:33,773
This is all my fault.

301
00:22:36,163 --> 00:22:40,463
I should've looked for my brother.

302
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:42,783
Had I done that...

303
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,143
then Jae-myung never would've
killed anyone.

304
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,693
You abandoned mom and I
to run away by yourself.

305
00:22:49,783 --> 00:22:53,903
So I blamed you and dad.

306
00:22:53,993 --> 00:22:56,743
and lived my life without ever trying
to look for you again.

307
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:01,843
I...

308
00:23:03,393 --> 00:23:05,001
I...

309
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:09,673
I turned my brother into a murderer.

310
00:23:25,013 --> 00:23:29,953
I'm asking why you're sitting here,
drinking by yourself right now.

311
00:23:30,663 --> 00:23:34,163
That's because the lead for a story
that I came up with...

312
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:35,783
No, wait.

313
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,023
I can't tell you.

314
00:23:37,113 --> 00:23:39,913
You're my rival,
so I can't tell you about it.

315
00:23:41,063 --> 00:23:42,363
No, you can tell me.

316
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:46,606
I black out all the time when I drink.
I'm not going to remember it tomorrow.

317
00:23:48,353 --> 00:23:49,583
Really?

318
00:23:50,253 --> 00:23:51,784
Then I'll tell you.

319
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,673
So what happened was...

320
00:23:56,023 --> 00:23:59,063
There's an eggroll that likes me.

321
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:03,303
But he stole the lead for a story
that I came up with.

322
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:07,623
So I took it up with my captain,
and the captain took the eggroll's side.

323
00:24:07,873 --> 00:24:10,783
-How does that make any sense?
-It doesn't.

324
00:24:10,873 --> 00:24:12,853
That's doesn't make any sense.

325
00:24:12,943 --> 00:24:16,773
I totally got treated
like some dirt on the ground.

326
00:24:17,103 --> 00:24:19,063
-You know?
-Yes.

327
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:20,753
I totally know what that's like.

328
00:24:20,913 --> 00:24:23,834
That's exactly how I'm feeling right now.

329
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:25,649
You, too? Why?

330
00:24:29,653 --> 00:24:31,263
I feel drunk.

331
00:24:31,813 --> 00:24:33,083
Hang on.

332
00:24:39,663 --> 00:24:40,945
Okay, keep talking.

333
00:24:43,443 --> 00:24:47,856
There's an eggroll that I like,
and he's going through a rough time.

334
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,793
And I'm partially to blame for that.

335
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:56,363
So I can't even ask what's going on,
or try to comfort him.

336
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,993
I can’t even offer to help either.

337
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,553
I totally feel like a pile of dirt.

338
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:05,041
-Do you get what I'm saying?
-I get it. I totally get it.

339
00:25:26,313 --> 00:25:28,494
Yes, three slaps to the right cheek.

340
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:30,383
Excuse me?

341
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:33,323
No, I don't know
if she's left handed or not.

342
00:25:34,323 --> 00:25:36,403
I'm sorry, I'll look into it.

343
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:41,103
Excuse me? I'm in a taxi.
Yes, I understand.

344
00:25:42,913 --> 00:25:45,793
Hey, I'm riding around in a taxi
as I look for my scoops, okay?

345
00:25:45,883 --> 00:25:47,573
Okay.

346
00:25:50,623 --> 00:25:53,683
It's nice having a rich partner
to save on some cab fare.

347
00:25:55,993 --> 00:25:58,150
Hey, isn't that Choi In-ha?

348
00:26:00,053 --> 00:26:02,877
Maybe... or maybe not.

349
00:26:03,073 --> 00:26:06,361
How much did she drink?
Should we take her home?

350
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:13,113
Hey, you're just going to
leave her there?

351
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:15,158
Didn't you say that you had to get
to Ki-ha Police Station?

352
00:26:15,249 --> 00:26:18,259
That's true... but what's gotten into you?

353
00:26:18,623 --> 00:26:22,352
-Did you and In-ha have a fight?
-Maybe, or maybe not.

354
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:24,223
What's that supposed to mean?

355
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:28,501
Do you think she's upset about laying it
into her mom at the lecture?

356
00:26:28,592 --> 00:26:32,133
-Who cares if she is?
-What if she catches a cold?

357
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:35,793
-Who cares if she does?
-She looked really drunk.

358
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:38,243
What if a bad guy hurts her?

359
00:26:49,373 --> 00:26:51,754
Take a taxi the rest of the way there.

360
00:26:54,203 --> 00:26:55,583
From here?

361
00:27:10,424 --> 00:27:11,725
Come on.

362
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:20,063
Choi Dal-Po.

363
00:27:20,843 --> 00:27:22,405
It's me, Seo Bum-Jo.

364
00:28:13,303 --> 00:28:14,432
What is this?

365
00:28:14,523 --> 00:28:16,154
What's this? What happened to her?

366
00:28:18,671 --> 00:28:20,967
In-ha had a lot to drink,
so I brought her home.

367
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:22,533
What?

368
00:28:37,903 --> 00:28:41,943
I told you that I'd just think about it,
but I haven't given you my permission yet.

369
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,297
You two should be more cautious
with your behavior around me right now.

370
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:47,507
I'm sorry.

371
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,213
As I've mentioned to you before...

372
00:28:52,303 --> 00:28:55,963
-In-ha is a beautiful...
-Water!

373
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:57,838
Water.

374
00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:02,453
In-ha is...

375
00:29:02,543 --> 00:29:07,003
-beautiful and precious to me...
-Water... I want water!

376
00:29:13,063 --> 00:29:16,039
In-ha is just...
What the heck is wrong with her?

377
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:17,763
I want water!

378
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:22,014
If you're that sloppy drunk,
then just sleep it off!

379
00:30:11,373 --> 00:30:13,413
My head.

380
00:30:13,953 --> 00:30:14,919
Oh, my goodness!

381
00:30:15,263 --> 00:30:17,155
Dad, why are you dressed like that?

382
00:30:17,246 --> 00:30:20,482
I don't think you're in any place
to judge my appearance right now.

383
00:30:22,993 --> 00:30:25,785
-What happened to me last night?
-That's what I'd like to ask you.

384
00:30:25,876 --> 00:30:28,463
How is it that my daughter
became such a beast,

385
00:30:28,554 --> 00:30:32,033
and why it is that at my age, I have
to serve hangover soup to my daughter?

386
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:34,251
That's what I'd like to ask my ancestors.

387
00:30:34,853 --> 00:30:37,015
But I still made it back home last night.

388
00:30:37,106 --> 00:30:39,741
That's actually pretty admirable
compared most kids these days.

389
00:30:39,832 --> 00:30:41,958
Dal-Po carried you home on his back.

390
00:30:43,193 --> 00:30:44,123
Dal-Po?

391
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:49,081
I must've messed up the whole universe
in my past life to deserve this.

392
00:30:50,673 --> 00:30:53,503
-You should wipe that drool off your chin.
-Drool?

393
00:31:00,513 --> 00:31:02,048
That's disgusting.

394
00:31:11,389 --> 00:31:14,782
I heard you brought me home last night?
I don't remember any of it.

395
00:31:15,553 --> 00:31:16,993
Yeah.

396
00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:21,183
-You really don't remember any of it?
-No, I don't.

397
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:23,255
It's a relief that you don't remember
any of it.

398
00:31:23,346 --> 00:31:25,647
You'd probably be too humiliated
to even lift your head up if you did.

399
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:30,741
Why did you have so much to drink?

400
00:31:31,674 --> 00:31:33,638
Were you upset about something?

401
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:36,711
No.

402
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:41,284
-Yes, there is something.
-What is it?

403
00:31:44,674 --> 00:31:45,239
That's...

404
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,221
She must've gotten into a lot of trouble
with her superiors at work.

405
00:31:47,311 --> 00:31:49,945
She kept grumbling about her superiors
while I was carrying her home last night.

406
00:31:50,554 --> 00:31:52,726
Really? I did?

407
00:31:54,924 --> 00:31:56,164
Yeah.

408
00:31:57,246 --> 00:31:58,886
I see.

409
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,396
That's a relief.

410
00:32:13,906 --> 00:32:15,586
So just forget about it.

411
00:32:15,676 --> 00:32:17,646
Just like how you forget things
when you get drunk.

412
00:32:18,516 --> 00:32:20,356
Do that with this, too.

413
00:32:20,886 --> 00:32:23,676
What was that memory about?
I'm afraid it was from last night.

414
00:32:28,386 --> 00:32:30,256
Uncle Dal-Po, it's me.

415
00:32:30,346 --> 00:32:31,549
Yeah, come in.

416
00:32:37,816 --> 00:32:38,978
Are you okay?

417
00:32:39,266 --> 00:32:42,226
How did it go yesterday with your brother?
I tried calling you a few times.

418
00:32:42,696 --> 00:32:46,176
Sorry, I didn't get to answer your calls
because we were busy catching up.

419
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:50,336
-What did you guys talk about?
-We were just talking.

420
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:54,706
-It must've been nice.
-Yeah.

421
00:32:56,646 --> 00:33:01,570
I was too drunk to remember anything,
did you say something to me last night?

422
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:04,206
I didn't say anything.

423
00:33:05,356 --> 00:33:06,826
Really?

424
00:33:08,726 --> 00:33:11,850
I may have said something
about you being really heavy though.

425
00:33:12,016 --> 00:33:13,106
What?

426
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:17,920
Did something happen yesterday?
Why were you drinking by yourself?

427
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:20,939
I wasn't drinking by myself.
Yu-Rae was with me.

428
00:33:21,326 --> 00:33:25,103
Yu-Rae was with you?
You were by yourself when I got there.

429
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:27,106
Really?

430
00:33:27,196 --> 00:33:28,696
Then what happened to Yu-Rae?

431
00:33:34,396 --> 00:33:37,390
Choi In-ha

432
00:33:54,676 --> 00:33:56,353
Tell Hwang Gyo-dong to get out here.

433
00:33:58,846 --> 00:34:01,774
You shouldn't live your life like that.
You think being a captain is everything?

434
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:04,986
You can write
the gas station story yourself!

435
00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:10,185
Hey...
Is she talking in her sleep right now?

436
00:34:12,292 --> 00:34:13,750
What is wrong with her?

437
00:34:13,841 --> 00:34:16,031
I think she's an apprentice,
so how did she get in here?

438
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:18,671
That's what I'd like to know.
She's quite talented.

439
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:22,717
-Aren't you going to move her?
-Why would I do that?

440
00:34:47,036 --> 00:34:48,156
Kim Kong-joo.

441
00:34:48,246 --> 00:34:50,441
Is MSC News Times
interviewing Ki Jae-myung?

442
00:34:50,532 --> 00:34:53,755
Yes, we've been asking him,
and he just got back to us about it.

443
00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:56,051
We're interviewing him
at the studio tomorrow.

444
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:58,528
At the studio?
Anchor Song Cha-ok is doing the interview?

445
00:34:58,666 --> 00:34:59,936
Yes.

446
00:35:00,026 --> 00:35:03,373
Don't you think that you guys are dragging
this story on Ki Jae-myung for too long?

447
00:35:03,464 --> 00:35:04,750
This item is no big deal though.

448
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:10,158
Are you aware that Mr No Big Deal
was asked to ring the New Year's bell?

449
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,572
Seriously?

450
00:35:11,663 --> 00:35:14,046
He's a hero who risked his own life
to save the life of another.

451
00:35:14,136 --> 00:35:16,514
And turns out that he's a victim
of a tragedy from 13 years ago.

452
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,326
On top of that, he's handsome

453
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:21,674
and he turned down commercial offers,
as well as, offers for corporate jobs

454
00:35:21,765 --> 00:35:25,000
because he wants to remain grounded
and not get swept up by fame and money.

455
00:35:25,091 --> 00:35:29,643
I believe that he's better qualified than
most other politicians to ring that bell.

456
00:35:29,734 --> 00:35:31,791
Did Ms Song Cha-ok
say yes to the interview?

457
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:35,950
Yes, of course.
She's probably happy about it.

458
00:35:36,266 --> 00:35:38,336
She also said that
she's going to broadcast

459
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:40,688
exclusive footage she has of him
from 13 years ago.

460
00:35:41,736 --> 00:35:43,206
What exclusive footage?

461
00:35:45,046 --> 00:35:46,746
That's a secret.

462
00:35:49,436 --> 00:35:51,186
Bingo!

463
00:35:58,976 --> 00:36:01,616
Choi Dal-Po, have you found out
anything on Ki Jae-myung?

464
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:04,626
-Yeah.
-I found something, too.

465
00:36:04,716 --> 00:36:07,556
-Want to trade information?
-Depends on what you've got.

466
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:10,766
I heard that Ki Jae-myung has been chosen
to ring the New Year's bell.

467
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,146
-I already know that.
-Then how about this?

468
00:36:13,236 --> 00:36:16,616
He is going to make an appearance
on MSC News Times tomorrow.

469
00:36:17,596 --> 00:36:22,106
-At the studio?
-Yes, for an interview with Song Cha-ok.

470
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:25,016
They've been asking him for an interview,
and he all of a sudden agreed to do it.

471
00:36:25,106 --> 00:36:26,766
Okay, your turn.

472
00:36:28,356 --> 00:36:29,746
What's his deal?

473
00:36:29,836 --> 00:36:32,116
Did he just leave
after taking my information?

474
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:42,106
I witnessed Ki Jae-myung murdering
Moon Duk-soo. We can talk more in person.

475
00:36:42,196 --> 00:36:44,430
I'll be waiting for your call.

476
00:36:50,196 --> 00:36:52,871
Moon Duk-soo is under this pile of rocks.
More details will be given in person.

477
00:37:14,576 --> 00:37:15,886
Jae-myung.

478
00:37:19,116 --> 00:37:21,017
What are you doing? You surprised me!

479
00:37:21,581 --> 00:37:22,698
Are you hurt anywhere?

480
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:25,120
Did you agree to do an interview
at MSC News Times studio tomorrow?

481
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:29,729
-Yeah.
-Why did you suddenly agree to it?

482
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,646
I already told you.

483
00:37:31,736 --> 00:37:33,553
I'm going to see to it
that she's brought to her end.

484
00:37:34,656 --> 00:37:38,555
You're going to kill her in front of the
camera while the whole world is watching?

485
00:37:38,826 --> 00:37:40,126
Do you think...

486
00:37:41,566 --> 00:37:42,651
I shouldn't do that?

487
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:45,660
-Jae-myung!
-I've already killed people.

488
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:48,831
Adding one more to that list
isn't going to change anything.

489
00:37:51,387 --> 00:37:54,667
I've already come this far,
I'm going to see it through to the end.

490
00:37:56,634 --> 00:37:58,077
Please don't, and just turn yourself in.

491
00:37:58,168 --> 00:38:00,604
I've just been contacted by a witness
who says they saw what you did.

492
00:38:01,066 --> 00:38:02,156
What?

493
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,786
Someone texted me and told me that
you buried him under a pile of rocks.

494
00:38:04,876 --> 00:38:07,371
Is that... is that true?

495
00:38:08,646 --> 00:38:11,604
Are you...
the only person who saw that text?

496
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:22,886
Yeah.

497
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:25,926
Then just leave it.

498
00:38:26,706 --> 00:38:28,144
And just forget about it.

499
00:38:28,326 --> 00:38:30,666
-Jae-myung!
-I told you not to call me that.

500
00:38:30,986 --> 00:38:34,439
Don't come to me again,
and just go back to the life you have.

501
00:38:36,846 --> 00:38:39,906
I know what you were thinking
when you killed those people.

502
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:43,096
And I'm also well aware that
you want to get revenge on Song Cha-ok.

503
00:38:46,046 --> 00:38:47,561
You know that...

504
00:38:48,086 --> 00:38:50,363
yet you still tell me to turn myself in?

505
00:38:51,256 --> 00:38:52,756
Can't you...

506
00:38:53,086 --> 00:38:54,458
leave that revenge to me?

507
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:57,648
What?

508
00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:02,116
I'll get revenge on Song Cha-ok
in my own way.

509
00:39:02,456 --> 00:39:06,466
As a reporter, I'll prove her wrongdoing,
and get her to apologize.

510
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:09,768
-So just leave the revenge to me...
-Ha-myung.

511
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:13,067
You like her daughter, don't you?

512
00:39:15,278 --> 00:39:16,656
Then do you think that...

513
00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:19,227
you'll actually be able to get revenge?

514
00:39:22,996 --> 00:39:27,162
You haven't been able to do it yet,
so will you actually be able to do it?

515
00:39:28,517 --> 00:39:30,996
Being Choi Dal-Po suits you better
than being Ki Ha-myung.

516
00:39:31,466 --> 00:39:35,241
So be happy
and live your life as Choi Dal-Po...

517
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,673
and let yourself be loved by others.

518
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:44,453
Because I'll be the one to bring an end
to Song Cha-ok.

519
00:39:45,606 --> 00:39:46,649
Jae-myung!

520
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:56,896
Jae-myung.

521
00:39:56,986 --> 00:39:58,246
Jae-myung!

522
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:00,486
Jae-myung, wait.

523
00:40:02,796 --> 00:40:04,126
Jae-myung!

524
00:40:22,496 --> 00:40:23,936
So just forget about it.

525
00:40:24,026 --> 00:40:26,146
Just like how you forget things
when you're drunk.

526
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:30,166
Geez, what the heck was it?
What was it that Dal-Po said?

527
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:37,116
Do it harder.

528
00:40:37,336 --> 00:40:40,686
-I have to go somewhere now.
-Didn't you say that you had the day off?

529
00:40:40,776 --> 00:40:42,203
I need to check on something.

530
00:40:42,436 --> 00:40:45,306
I feel like something important happened
when I was drunk last night.

531
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:46,351
So what are you going to do?

532
00:40:46,926 --> 00:40:50,743
Maybe I'll remember something
if I retrace my steps from last night.

533
00:40:51,806 --> 00:40:56,226
Maybe it's better that you don't know.
Remembering may be humiliating.

534
00:40:56,506 --> 00:40:59,073
Do you really think that your daughter
would've done anything too humiliating?

535
00:40:59,364 --> 00:41:03,062
I didn't think that my daughter would do
anything that would be humiliating either,

536
00:41:03,153 --> 00:41:05,322
but she really does go around
doing things that are humiliating.

537
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:07,377
I'll be back.

538
00:41:09,973 --> 00:41:12,937
You little brat, are you happy that
your daughter got wasted?

539
00:41:13,028 --> 00:41:13,901
Number three.

540
00:41:19,296 --> 00:41:23,719
-Ma'am, do you remember me?
-Of course, I remember you.

541
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,276
Because of you, I didn't get to go home
until two o'clock in the morning.

542
00:41:26,366 --> 00:41:27,726
I'm really sorry.

543
00:41:27,816 --> 00:41:30,536
But do you remember who I was with,
and what we talked about?

544
00:41:30,626 --> 00:41:32,506
How would I know that?

545
00:41:32,596 --> 00:41:35,397
You were passed out
at the table by yourself.

546
00:41:36,186 --> 00:41:39,366
-Then how did I get home?
-I'm not sure.

547
00:41:39,606 --> 00:41:42,706
Oh, some young man came by
and carried you out of here.

548
00:41:42,796 --> 00:41:44,716
But you don't know what we talked about?

549
00:41:44,806 --> 00:41:46,746
How would I know that?

550
00:41:46,836 --> 00:41:49,396
But as I was leaving to go home,

551
00:41:49,486 --> 00:41:53,126
I saw the two of you sitting out there,
having a long and serious conversation.

552
00:41:53,826 --> 00:41:56,586
-Right out there?
-It looked like a serious conversation.

553
00:41:56,676 --> 00:41:58,936
You looked like you were crying.

554
00:41:59,176 --> 00:42:01,016
I was crying?

555
00:42:01,976 --> 00:42:03,746
How can I?

556
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:06,616
When it's you.

557
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,056
I've called for a cab,
so it should be here soon.

558
00:42:35,306 --> 00:42:37,793
Where have you been?

559
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:45,335
I went to see my brother.

560
00:42:45,786 --> 00:42:47,806
I see.

561
00:42:47,896 --> 00:42:50,852
I tried calling you so many times.

562
00:42:51,356 --> 00:42:52,836
I couldn't...

563
00:42:53,616 --> 00:42:55,056
take your calls.

564
00:42:55,146 --> 00:42:58,376
Why couldn't you take my calls?

565
00:43:01,286 --> 00:43:03,816
I'm the one who has turned my brother...

566
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,702
into a murderer.

567
00:43:14,236 --> 00:43:16,498
I thought  my brother had abandoned me...

568
00:43:18,191 --> 00:43:19,836
so I didn't look for him.

569
00:43:21,726 --> 00:43:23,806
Even when I could've.

570
00:43:24,366 --> 00:43:25,895
I loved being around you so much

571
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,736
and I loved being around your dad
and father so much...

572
00:43:31,286 --> 00:43:32,886
so I didn't look for my brother.

573
00:43:35,456 --> 00:43:37,676
Had I found my brother sooner,

574
00:43:37,766 --> 00:43:40,335
then I probably would've been able to stop
any of this from happening.

575
00:43:45,246 --> 00:43:47,486
I hate myself to a point
where I can't even breathe.

576
00:43:48,746 --> 00:43:51,126
I hate myself
for not having searched for my brother

577
00:43:51,216 --> 00:43:53,114
and I hate myself for
not having been able to leave you.

578
00:43:54,726 --> 00:43:57,176
Even right at this moment...

579
00:43:59,876 --> 00:44:01,937
I still hesitate because of you.

580
00:44:03,236 --> 00:44:04,882
And I really hate myself for that.

581
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:12,456
The more my heart aches for my brother...

582
00:44:12,866 --> 00:44:16,406
the bigger my hatred grows for your mother
to a point where I want to destroy her.

583
00:44:16,496 --> 00:44:19,026
I want to rant and cry with my brother....

584
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:25,186
but I can't do that because of you.

585
00:44:26,116 --> 00:44:31,056
I want to tell my brother to start living
and leave the revenge to me...

586
00:44:33,326 --> 00:44:35,080
but I can't do that because of you.

587
00:44:36,836 --> 00:44:38,574
It's okay if you want to hate me.

588
00:44:39,536 --> 00:44:41,207
It's okay if you want to leave me.

589
00:44:42,826 --> 00:44:44,192
I mean it.

590
00:44:48,406 --> 00:44:50,486
How can I?

591
00:44:51,406 --> 00:44:52,535
When it's you?

592
00:44:59,766 --> 00:45:01,286
What do I do?

593
00:45:01,376 --> 00:45:02,741
Dal-Po...

594
00:45:03,046 --> 00:45:04,616
I'm sorry.

595
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:08,666
I'm not really myself right now
after visiting my brother.

596
00:45:08,756 --> 00:45:12,636
-Dal-Po...
-So forget everything that I just said.

597
00:45:13,696 --> 00:45:15,836
Just like how you forget things
when you get drunk.

598
00:45:17,806 --> 00:45:19,470
Forget all of this, too.

599
00:45:24,496 --> 00:45:26,245
What are we going to do?

600
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,756
Ha-myung, you like her daughter,
don't you?

601
00:45:41,846 --> 00:45:46,037
Then do you really think...
that you can get revenge on her?

602
00:45:47,186 --> 00:45:51,025
You haven't been able to do it yet,
so do you actually think you can do it?

603
00:45:52,146 --> 00:45:55,893
Because I'll be the one
to bring Song Cha-ok to an end.

604
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:08,166
In-ha, what are you doing here?

605
00:46:08,596 --> 00:46:10,370
Don't you have the day off?

606
00:46:11,026 --> 00:46:12,518
I have something to tell you.

607
00:46:20,436 --> 00:46:22,856
What's so important that
you came all the way down here?

608
00:46:23,306 --> 00:46:25,996
I remembered everything
you said to me last night.

609
00:46:28,126 --> 00:46:29,276
What?

610
00:46:30,336 --> 00:46:32,973
I can't imagine how much
you must've hated me all this time.

611
00:46:34,786 --> 00:46:38,256
Of course, I hate you.
You have no idea how heavy you were.

612
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:41,166
Don't get mad at me over a joke!

613
00:46:45,006 --> 00:46:46,509
Stop changing the subject,
and just listen.

614
00:46:48,086 --> 00:46:52,326
I know that you've be suppressing hatred
that you feel for my mom because of me.

615
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:55,456
And I also know that
you'll continue to do so from now on.

616
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:56,542
And...

617
00:46:57,916 --> 00:47:01,136
I also know that your hatred is too big
to be kept suppressed forever.

618
00:47:02,716 --> 00:47:06,286
-In-ha, I...
-That's why I'm going to let you go.

619
00:47:12,506 --> 00:47:15,326
I don't want
to keep holding you back anymore.

620
00:47:17,136 --> 00:47:19,496
So let's just end it now.

621
00:47:33,037 --> 00:47:35,765
Don't worry.
I'll be able to get over my feelings.

622
00:47:40,026 --> 00:47:41,352
So...

623
00:47:41,536 --> 00:47:43,404
don't let yourself be weighed down
with concern for me...

624
00:47:44,507 --> 00:47:47,174
and don't hesitate anymore because of me,
and put up a good fight against my mom.

625
00:47:48,526 --> 00:47:51,197
It's okay for you to be angry,
and hate her as much as you want.

626
00:47:54,736 --> 00:47:58,446
-Do you mean that?
-Yes.

627
00:47:58,536 --> 00:48:00,346
I mean it.

628
00:48:01,866 --> 00:48:03,356
See?

629
00:48:03,446 --> 00:48:05,276
I'm not hiccuping.

630
00:48:13,676 --> 00:48:16,246
It's late, I should get home.

631
00:48:48,796 --> 00:48:50,276
Thinking back...

632
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,266
I should've left then.

633
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,386
I never should've let those feelings grow

634
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:11,972
nor should I have set my gaze on her.

635
00:49:14,546 --> 00:49:19,516
I thought that the flutters in my heart
would just subside as time goes by.

636
00:49:23,726 --> 00:49:28,156
I thought that after some time had passed,
it would be easy for me to leave her.

637
00:49:29,936 --> 00:49:32,786
But that was a foolish misunderstanding...

638
00:49:35,086 --> 00:49:37,096
and just an excuse...

639
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:41,136
for me to remain by her side.

640
00:49:56,196 --> 00:49:57,880
In the cloud of that excuse
and misunderstanding...

641
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:00,957
I had felt such joy and happiness.

642
00:50:05,616 --> 00:50:07,577
Even though that happiness
was just a lie...

643
00:50:08,446 --> 00:50:10,752
I thought that I could argue it
until it became a reality.

644
00:50:15,061 --> 00:50:18,825
I thought that if I argued it enough,
those dreams would become a reality.

645
00:50:22,916 --> 00:50:25,426
But no matter how I shut my eyes
and ears to it...

646
00:50:25,516 --> 00:50:27,536
and no matter
how much I argued against it...

647
00:50:28,206 --> 00:50:32,146
the truth still remained
right where it stood.

648
00:50:46,887 --> 00:50:48,906
It's now time to awake from those dreams.

649
00:50:49,566 --> 00:50:52,316
No matter how hideous
and heavy the truth is...

650
00:50:52,766 --> 00:50:54,571
it's now time to face the reality.

651
00:51:03,356 --> 00:51:04,586
Oh, my goodness.

652
00:51:04,676 --> 00:51:06,526
Aren't you Mr Ki Jae-myung?

653
00:51:06,616 --> 00:51:09,336
You're the one who saved
that boy with your truck.

654
00:51:09,426 --> 00:51:11,116
Yes, hello.

655
00:51:13,456 --> 00:51:16,976
-How much is that?
-This one?

656
00:51:17,066 --> 00:51:18,406
Yes.

657
00:51:29,406 --> 00:51:30,756
Ha-myung

658
00:51:34,946 --> 00:51:36,386
Hello?

659
00:51:37,506 --> 00:51:40,196
Yeah... right now?

660
00:51:42,536 --> 00:51:43,896
Okay.

661
00:51:43,986 --> 00:51:45,104
Where are you?

662
00:52:12,406 --> 00:52:14,364
Are you here to tell me
to turn myself in again?

663
00:52:21,886 --> 00:52:23,267
I'm sorry, Jae-myung.

664
00:52:24,386 --> 00:52:26,472
It's my fault that
you've become a murderer.

665
00:52:26,996 --> 00:52:28,680
Had I found you sooner...

666
00:52:30,556 --> 00:52:31,956
then you wouldn't have
turned out this way.

667
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:38,011
No, even if you had,
you wouldn't have been able to stop me.

668
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:40,972
When knowing how unfairly
our father and mother left this world

669
00:52:41,216 --> 00:52:43,058
you couldn't have stopped me
from seeking my revenge.

670
00:52:43,806 --> 00:52:45,196
I'll do it.

671
00:52:45,286 --> 00:52:46,926
I'll get that revenge.

672
00:52:47,016 --> 00:52:48,556
You?

673
00:52:51,436 --> 00:52:52,818
How will you be able to do that?

674
00:52:52,976 --> 00:52:56,544
Do you remember the reason why you said
you couldn't leave the revenge to me?

675
00:52:57,896 --> 00:53:01,041
-Yeah.
-I'm here to answer that question.

676
00:53:04,176 --> 00:53:08,706
To me, Song Cha-ok wasn't our family's
enemy, but she was In-ha's mother.

677
00:53:08,796 --> 00:53:11,544
Because I couldn't get over that thought,
just like you said.

678
00:53:12,636 --> 00:53:14,590
I gave up on any ideas of me
seeking revenge against her.

679
00:53:15,736 --> 00:53:18,676
But now, I want to seek
real revenge against her.

680
00:53:19,256 --> 00:53:20,858
And because of that...

681
00:53:25,956 --> 00:53:27,730
I've let In-ha go.

682
00:53:28,476 --> 00:53:29,788
What?

683
00:53:30,516 --> 00:53:33,316
I'm going to stop thinking of Song Cha-ok
as In-ha's mother

684
00:53:33,406 --> 00:53:35,283
and fight her as a reporter
against another reporter.

685
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:40,786
I'm not sure.

686
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:44,559
How do I know that
you're any different from her?

687
00:53:46,726 --> 00:53:47,845
You're right.

688
00:53:48,836 --> 00:53:50,438
I'm not much different from her right now.

689
00:53:51,758 --> 00:53:55,125
I've only been seeing and hearing things
that I chose to see and hear, like her.

690
00:53:55,935 --> 00:53:58,776
I knew what you did,
and I knew what you were about to do

691
00:53:58,866 --> 00:54:00,756
and I still chose to ignore it. But...

692
00:54:03,608 --> 00:54:04,898
I'm not going to be like that anymore.

693
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,046
I just...

694
00:54:07,529 --> 00:54:10,105
handed over all the evidence I have on you
to my boss before I came here.

695
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:12,656
Including the recording of what you said
at the ossuary the other day,

696
00:54:12,746 --> 00:54:14,056
and the text from the witness.

697
00:54:14,146 --> 00:54:16,506
And I'm going to go
and meet with that witness.

698
00:54:16,596 --> 00:54:19,076
If the information I receive is true,
then as a reporter,

699
00:54:32,006 --> 00:54:33,436
I'm going to...

700
00:54:38,516 --> 00:54:40,748
I'm going to report you as a murderer.

701
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:47,036
Please forgive me.

702
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:49,916
But this is...

703
00:54:50,466 --> 00:54:52,976
my answer to your question.

704
00:54:56,396 --> 00:54:59,356
As a reporter, I'm going to stop you
from seeking your revenge...

705
00:55:00,536 --> 00:55:02,236
and as a reporter...

706
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,126
I'm going to exact
my own revenge on Song Cha-ok.

707
00:55:10,496 --> 00:55:11,502
Ha-myung.

708
00:55:33,816 --> 00:55:35,796
Okay, is everyone ready?

709
00:55:36,546 --> 00:55:38,207
We're ready.

710
00:55:38,526 --> 00:55:43,276
These are the questions you'll be asked,
but the order of it may change slightly.

711
00:55:43,366 --> 00:55:45,196
And...

712
00:55:48,866 --> 00:55:52,106
Wow, you look like
a totally different person in that suit.

713
00:55:54,056 --> 00:55:55,836
Thank you.

714
00:56:09,716 --> 00:56:12,526
Are you here because you're worried
about what Ki Jae-myung may do?

715
00:56:12,616 --> 00:56:13,569
Yeah.

716
00:56:34,646 --> 00:56:38,506
It was found out that
you were an unfortunate victim

717
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:40,976
of the tragic factory explosion accident
that occurred 13 years ago

718
00:56:41,066 --> 00:56:43,796
and it has garnered him
even more attention from the citizens.

719
00:56:44,126 --> 00:56:48,767
We've already met 13 years ago
right in this same spot, haven't we?

720
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:08,926
Informant

721
00:57:20,346 --> 00:57:22,246
This is Choi Dal-Po from YGN News.

722
00:57:22,336 --> 00:57:24,018
Are you the informant?

723
00:57:24,216 --> 00:57:26,456
Ha-myung, it's me.

724
00:57:27,946 --> 00:57:29,466
I'm your informant.

725
00:57:32,256 --> 00:57:33,936
Jae-myung?

726
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:51,460
I am turning myself in to you.

727
00:57:54,786 --> 00:57:56,626
But why would you...

728
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,199
I was just curious.

729
00:58:01,799 --> 00:58:03,427
I was curious to see whether or not

730
00:58:04,542 --> 00:58:05,837
I could trust you to seek our revenge.

731
00:58:06,857 --> 00:58:09,516
I was curious to see whether or not
you were different from Song Cha-ok.

732
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,477
I needed to know for myself.

733
00:58:16,979 --> 00:58:18,702
Even though it took longer
than I expected...

734
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:22,218
you ultimately still called.

735
00:58:27,986 --> 00:58:29,476
Now...

736
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:33,926
I see that I can trust you.

737
00:58:34,626 --> 00:58:35,986
Jae-myung.

738
00:58:37,586 --> 00:58:40,136
I'm going to leave it in your hands
to seek revenge for us.

739
00:58:43,252 --> 00:58:44,596
If you're going to do it...

740
00:58:45,463 --> 00:58:46,718
then do it with flair.

741
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:16,106
Are you Ki Jae-myung's little brother?

742
00:59:16,196 --> 00:59:18,716
Ki Jae-myung's brother reported
his own brother of being a murderer

743
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:20,666
so I think with enough twist,
we can make it work.

744
00:59:20,756 --> 00:59:23,176
I'll take the beating and curses,
if they beat me and curse me.

745
00:59:23,266 --> 00:59:25,376
How about quitting being a reporter?

746
00:59:25,466 --> 00:59:28,176
So you interviewed him
when you've already made up your mind?

747
00:59:28,266 --> 00:59:30,556
-If this is wrong, then that's the end.
-I'm sorry.

748
00:59:30,646 --> 00:59:33,386
Was it that hard for you to live with us?

749
00:59:33,806 --> 00:59:36,066
-Dal-Po.
-Don't call me by that name.

750
00:59:37,396 --> 00:59:40,316
Please don't do anything,
and just stay here.
