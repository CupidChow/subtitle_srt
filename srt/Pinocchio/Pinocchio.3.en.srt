1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,760
Pinocchio

2
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,480
What's wrong?

3
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,950
Isn't that wonderful?

4
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,750
Who? All-zero?

5
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,670
That amazing box.

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
Choi Dal-Po.

7
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,110
Do you think broadcast is a joke?

8
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,260
I don’t think broadcasting is a joke.

9
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,360
You can kill a person by
one word from a broadcast.

10
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,180
How dare...

11
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,210
-I think that broadcasting a joke?
-The people who saw that show

12
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,710
won’t be able to say that
Dal-Po stole the test paper now.

13
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,130
Isn’t that really cool?

14
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,120
It's full of human beings thoughtlessly
assumes nonsense and blabbers out.

15
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,990
Tons of people here wear microphones
and cameras as their armbands.

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,470
I decided my career path.

17
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,670
Oh, my... Hey!

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,490
You can't change it if you
write with a pen. Use pencil!

19
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,360
I will never ever change it!
I'm sure of it.

20
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,450
I will become a TV journalist.

21
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,720
I'll become a journalist

22
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,810
and get a job in the TV station.

23
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,800
Thinking that I’m breathing the same air
with that disgusting people

24
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,980
suffocates and makes me sick.

25
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,250
Going back to a TV station...

26
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,759
is something I hate much more than death.

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,720
Is that...

28
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,980
enough of an answer?

29
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,930
Episode 3 - Queen of the Eye

30
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,930
Ha-myung, wake up and eat your breakfast.

31
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,930
Just five more minutes.

32
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,660
Ha-myung!

33
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,560
Mom?

34
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,570
When I was up on the roof
trying to put the fire out,

35
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,610
the roof suddenly collapsed.

36
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,660
Really? Then, what happened?

37
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:14,910
Jae-myung.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
-Are you listening to me?
-Yes, I'm listening.

39
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,140
Then, I fell five meters
down to the ground,

40
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,710
but I was perfectly fine.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
How is that possible?

42
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,040
Father...

43
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,840
-Hyung...
-Oh, Ha-myung.

44
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,030
Guess what happened.
How do you think I got away safely?

45
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,270
Hey! Hey! This kid. What are you doing?

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,110
Oh, my! What are you doing?

47
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,560
-Isn’t this a dream?
-What's got into you?

48
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,260
Are you still half asleep?
What are you dreaming of?

49
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,570
Dream?

50
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,630
That was a dream?

51
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,230
Not this one?

52
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,600
What are you talking about?

53
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,760
What do you mean by
that dream and this dream?

54
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,730
A bad...

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,200
A really bad dream.

56
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,000
Dad went into hiding
after causing a huge accident.

57
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,340
Jae-myung ran away abandoning mom and I.

58
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,300
And...

59
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,370
Mom...

60
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,810
I did that?

61
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,740
He's crazy.

62
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,690
Why would I?

63
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,760
I should've scold you!
Why did you do that?

64
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,060
Why! Why! Why did you do that?

65
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,090
Should I get scolded for
what I did in his dream?

66
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,180
So I...

67
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,330
I lived my life blaming
Dad and Jae-myung...

68
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,900
and didn't even try to find you.

69
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,800
Oh, my God. Did you?

70
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,050
Geez.

71
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,820
Why'd you dream about
such an awful things?

72
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,660
It's okay.

73
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
That’s right.

74
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,830
That doesn’t make sense.

75
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,310
You're right.

76
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,970
I just need to heat this japchae
up for 30 seconds, right?

77
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,840
Why are you here?

78
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,990
Why are you here!

79
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,540
Uncle.

80
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,390
She...

81
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,250
She's not supposed to be here.
That means...

82
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,860
this is a dream.

83
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,420
Why is you acting
this way all of a sudden?

84
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,270
Then, what happened?

85
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,620
Where did you fall that
you're perfectly fine like this?

86
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Right. I was talking about that.

87
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,960
I fell...

88
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,460
into a pile of cow poop.

89
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,810
-That's disgusting!
-So disgusting!

90
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,750
Disgusting?

91
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,380
That pile of poop saved my life!

92
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,010
We should honor it, instead.

93
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,720
Dad.

94
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,990
Dad, who is she?

95
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,250
-Hyung, do you know her?
-Of course.

96
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,420
She's our pretty niece.

97
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,500
It really is a dream.

98
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm sure.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,040
I don't want to wake up.

100
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,490
It feels bumpy.

101
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,680
What?

102
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,440
This feels bumpy.

103
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,960
What's wrong with you today?

104
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,710
I can feel this. It can't be a dream.

105
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,240
It definitely feels bumpy!

106
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,660
It's bumpy.

107
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,610
It's not a dream. It's bumpy.

108
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,940
October 4th, 2013

109
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,240
It's bumpy.

110
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,390
What is he dreaming of?

111
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,020
Hey, wake up.

112
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,720
It feels bumpy.

113
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,030
It feels bumpy.

114
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,560
You pervert!

115
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,970
Oh, my! You shouldn't
have hit him so hard.

116
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,640
Go on and eat.

117
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,830
What's wrong?

118
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,820
Oh, my goodness.

119
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,020
Wait a sec.

120
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,880
What did you do to his good-looking face?

121
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,520
-He did something that deserves a beating.
-My God.

122
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,970
And to be frank, his face
isn't that good-looking.

123
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,470
His face is just there,
so he had no choice but to...

124
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,780
Hey!

125
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,580
What a sass!

126
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,350
See the way you talk to your uncle!

127
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,330
This is why people
call you 'Blunt Witch'.

128
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,190
I'm smart, and pretty.

129
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,490
If I have a nice attitude too,
wouldn't this world be too unfair?

130
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,430
And it's not that I'm blunt,
I'm being honest.

131
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,310
It's true that he had a bad style.

132
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,770
Hyungnim, please tell your niece that
she needs to have a sense of honor.

133
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,090
-In-ha, you need to have...
-Uncle.

134
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,640
Tell my dad that I have a sense of honor.

135
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,840
Tell her I'm curious to
know where she gets off

136
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,730
telling her uncle who supports her

137
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,510
for three years by being a cab driver

138
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,550
while she wasted time and money chasing
her useless dream that he's tacky?

139
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,349
You should just become a rapper.

140
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,520
Uncle, tell my dad that I have a last
interview with the TV station tomorrow

141
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,074
and when I get hired, he's not allowed
to make fun ever again!

142
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,960
Tell her that landing a final interview

143
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,990
after three whole years is nothing
to brag about, and if she fails again

144
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,474
she has to do as our contract states.

145
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,120
What are you saying to your daughter?

146
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,620
It's a relief that I don't have
to see this nonsense anymore.

147
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,692
This has been going on
for three years already!

148
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,970
If you fail again this time,
will it be your 36th time?

149
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,600
No, it's 35th.

150
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,310
And I told you that I'll pass this time.

151
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,830
You've already said that 35 times.

152
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,800
There are 10 people
made it to final interview.

153
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,320
I heard that about two people fail.

154
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,790
Do you think that I'm
going to be one of those?

155
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,590
Cap, I heard that they have chosen
10 people for the final interview?

156
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,082
I think they chose more this year
to make up for last year.

157
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,924
I hope they choose the useful ones.

158
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,340
I don't know about that.

159
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,599
-But there is one I'm speechless about.
-Who is it?

160
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,880
One of them has Pinocchio syndrome.

161
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,940
What?

162
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,920
That doesn’t make any sense.

163
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,970
How can a person who can't lie
do interviews?

164
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,800
That's what I'm saying.

165
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,000
That person must have some
remarkable qualifications.

166
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,480
-Or a connection?
-Yeah.

167
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,410
She has a connection.

168
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,850
It's Ms Song Cha-ok's daughter.

169
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,019
Really? She has a daughter?

170
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,460
-I thought she was single.
-I recently found it out myself.

171
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,970
But even still, how could she
have chosen a Pinocchio!

172
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,410
Why not?

173
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,810
If she's her daughter, we have to hire her
no matter who she is.

174
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,230
It's a jackpot if she has even half
of what Song Cha-ok.

175
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,769
Her legend is nothing but an illusion.

176
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,810
She stole an exclusive scoop right
from under her junior's nose.

177
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,600
Ms Song Cha-ok!

178
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,840
We're over here!

179
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,540
-Right this way.
-Do you remember me?

180
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,780
-I'm from Local News...
-A cap isn't supposed to be here.

181
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,520
It's not just anyone returning,
but it's you!

182
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,590
I want to prepare a red carpet
but I'm afraid you won't like it,

183
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,259
so I stopped with this banner.

184
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,180
Isn't this cute?

185
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,200
Yeah.

186
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,820
So cute that I almost swore out loud.

187
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,640
When is the editorial meeting?

188
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,200
You'll attend the meeting tomorrow?

189
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,690
Why? I'm not allowed to?

190
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,150
Of course you can.

191
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,487
You're not only the head of Local News
Department, but also an anchor-to-be.

192
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,120
How was Washington?

193
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,930
Were you okay with the food?

194
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,590
Did you get the kimchi that I sent you?

195
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,210
Oh, my.

196
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,400
Look at this.

197
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,190
What's this, father?

198
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,730
I heard...

199
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,830
you broke up with Sung-eun last month?

200
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,010
She's the pizza shop owner's daughter.

201
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,084
Want to meet her?

202
00:09:43,446 --> 00:09:45,787
No, it's okay.
I already have a new girlfriend.

203
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,935
Wow, that's quick.
You've got some skills.

204
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,310
What kind of a girl is she?

205
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,550
Her name is Hye-sung.

206
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,336
She's smart, kind, and has a nice voice.

207
00:09:58,426 --> 00:10:02,986
Isn't that exactly what you
said about Sung-eun, too?

208
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,056
Did I?

209
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:07,456
You two take a rest.

210
00:10:07,766 --> 00:10:11,386
Maybe he likes smart and
kind girls with nice voices.

211
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:12,476
Lower your head.

212
00:10:14,106 --> 00:10:15,856
Uncle, you should buy some new clothes.

213
00:10:15,946 --> 00:10:18,016
Your tacky style must push
girls always dumping you.

214
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:19,176
Done.

215
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:23,494
If my style were an issue, I wouldn’t
have dated her in the first place.

216
00:10:27,156 --> 00:10:29,156
In-ha, come here.

217
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:32,675
Does Dal-Po look that tacky to you?

218
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:34,616
Is he really that tacky?

219
00:10:34,806 --> 00:10:36,744
He's even worse.

220
00:10:48,676 --> 00:10:50,869
Which TV station are you going to
for your final interview?

221
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:54,098
If I told you, will you keep it a secret
from my dad?

222
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:55,648
Why would I have to keep it a secret?

223
00:10:57,368 --> 00:10:58,408
Is it by any chance...?

224
00:10:58,898 --> 00:10:59,668
Yeah.

225
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:01,048
You are right.

226
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:04,608
I'm going to MSC Station,
where my mom works.

227
00:11:08,058 --> 00:11:09,578
-Did you contact your mother?
-Yeah.

228
00:11:09,728 --> 00:11:11,654
I texted her that I will be
on the final interview.

229
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:14,528
I may get to see my mom,
so what should I wear?

230
00:11:15,628 --> 00:11:17,628
How is it? Is it nice? Do I look smart?

231
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:19,428
You look dumb.

232
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:20,918
Really? That's no good.

233
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:24,518
How about...

234
00:11:30,678 --> 00:11:31,678
Hey, what about this?

235
00:11:31,878 --> 00:11:33,878
Does this make me look
smart and polished?

236
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:36,578
You look like the dumbest in the world.

237
00:11:41,638 --> 00:11:42,638
What's wrong with you?

238
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:44,228
Are you stupid?

239
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:46,548
Do you really think that's
you mom's real number?

240
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:47,798
Of course.

241
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:49,558
If it wasn't, then a text will come.

242
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:51,648
If it's the number,
she would've texted you.

243
00:11:58,388 --> 00:12:00,188
My mom's very busy.

244
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:02,388
Busy enough to ignore her
own daughter for 10 years?

245
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,428
That means one of two things.

246
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:07,188
She either changed her number
or she no longer cares about you.

247
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:11,328
Hey, push hard...

248
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:20,038
Haven't you assume as much?

249
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:21,208
If she hasn't replied...

250
00:12:21,298 --> 00:12:23,958
She's been out in Tokyo and Washington
as a correspondent.

251
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:26,788
-It's difficult to get in touch.
-I wasn't aware of that.

252
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:30,028
-There's no phone in Tokyo and Washington.
-Don't be sarcastic.

253
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:33,028
Why are you and dad so desperate
to insult my mom?

254
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:34,688
Because of your pathetic pipe dream.

255
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:37,536
-You're going to get disappointed.
-I won't disappointed.

256
00:12:38,108 --> 00:12:41,178
Because I won't believe no matter
how badly you and dad slander my mom.

257
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:44,528
-It's not slander, it's truth.
-No, it is a slander.

258
00:12:45,168 --> 00:12:46,058
Dal-Po.

259
00:12:46,478 --> 00:12:47,808
Have you ever met my mom before?

260
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:52,148
I only believe what I see.

261
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,168
Just the way I believed in you
eight years ago.

262
00:12:54,548 --> 00:12:56,218
Hey, that's a totally different issue.

263
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,128
No.

264
00:12:57,218 --> 00:12:58,918
This is the exact same thing.

265
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:02,008
When others slandered you,
I didn't believe any of it.

266
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:03,378
And I was right.

267
00:13:06,488 --> 00:13:08,678
So don't slander my mom
without any evidence.

268
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:23,908
What would we have to apologize
to All-Zero for?

269
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:26,258
You spread false rumors
about him without any evidence.

270
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,328
Do you have evidence
that proves Dal-Po stole it?

271
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:32,288
The worst student scored a perfect score
on the test overnight.

272
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,248
No evidence can be bigger than that.

273
00:13:34,338 --> 00:13:36,338
That's not evidence, that's speculation.

274
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:45,768
This is Hye-sung Navigation System,
your friend in safe driving.

275
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,708
Please put on your seat belt.

276
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:49,098
Hye-sung.

277
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:51,008
What am I going to do?

278
00:13:51,588 --> 00:13:52,878
Please drive safely.

279
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:56,448
I’m going.

280
00:13:56,538 --> 00:13:57,808
Crossword.

281
00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:00,808
What's this?

282
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:04,738
-Oh, Dal-Po left his wallet.
-Oh, no.

283
00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:06,338
What are we going to do?

284
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,568
You'd better hurry.

285
00:14:07,658 --> 00:14:09,428
I bet he hasn't left yet.

286
00:14:23,418 --> 00:14:25,938
What are you waiting?
Hurry take that out to him?

287
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:27,058
Yes.

288
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:32,408
Dal-Po!

289
00:14:32,898 --> 00:14:33,868
Dal-Po...

290
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:07,008
Get in.

291
00:15:08,048 --> 00:15:08,958
I'm fine.

292
00:15:09,268 --> 00:15:10,578
It's cold. Just get in the car.

293
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:11,968
I'm not cold.

294
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:15,488
Fine, I'm cold!

295
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:18,278
But I'm not taking your cab. Why?
Since it's more expensive than bus.

296
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:22,398
And because you're a mean uncle who
makes his niece pay the taxi fare.

297
00:15:24,238 --> 00:15:25,558
I won't turn on the meter.

298
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:26,928
Really?

299
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:30,008
For real?

300
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:31,148
Yeah.

301
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,938
Frequent accident zone ahead.

302
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:51,548
Please drive safely.

303
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:55,058
Want to buy my dream?
I had a wonderful dream.

304
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,098
What did you dream about?

305
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:01,368
A dream where I saw
the people I really long for.

306
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,028
Are you sure that it was a good dream?

307
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:05,138
You should just buy it.

308
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:08,718
If it is, then you may get to see your
mom and make it on your interview today.

309
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,128
-How much will it cost me?
-$10.

310
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:13,608
Hey!

311
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:15,718
$1.

312
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,278
$5.

313
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:19,508
Or forget it. It’s too
good to be less than $5.

314
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:26,728
Okay, deal.

315
00:16:32,288 --> 00:16:34,578
-What's this?
-Call it a receipt of sorts.

316
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,638
This is so childish!

317
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:39,048
You’re no longer a kid.

318
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,268
Drive slower, you're
moving around too much.

319
00:16:57,088 --> 00:16:59,958
Who were the people in
your dream by the way?

320
00:17:01,008 --> 00:17:03,008
You said they were people
you really long for.

321
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:04,628
Who were they?

322
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:10,328
You don't need to know.

323
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:23,108
Seoul Metropolitan Police
Station Journalist Room

324
00:17:30,278 --> 00:17:32,528
As soon as she gets back
from in Washington

325
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,418
she became a department head and
is given the prime time anchor.

326
00:17:35,658 --> 00:17:37,278
Such an extraordinary greeting.

327
00:17:37,368 --> 00:17:40,068
Our news show has recently hit
the rock bottom.

328
00:17:40,188 --> 00:17:43,188
We’re so behind your news show
in viewer ratings.

329
00:17:43,968 --> 00:17:46,298
So, I'm sure they're taking a gamble
on her.

330
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:47,748
I do think so.

331
00:17:47,838 --> 00:17:49,458
It’s gambling like all or nothing.

332
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:50,588
All or nothing?

333
00:17:50,858 --> 00:17:51,898
What do you mean by 'all'?

334
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,468
First, Ms Song Cha-ok has
an impressive resume.

335
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:55,998
She was the first woman

336
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,358
to be the head of reporters
in cable news networks.

337
00:17:58,448 --> 00:18:00,768
And, she worked abroad
as a correspondence even twice.

338
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:02,798
She's practically a legend.

339
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:05,478
She knows how to take care of herself
as a journalist, as well.

340
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:13,818
She's a woman, but she still runs
full course marathons.

341
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,894
Didn't she also won first place
in the beer drinking competition?

342
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:21,598
On top of that, she's also got the looks

343
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:23,848
and has great showmanship as a reporter.

344
00:18:24,018 --> 00:18:25,768
I think I get that.

345
00:18:25,998 --> 00:18:28,268
-What is 'nothing' then?
-That showmanship is the problem.

346
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,638
She's more of an entertainer,
rather than a real reporter.

347
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:33,028
She's always been well-known
for her level of showmanship.

348
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:35,238
It's about 10 years ago, I guess...

349
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:37,268
Do you remember when the
preschool bus accident

350
00:18:37,358 --> 00:18:39,538
she did a report with a shoe in her hand?

351
00:18:39,628 --> 00:18:41,908
-Five year old, Jae-min, wore...
-Of course.

352
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:44,394
My mother cried when she saw that.

353
00:18:44,678 --> 00:18:47,018
She bought the shoe at a store
just to shoot that scene.

354
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:48,778
No way. Are you serious?

355
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:50,868
Yes! And that's not all.

356
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:52,558
When main street of Gangnam flooded

357
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:55,008
all the other reporters
waded in knee deep.

358
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:57,838
The overflow that you see in this
Gangnam Avenue every year...

359
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,153
But she was the only one
who went waist deep on the news.

360
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:03,248
-How?
-She knelt down in the water.

361
00:19:03,568 --> 00:19:05,828
-Just to it even more realistic.
-How was it?

362
00:19:07,988 --> 00:19:10,248
-That's just pure fraud.
-Of course.

363
00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:13,778
That’s why people call our channel
‘MSG Station’ because of her.

364
00:19:15,878 --> 00:19:17,278
-What?
-You're such a...

365
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:20,318
But still, she's your superior.

366
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:23,458
-Don't you diss her too much?
-I'm just telling the truth as a reporter.

367
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:25,248
So what if she's my superior?

368
00:19:25,448 --> 00:19:27,558
The higher person it is about

369
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:29,358
the harsher criticism you have to use.

370
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,993
You really sound like
a real reporter right now.

371
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:44,028
Why are you looking at me like that?

372
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:48,408
Typing 'Kim Gong-joo handsome reporter'

373
00:19:48,498 --> 00:19:51,268
in the searching engine just to change
your related search topic

374
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,978
is a form of manipulation in itself.

375
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:56,538
It's not manipulation.

376
00:19:56,768 --> 00:19:58,548
Compared to what Ms Song Cha-ok does,

377
00:19:58,638 --> 00:20:00,428
this is just child's play.

378
00:20:08,128 --> 00:20:09,418
How would you like to be styled?

379
00:20:09,878 --> 00:20:11,628
I want to have a make-up like this.

380
00:20:13,148 --> 00:20:15,288
You must be interviewing
for a news anchor.

381
00:20:15,768 --> 00:20:18,488
Not for an anchor, but a reporter.

382
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:20,068
Anchor, and reporter...

383
00:20:20,158 --> 00:20:21,938
Isn't it pretty much the same thing?

384
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:24,338
It's different. It's totally different.

385
00:20:25,218 --> 00:20:26,398
How are they different?

386
00:20:28,378 --> 00:20:31,448
Reporters are more precise
and intellectual.

387
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:33,438
Do you get it?

388
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:37,528
More precise and intellectual?

389
00:20:38,878 --> 00:20:40,808
Okay, I know it exactly!

390
00:20:40,898 --> 00:20:41,848
Okay.

391
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:44,888
I got it... I totally got it.

392
00:20:48,378 --> 00:20:50,898
Give her the 'Anchor' look.

393
00:20:58,228 --> 00:20:59,518
Mom

394
00:21:01,848 --> 00:21:03,108
Go for it

395
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:04,618
Mom...

396
00:21:06,388 --> 00:21:07,308
What is it?

397
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,992
My mom just texted me.

398
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:11,968
So?

399
00:21:12,828 --> 00:21:14,223
I said, my mom just texted me.

400
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:15,870
This is just unbelievable.

401
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:17,622
My mom just texted me!

402
00:21:18,468 --> 00:21:19,308
Can you believe this?

403
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:21,508
Why would it be unbelievable?

404
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:24,228
It's usual to get a text
from your cellphone.

405
00:21:24,318 --> 00:21:26,412
It's been 13 years.

406
00:21:27,848 --> 00:21:29,968
This isn't a dream, is it?

407
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:32,168
I think it's her first time got a text.

408
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,488
I know.

409
00:21:34,008 --> 00:21:35,438
She must get bullied a lot.

410
00:21:37,238 --> 00:21:39,528
Congratulations on your text message.

411
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:41,098
Thank you!

412
00:21:41,188 --> 00:21:43,798
I'm so incredibly happy right now!

413
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:52,658
-Yeah.
-Dal-Po, Dal-Po!

414
00:21:52,748 --> 00:21:53,838
Don't be shocked, okay?

415
00:21:53,928 --> 00:21:55,928
I'm not shocked right now.

416
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:58,678
My mom just texted me and
she said, 'Go for it'!

417
00:21:58,768 --> 00:22:00,628
Hey, how can you be sure
that it's from your...

418
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,588
...mom, of course. Congratulations.

419
00:22:06,198 --> 00:22:07,028
Thanks!

420
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,118
The dream you sold me
must've been for real!

421
00:22:09,448 --> 00:22:11,648
How could such luck find me so soon?

422
00:22:12,368 --> 00:22:14,428
I know, I have a good feeling today.

423
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:16,728
What do you think?

424
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:18,928
Do you think that I'll get hired today?

425
00:22:19,128 --> 00:22:19,968
Huh?

426
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,038
-Yeah.
-Are you sure?

427
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:24,848
I'm sure.

428
00:22:25,018 --> 00:22:27,428
Okay, I'll call you when I'm done.

429
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:32,508
Hye-sung.

430
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:35,308
I feel like I just sold fake medication
to critically ill patients.

431
00:22:35,398 --> 00:22:37,668
Is she naive or just plain stupid?
She's not even a kid.

432
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:39,758
Children safety zone ahead.

433
00:22:39,898 --> 00:22:40,978
Please drive safely.

434
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:42,928
Yeah, you're right.

435
00:22:43,188 --> 00:22:45,128
She's a child.
She's totally just a child.

436
00:22:45,218 --> 00:22:46,498
A child that has yet to grow up.

437
00:22:46,588 --> 00:22:49,508
-A child that needs to be looked after.
-Drive under 30km/h.

438
00:22:49,812 --> 00:22:51,228
I'm serious, man. This guy is weird.

439
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:53,941
He's actually having a
conversation with the GPS.

440
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:59,159
Jesus, he's smiling at me
through the rear view.

441
00:22:59,476 --> 00:23:00,973
I'm positive he's insane.

442
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,160
Shall I just get out of this cab
right now?

443
00:23:03,506 --> 00:23:06,245
Don't need to bother getting out.
I'm quite all right.

444
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:09,279
Yeah, I gotta go.

445
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:19,345
Bye.

446
00:23:26,568 --> 00:23:27,518
What happened?

447
00:23:28,588 --> 00:23:30,358
What’s going on, sir?

448
00:23:32,318 --> 00:23:34,508
Oh, my. What should I do now?

449
00:23:36,368 --> 00:23:37,898
What happened?

450
00:23:37,988 --> 00:23:40,718
I slipped down the slope

451
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:42,598
and hit this truck.

452
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:45,128
The front of the truck is scratched up.

453
00:23:45,218 --> 00:23:47,268
I have to tell the truck owner,

454
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:49,138
but I don't have a cellphone.

455
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:52,037
I wonder how much I'm going to have
to reimburse for this.

456
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:55,538
Sir, I'll take care of this,
so you can just go.

457
00:23:55,818 --> 00:23:57,188
How are you going to do that?

458
00:23:57,648 --> 00:23:59,878
I'll call the owner and take care of it.
You can just go.

459
00:23:59,968 --> 00:24:02,038
Are you sure that'll be okay?

460
00:24:02,128 --> 00:24:04,358
-It's okay.
-Thank you.

461
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:05,528
Oh!

462
00:24:13,648 --> 00:24:15,298
No phone number.

463
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:16,938
Sorry I accidentally hit your bumper

464
00:24:19,348 --> 00:24:20,678
Call me, and I'll reimburse you

465
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:26,558
Yes?

466
00:24:27,488 --> 00:24:29,138
No, I'm not driving right now.

467
00:24:31,758 --> 00:24:32,758
My wallet?

468
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:38,408
Yes.

469
00:24:38,498 --> 00:24:39,738
I'll go and get it right now.

470
00:24:39,868 --> 00:24:40,868
No real damage.

471
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:46,538
He couldn't have...

472
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:24,898
There's not enough money for both
Dal-Po and I to go to college?

473
00:25:26,418 --> 00:25:28,588
We would've had enough money
to send both of you

474
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:30,348
if we hadn't failed the seaweed farm.

475
00:25:31,078 --> 00:25:32,628
Does Dal-Po want to go to college, too?

476
00:25:32,718 --> 00:25:35,068
He hadn't said, but I'm sure he does.

477
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:37,478
He came in at first place
in the mock test, too.

478
00:25:39,778 --> 00:25:41,258
Based on our grades,

479
00:25:41,598 --> 00:25:43,368
it's only right for Dal-Po to go.

480
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:45,418
I'm going to enlist in the army.

481
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:47,188
-What?
-The army?

482
00:25:49,988 --> 00:25:51,638
Yes, I've already
requested to be enlisted.

483
00:25:51,728 --> 00:25:53,428
I'm going to enlist as
soon as I graduate.

484
00:25:54,488 --> 00:25:55,338
Dal-Po.

485
00:25:55,468 --> 00:25:56,878
If it's because of me...

486
00:25:57,608 --> 00:25:59,378
It's not because of you,
so don't overreact.

487
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:01,398
Let's just wrap it up here.

488
00:26:01,488 --> 00:26:02,986
I have no interest in going to college.

489
00:26:23,588 --> 00:26:24,958
There it is.

490
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:26,758
I had no idea that I left my wallet.

491
00:26:28,238 --> 00:26:29,808
I found this in your wallet.

492
00:26:30,078 --> 00:26:31,408
That?

493
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:33,538
In-ha left her photos for her resume

494
00:26:33,628 --> 00:26:35,958
and I brought them to her,
and that's the leftover.

495
00:26:36,998 --> 00:26:38,998
You know how absent-minded she is.

496
00:26:39,548 --> 00:26:40,378
Really?

497
00:26:40,468 --> 00:26:41,328
Is that all?

498
00:26:41,618 --> 00:26:43,478
Of course. What else could it be?

499
00:26:45,448 --> 00:26:47,448
You're not thinking
something weird, are you?

500
00:26:47,718 --> 00:26:49,188
Something weird Like what?

501
00:26:49,548 --> 00:26:50,908
Well...

502
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,008
As long as you're not, then it's fine.

503
00:27:01,068 --> 00:27:02,438
I'll keep this picture.

504
00:27:03,928 --> 00:27:05,198
If your girlfriend sees this

505
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:06,738
then she might get the wrong idea.

506
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:09,438
You wouldn't want that, would you?

507
00:27:11,508 --> 00:27:12,348
No.

508
00:27:25,008 --> 00:27:25,848
Mom.

509
00:27:26,648 --> 00:27:28,108
I'm finally here.

510
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:30,828
I can feel you...

511
00:27:31,578 --> 00:27:33,538
...can you feel me, too?

512
00:27:48,288 --> 00:27:49,348
She's totally insane.

513
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:07,668
Wait, I'm sorry to ask this,

514
00:28:07,948 --> 00:28:10,798
but is Ms Song Cha-ok
one of the interviewers?

515
00:28:12,128 --> 00:28:12,978
Yes.

516
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,438
She's a total Ice Witch.

517
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:17,398
She's total scary, so be careful.

518
00:28:18,138 --> 00:28:19,188
Really?

519
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:20,608
That's such a relief.

520
00:28:21,008 --> 00:28:23,258
Thank you. Thank you so much!

521
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,058
Miss Choi In-ha.

522
00:28:27,528 --> 00:28:28,398
Please come in.

523
00:28:28,968 --> 00:28:29,828
Yes, Sir.

524
00:28:36,368 --> 00:28:37,798
She's a real threat, too.

525
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,098
Have a seat in the middle.

526
00:28:52,908 --> 00:28:53,968
Hello.

527
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:56,058
I'm number 424,
and my name is Choi In-ha.

528
00:28:56,338 --> 00:28:57,418
Have a seat.

529
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:00,938
Yes. She told me to sit down.

530
00:29:01,268 --> 00:29:02,638
She told me to sit down!

531
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,058
That I may be too nervous.

532
00:29:08,668 --> 00:29:12,638
Your file states that you have
the Pinocchio syndrome.

533
00:29:12,728 --> 00:29:13,738
Is that correct?

534
00:29:13,838 --> 00:29:14,628
Yes.

535
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:17,018
Are you aware that

536
00:29:17,108 --> 00:29:20,398
not a single registered reporter
in our country has that syndrome?

537
00:29:20,488 --> 00:29:21,798
Why do you think that is?

538
00:29:22,058 --> 00:29:23,128
To be honest,

539
00:29:23,318 --> 00:29:24,628
I'm not sure why that is.

540
00:29:24,748 --> 00:29:25,788
Why don't you know that?

541
00:29:25,878 --> 00:29:27,208
Because if you can't lie,

542
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,263
it could be deemed as a weakness
for a reporter.

543
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:30,193
No.

544
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:32,363
I actually believe that
it's a positive merit.

545
00:29:32,653 --> 00:29:34,939
Isn't a reporter supposed
to relay the truth?

546
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:38,139
I think any news made and reported
by a reporter who can't lie

547
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:40,806
can only build up
the trust with the viewers.

548
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:41,696
No.

549
00:29:41,786 --> 00:29:43,766
-I firmly believe that.
-A reporter who can't lie

550
00:29:43,856 --> 00:29:45,656
and will only tell the truth?

551
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:47,966
You really are a rookie.

552
00:29:48,556 --> 00:29:50,746
Did I use to be that naive
when I first started out?

553
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:53,095
Yeah, you two are a lot alike.

554
00:29:55,046 --> 00:29:56,046
He said we're alike.

555
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:57,806
He said I take after my mom!

556
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,696
Let's do a simple test.

557
00:29:59,986 --> 00:30:02,166
If you can pass this test
without hiccuping,

558
00:30:02,546 --> 00:30:04,786
I'll admit you have what it takes
to be a reporter.

559
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:05,846
You think you can do it?

560
00:30:06,716 --> 00:30:07,646
Yes.

561
00:30:09,326 --> 00:30:10,666
Here.

562
00:30:11,156 --> 00:30:13,036
These are two restaurant business cards.

563
00:30:13,326 --> 00:30:14,435
Will choose one?

564
00:30:29,676 --> 00:30:31,476
We received a report that

565
00:30:31,566 --> 00:30:34,086
both restaurants allow their customers
to smoke illegally.

566
00:30:34,226 --> 00:30:38,186
We're planning to record a call
with the owner and make a report.

567
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:42,036
Would you like for me to demonstrate?

568
00:30:44,206 --> 00:30:45,046
Yes.

569
00:30:54,406 --> 00:30:55,246
Hello?

570
00:30:55,346 --> 00:30:57,606
Hello, I'm calling from
Go-sung Stock Company

571
00:30:57,796 --> 00:31:00,374
to see if I can make a dinner reservation
for tomorrow at 7?

572
00:31:00,464 --> 00:31:02,084
-For how many people?
-For four people.

573
00:31:02,384 --> 00:31:03,284
But...

574
00:31:03,514 --> 00:31:05,094
...they're all smokers.

575
00:31:05,294 --> 00:31:06,364
Is it okay if they smoke?

576
00:31:06,454 --> 00:31:08,121
Yes, it's fine as long as they smoke
in their room.

577
00:31:08,624 --> 00:31:10,204
We have guests smoking in the room too.

578
00:31:10,294 --> 00:31:11,874
Okay, please make the reservation.

579
00:31:13,544 --> 00:31:15,144
What do you think? Simple, wasn't it?

580
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:17,834
It's your turn to give it a try.

581
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:20,869
Without hiccuping.

582
00:31:30,904 --> 00:31:32,684
Given her inability to lie,

583
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:35,234
isn't that a mission impossible?

584
00:31:35,324 --> 00:31:37,614
She's trying to make her fail
the interview.

585
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:40,480
That's vicious.
Maybe she's not her real mom.

586
00:31:47,814 --> 00:31:48,694
Hello?

587
00:31:50,254 --> 00:31:51,769
I have a question to ask you.

588
00:31:54,144 --> 00:31:55,024
By any chance...

589
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:57,444
...do you allow smoking there?

590
00:31:57,534 --> 00:31:58,584
Why are you asking that?

591
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:00,934
Because...

592
00:32:06,364 --> 00:32:08,344
we got a report
and we're trying to verify it.

593
00:32:08,774 --> 00:32:09,714
Report?

594
00:32:10,204 --> 00:32:11,054
What a crazy...

595
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:17,380
You can't even handle
a simple interview like this.

596
00:32:18,964 --> 00:32:21,284
You think you can be a reporter,
Miss Choi In-ha?

597
00:32:22,764 --> 00:32:24,204
In order to make a news report,

598
00:32:24,304 --> 00:32:26,349
a reporter must be able to lie
during these interviews

599
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:28,439
depending on the circumstances.

600
00:32:28,744 --> 00:32:30,254
Because telling those lies...

601
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:33,303
will bring out the truth,
like oil on water.

602
00:32:35,094 --> 00:32:35,984
This is the reason...

603
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,451
why a Pinocchio cannot become a reporter.

604
00:33:13,884 --> 00:33:15,604
-Please excuse me.
-Okay.

605
00:33:18,974 --> 00:33:20,854
What are you doing here
instead of going home?

606
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:26,887
Because there's something
I needed to check.

607
00:33:27,944 --> 00:33:28,904
May I please...

608
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:30,694
...see your cellphone?

609
00:33:30,854 --> 00:33:32,294
Why do you need to see my cellphone?

610
00:33:46,464 --> 00:33:48,234
Mom

611
00:33:54,094 --> 00:33:55,014
It wasn't.

612
00:33:57,874 --> 00:33:58,988
It wasn't the number.

613
00:34:00,394 --> 00:34:01,604
Dal-Po was right.

614
00:34:02,414 --> 00:34:03,294
Ms Song Cha-ok.

615
00:34:03,444 --> 00:34:04,534
Should we go first?

616
00:34:05,324 --> 00:34:07,014
No, I'm coming.

617
00:34:07,814 --> 00:34:09,564
-Goodbye, then.
-Mom.

618
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:17,904
I've...

619
00:34:19,914 --> 00:34:21,194
...really missed you.

620
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:34,714
I guess she is a mother after all.

621
00:34:35,104 --> 00:34:35,944
I guess she is.

622
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,534
I'm sorry.

623
00:34:44,444 --> 00:34:47,274
But I haven't had any time to miss you.

624
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:56,634
You've worked hard today.

625
00:35:00,114 --> 00:35:01,874
How about some tea before the meeting?

626
00:35:01,964 --> 00:35:03,184
Sounds good.

627
00:35:03,744 --> 00:35:05,044
I'll have it prepared.

628
00:35:14,424 --> 00:35:16,834
We're going with the vintage look

629
00:35:16,924 --> 00:35:19,444
and make a point
with a warm and cozy look.

630
00:35:20,214 --> 00:35:21,564
You...

631
00:35:21,804 --> 00:35:23,657
...are far worse than a thief.

632
00:35:40,184 --> 00:35:41,024
Mom

633
00:35:43,594 --> 00:35:44,789
Why did you do that?

634
00:35:47,674 --> 00:35:50,474
Was it that hard for you to tell me
that you weren't my mom?

635
00:35:51,704 --> 00:35:53,424
Why did you steal my texts?

636
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:55,624
I just made a fool of myself
because of you!

637
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:03,424
I've waited...

638
00:36:04,474 --> 00:36:06,544
and waited some more,
for the past 10 years.

639
00:36:08,944 --> 00:36:10,078
Why did you do that?

640
00:36:11,114 --> 00:36:14,574
Why did you steal my texts
and make me look like a pitiful fool!

641
00:36:26,444 --> 00:36:27,764
I'm sorry.

642
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:34,864
I'm so truly sorry.

643
00:36:39,004 --> 00:36:39,854
Truly...

644
00:37:41,284 --> 00:37:43,704
I'm with my mom right now,
so I can't answer the phone

645
00:37:55,034 --> 00:37:55,904
That fool.

646
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:06,144
What did your mother say?

647
00:38:18,574 --> 00:38:21,124
She said she can't believe
how pretty I've become.

648
00:38:22,304 --> 00:38:24,644
She said sorry she hasn't called.

649
00:38:24,904 --> 00:38:26,794
She hugged me and told me
that she's missed me.

650
00:38:37,284 --> 00:38:38,834
You're not lying, right?

651
00:38:48,144 --> 00:38:49,344
I'm telling the truth.

652
00:38:49,524 --> 00:38:51,114
Your dream was so right.

653
00:38:51,794 --> 00:38:55,224
I'm sure you'll get to see
the people from your dream

654
00:38:55,664 --> 00:38:56,504
like me.

655
00:38:59,854 --> 00:39:01,014
Want me to pick you up?

656
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:08,184
No, I can get home by myself

657
00:39:21,254 --> 00:39:22,124
Miss.

658
00:39:22,294 --> 00:39:23,634
Why are you crying like that?

659
00:39:24,034 --> 00:39:25,494
Are you not feeling well?

660
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:27,654
Because my hiccups...

661
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:32,664
Because I don't think
my hiccups will ever stop.

662
00:39:43,234 --> 00:39:44,134
It's okay.

663
00:39:44,324 --> 00:39:45,814
I'm sure she can take care of herself.

664
00:39:45,904 --> 00:39:46,904
Stop worrying.

665
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:49,774
I'll keep this picture.

666
00:39:50,404 --> 00:39:53,014
If your girlfriend were to see this,
she might get the wrong idea.

667
00:39:54,554 --> 00:39:55,984
You wouldn't want that, would you?

668
00:39:56,354 --> 00:39:57,774
That's right, I don't.

669
00:39:58,594 --> 00:40:00,314
There's a frequent accident zone ahead.

670
00:40:00,504 --> 00:40:01,564
Please drive safely.

671
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,734
The police plan to...

672
00:40:33,824 --> 00:40:37,674
...if that would be enough punishment for
the crime of dragging nine firefighters

673
00:40:37,774 --> 00:40:39,314
to death.

674
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:54,934
Go to Doyang-dong intersection, please.

675
00:41:06,814 --> 00:41:08,614
You're the one on MSC news, aren't you?

676
00:41:08,974 --> 00:41:10,904
I think I've seen you in news
from Washington.

677
00:41:10,994 --> 00:41:11,904
Yes, that's correct.

678
00:41:12,294 --> 00:41:13,494
Wow, this is cool.

679
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:15,539
Can I get your autograph
before you leave?

680
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:16,744
I don't give out autographs.

681
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:20,264
A friend of mine actually went in
for a final interview at MSC today.

682
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,074
Can you tell me how the result?

683
00:41:23,504 --> 00:41:24,384
Who was it?

684
00:41:25,034 --> 00:41:26,124
Her name is Choi In-ha.

685
00:41:26,744 --> 00:41:27,834
Do you remember her?

686
00:41:30,814 --> 00:41:32,384
I am afraid your friend didn’t make it.

687
00:41:36,684 --> 00:41:37,564
I knew it.

688
00:41:38,574 --> 00:41:40,104
May I ask why she didn't make it?

689
00:41:41,194 --> 00:41:43,034
Your friend has Pinocchio Syndrome.

690
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:45,574
Is that why she didn't make it?

691
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:47,454
Because she can't lie?

692
00:41:47,544 --> 00:41:50,574
You can get the details from her.
I'd prefer to drive in silence.

693
00:41:50,664 --> 00:41:52,414
It wasn't because she's your daughter?

694
00:41:55,354 --> 00:41:56,304
Who are you?

695
00:41:57,784 --> 00:41:58,874
I'm Choi In-ha's uncle.

696
00:42:00,754 --> 00:42:01,784
Stop the car.

697
00:42:57,924 --> 00:43:00,484
I don't remember In-ha having
an uncle, so who are you?

698
00:43:00,854 --> 00:43:01,884
My name is Choi Dal-Po.

699
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:04,934
Your ex father-in-law adopted me.

700
00:43:08,374 --> 00:43:09,834
You're coming at me like this

701
00:43:10,544 --> 00:43:12,134
because of that mere connection?

702
00:43:13,044 --> 00:43:15,534
It seems you want to put up
the pretense of being her uncle,

703
00:43:15,754 --> 00:43:17,194
then do it right.

704
00:43:17,284 --> 00:43:19,414
As an uncle, shouldn't you
have to stop her chasing

705
00:43:19,504 --> 00:43:20,704
a pointless dream?

706
00:43:20,794 --> 00:43:23,214
Is it a pointless dream
for a person who can't lie

707
00:43:23,554 --> 00:43:24,444
to be a reporter?

708
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:27,694
There's not a single reporter in this
country who has Pinocchio syndrome.

709
00:43:34,754 --> 00:43:36,404
I'm asking you a reason...

710
00:43:36,724 --> 00:43:38,834
-not statistics.
-Statistics are the reason.

711
00:43:39,024 --> 00:43:41,719
Don't you think there's an understandable
reason why not a single reporter

712
00:43:42,554 --> 00:43:43,495
has Pinocchio syndrome?

713
00:43:49,914 --> 00:43:50,964
Who are you texting?

714
00:43:52,594 --> 00:43:55,404
Someone left me a number earlier
for scratching up the truck.

715
00:43:55,934 --> 00:43:57,144
He offered reimbursement,

716
00:43:57,244 --> 00:43:58,644
but I'll tell there's no need.

717
00:43:59,024 --> 00:44:01,644
What? Why would you let go
of free money like that?

718
00:44:01,734 --> 00:44:03,984
Take this opportunity
and totally fix up your truck.

719
00:44:04,244 --> 00:44:06,454
Give it to me.
I'll get you the reimbursement.

720
00:44:07,614 --> 00:44:09,274
This kid.

721
00:44:09,594 --> 00:44:11,144
No, it's okay.

722
00:44:11,234 --> 00:44:12,879
It's just a small scratch on the bumper.

723
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:16,254
You kid!

724
00:44:35,664 --> 00:44:36,984
I'm 7954 truck owner.

725
00:44:37,134 --> 00:44:38,554
I apologize for the late response.

726
00:44:38,734 --> 00:44:40,924
There's no need to worry about the bumper.

727
00:44:47,024 --> 00:44:48,174
I saw...

728
00:44:49,414 --> 00:44:51,124
a picture of your family in your truck.

729
00:44:52,364 --> 00:44:53,614
I saw that aside your father,

730
00:44:53,894 --> 00:44:55,544
you had a mother, and a little brother.

731
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:57,694
Why have you never mentioned them?

732
00:44:59,604 --> 00:45:01,334
They’re both dead.

733
00:45:04,274 --> 00:45:05,364
I see.

734
00:45:06,054 --> 00:45:08,054
Still no word on your father?

735
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:10,424
No.

736
00:45:12,364 --> 00:45:15,514
Just to be sure, I even drove all
over the country searching for him...

737
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,054
but I couldn't find him.

738
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:20,414
I searched everywhere.

739
00:45:20,924 --> 00:45:25,686
If you asked me to draw a map of Korea,
I'd be able to draw every nook and cranny.

740
00:45:28,114 --> 00:45:28,964
Hey.

741
00:45:29,214 --> 00:45:30,664
No news means good news.

742
00:45:30,974 --> 00:45:31,814
Cheers.

743
00:45:31,905 --> 00:45:33,349
I'm sure that your father
is safe somewhere.

744
00:45:37,694 --> 00:45:40,464
Didn't you say that you're assigned
the demolition of the factory?

745
00:45:40,554 --> 00:45:41,424
Yeah...

746
00:45:41,874 --> 00:45:43,784
It's quite a large scale.

747
00:45:44,204 --> 00:45:45,864
So, I think they're
going to blow it down.

748
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:48,254
-Why? Are you interested?
-Yes.

749
00:45:48,724 --> 00:45:50,975
If they're looking for more people,
can you get me in?

750
00:45:51,514 --> 00:45:52,364
Sure, I can do that.

751
00:45:53,044 --> 00:45:54,034
Thank you.

752
00:45:54,784 --> 00:45:56,401
Are you trying to rip me out of my money?

753
00:45:57,224 --> 00:46:00,504
You need to give me a kind of IOU.

754
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:01,564
That’s what I am saying.

755
00:46:01,654 --> 00:46:03,064
You have no sense of honor.

756
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:08,594
Sense of honor?

757
00:46:09,014 --> 00:46:10,044
Are you kidding me?

758
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:10,984
Hey!

759
00:46:11,124 --> 00:46:13,124
You guys have no right
to treat me this way.

760
00:46:13,724 --> 00:46:15,124
That time when the accident...

761
00:46:15,484 --> 00:46:17,654
I lied to keep the truth
about the two of you

762
00:46:17,974 --> 00:46:20,234
-starting that fire at the factory.
-Oh, please!

763
00:46:20,514 --> 00:46:21,574
You bring that up again?

764
00:46:21,954 --> 00:46:23,214
Can't you give it a rest?

765
00:46:23,754 --> 00:46:24,994
It has been 10 years ago.

766
00:46:25,084 --> 00:46:26,594
Why?

767
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:28,104
Let's talk this out.

768
00:46:28,424 --> 00:46:29,674
Let's get the story straight.

769
00:46:29,864 --> 00:46:32,124
Yes, we did start the fire.

770
00:46:32,294 --> 00:46:35,734
But you're the reason
why all those firemen died!

771
00:46:35,984 --> 00:46:38,504
You told the firemen that we were still
in the night duty room

772
00:46:38,594 --> 00:46:41,014
and that's why the Chief went
into that burning building!

773
00:46:41,104 --> 00:46:44,037
You always speak so recklessly
whenever you get some liquor in you!

774
00:46:45,214 --> 00:46:46,414
No, that's not true.

775
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:49,364
You're the one with the careless mouth.

776
00:46:49,464 --> 00:46:52,162
That's why the Chief
got all those blames!

777
00:46:54,544 --> 00:46:55,544
Hey!

778
00:46:58,204 --> 00:47:00,574
Oh, no! We need to quickly get you
to the hospital.

779
00:47:01,304 --> 00:47:02,766
Hyungnim, what are you waiting for?

780
00:47:03,474 --> 00:47:04,794
Oh, yes. Sorry.

781
00:47:07,584 --> 00:47:09,104
-Where are you going?
-Wait.

782
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:11,510
-I need to check on something.
-What is it? Do you know those guys?

783
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:14,414
Hey!

784
00:47:24,844 --> 00:47:26,284
It was a lie?

785
00:47:29,424 --> 00:47:30,804
It's a lie...

786
00:47:48,554 --> 00:47:50,354
Thank you. If there's any problem,

787
00:47:50,444 --> 00:47:52,124
feel free to contact me at any time.

788
00:47:52,214 --> 00:47:53,394
My name is Choi Dal-Po.

789
00:47:55,614 --> 00:47:57,274
Father, I'm home.

790
00:47:58,034 --> 00:47:58,874
Oh...

791
00:47:59,034 --> 00:47:59,884
Dal-Po.

792
00:48:00,274 --> 00:48:04,284
When did you last speak to In-ha today?

793
00:48:05,204 --> 00:48:06,884
Around 5:00? Why do you ask?

794
00:48:06,974 --> 00:48:09,044
Oh, no. That little sassy!

795
00:48:09,574 --> 00:48:12,324
I think she ran away from home.

796
00:48:12,494 --> 00:48:16,224
All her books are gone from her room.

797
00:48:16,354 --> 00:48:18,874
She's not answering her phone either.

798
00:48:19,334 --> 00:48:20,234
What? Wait a sec.

799
00:48:20,324 --> 00:48:22,454
Oh, no. What should I do?

800
00:48:24,424 --> 00:48:25,904
Oh, God.

801
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:27,144
Dal-Po.

802
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:33,054
Dal-pyung is looking for her hours ago,
but I don't think he found her yet.

803
00:48:33,474 --> 00:48:35,474
What are we going to do?

804
00:48:38,554 --> 00:48:42,284
I can't believe In-ha ran away
from home at her age.

805
00:48:43,314 --> 00:48:44,314
In-ha!

806
00:48:45,624 --> 00:48:46,624
Choi In-ha!

807
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,394
Ha-myung.

808
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:03,204
Do you want to go see
the fireworks with me?

809
00:49:26,794 --> 00:49:27,704
No way.

810
00:49:28,294 --> 00:49:29,264
In-ha!

811
00:49:29,434 --> 00:49:30,294
In-ha!

812
00:49:30,994 --> 00:49:31,984
Choi In-ha!

813
00:49:48,574 --> 00:49:49,754
She can't be...

814
00:49:50,534 --> 00:49:51,394
Please.

815
00:50:41,844 --> 00:50:42,784
Goodbye.

816
00:50:43,734 --> 00:50:44,754
My dream...

817
00:50:46,854 --> 00:50:47,894
My everything...

818
00:50:55,674 --> 00:50:56,904
In-ha.

819
00:51:16,414 --> 00:51:17,804
This really is too much.

820
00:51:18,264 --> 00:51:20,264
How can not a single thing goes...

821
00:51:20,554 --> 00:51:21,844
right.

822
00:51:24,674 --> 00:51:26,054
In-ha. Choi In-ha!

823
00:51:26,854 --> 00:51:28,094
You're out there, aren't you?

824
00:51:31,314 --> 00:51:32,284
Choi In-ha!

825
00:51:34,804 --> 00:51:35,864
Hurry up and open the door!

826
00:51:35,954 --> 00:51:38,154
You don’t think of killing yourself,
right? Choi In-ha!

827
00:51:38,574 --> 00:51:39,404
What do I do?

828
00:51:39,494 --> 00:51:40,434
What do I do?

829
00:51:44,174 --> 00:51:45,234
Choi In-ha.

830
00:51:45,854 --> 00:51:46,934
In-ha.

831
00:51:59,814 --> 00:52:00,654
In-ha.

832
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:01,584
Choi In-ha!

833
00:52:02,814 --> 00:52:03,654
In-ha.

834
00:52:06,144 --> 00:52:06,984
In-ha.

835
00:52:07,134 --> 00:52:07,974
Choi In-ha!

836
00:52:09,964 --> 00:52:10,804
In-ha.

837
00:52:17,604 --> 00:52:18,444
In-ha!

838
00:52:19,064 --> 00:52:19,994
What's wrong with him?

839
00:52:20,374 --> 00:52:21,654
Why did he overreact like that?

840
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:22,614
In-ha.

841
00:52:26,614 --> 00:52:27,614
Did he see me?

842
00:52:37,214 --> 00:52:38,904
Don't come. Don't come!

843
00:52:44,204 --> 00:52:45,294
What a relief!

844
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:55,244
In-ha, I can see you over there.

845
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:57,894
He did see me!

846
00:52:59,794 --> 00:53:00,714
I know everything.

847
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:02,984
I know you failed your interview.

848
00:53:03,364 --> 00:53:06,224
I also know that your mother wasn't
the person you thought she was.

849
00:53:10,284 --> 00:53:12,754
If you know all that,
then can't you just ignore it?

850
00:53:13,124 --> 00:53:14,004
There are times...

851
00:53:16,114 --> 00:53:19,214
...when I want to lie and pretend
that everything's okay like others do.

852
00:53:19,704 --> 00:53:20,794
But I can't...

853
00:53:22,314 --> 00:53:23,574
That's why I'm here.

854
00:53:24,914 --> 00:53:26,984
You don't need to pretend
that everything's okay.

855
00:53:27,074 --> 00:53:28,564
Because I know how upset you are.

856
00:53:35,204 --> 00:53:36,134
In front of me...

857
00:53:48,084 --> 00:53:49,054
Why are you...

858
00:53:49,804 --> 00:53:51,374
so insensitive?

859
00:53:52,344 --> 00:53:54,914
Can't you just leave me alone
at a time like this?

860
00:54:07,204 --> 00:54:08,144
I'm sorry.

861
00:54:10,324 --> 00:54:12,324
I guess my dream wasn't
a good dream after all.

862
00:54:32,674 --> 00:54:35,334
I just graduated from college.
I've moved to Seoul.

863
00:54:35,424 --> 00:54:38,104
I didn't make
my first TV station interview.

864
00:54:38,194 --> 00:54:39,794
I failed again.

865
00:54:40,114 --> 00:54:42,364
It was my 33rd. Mom...

866
00:54:42,854 --> 00:54:44,854
You know that
it's my birthday soon, right?

867
00:54:45,534 --> 00:54:47,224
I'm not asking for any present.

868
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:49,314
I just want to be able to see you.

869
00:54:49,904 --> 00:54:51,784
If that's not possible, then a phone call?

870
00:54:51,994 --> 00:54:53,394
Or even a just text message?

871
00:54:58,714 --> 00:55:00,074
You're home a little late, son.

872
00:55:00,394 --> 00:55:02,244
-Did you just get done with work?
-Mother.

873
00:55:02,544 --> 00:55:03,824
I want to meet her.

874
00:55:03,914 --> 00:55:07,214
Wow, look at my son's broad shoulders.

875
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:08,454
Who do you want to meet?

876
00:55:10,014 --> 00:55:11,184
Are you talking about...

877
00:55:11,304 --> 00:55:12,194
the Pinocchio girl?

878
00:55:18,984 --> 00:55:20,944
Leave it. I'm going to burn them all.

879
00:55:21,164 --> 00:55:22,654
You decided to give up on everything?

880
00:55:22,744 --> 00:55:23,744
Your mom, and reporter.

881
00:55:24,504 --> 00:55:25,354
Yeah.

882
00:55:26,764 --> 00:55:28,744
Why do you keep trying to lie
when you know you can't?

883
00:55:29,654 --> 00:55:30,694
Then what else am I do to?

884
00:55:30,784 --> 00:55:32,214
I made a promise to my dad.

885
00:55:32,614 --> 00:55:35,709
I can't waste the rest of my 20s
as an unemployed bum. I can't...

886
00:55:39,064 --> 00:55:41,064
I'm too ashamed to face you.

887
00:55:42,394 --> 00:55:43,264
What?

888
00:55:45,374 --> 00:55:47,504
Do you think I'm stupid? An idiot?

889
00:55:48,084 --> 00:55:50,574
I know you obviously gave up
on going to college because of me.

890
00:55:50,664 --> 00:55:54,104
Do you think it's comfortable for me
to live off the money you earn? I...

891
00:55:54,744 --> 00:55:57,304
I have a sense of conscience, too.

892
00:55:58,124 --> 00:55:58,904
So throw these all.

893
00:55:58,994 --> 00:56:01,304
I feel much better knowing
that this is over.

894
00:56:01,784 --> 00:56:02,644
You're lying.

895
00:56:05,324 --> 00:56:06,174
Fine.

896
00:56:06,504 --> 00:56:07,484
That was a lie.

897
00:56:07,824 --> 00:56:09,374
It's a lie, but what can I do about it?

898
00:56:09,464 --> 00:56:10,564
I don't need all these!

899
00:56:12,164 --> 00:56:13,614
Statistics are the reason.

900
00:56:14,154 --> 00:56:17,214
Don't you think there's an understandable
reason why not a single reporter

901
00:56:17,464 --> 00:56:18,474
has Pinocchio syndrome?

902
00:56:18,564 --> 00:56:20,024
That's a stereotype and a prejudice.

903
00:56:20,114 --> 00:56:21,274
No, it's common sense.

904
00:56:21,364 --> 00:56:22,604
According to your common sense,

905
00:56:22,694 --> 00:56:25,204
someone who can’t lie can't be a reporter?

906
00:56:29,394 --> 00:56:31,914
Let go of me. I don't need all these.

907
00:56:34,614 --> 00:56:35,694
Yes, that can never happen.

908
00:56:36,474 --> 00:56:39,274
How can you say 'never' so easily?

909
00:56:39,634 --> 00:56:41,704
How can you so easily judge
someone else's life?

910
00:56:41,794 --> 00:56:44,394
How many lives have you ruined
with that common sense of yours?

911
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,539
Especially as a reporter!

912
00:56:45,629 --> 00:56:47,629
It seems you want to criticize me.

913
00:56:50,609 --> 00:56:51,859
What a joke.

914
00:56:52,299 --> 00:56:54,449
A wolf does not bark at a tiger.

915
00:56:54,849 --> 00:56:56,979
Only foolish and ignorant
mutts would do that.

916
00:56:57,639 --> 00:56:59,399
There's nothing more foolish and feeble

917
00:56:59,659 --> 00:57:01,167
than carelessly barking up the wrong tree.

918
00:57:01,799 --> 00:57:05,109
Do you even know what reporter is...

919
00:57:06,899 --> 00:57:08,489
as you bark at me?

920
00:57:09,289 --> 00:57:10,169
I need it.

921
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:12,009
What?

922
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:12,959
These books...

923
00:57:13,469 --> 00:57:14,509
I need it.

924
00:57:16,089 --> 00:57:16,949
You're right.

925
00:57:17,449 --> 00:57:18,819
I don't know what reporter is.

926
00:57:19,249 --> 00:57:20,319
I'm sorry for ignorantly

927
00:57:20,489 --> 00:57:21,349
argued with you.

928
00:57:21,889 --> 00:57:22,929
I was out of my place.

929
00:57:23,019 --> 00:57:24,289
As long as you understand it.

930
00:57:27,249 --> 00:57:28,849
Why do you need these books?

931
00:57:29,859 --> 00:57:31,149
You're going to sell them?

932
00:57:37,689 --> 00:57:38,589
No.

933
00:57:39,799 --> 00:57:41,359
I suddenly want to become a reporter.

934
00:57:42,219 --> 00:57:43,069
Just like you.

935
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:44,839
What?

936
00:57:45,019 --> 00:57:45,979
That's why...

937
00:57:52,029 --> 00:57:53,079
I'm going to find out.

938
00:57:53,479 --> 00:57:55,109
I'll come visit you again.

939
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,989
Once I find out what
a true reporter is...

940
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,229
Once I become a wolf,
and not just a street mutt...

941
00:58:02,669 --> 00:58:03,539
I'll come...

942
00:58:04,659 --> 00:58:05,829
and bark at you for real.

943
00:58:10,049 --> 00:58:11,319
Let's be a reporter together...

944
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:12,519
...In-ha.

945
00:58:14,329 --> 00:58:16,149
You want to meet her after 13 years?

946
00:58:16,729 --> 00:58:17,579
Yes.

947
00:58:17,879 --> 00:58:20,299
If my son says he wants to meet her,
then he should.

948
00:58:20,389 --> 00:58:21,309
What can I do?

949
00:58:21,569 --> 00:58:23,232
Do you want me to find her
and bring her to you?

950
00:58:24,669 --> 00:58:25,579
No.

951
00:58:26,189 --> 00:58:28,189
I'm going to go see her myself.

952
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:37,829
It stops.

953
00:58:38,399 --> 00:58:39,239
Your hiccups.

954
00:59:08,869 --> 00:59:10,209
What do we do about grandfather?

955
00:59:10,299 --> 00:59:11,539
No need to worry about that.

956
00:59:11,629 --> 00:59:14,299
I want the color to be ash brown.

957
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:15,229
Father.

958
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:16,099
Are you okay?

959
00:59:16,189 --> 00:59:18,329
That's not a bad looking face to brag.
Incredible!

960
00:59:18,449 --> 00:59:20,359
Your clothes are incredible.

961
00:59:20,449 --> 00:59:22,899
A final round
of YGN news reporter interviews...

962
00:59:22,989 --> 00:59:26,372
-Do we need to advertising in news?
-A PR that can turn this upside down...

963
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,532
-Not the looks...
-I'm not going to report this.

964
00:59:28,622 --> 00:59:30,702
At least one of us pass.
Whether it is you or me...

965
00:59:30,792 --> 00:59:32,062
Whether it is you or me? Hey!

966
00:59:34,062 --> 00:59:35,129
I don't agree with you.

967
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:38,220
It's worthless, unless we both pass.
