1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,980
Pinocchio

2
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,360
Why did you...

3
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,290
come to my house?

4
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,510
Why did you...

5
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,480
peek into my car?

6
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,000
I was covering a story and
saw your truck by chance.

7
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,220
So I was glad to see...

8
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,134
Don't ever call me "hyung" anymore
and don’t even come near me!

9
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:03,270
Reporters...

10
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,330
are all horrifying...

11
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,000
and disgusting.

12
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,280
No left-turn signal

13
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,030
Weren't you heading to the station?

14
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,990
I came back because I
have something to ask.

15
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,140
What is it?

16
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:48,890
If...

17
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:51,060
What if...

18
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,800
you had a family member that
you've parted for a long time.

19
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,180
And you just met him again.

20
00:01:58,101 --> 00:02:00,086
But if that person isn't
whom you thought he'd be...

21
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,550
What would you do, then?

22
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,430
Not whom you thought he'd be?

23
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,690
What do you mean by that?

24
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,480
For example...

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,140
what if he had harmed someone?

26
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,330
Are you sure that...

27
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,890
he harmed someone?

28
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,060
No.

29
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,730
What if it's just a hunch?

30
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,590
A hunch...

31
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,640
that no one, but you have.

32
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,410
If it were me...

33
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,600
there's only one answer.

34
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,050
I'd investigate it.

35
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,380
I wouldn't go by a hunch, but look
for decisive evidence, instead.

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,840
Whether by directly asking that family
member, or ask people around him...

37
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,520
I'd find out the truth.

38
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,880
I'd worry...

39
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,790
after I found out the truth.

40
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,810
Is there an accident?

41
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,270
-Seonbae!
-I'm shooting it.

42
00:03:20,446 --> 00:03:21,360
Watch out!

43
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,930
-No!
-No!

44
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,860
Hurry take him out.

45
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,690
Get out. Grab on!

46
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,180
A head-on collision at Ewha intersection.

47
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,360
I repeat, a head-on collision
at Ewha intersection.

48
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:29,970
Ha-myung...

49
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,390
Are you okay, Ha-myung?

50
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,870
Are you hurt?

51
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,360
No.

52
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,670
I'm fine.

53
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,880
That's a relief, Ha-myung.

54
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,650
I'm glad you're okay.

55
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,840
Mister!

56
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,370
Mister!

57
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,970
Wake up.

58
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,310
Mister!

59
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,120
Mister!

60
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,100
No!

61
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,700
We've got...

62
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,950
the exclusive on this, right?

63
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,500
Yeah.

64
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,320
I think so.

65
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,520
That at man is...

66
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,530
Episode 9 -The Pied Piper

67
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,470
Did you get it all?

68
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,650
How detailed?

69
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,200
Are you sure?

70
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,580
What about the boy interview?

71
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,190
We've got the only exclusive, right?

72
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,540
Captain, it's me.

73
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,730
In-ha and Bum-Jo got a great exclusive.

74
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,430
Tell Choi In-ha to follow the
delivery man, and cover him.

75
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,030
It's better if she gets the interview.

76
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,920
Tell Seo Bum-Jo to report the news.

77
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,640
You're sure that we've got it exclusive?

78
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,460
Is our news van at the
National Assembly now?

79
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,340
Tell them to get to the crime scene
immediately!

80
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,880
Why is it Bum-Jo who reports
the news, and not me?

81
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,860
Yes.

82
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:37,750
Yes, I understand.

83
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,710
Yes.

84
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,590
Let's make this our top news.

85
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,820
-No way.
-That doesn’t make sense.

86
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,550
It's too light of a story
to make it our top story.

87
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,880
No one died,

88
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,410
and there was only one injured.

89
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,030
It depends on how we treat the story.

90
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,980
A water delivery man put his life
on the line to save a little boy.

91
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,090
This story fits more for our top slot than
the ski resorts being popular on weekend.

92
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,030
It's a touching story that the viewers
like, and we have the footage.

93
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,440
Moreover, it's an exclusive.

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,840
Don't you think...

95
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,920
it's enough to raise our ratings?

96
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,990
-We need to give it soon.
-Is it coming out?

97
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,400
As soon as possible, okay?

98
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,100
That's a little fast.

99
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,990
Are they really making this the top news?

100
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,160
We don't have much time.

101
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,630
We've worked with less.

102
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,200
I've checked the manuscript,

103
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,020
-so send it out to Seo Bum-Jo.
-Yes.

104
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,160
Seo Bum-Jo, I've sent you the script.
So, give a report with that.

105
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,860
Traffic Survey Office

106
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,460
Where have you been?

107
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,330
See?

108
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,120
A woman wouldn't be able to yawn with mouth
opened in front of a man she likes.

109
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,620
Which means, you are not
deemed as a man in my eyes.

110
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,480
Of course.

111
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,490
-What's that?
-It's a case.

112
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:04,530
Let's check it out.

113
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,150
The truck flipped over...

114
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,480
Which one is the assault vehicle?

115
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,550
-The assault vehicle?
-Yes.

116
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,650
This car crash into that one...

117
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,390
to protect the boy...

118
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,170
Excuse me.

119
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,400
What happened to the
driver of this truck?

120
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,600
I don't know.

121
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,500
He was taken away in an ambulance.

122
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,270
He seemed to be hurt pretty bad.

123
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,650
Which hospital was he taken to?

124
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,870
We have no idea.

125
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,500
Choi Dal-Po! Where are you going?

126
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,290
Bumper

127
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,580
How's his current condition?

128
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,030
His left arm seems to be fractured.

129
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,170
But we need to verify
this at the hospital.

130
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,590
Ha-myung...

131
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,850
Is Ha-myung safe?

132
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,700
-Is he hurt?
-No, he's fine.

133
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,480
He's fine, so you don't need to worry.

134
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
That's a relief.

135
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,750
That's a relief.

136
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,370
Who's Ha-myung?

137
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,980
Yes, he ran away when he heard that
his license was going to get revoked.

138
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,680
Yes, no reported deaths,
and one man was injured.

139
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,930
Any CCTVs or black box footage?

140
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,250
Hey!

141
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,400
You should've looked for
it if you don't have it.

142
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,170
What does the injured do for a living?

143
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,300
The criterions we have for our
top news is the importance...

144
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,270
Water deliveryman?

145
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,850
He saved a middle school boy?

146
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,820
But now, we temporarily put
aside our usual criterion...

147
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,200
to bring you another
look of our top news.

148
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,190
Today’s criterion is about
sacrifice and emotions.

149
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,600
A young man...

150
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,070
put his own life on the line to save a
middle school student who is in danger.

151
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,970
-What's that?
-Our MSC news crew...

152
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,430
captured a vivid image of
that very touching moment.

153
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,240
Reporter Seo Bum-Jo will bring
you the exclusive news.

154
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,150
Seo Bum-Jo?

155
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,890
Which Seo Bum-Jo?

156
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,280
My son, Seo Bum-Jo?

157
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,110
A cargo truck races down the road in
an attempt to flee from the police.

158
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,060
The truck crosses the median and drives
the wrong way up to the intersection.

159
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,350
This is the frightening moment...

160
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,550
-My son, Bum-Jo!
-...when the truck...

161
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,200
was about to hit the boy after he
ran away from the alcohol test.

162
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,200
Another truck from the opposing lane
collided in to block the truck...

163
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,970
to save the boy.

164
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,790
The boy that was nearly lost his life
is saved without any injuries.

165
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,480
The driver who saved the boy
walked out of the truck...

166
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,820
to check on the boy,
whether he's injured,

167
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,300
then collapses on the spot.

168
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,500
Great image!

169
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,710
Even captured the emotion!

170
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,820
He asked if I was okay as soon
as he got out of the truck.

171
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,000
-How did they get that?
-As I said I'm okay...

172
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,660
They were out to shoot the icy roads...

173
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,640
and just hit the jackpot.

174
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,700
People say, lucky person would get wild
ginseng while they're digging up vegetables.

175
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,440
I guess they really hit the jackpot.

176
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,570
Emergency Medical Center

177
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,030
Have you had any recent car
accident victims come in?

178
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,300
His name is Ki Jae-myung,
a male in his 30s.

179
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,710
No, we haven't had any car
accident victims come in.

180
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,520
I see, thank you.

181
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,660
All pedestrians are walking with
caution in fear of a slip and fall.

182
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,340
The snow last night...

183
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,730
has become thin ice...

184
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,750
The truck driver who
drove the wrong way...

185
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,530
was in the state of inebriation
with an alcohol level of 0.107...

186
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,000
at the time of the crash.

187
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,450
This courageous citizen who save
the student at the risk of his own life...

188
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,100
is Mr Ki, a 30 year-old male.

189
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,350
-Mr Ki was rushed off to the hospital...
-Mr Ki, a 30 year-old male?

190
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,910
And it is reported that his
life is not in danger.

191
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:01,890
No way!

192
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,400
He is a hero who saves a
life with his brave deed,

193
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,790
even in a dangerous situation
that he could lose his own life.

194
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:10,930
Hyung.

195
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,890
This has been Seo Bum-Jo, from MSC News.

196
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,480
Yes, I understand.

197
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,140
Mr Lee just got here.

198
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,720
Yes, I'll call as soon as
the interview is over.

199
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,890
-Is the driver okay?
-Yes.

200
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,130
His left arm fractured, so he's
seeing an orthopedist now.

201
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,220
He's fine otherwise.

202
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,560
That's a relief.

203
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,960
How about the interview?

204
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,040
Mr Ki Jae-myung is stable now,

205
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,910
but we'll have to beg him to give us one.

206
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,250
Ki Jae-myung?

207
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,960
The driver's name is Ki Jae-myung?

208
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,960
Yes. It's a unique name, isn't it?

209
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,220
Excuse me, is Mr Ki Jae-myung
still being treated?

210
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,980
He just checked himself
out of the hospital.

211
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,570
Really? Are you sure?

212
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,750
Let's go.

213
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,300
Mr Ki Jae-myung, wait!

214
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,750
Yes, how can I help you?

215
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,040
I'm MSC News' Reporter Choi In-ha,
who was at the crime scene earlier.

216
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,650
May I please ask you for an interview?

217
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,790
Were you...

218
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,700
the one who's on the MSC
News' advertisement?

219
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,870
Yes, that's correct.

220
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,940
You have a good eyes.

221
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,890
They're mother and daughter.

222
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,400
Choi In-ha

223
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,330
Reporter Choi In-ha...

224
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,200
I would really love it
if you could give me an interview.

225
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,790
But if it's too much for you
right now, we can do it later.

226
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,710
Let's do it now.

227
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,140
Thank you.

228
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,600
Seonbae, let's get started.

229
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,430
Yeah, okay.

230
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,770
Emergency Room

231
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,980
Is there a car accident victim
by the name of Ki Jae-myung here?

232
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,150
Mr Ki Jae-myung?

233
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,150
Yes, he was here.

234
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,140
He just is done with the examinations.

235
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,990
How is he? Is he badly injured?

236
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,740
Other than a fractured arm, he's fine.

237
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,730
His CT and other examinations
didn't show any other injuries.

238
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,790
That's a relief.

239
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,780
Is he discharged yet?

240
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,930
I saw he's doing an interview
out there right now.

241
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,260
An interview?

242
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,810
Then, Ha-myung is the name
of your late little brother?

243
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,600
Yes.

244
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,860
That boy must've reminded me

245
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,780
of my little brother for a moment.

246
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,170
He's about the same age when he died.

247
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,690
You must hate the people
that slandered your father.

248
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,410
I'm a reporter myself,

249
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,400
but I feel so ashamed.

250
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,380
The reporters that framed
and destroyed my family back then...

251
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,233
are still working as reporters.

252
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,900
It must be distressful
whenever you watch the news.

253
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,550
Do you remember all of those reporters?

254
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,900
I remember faint bits and pieces of them.

255
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,040
But...

256
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,510
one of them was so evil,

257
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,640
that I remember every detail of her.

258
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,650
Her face...

259
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,600
her name...

260
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,210
and her voice.

261
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,690
Can you tell me who that was?

262
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,700
-That reporter is...
-Hey...

263
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,630
Choi In-ha!

264
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,160
Huh? Dal-Po.

265
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,980
Please keep this interview
confidential with MSC News only.

266
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,470
Please don't give an interview
to other reporters, okay?

267
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,960
Sure, I can do that.

268
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,900
Come with me!

269
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,930
Sorry, but it's over.

270
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,530
Seonbae, let's wrap it up.

271
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,940
Don't tell this person anything.

272
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,740
I'll be in touch again soon.

273
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,960
I said, come with me!

274
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,230
Dal-Po...

275
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,470
I'm sorry, but it's urgent.

276
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,810
Dal-Po.

277
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,910
Choi Dal-Po.

278
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Hey, what's wrong with you?

279
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,820
Are you trying to ruin my exclusive news?

280
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,440
Don't get in touch with that man.

281
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,070
That man is very dangerous.
He extremely hates reporters.

282
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,340
I know.

283
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,374
I heard the story, and he has
the reason to hate them.

284
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,570
Do you remember the story of...

285
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,201
the fireman who's skeletal remains
found during our interview at YGN?

286
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,280
He said he's the son of that fireman.

287
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,921
Of course he'd hate reporters.

288
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,650
I'd really hate them too if I were him.

289
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,410
That's why he's dangerous to you...

290
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,040
I mean, you don't know
what he'd do to reporters, so...

291
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,220
That man put his life on the
line to save the life of another.

292
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,977
A man like that would never harm anyone.

293
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,600
I know.

294
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,114
I know that man...

295
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,400
and he's dangerous.

296
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,991
So have someone else do his
interviews, and you stay out of it.

297
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,510
Why only me to stay out of it?

298
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,900
Am I the only one in danger?

299
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,070
Don't tell me to just stay out of it, and
explain it to me so that I can understand.

300
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,050
Can't I... just be that reason?

301
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,890
Because it's me...

302
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,530
Because it's my word...

303
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,710
Because you know that I care
for you more than anyone else.

304
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,200
Can't you just trust me?

305
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,420
Dal-Po...

306
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,720
Please.

307
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,890
Please don't get involved with that man.

308
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,170
Don't ask me for reasons. Just please...

309
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,210
Please just do this for me, okay?

310
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,430
You...

311
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,940
You know something that
I don't, don't you?

312
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,750
Yeah.

313
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,390
You won't tell me even
if I ask, will you?

314
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,900
I can't.

315
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,900
It's for my own sake, isn't it?

316
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,980
Yeah.

317
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,440
Okay.

318
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,060
I'll do as you say.

319
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,140
I have so many things to ask
right now, but I won't.

320
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,390
I can't do anything about the
interview I just had from airing,

321
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,720
but I won't do any more of it.

322
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,340
Because I trust you
more than I trust him.

323
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,710
You're being serious, right?

324
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,790
I'm serious.

325
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,890
See? I'm not hiccuping.

326
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,804
You know that as a Pinocchio,

327
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:27,805
I can only make promises that I can keep.

328
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,180
So you can trust me.

329
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,460
I will never do anything
that'll cause you to worry.

330
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,330
Thanks.

331
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:07,598
You did a really great thing today.

332
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,390
Thank you for the interview.

333
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,650
Sure.

334
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,530
It's been a long time.

335
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,530
Yes.

336
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,290
We met in front of the TV
station recently, didn't we?

337
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,400
I wasn't sure at first...

338
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,870
but it was you.

339
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,410
We met long before last week.

340
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,730
I believe you were behind the camera
of an interview I did 13 years ago.

341
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,530
Don't you remember?

342
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,320
Mr Lee Joo-ho?

343
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm not sure.

344
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,790
I don't really remember...

345
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,900
I remember you very clearly.

346
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,490
You were with Reporter Song Cha-ok
at that time, right?

347
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,270
Choi In-ha, was her name?

348
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,030
The woman that just interviewed me...

349
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,260
is her daughter, isn't she?

350
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,180
How interesting.

351
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,400
I can't believe...

352
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,290
I met Reporter Song's daughter
through this accident.

353
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,040
I find it very interesting...

354
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,615
and grateful.

355
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,380
By the way, you’re not doing this...

356
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,990
to steal my exclusive news, are you?

357
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,092
-Hey!
-I mean, if that's the case...

358
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,180
No, it's not like that.

359
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,200
It's alright, then.

360
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,430
Let's go back inside.
My senior must be waiting.

361
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,670
Okay.

362
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,154
One more thing, Dal-Po.

363
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,710
Once we go back home
after the training period is over,

364
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,910
my dad will find out about us.

365
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,220
I know.

366
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,890
It's possible that my dad
may act mean toward you.

367
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,790
I know.

368
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,100
Even if he does, don't give up on us.

369
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,680
I'll talk to my dad...

370
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,170
I'd never do that.

371
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,590
Seo Bum-Jo!

372
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,160
I saw your report.

373
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,200
You were great.

374
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,700
I'm sorry.

375
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,190
-It should've been you.
-Of course you should be sorry.

376
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,710
I almost cursed on you,
but I hold it since it's you.

377
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,070
Congratulations!

378
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,060
Okay.

379
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,000
You did a real great job today,
Seo Bum-Jo.

380
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,940
Let's go!

381
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,170
I heard you two were behind
the exclusive tonight?

382
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,100
-Yes.
-Yes.

383
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,840
Good job.

384
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,210
What?

385
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,110
What are you doing?

386
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,760
What did you just say?

387
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,330
I said, good job.

388
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,520
I can't hear you. Say it louder.

389
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,570
I said, good job. Happy, now?

390
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,750
Yes, I'm happy.

391
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,750
How about removing that foot now?

392
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,430
Sure.

393
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,672
That shoes...

394
00:23:41,763 --> 00:23:43,500
Are they the right fit?

395
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,730
Excuse me?

396
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,240
Wait, Chief...!

397
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,170
-Did you hear that?
-Yeah.

398
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,646
Did Chief buy you those shoes?

399
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:55,777
I guess so.

400
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,050
I thought my dad bought this for me,
but it was my mom?

401
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,100
Seriously?

402
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,680
I had no idea! I can't believe it!

403
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,790
No wonder!

404
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,330
My dad wouldn't have the sense
to buy these kind of thing!

405
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,170
I can't believe it!

406
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,770
-Are you that happy?
-Of course, I'm happy!

407
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,170
High-five!

408
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,637
Hey, you have to lift up your right hand!

409
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:19,990
Is it?

410
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,030
Chief Song idea was right.

411
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,890
Now that the ratings have been flipped,

412
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,010
let's keep up the momentum
and go even bigger!

413
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,063
I've prepared a private interview
with the driver of water delivery truck.

414
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,350
How about making it
as our third item today?

415
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,470
It sounds good.

416
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,520
Culture Chief.

417
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,350
Create a story around the concept
of 'Heroes Amongst Us'...

418
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,630
-by tomorrow.
-Yes.

419
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,600
International Chief.

420
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,730
Find out if there are
any similar foreign stories.

421
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,560
We can't make a truck accident
as an exclusive news.

422
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,580
They just got lucky with the story.

423
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,620
Let's not distress our trainees
over it too much.

424
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,409
But we still need to do
follow-up coverage.

425
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,808
I heard that MSC even
has a private interview

426
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:25,000
with the water deliveryman.

427
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,718
This is no time for us to blame it
on luck when the ratings show otherwise.

428
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,460
You're right...

429
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,170
This is no time for us
to be blaming it on luck.

430
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,400
Not when the ratings have been flipped.

431
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,400
Then, shall we go after the coverage?

432
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,500
Don't do it.

433
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,470
Come on, Mr Director!

434
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,808
We need to report
the U.S. Vice President visit,

435
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:48,431
asylum of North Korea's senior official,

436
00:25:48,522 --> 00:25:52,782
and even an in-depth report
of the Korea Australia FTA.

437
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,740
That touching stories...

438
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,439
is going to lose its heat
within the next couple of days.

439
00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:00,103
So, let's stop worrying about it,
and do what we should, okay?

440
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,826
But the news of my brother didn't end
within the next couple of days.

441
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:10,799
Mr Ki Jae-myung who risked his own life
to save the life of a boy yesterday...

442
00:26:10,889 --> 00:26:11,958
It didn't lose any heat

443
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:14,629
but it flamed even hotter.

444
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:17,269
When asked why he risked his own
life to save the life of the boy,

445
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,459
he shared an unexpected
tragic story with us.

446
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:21,849
Reporter Lee Il-joo brings
you the exclusive report.

447
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:25,299
Mr Ki Jae-myung, who risked his
own life to save a student,

448
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:28,639
loses his consciousness after calling out

449
00:26:28,749 --> 00:26:31,389
an unknown name at the
scene of the accident.

450
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,729
Mister!

451
00:26:32,969 --> 00:26:37,009
The name Ha-myung turned out to be
the name of Mr Ki's late little brother.

452
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,319
Yes.

453
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:41,439
My little brother died right
around that same age.

454
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:44,019
I must've rescued him
without even realizing it

455
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:45,999
because he reminded me of him.

456
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:50,269
They decided to just run
with a melodrama.

457
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:52,011
Must we just sit back like this?

458
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:53,319
We don’t have anything?

459
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,525
Haven't you guys found
anything on Ki Jae-myung?

460
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:04,746
Let's not get swept up in it.

461
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:07,189
We don't need to jump into this hero game

462
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,999
that we didn't even know anything about.

463
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:12,319
That's why I'm asking you
to find that out. Got it?

464
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:14,569
Yes, Sir.

465
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:16,479
Choi Dal-Po.

466
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:20,189
Forget about everything else,

467
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:21,739
and focus on Ki Jae-myung.

468
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:23,279
Report everything directly to me.

469
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:24,809
Yes, Sir.

470
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:26,492
Captain.

471
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:28,999
Should I dig on Ki Jae-myung, too?

472
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,339
Stay out of it.

473
00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:31,979
Yes, Sir.

474
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:35,269
At the time...

475
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,599
my father was slandered to have driven
nine of his fellow firemen to death

476
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:40,899
and fled like a coward.

477
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,189
But my father did not flee to escape.

478
00:27:46,469 --> 00:27:48,139
Even though he lost
his life in the fire...

479
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:50,099
his body was never found.

480
00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:53,509
And recently...

481
00:27:55,929 --> 00:27:57,499
Thus, my brother became a hero.

482
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,249
As a new-found hero,

483
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:03,121
he tells the world of the
injustice done to our father.

484
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,519
...my father's skeletal
remains were discovered.

485
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:07,089
And he finally received...

486
00:28:07,749 --> 00:28:10,159
an apology that he so desperately longed
to hear 13 years ago.

487
00:28:10,249 --> 00:28:11,649
When the power of the media speaks,

488
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:14,419
it is said that the pen
is mightier than the sword.

489
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:17,001
It means, as the pen is
mightier than the sword,

490
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,739
a pen can inflict a far
greater wound than a knife.

491
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:23,259
In a show of assuming the responsibility
of the pain inflicted on Mr Ki Jae-myung,

492
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:27,909
MSC News would like to extend
our most sincerest apology.

493
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,899
We will also make you a promise.

494
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,399
Just like how we, MSC News,

495
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:36,349
bring you the exclusive
on Mr Ki Jae-myung's story of injustice,

496
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:39,389
MSC will continue to strive
to report only the truth.

497
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:41,769
We will do the role of a pen
properly and faithfully...

498
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:42,949
The same news...

499
00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:46,119
that made my father
as an evil 13 years ago...

500
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:49,859
now making my brother as a hero.

501
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,409
I heard that Ki Jae-myung...

502
00:28:52,889 --> 00:28:55,054
was arrested by police
for violence during high school.

503
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:57,409
That's not uncommon at that age.

504
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:01,309
Ki Jae-myung is the lifeline
to our viewers ratings right now,

505
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:03,691
Let's just pass on that and stay
with the touching stories.

506
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:06,331
The news kept the darker
side of my brother

507
00:29:06,422 --> 00:29:07,673
hidden away from the world.

508
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:10,551
Mr Ki is said to have come by here
every night on his way home

509
00:29:10,642 --> 00:29:12,839
to buy all kimbap left
from this grandmother.

510
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:16,884
He'd buy all the leftover kimbap to help
her make ends in this cold weather...

511
00:29:16,975 --> 00:29:19,644
My brother's hidden good deeds
were made known to the world.

512
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:23,419
Mr Ki took the reward of 500 dollars
from Han River Police Station

513
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:25,107
and used it to buy Christmas gifts

514
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:27,499
for the children
at a local children's shelter.

515
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:30,660
Even his smallest good deeds
were praised by the world.

516
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:34,579
Everything he did and said...

517
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:38,775
like the Pied Piper from the fairytale
who left the children under his trance,

518
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:42,069
starts to captivate the world.

519
00:29:54,689 --> 00:29:56,599
It's too crowded.
Let's take the next one.

520
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:58,099
We may be able to fit.

521
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:01,279
Hey, hey!

522
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:02,809
It's already full please.

523
00:30:04,379 --> 00:30:05,929
-Hello.
-Yeah.

524
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:25,189
The last one to get on needs to get off.

525
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,589
Seonbae, stop pushing me.
I wasn't the last one to get on.

526
00:30:29,209 --> 00:30:30,169
Don't step on my shoe!

527
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,689
We’re already late. Just get off quickly.

528
00:30:36,829 --> 00:30:38,879
Hey, I'll just take the next one.

529
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:44,319
Let's just go!

530
00:30:53,089 --> 00:30:54,389
What do you think you're doing!

531
00:30:56,169 --> 00:30:57,929
There's something I want to tell you.

532
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,199
First...

533
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:03,419
Here, this is my gift to you.

534
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:11,999
Do you remember...

535
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,689
leaving your cellphone
at our house 13 years ago?

536
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:20,009
I took over that cellphone number,
and kept it live ever since.

537
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:23,299
Please take a look
at all texts there first.

538
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:25,099
Why...

539
00:31:26,129 --> 00:31:27,499
should I see that?

540
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:30,509
I've been using...

541
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:32,579
your old phone number...

542
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:34,279
for the past 13 years.

543
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:37,099
What?

544
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,909
So, I've been stealing...

545
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:41,739
your text messages...

546
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:43,419
for the past 13 years.

547
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:49,059
I'm sorry.

548
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:57,889
Grandfather is sick,

549
00:31:57,979 --> 00:32:00,229
so dad and I are moving
to Hyang-ri Island to live with him.

550
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,649
There's no TV here, so I don't
get any chances to see you.

551
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:09,369
Mom, there are times when I prefer
this quiet island over the noisy Seoul.

552
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,369
I don't even miss you.

553
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:12,599
It’s April Fools' Day.

554
00:32:12,689 --> 00:32:14,819
I bought a carnation,

555
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,619
but I can't even give it to you.

556
00:32:16,709 --> 00:32:17,549
Mom.

557
00:32:17,739 --> 00:32:20,389
Do you remember how you always ate
all my egg yolks for me?

558
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,220
I was worried about
what I was going to do

559
00:32:22,311 --> 00:32:23,109
without you anymore,

560
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:24,938
but Uncle Dal-Po turns out
to only eat the yolks.

561
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:26,292
Isn't that amazing?

562
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:30,939
You changed your number
since you lost your phone, right?

563
00:32:32,489 --> 00:32:34,769
-But In-ha didn't know that.
-It's not the number.

564
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,679
So she kept sending all those texts.

565
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:38,799
It really isn't the number.

566
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:41,149
Dal-Po was right.

567
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:45,040
I thought she'd quit at some point
when she didn't get any responses,

568
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:46,679
but she just kept sending them.

569
00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:48,519
For 13 whole years.

570
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:50,739
Like a hopeful fool.

571
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:55,019
But after some time of reading the texts,

572
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:57,580
I started developing an
interest in Choi In-ha.

573
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,479
That's why I'm here right now.

574
00:33:00,589 --> 00:33:01,429
So...

575
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:03,259
what do you want to say?

576
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:04,878
You're saying that like a fool,

577
00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:06,448
you became a reporter because of a girl?

578
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:07,723
Yes.

579
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:10,899
You should sit down one day,
and read through them all.

580
00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:13,609
The messages are so honest.

581
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:16,409
I bet you'll fall right in love with her.

582
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:18,179
I can guarantee it.

583
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:21,319
Once you read all those texts,
just like I did...

584
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,179
you're going to become a fool yourself.

585
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:26,359
And just like I did...

586
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,139
you're going to want...

587
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:31,092
to be a good person to Choi In-ha.

588
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:42,919
MSC has totally taken over the reins.

589
00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:45,585
Once they took over the ratings,
they're firmly staying put.

590
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:47,285
Ki Jae-myung does popular these days.

591
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:50,455
They really are squeezing
the scene of the accident...

592
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:52,005
just because it's an exclusive.

593
00:33:52,515 --> 00:33:53,675
Isn't that too much?

594
00:33:59,265 --> 00:34:00,235
Is that too much?

595
00:34:00,815 --> 00:34:05,095
I was going to share our exclusive footage
out of the goodness of my heart...

596
00:34:05,975 --> 00:34:07,945
but I guess not.

597
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,625
Mr Gong-joo.

598
00:34:13,805 --> 00:34:15,875
Why did you take my joke seriously?

599
00:34:15,975 --> 00:34:17,355
Are you really going share it?

600
00:34:17,445 --> 00:34:18,285
Here.

601
00:34:22,615 --> 00:34:25,705
If you put "Courtesy of MSC"
on the top of the image,

602
00:34:26,045 --> 00:34:27,685
then I'll think about it.

603
00:34:28,035 --> 00:34:29,715
In Gothic font...

604
00:34:31,925 --> 00:34:32,785
No way.

605
00:34:33,075 --> 00:34:33,965
Forget it.

606
00:34:35,305 --> 00:34:36,155
By the way,

607
00:34:36,595 --> 00:34:39,215
Ki Jae-myung adamantly refused
to give us an interview.

608
00:34:39,365 --> 00:34:41,225
Why is he agreeing to do
it with only you guys?

609
00:34:41,335 --> 00:34:42,185
Did you guys...

610
00:34:43,185 --> 00:34:44,035
give him some cash?

611
00:34:46,315 --> 00:34:48,205
Money? Don't be shallow...

612
00:34:48,495 --> 00:34:50,975
He said it was because of MSC's integrity.

613
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:52,625
In-Te-gri-Ty!

614
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:55,125
Choi Dal-Po Han River

615
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:56,725
Hello?

616
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:00,505
Hang on.

617
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:01,905
What is it this time?

618
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:03,585
Why he takes call in private?

619
00:35:03,675 --> 00:35:05,085
Is it another exclusive news?

620
00:35:05,385 --> 00:35:07,445
Hey, let’s share it with us!

621
00:35:10,695 --> 00:35:11,535
Okay, talk.

622
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:14,215
I'm going to meet my brother today.

623
00:35:15,535 --> 00:35:16,618
Will you be okay to go alone?

624
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:18,415
Yes.

625
00:35:26,815 --> 00:35:28,195
That man is...

626
00:35:45,335 --> 00:35:46,665
Lecture Topic: Fact and Impact

627
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:04,165
Now that we're working the desk,
we were even offered to go to the sauna.

628
00:36:04,505 --> 00:36:05,365
It's good.

629
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:08,365
I'm sure it was only
because we were filthy.

630
00:36:08,455 --> 00:36:09,835
He said we stunk.

631
00:36:12,225 --> 00:36:13,215
I can't tell.

632
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:21,205
Just think about it.

633
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:24,802
Why do you think Ki Jae-myung
took this out of the blue?

634
00:36:24,985 --> 00:36:27,155
It means that he's planning
on coming to the lecture.

635
00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:28,875
What's the problem with that?

636
00:36:28,965 --> 00:36:30,465
You know what the problem is.

637
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:33,325
You know what you did
to him 13 years ago.

638
00:36:34,635 --> 00:36:38,095
I'm positive that Ki Jae-myung will
show up to cause some sorts of trouble.

639
00:36:38,315 --> 00:36:39,155
Really?

640
00:36:39,545 --> 00:36:41,305
Then, make sure
to bring your camera, okay?

641
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:44,022
That should make for some good news.

642
00:36:47,065 --> 00:36:49,965
Not just trouble,
but he may even attack you!

643
00:36:52,905 --> 00:36:55,115
I went to Japan for the earthquake
in Fukushima.

644
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:58,189
I've done all sorts of interviews
from pseudo-religions to organized gangs.

645
00:36:58,535 --> 00:37:00,808
I'd actually welcome if it's an attack,
not just trouble.

646
00:37:01,195 --> 00:37:03,334
The bigger the scale of the news,
the better, isn't it?

647
00:37:04,685 --> 00:37:05,335
I mean...

648
00:37:11,682 --> 00:37:12,877
My mom is coming this way.

649
00:37:14,095 --> 00:37:14,868
You're right.

650
00:37:20,735 --> 00:37:21,675
-Mom...
-Just eat.

651
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:23,641
I came because I wanted to eat in peace.

652
00:37:25,115 --> 00:37:25,799
Yes.

653
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:25,715
Choi Dal-Po.

654
00:38:28,255 --> 00:38:29,845
Captain wanted me to get this to you.

655
00:38:31,085 --> 00:38:32,005
You heard it, right?

656
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:34,625
Yes, thank you.

657
00:38:37,935 --> 00:38:38,845
But...

658
00:38:39,535 --> 00:38:41,075
what do a trainee need that for?

659
00:39:00,135 --> 00:39:02,725
Ki Ho-sang

660
00:39:08,475 --> 00:39:10,085
Please forgive us for our criticism

661
00:39:10,175 --> 00:39:12,005
We love you. Please rest in peace

662
00:39:35,055 --> 00:39:36,255
We're sorry, and we love you.

663
00:39:36,345 --> 00:39:38,015
We're sorry for the criticism.
We love you.

664
00:39:38,105 --> 00:39:39,645
Our hero, we love you.

665
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:52,335
What are you doing here?

666
00:40:00,325 --> 00:40:01,705
I heard you came here every day.

667
00:40:01,795 --> 00:40:02,975
So, I came by to see you.

668
00:40:03,295 --> 00:40:06,585
I heard that your father passed away
wrongfully at the fault of the reporters.

669
00:40:10,735 --> 00:40:11,585
Yes.

670
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:13,455
He passed away wrongfully...

671
00:40:14,675 --> 00:40:15,895
because of reporters like you.

672
00:40:18,635 --> 00:40:19,645
I've made it very clear

673
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:22,865
that I will only give interviews to MSC.

674
00:40:25,755 --> 00:40:27,055
Why MSC?

675
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:29,359
I heard that MSC was the worst

676
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:32,023
when it came to Fireman Ki Ho-sang report
13 years ago.

677
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:33,505
I have no specific reasons.

678
00:40:35,075 --> 00:40:36,625
Because current MSC reporters...

679
00:40:37,705 --> 00:40:40,125
don't distort my truth like you do.

680
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:49,025
By any chance...

681
00:40:51,035 --> 00:40:52,465
do you know who Moon Duk-soo is?

682
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:03,204
No.

683
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:05,245
He's the factory worker that framed

684
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,825
Fireman Ki Ho-sang
at the factory explosion incident.

685
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,528
He recently disappeared
after killing two of his co-workers.

686
00:41:11,205 --> 00:41:12,045
Really?

687
00:41:16,755 --> 00:41:18,255
What a retributive justice for them.

688
00:41:19,725 --> 00:41:22,395
I'm sure that he was a father
and husband for someone.

689
00:41:22,815 --> 00:41:24,805
I hope that he'll stop making
his family suffer...

690
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:26,765
and just turn himself in.

691
00:41:28,495 --> 00:41:29,335
Why are you...

692
00:41:31,285 --> 00:41:32,405
speaking in the past tense?

693
00:41:35,855 --> 00:41:38,571
You just said,
"he was a father and husband".

694
00:41:39,655 --> 00:41:42,635
Why are you speaking of a missing person
as if he's no longer exists?

695
00:41:43,115 --> 00:41:44,405
As if he's already dead.

696
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:47,465
That's because...

697
00:41:48,395 --> 00:41:50,487
he can't play the role
of a father and husband right now.

698
00:41:55,785 --> 00:41:58,595
And I've also only said Moon Duk-soo
framed Mr Ki Ho-sang.

699
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:01,175
I didn't mention anything
about the other two dead people.

700
00:42:02,615 --> 00:42:04,705
But why did you say
"retributive justice for them"?

701
00:42:05,145 --> 00:42:08,455
Doesn't that mean you already knew that
the other two also framed Mr Ki Ho-sang?

702
00:42:17,195 --> 00:42:18,415
Ki Jae-myung...

703
00:42:19,935 --> 00:42:22,495
Are you now asking for an apology
from the people in the world?

704
00:42:25,255 --> 00:42:26,755
Or you want take revenge on them?

705
00:42:29,565 --> 00:42:31,065
If I had to choose one...

706
00:42:36,025 --> 00:42:37,130
then it must be revenge.

707
00:43:19,755 --> 00:43:21,145
Are you now asking for an apology?

708
00:43:21,675 --> 00:43:23,245
Or you want take revenge?

709
00:43:24,205 --> 00:43:25,705
If I had to choose one...

710
00:43:27,345 --> 00:43:28,395
then it must be revenge.

711
00:43:34,395 --> 00:43:35,903
Hey, Choi Dal-Po.

712
00:43:36,315 --> 00:43:37,165
Captain's calling.

713
00:43:37,255 --> 00:43:38,715
-I'll transfer it to you.
-Yes, Sir.

714
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,475
If it's magic that can fool
the entire world,

715
00:43:43,795 --> 00:43:45,195
then can it turn into a miracle?

716
00:43:46,045 --> 00:43:48,375
If it's a lie that can fool
the entire world,

717
00:43:49,275 --> 00:43:50,923
then can it turned into a truth?

718
00:43:52,615 --> 00:43:53,465
If so...

719
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:56,339
Yes, this is Choi Dal-Po
from Han River district.

720
00:43:56,585 --> 00:43:57,964
Why aren't you answering your cellphone?

721
00:43:58,425 --> 00:44:00,075
It's broken. I'm sorry.

722
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:01,355
Really?

723
00:44:03,045 --> 00:44:05,615
How did the meeting with your brother?
Did you find out anything?

724
00:44:05,705 --> 00:44:08,115
Now the whole world believes
my brother is a hero.

725
00:44:09,135 --> 00:44:10,665
If only I keep silent...

726
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:13,395
then can't my brother live as a real hero?

727
00:44:13,915 --> 00:44:14,755
No.

728
00:44:14,965 --> 00:44:17,055
I haven't found anything yet.

729
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:18,195
I'm sorry.

730
00:44:29,405 --> 00:44:31,245
A truth trapped in a wall of lies,

731
00:44:31,565 --> 00:44:33,665
may look still and peaceful
like the calm water.

732
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:35,675
But without anyone knows,

733
00:44:36,345 --> 00:44:38,448
the truth find the tiniest crack
in the wall

734
00:44:38,539 --> 00:44:40,044
and leaking out toward the world.

735
00:44:42,904 --> 00:44:43,884
Ki Jae-myung...

736
00:44:43,974 --> 00:44:46,574
Ki Jae-myung Fashion: Popular
Among Teenagers as Hero Fashion

737
00:44:46,664 --> 00:44:47,704
Ki Jae-myung?

738
00:44:48,734 --> 00:44:50,467
I think I've heard
that name somewhere before.

739
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:54,194
Here...

740
00:44:54,284 --> 00:44:56,094
-Get this to Choi Dal-Po.
-Yes, Sir.

741
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,284
What's this?

742
00:44:58,894 --> 00:44:59,734
Ki Jae-myung?

743
00:45:00,214 --> 00:45:00,904
That's right.

744
00:45:00,995 --> 00:45:03,179
That was the name on the note
Captain gave to Choi Dal-Po.

745
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:07,055
How is Choi Dal-Po
related to Ki Jae-myung?

746
00:45:09,689 --> 00:45:11,399
The truth flows slowly,

747
00:45:11,629 --> 00:45:13,275
and forces that tiny crack even wider.

748
00:45:16,082 --> 00:45:17,819
What are you doing? Why did you stop?

749
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:20,499
I think I've seen this
man somewhere before.

750
00:45:31,489 --> 00:45:32,910
What's he doing up there?

751
00:45:33,909 --> 00:45:35,019
Who is that guy?

752
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:38,119
I remember now.
It's the guy Choi Dal-Po met.

753
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:40,509
Dal-Po and Ki Jae-myung?

754
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:42,579
The factory fire case?

755
00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:45,799
What am I missing?

756
00:45:46,149 --> 00:45:48,659
In one moment, the wall that
looked strong crumbling down.

757
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:53,869
Hey, Choi In-ha!

758
00:45:56,149 --> 00:45:58,179
-Come here for a minute.
-Excuse me?

759
00:45:58,519 --> 00:45:59,359
Yes, Sir.

760
00:45:59,499 --> 00:46:00,379
And flows heavily...

761
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:02,849
out toward the world.

762
00:46:05,043 --> 00:46:06,203
What is it?

763
00:46:08,013 --> 00:46:10,223
I have a favor to ask to you.

764
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:12,387
What is it?

765
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,748
First, there's something you need to see.

766
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,573
Who is this person?

767
00:46:23,664 --> 00:46:25,264
Ki Jae-myung from 13 years ago.

768
00:46:25,942 --> 00:46:29,433
He once gave us an interview
to declare his father's innocence.

769
00:46:30,423 --> 00:46:31,433
Really?

770
00:46:32,263 --> 00:46:34,700
Wouldn't it be newsworthy
if we air it now?

771
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:36,533
Just watch it first.

772
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:40,733
Don't look at the camera.
Just look at me while you talk.

773
00:46:40,823 --> 00:46:41,683
Are you ready?

774
00:46:42,729 --> 00:46:43,612
Yes.

775
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,103
Mom...

776
00:46:46,123 --> 00:46:47,693
I mean, Chief Song interviewed him?

777
00:46:48,793 --> 00:46:49,181
Yeah.

778
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:51,163
What's the trophy?

779
00:46:51,673 --> 00:46:52,513
This is...

780
00:46:54,003 --> 00:46:57,183
the trophy for "Fireman of Honor"
that my father won last year.

781
00:46:57,553 --> 00:47:00,553
My father received this award
for his great contribution

782
00:47:00,783 --> 00:47:05,228
to put out 730 fires and to save
the lives and assets of over 1,400 people

783
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:06,920
during the 21 years
and two months of his duty...

784
00:47:08,153 --> 00:47:09,473
as a public fireman.

785
00:47:09,653 --> 00:47:13,023
Why do you think that kind of father
is still on the run?

786
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,013
My father...

787
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:20,323
died with his boots on.

788
00:47:21,323 --> 00:47:22,373
What do you mean by that?

789
00:47:22,463 --> 00:47:24,886
A Pinocchio witness even stated
that he saw your father.

790
00:47:24,977 --> 00:47:26,929
I believe in my father
more than I do in a Pinocchio!

791
00:47:27,501 --> 00:47:29,519
That Pinocchio must've been mistaken.

792
00:47:29,621 --> 00:47:30,461
Wait.

793
00:47:30,561 --> 00:47:32,011
Hey, we're not here to listen to...

794
00:47:32,101 --> 00:47:34,071
I wish my father was alive, as well!

795
00:47:37,871 --> 00:47:41,972
What son in this world
would wish for their father to be dead?

796
00:47:42,801 --> 00:47:44,971
I don't care if people point
and call him a coward.

797
00:47:45,061 --> 00:47:48,031
I don't care if I never see him
as long as he's still alive!

798
00:47:50,191 --> 00:47:52,714
But the fact is,
that's not the type of a man he is.

799
00:47:54,651 --> 00:47:57,131
He's not the type of man
to leave his co-worker behind.

800
00:47:57,851 --> 00:48:00,831
He's not even more a man who'd abandon
his family and hiding somewhere.

801
00:48:02,741 --> 00:48:04,057
As a son...

802
00:48:06,061 --> 00:48:09,151
I hate to come into conclusion
of my father's death.

803
00:48:12,471 --> 00:48:13,961
But I know since I'm his son...

804
00:48:15,551 --> 00:48:16,421
My father...

805
00:48:19,341 --> 00:48:20,581
...died with his boots on.

806
00:48:23,381 --> 00:48:25,281
That's enough. We'll end it here.

807
00:48:32,721 --> 00:48:34,146
Why did you show this to me?

808
00:48:35,693 --> 00:48:36,641
The day we filmed this...

809
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,930
there was one more incident.

810
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:41,700
What incident?

811
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,490
What do you think?
Was the interview newsworthy?

812
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:53,110
Yeah, we can just use the part of him
yelling about only wanting his father

813
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,730
to be alive even he's blamed.

814
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:56,670
Wait, Seonbae.

815
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:58,840
I think that's going too far.

816
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,420
That wasn't the point of the interview.

817
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:01,890
That was the point of it to me.

818
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,069
The son is just as shameless
as his father is.

819
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,240
Seonbae...

820
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,300
You're not even a reporter.

821
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,940
You're a monster!

822
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,340
Let go! Let go of her!

823
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:16,440
Seriously.

824
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,930
We need some help over here!

825
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,710
Seonbae, you should've tolerated him.

826
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,440
It was a mistake stemming from anger.

827
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,600
Mistake?

828
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:51,830
He was going to hit me with that trophy.

829
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,800
That was a clear attempted murder.

830
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,910
He just hit the wall,
then stopped himself.

831
00:49:58,750 --> 00:49:59,750
Let's just settle this.

832
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,820
If you just send him away like that,
he won't be able to go home...

833
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:05,240
and he'll have to spend
the night in a cold holding cell.

834
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:06,220
Good.

835
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,420
That's what I want.

836
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:11,990
Because of that incident,

837
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:14,420
Ki Jae-myung wasn't able
to go home that night.

838
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,720
And later that night,

839
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:19,240
Ki Jae-myung's mother
and his little brother...

840
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:21,944
jumped off a cliff
and committed dual suicide.

841
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,631
Ki Jae-myung believes that
if he gone home that night,

842
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:28,080
he can stop that tragedy from happening.

843
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:30,030
That's why...

844
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,920
he has a huge resentment
against Chief Song.

845
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,720
Is my mom...

846
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,220
aware of all this?

847
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:43,920
Yeah.

848
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,930
Revive them, you bastards!

849
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,100
You guys killed them.

850
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:55,010
You guys killed
my little brother and my mother!

851
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:59,145
You guys killed them
with the words you spread.

852
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,832
Get a shot of the shoe
with the sea in the background.

853
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,721
This is your fault!

854
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,710
This never would've happened,
if I was with my mother last night!

855
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,630
No.

856
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,820
If you were with her last night,
you would've died together.

857
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:21,930
I will kill you.

858
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,180
I'm going to kill you!

859
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,270
That guy, Ki Jae-myung...

860
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,590
there's something fishy about him.

861
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,687
The way he took that flier

862
00:51:37,778 --> 00:51:39,311
about Chief Song's upcoming
lecture that day...

863
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,390
And I don't know if I'm too sensitive...

864
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,848
But he seems to think
something dangerous.

865
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:49,920
No matter how I warn her, she just won't
listen. She's still just going to do it.

866
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,736
She said she'd prefer that he attacks her
out of his grudge.

867
00:51:52,827 --> 00:51:54,955
She welcomes the newsworthy attack!

868
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,030
Anyhow, can you try to stop her?

869
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,160
Who knows?

870
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,930
Maybe she'll listen to her daughter.

871
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:06,400
Are you even listening to me?

872
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,422
Is my mom...

873
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,970
I mean, Chief Song,
that cruel of a person?

874
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:21,130
Choi In-ha.

875
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,230
How could she do that?

876
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,580
How come...?

877
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,720
I really...

878
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,740
I really can't understand it.

879
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:43,060
That shoe...

880
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,540
What is that shoe?

881
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,260
This is...

882
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,040
That shoe belonged
to Ki Jae-myung's brother.

883
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:53,040
The one that drowned in the sea
with his mother.

884
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,070
Ki Jae-myung's little brother?

885
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:57,470
That's right.

886
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:01,020
He told you that during the interview
at the hospital.

887
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,910
Was it Ki... Ha-myung?

888
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,220
That's his little brother's shoe.

889
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,360
I'll be back.

890
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,680
No way.

891
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,490
Hey.

892
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,420
Choi In-ha!

893
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:30,510
Hey!

894
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:32,010
Hey! Hey! Hey!

895
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:33,270
Hey! Hey!

896
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:34,600
Choi In-ha!

897
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,390
Hey!

898
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:41,250
Hey!

899
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,310
It was either last September or October,

900
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,010
the day a high sea warning issued.

901
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,400
I took the boat out to sea by myself

902
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:56,980
to fix the pole from the storm.

903
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:01,970
That's when I saw
something cling to a pillar.

904
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:10,990
Oh my.

905
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:11,990
In-ha.

906
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:14,931
What are you doing home at this hour?

907
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:24,690
In-ha, I finally bought a television
to see you and Dal-Po on the news.

908
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:29,010
Look at this.

909
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,650
The colors and everything are so clear.

910
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,400
-Grandfather.
-Huh?

911
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,090
This shoe... What is this shoe?

912
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,460
Hey, you can't throw that out!

913
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:43,990
That's the shoe...

914
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,340
that saved your uncle's life

915
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:48,990
when it got caught in
the pillar back then.

916
00:54:49,305 --> 00:54:52,040
That shoe is like a talisman.

917
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:58,390
By the way...

918
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,290
did you two make an appointment today?

919
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:05,410
I thought you guys couldn't come home
because of that mawari or something.

920
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,689
How did you both manage
to come home today?

921
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,730
Uncle came by the house?

922
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:10,700
Yeah.

923
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:11,980
Come here.

924
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,410
I think something's going on with Dal-Po.

925
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,298
I don't know what's
happened, but he just...

926
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:23,920
walked around the house
then went up to the rooftop.

927
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:29,050
In-ha.

928
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:30,800
Are you leaving again now?

929
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:44,410
Let me ask you something.

930
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,060
Why do you hate me?

931
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,020
Am I your sworn enemy or something?

932
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,900
Of course you're my sworn enemy.

933
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,420
I'm not going to be disappointed.

934
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:56,260
No matter how badly you and my dad slander
my mom, I won't believe any of it.

935
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,230
It's not slander, but the truth.

936
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,810
They should be careful, and more careful!

937
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,100
Being not aware of that is their fault!

938
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,940
That negligence...

939
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:17,430
has destroyed a family.

940
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,990
That's why they must take responsibility
for it.

941
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:24,180
I think...

942
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,590
that you shouldn't be a reporter.

943
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:28,640
I mean that.

944
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,420
Tell me, was that all just a lie?

945
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:41,960
Hey!

946
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:43,580
You crazy bastard!

947
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:49,170
Dal-Po.

948
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:51,530
Dal-Po.

949
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,560
Please don't get involved with him.

950
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:14,740
Don't ask me for reasons. Just please...

951
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,720
Please don't, okay?

952
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:37,170
In-ha.

953
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:02,930
Are you by any chance...

954
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:08,740
Ki Ha-myung?

955
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:20,260
Are you?

956
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,210
Is your real name...

957
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,490
Ki Ha-myung?

958
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:33,430
How did you...?

959
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,260
How did you find...?

960
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:50,344
The truth that I've wanted
to keep hidden...

961
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:54,100
was found out by the person
who should've never known it.

962
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:14,860
Did you return the pin recorder?

963
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:16,730
-Let me return it.
-So, you've made your decision.

964
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:17,940
-Captain.
-Choi Dal-Po

965
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,250
I'll dig around Ki Jae-myung.

966
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:22,080
Tell me who your real family is,
then I'll reconsider it.

967
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:24,635
He makes In-ha laugh and cry...

968
00:59:24,726 --> 00:59:26,379
-My In-ha?
-You don't know?

969
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:27,304
You said you didn't know?

970
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,640
I think I may be gone for a while.

971
00:59:29,731 --> 00:59:31,621
-Where?
-Somewhere far...

972
00:59:31,712 --> 00:59:33,375
Ki Jae-myung's wrath is justified.

973
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:35,810
Why did you do it?
Even I was able to endure it.
