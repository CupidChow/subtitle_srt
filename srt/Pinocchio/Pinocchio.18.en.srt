1
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,310
Pinocchio

2
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,160
They're whining so much
that I'm really irritated.

3
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,216
I'm stressed to the point of irritation.

4
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,050
Embarrassing me to the point
that I'm irritated.

5
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,830
Episode 18 - Red Shoes.

6
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,615
I'm back, Captain.

7
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:47,732
You made the right decision.
Welcome back!

8
00:01:47,823 --> 00:01:48,388
Welcome back.

9
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,784
I'm sorry for making you worry.

10
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,135
If you're sorry, do a good job.

11
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,415
Lower your voice for now.

12
00:01:56,506 --> 00:01:59,690
You'll have more opportunities
to speak up later.

13
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,480
- So, now.
- No, Sir.

14
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,829
I have no intention
to lower my voice even now.

15
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,002
- If I did, I wouldn't have come back.
- Hey!

16
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,180
What's wrong with you?

17
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:12,347
I respect you, Captain.

18
00:02:13,204 --> 00:02:15,142
And I think you are
truly a good reporter.

19
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,164
For reporters, observing is
serving the public interest!

20
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,601
And making news with them
is serving the public interest.

21
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:23,684
And making news with them
is serving the public interest.

22
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:25,703
We must make city officials
pay attention to that news!

23
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:27,445
We must make city officials
pay attention to that news!

24
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:28,813
We must make the president
pay attention to that news!

25
00:02:28,903 --> 00:02:30,190
We must make the president
pay attention to that news!

26
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,680
So that the whole world
will pay attention!

27
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,507
That is how a reporter serves the public!

28
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,681
You said those words to me.

29
00:02:36,772 --> 00:02:39,063
I remember every word.

30
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,130
When did I say that?
I don't remember that?

31
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:45,961
You did when we were doing
the story on the icy roads.

32
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,864
Did I? I wonder why I said that.

33
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,375
Captain, I believe you are hiding
your true self right now.

34
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:58,199
No, this is the real me.

35
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,201
I'm not hiding anything.
It's my bare face.

36
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll see you at the meeting later.

37
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,851
I believe in you and will follow you.

38
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,723
Hey, hey! Choi In-ha. Choi In-ha!

39
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,780
Why does she trust me without my input?

40
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,849
I don't know me, so how does
she know to trust me?

41
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,160
Do you think Ms Song will change?

42
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,115
Let me see... Honestly, I have no idea.

43
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,940
I don't know.

44
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,570
You've thrown out a card,

45
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:38,314
but maybe it was too reckless.

46
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,518
Then, should I go and ask
for the text messages back?

47
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,919
Can you do that?

48
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,478
Captain!

49
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,716
I didn't really mean it.

50
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,247
But how can you be so relaxed?

51
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,408
I'm not relaxed.

52
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,700
Honestly, I still have another source

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,162
to reveal the connection between
Ms Song and Chairwoman Park.

54
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,357
What's that?

55
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:07,762
Have you found more evidence?

56
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,230
I have an informant.

57
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,170
An informant? Who?

58
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,705
He asked to remain anonymous for now.
So, I can't reveal him yet.

59
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,395
He will give us evidence
as he gathers it.

60
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,160
You don't have to worry about
those text messages anymore.

61
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,345
I have my cell phone back
and the record of the text messages.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,250
Ki Ha-myung promised that
he would not report this story, as well.

63
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,630
As always, you did a good job.

64
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,835
I don't trust Ki Ha-myung's words,
but I trust yours.

65
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,583
By the way...

66
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,911
when do I get to meet Choi In-ha?

67
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,145
Since the problem has been taken care of,

68
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,680
is it really necessary to meet her?

69
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,993
I'll watch over her carefully.

70
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,074
Shall we do that then?

71
00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:23,080
I have a meeting in the afternoon
so I need to get going.

72
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,291
That's too bad.

73
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,550
Next time,
let's meet when we're less busy.

74
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,684
Yes, ma'am.

75
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,807
But now that I think about it,
this is a first.

76
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,713
Excuse me?

77
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,119
It's the first time
that you refused my request.

78
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,349
Let's see each other again.

79
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,519
Ms Song, the item meeting
is starting soon.

80
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,389
I won't be attending that meeting anymore,
so go ahead without me.

81
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,330
- Why not?
- What do you mean, why not?

82
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,810
Are you disappointed? Should I go back?

83
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,220
No, I'm not disappointed. Not at all!

84
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,190
- Are you that happy?
- Of course I'm happy.

85
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,296
It was as if I didn't exist.
Now, I don't have to feel anxious.

86
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,354
Now, it's totally my world!

87
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,340
I need to use the restroom.

88
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,945
I believe the Officer Ahn story is
an embarrassment on behalf of MSC News.

89
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,360
Are you bringing up the past again?

90
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,120
That story hasn't finished yet.

91
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,896
During the investigation of the story,
Ms Song relayed a lie.

92
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:03,065
It was a lie that the CCTV
was found at the factory.

93
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,511
The footage of the factory was edited.

94
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:09,166
So, what is it that you want to do?

95
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:13,020
Do you want to humiliate her
with announcements of her false report?

96
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:15,319
No, I want to fix our errors.

97
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,370
Why did Ms Song report false news?
And on whose orders?

98
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,030
If other channels report this,
it will be a humiliation.

99
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,180
If we report it ourselves,
it will be a voice of introspection.

100
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,390
Captain!

101
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,550
Oh, it could be true.

102
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,966
Then, let's decide with a vote.

103
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,253
Raise your hand if you think
it makes sense to go after Ms Song.

104
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,640
Captain, are you raising your hand?

105
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,490
No, I wasn't. There was a loose thread
here. I was trying to get at this.

106
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,262
So, whose turn is it next?

107
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,847
Really, that big-eyed girl
just keeps saying...

108
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,156
"'I believe in you, Captain."

109
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,360
She's getting at my conscience.
I'm dying here!

110
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,988
Why are you so concerned
about the words of a rookie?

111
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,321
Maybe I should just report it
to Ms Song as if I am out of my mind?

112
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,360
Are you right in the head?

113
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,480
You want to tell Ms Song
about an item that attacks her?

114
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,769
That's why I'm saying I'll tell her.

115
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,631
Then, she can deal with it herself.

116
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,473
"I did what I can, as a reporter."

117
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,470
I will just pretend that.

118
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,740
Just pretend, huh?

119
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,685
Yes. Just to let her know.

120
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,170
And avoid responsibility!

121
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,940
What? What did you say?

122
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,987
Do it.

123
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,047
- Why?
- You said it was Choi In-ha's suggestion?

124
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,807
Dig into it quietly,
without the Director finding out.

125
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,470
But Ms Song!

126
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,770
This will...

127
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,628
This will damage our company.

128
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,797
I should really do it?

129
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,682
Do it.

130
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,632
I'll report the story.
Investigate it thoroughly.

131
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,170
Oh, man.

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,230
I'm ruined.

133
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,162
What is it?

134
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,157
She told me to do it.

135
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,747
Do what?

136
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,030
Ms Song told me to do Choi In-ha's story.

137
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,848
She says she'll report it herself too.

138
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,428
We're really doing it?

139
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,980
Captain?

140
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,484
You have kids studying abroad.
What if you get fired?

141
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,652
Honey? It's me.

142
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,938
Is that what's important,
whether it's night or day there?

143
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,463
Forget it.

144
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:18,320
Get the kids un-enrolled from school
and pack your bags.

145
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,428
I'm going to get fired soon.

146
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,432
How are we going to live?

147
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,139
Honey, do you know how to fry chicken?

148
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:28,023
Should we do a fried chicken business?

149
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,746
Yes, Director Yeon. How can I help you?

150
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,670
Well, a bit of a problem has come up.

151
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,916
What do you mean, a problem?

152
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,720
Yes.

153
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,430
Yes.

154
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,001
I had a feeling that might happen.

155
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,722
What would make Ms Song do this?

156
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,350
Alright. I'll have to come up with a plan.

157
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,851
When will I be able to meet Choi In-ha?

158
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,250
Since the problem has been taken care of,
is it really necessary to meet her?

159
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,668
Do you recall the texts you exchanged
with MSC's Song Cha-ok?

160
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:38,158
I don't know what you're referring to,
it's been so long.

161
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,815
I never said it had been long time.

162
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,225
They're annoying.

163
00:11:47,254 --> 00:11:48,810
Very annoying.

164
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,080
I've been suggesting the items related to
the connection of the two

165
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,098
but I keep getting stuck.

166
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,740
But I think Captain is slightly
on my side.

167
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,280
- Really?
- Not completely, just slightly.

168
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,374
How is Father? I heard his blood pressure
went up a while back.

169
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,678
Grandpa? He had medicine and got better.

170
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:25,678
If you're worried, come in and see him.

171
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,297
No, it's okay.

172
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:28,683
I'll get going.

173
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,667
That little brat! In front an apartment
How dangerous!

174
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,410
Leave it on. He's too far to hit now.

175
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,230
Seo Bum-Jo!

176
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,330
Is this your dog?

177
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,037
Unlike his owner, this dog is cute.

178
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,720
What brings you by?
All the way to my house?

179
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,990
Do you think I came because I missed you?

180
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,443
I came to make good
on that promise I made you.

181
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,700
Gosh!

182
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,590
Why didn't you talk to me
in the reporters room?

183
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,591
I'm quitting and going back home.

184
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,360
My mother wants it that way.

185
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,626
So, you're following
your mother's wishes?

186
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,415
No, it's the opposite.

187
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,940
What?

188
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,700
If I ask as a reporter,
she refuses to answer.

189
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,746
But, if I ask as a son,
she says she will answer me.

190
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,383
I'm quitting in order
to hear those answers.

191
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,840
I will hear all of her answers
and come find you.

192
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,850
Okay.

193
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,110
Let's talk inside.

194
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,411
Wow! So, this is a studio!

195
00:14:44,502 --> 00:14:48,200
It's my first time seeing one.
There's the bedroom, bathroom.

196
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,090
Oh, there's even a kitchen.
It has everything.

197
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,701
- So, this is possible.
- Want something to drink?

198
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,541
Do you have wine?

199
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,800
Crazy little brat.

200
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,630
Shut up and drink this.

201
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,310
You really resent my mother, right?

202
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,450
Yeah.

203
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,900
You probably won't believe me,

204
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,160
but she was the most kind person
in the world to me.

205
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,480
I know.

206
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,450
So what I'm doing now...

207
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,350
is very hard for me.

208
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,710
It's painful.

209
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,770
Captain. This is Seo Bum-Jo.

210
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,408
As of today, I'm quitting my job at MSC.

211
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:01,885
Move.

212
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,160
So I may...

213
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,092
not be able to keep
my promise I've made to you.

214
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,565
I have no intention on pressing for it.

215
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,454
I know how difficult it is for you.

216
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,454
You don't like me
and I'm annoying, right?

217
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,064
Not like this is anything new.

218
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,090
What about In-ha?

219
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,220
She's doing well?

220
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,664
Yes. But I think she is mistaken.

221
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,790
She thinks you're back
to being a mama's boy.

222
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,873
Maybe.

223
00:16:40,954 --> 00:16:42,647
Maybe I'm really back
to being a mama's boy.

224
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,735
Hey, you did this on purpose
because you thought I was a jerk!

225
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,841
I have a delivery. Where's the newsroom?

226
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,193
End of the hallway.

227
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,870
Congressman Kim Kyung-woo who was
summoned for the factory fire case

228
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,553
knew Chairwoman Park Rosa
since general election.

229
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,570
MSC aired marketing news
presenting the factory as Eco-friendly.

230
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,640
This happened three times last year.

231
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,787
Congressman Kim's CD publication party
even made it to the headlines.

232
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,420
When you add up all the reports and
news segments, there are way too many.

233
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,370
MSC was blatantly supporting him.

234
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,440
I have a delivery for Ki Ha-myung.

235
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,862
Ki Ha-myung?
He's in a meeting over there.

236
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,500
Ki Ha-myung!

237
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,630
Everyone take cover!

238
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,730
I'm at the newsroom at YGN.

239
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,400
Some crazy man is causing a commotion.
Come quick! Hurry!

240
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,300
Ki Ha-myung, come out!

241
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,700
Where are you? Come out now!

242
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,535
Come here!

243
00:20:38,877 --> 00:20:40,990
This afternoon, at the Congress theater

244
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:44,461
at the release party for a Christmas CD
for donation by Congress

245
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:47,422
Congressman Kim Kyung-woo
is singing carols.

246
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,245
What are you watching?

247
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,150
I'm going through news related
to Congressman Kim Kyung-woo.

248
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,604
Seems like MSC aired lots of
positive news related to him.

249
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,790
Most of them were led by me
and the director.

250
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,098
Sit down. I'll help you find more.

251
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,240
Excuse me?

252
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,614
Did you see the one on Congressman Kim
making kimchi for the poor?

253
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,390
No, not yet.

254
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,840
I have deliveries for Song Cha-ok and
Choi In-ha. Where can I find them?

255
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,770
In the office.

256
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,005
Anyone hurt? Is everyone okay?

257
00:21:49,096 --> 00:21:51,056
Yes. Is everyone okay?

258
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,160
- Yes.
- I'm fine.

259
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:58,730
What is this? Looks like he was here
for revenge of some sort.

260
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,193
He was looking for Ki Ha-myung.

261
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,900
He seems to have grudge against you.
Do you know him?

262
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,540
No, I've never...

263
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,930
No way.

264
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,301
Captain. I'm going out for a bit.

265
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,150
- Did you call the police?
- Yes.

266
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,411
Oh, it's blood! Blood!

267
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,650
Are you hurt? Let's see.
Where? Does it hurt a lot?

268
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,210
I'm not hurting anywhere.
I'm completely fine.

269
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,760
I am fine too.

270
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,640
What is this then?

271
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,660
Whose blood is this?

272
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:24,402
Song Cha-ok and Choi In-ha.
Come out. I'm going to kill you both!

273
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,420
Move over. I'll go.

274
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,049
Are you out of your mind?
He said he'll kill us both!

275
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,543
Where are Song Cha-ok and Choi In-ha?
Where are they!

276
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:41,480
- Song Cha-ok and Choi In-ha!
- Send someone quickly!

277
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,669
- I told you to stay quiet!
- He's holding a knife! A knife!

278
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,990
There's someone suspicious
in the newsroom with a knife.

279
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,620
Hey, you! Stop! Stop right there. Stop!

280
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,100
Yes, this is the MSC newsroom.
Someone is making threats with a weapon.

281
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,203
When will the police get here?

282
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,993
Open the door! Open the door!

283
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,550
Let her go! Let her go!

284
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,970
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Stay still!

285
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,240
- Dal-Po, are you okay? Were you hurt?
- I'm fine.

286
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,160
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

287
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,120
What's this? Blood?

288
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,650
Did you get hurt?

289
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,610
Yes, my arm.

290
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:16,880
Dal-Po! Dal-Po! Dal-Po! Dal-Po!

291
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,605
Where's Ki Ha-myung?

292
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,250
He's in surgery. His ligament was torn.
And he lost a lot of blood.

293
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,168
What the heck is all this? Who is
that terrorist? Someone you know?

294
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,160
I don't know him.
I've never seen him before.

295
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,339
He targeted both Ki Ha-myung
and Choi In-ha?

296
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,000
No, he asked for Ms Song as well.

297
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,208
- Ms Song, maybe you know him?
- No, I've never seen him either.

298
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,261
Ki Ha-myung, Choi In-ha, and Song Cha-ok.

299
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,930
Why them?

300
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,953
What could be the common grudge held
against all three?

301
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,146
- Any guesses?
- No, nothing.

302
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,640
Was it Ki Ha-myung?

303
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,981
Not too long ago,
he brought a camera with him

304
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,491
and brought up something
that happened 14 years ago.

305
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,580
Your daughter, Ms Song.
Choi In-ha, I mean.

306
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,348
Now that I think about it,
this is a first.

307
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,170
The first time, refusing my requests.

308
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,840
Oh, good to see you.

309
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,446
We were on our way to your company
to report the incident.

310
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,305
- Can we interview you?
- Oh, we were on our way to you.

311
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,810
Are you going to do the interview?

312
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,109
Depends on how you behave.

313
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,900
Never mind. Let's go find someone else.

314
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,380
Okay, okay. I will do it.

315
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,540
Ki Ha-myung, Choi In-ha,
and even Ms Song.

316
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,170
They were too aggressive lately.
Looks like it's fighting back.

317
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,409
Aggressive?
Shouldn't that be normal for a reporter?

318
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,680
You're being a nitpicker again.

319
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,330
If there's a weapon being wielded,
it's not normal. They pushed too hard.

320
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:16,045
- I don't know. I don't agree.
- Me neither.

321
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,600
If there's a terror, there must be
something really important to uncover.

322
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,186
Reporters need to be louder
in moments like these.

323
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:31,350
Hey. If you guys act this way,
I'm not giving you an interview.

324
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,349
I don't need your interview.
Let's go Jae-hwan.

325
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,740
Okay.

326
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,571
She must really dislike me.

327
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,930
I'm starting to dislike you too.

328
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,973
They don't even greet me properly.

329
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,020
Sir!

330
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,552
Do you know the three victims?

331
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,490
No. I don't know them well.

332
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,637
Do you hear something?

333
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,860
No, I can't hear anything.

334
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:25,268
Sir, we can't hear what you're saying
a little louder.

335
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,959
So why? Why did you attack those people?

336
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,160
Because of my father's grudge.

337
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:42,950
To avenge your father's grudge?
What, exactly, are you referring to?

338
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,605
- He said it was to avenge his father.
- His father?

339
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,198
Who is his father?

340
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,060
Do you remember that man?

341
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:57,000
That man who fired the bus driver
for extortion of 60 cents.

342
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,914
What? The son of that owner?

343
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,980
This is shocking.

344
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,020
I could have been a victim of this too.

345
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:13,061
A man in his 20s entered
the YGN broadcast studios.

346
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,620
As he yells at a specific reporter,

347
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,654
he threatened the reporters with
a weapon and ran away after 3 minutes.

348
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,040
At MSC, which is just 500 meters away
from YGN,

349
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,590
he attacked the reporters with a weapon
before he was arrested.

350
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,020
The man who caused these
is Mr Cho, a 21 year old.

351
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,010
Last year in December, MSC's
Reporter Song reported on a story

352
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,476
featuring a man who owned
a bus company. He is the son of that man.

353
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,094
Song, Ki, Choi those reporters

354
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,886
they said to the nation that
my father was a con artist.

355
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,403
I wanted to tell them
to watch their mouth.

356
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,036
Police are now investigating charges
of attempted murder against Cho.

357
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,150
YGN's Reporter Ki Ha-myung is currently
receiving treatment in the hospital.

358
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,813
But he has no life-threatening injuries.

359
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,028
YGN News, I'm Yoon Yu-Rae.

360
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:21,500
I cultivated and grew this business
for over 20 years.

361
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,151
All I have left to do
is just reap the fruits.

362
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,805
But the pests keep buzzing around
and I'm getting really annoyed!

363
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,675
In-ha.

364
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,600
Dal-Po, are you okay? How's your arm?

365
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,130
It's okay. It's nothing.

366
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,093
What do you mean nothing? You even
hurt your ligament and needed surgery.

367
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,041
If you were a baseball player,
your career would be over.

368
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,140
I'm going to the Administrative Office.

369
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,251
Dal-Po, when we get out, don't go home.
You're coming with us.

370
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,200
- No, it okay. That's not necessary.
- It is necessary.

371
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,331
The doctor said if you use your arm,
you could make it much worse.

372
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,953
- Stay with us for now.
- Okay.

373
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,310
- Has the culprit been caught?
- Yes.

374
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,270
You remember the bus driver suicide story,
right?

375
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,270
- The bus company owner's son did it.
- What?

376
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,760
So, he came after you, me, and Ms Song?
Even though he knew he'd get caught?

377
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,643
Yes. That was his statement to the police.

378
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,730
By the way, how did you know
he'd come after me?

379
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,636
That day I took you home,
do you remember that motorcycle?

380
00:31:54,188 --> 00:31:55,906
Yeah I remember, that brat.

381
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,432
That motorcycle driver was him.

382
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,492
What is this?
That's so scary? He planned it all, right?

383
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,873
Yes. I think so.

384
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,942
I told Ki Ha-myung to rest at home
until he gets better.

385
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:20,577
Are you saying he did it because of
the interview of the bus company owner?

386
00:32:20,668 --> 00:32:21,923
Isn't this a bit much?

387
00:32:22,014 --> 00:32:23,130
What do you mean?

388
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,410
Last year, I did a report at the airport
on people going away on trips.

389
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,903
A couple that appeared in the frame
behind me sued me.

390
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:33,430
Because of the news, he got caught
having an affair, divorced and got fired.

391
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:36,550
Being a reporter means
having to deal with a lot of grudges.

392
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:38,481
It's something we all go through.

393
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:42,560
But Ki Ha-myung, he had to learn
that lesson too quickly.

394
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,736
But is this really
because of that interview?

395
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,120
If he felt that the report was unfair,
he could have sued us.

396
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,064
Why did he commit this act of terror?

397
00:32:54,401 --> 00:32:58,389
What are you talking about?
Are you saying there's more to it?

398
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:01,771
Yes.

399
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,910
Maybe, this is a warning.

400
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,609
- To watch what we say.
- Watch what we say?

401
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,730
What, exactly, is Ki Ha-myung
working on right now?

402
00:33:17,003 --> 00:33:20,885
He's digging into the connection
between MSC and Chairwoman Park.

403
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,695
I can't hear.

404
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,808
They said something about 'connection'.

405
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,368
Hey, you know what? I think Captain
is interested in you, for real.

406
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,120
What?

407
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,200
No, it's just that during the incident,

408
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,750
he asked you if you were hurt
and made a fuss.

409
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:55,775
I was there too
and he didn't ask about me.

410
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,532
What else could this mean?

411
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,400
What else could it mean?

412
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,654
It means you're so thick that you won't
bleed no matter how much you were poked.

413
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:11,330
- Hey. I'm not joking. I really think.
- Stop!

414
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,945
- No, really...
- Enough!

415
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,818
I will no longer believe those kinds
of assumptions and feelings anymore.

416
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,410
Bring me solid facts.

417
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,160
I won't believe anything before you do.

418
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,480
I really think it's true.

419
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,964
Gosh. Look at them.

420
00:34:31,406 --> 00:34:33,243
She's still acting like a stalker fan.

421
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,924
She's not being a stalker fan,
she's being a diligent reporter.

422
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,082
You're acting suspicious.

423
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,877
How could such a terrible thing...
You must have been scared!

424
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:57,465
Oh, dear. Your face is still not
looking too well.

425
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,572
It was quite a coincidence.

426
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,156
Me, my daughter, and even Ki Ha-myung...

427
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,794
How could it be that the three people
you're interested in got attacked?

428
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,774
I would have believed that it was your
message of "watch what you say."

429
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,862
Ms Song, what are you talking about?

430
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,423
You don't think that I...

431
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,403
I'm really taken aback.

432
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,371
It's such an awful thing to say.
I can hardly bear to say it.

433
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,719
If it's not true, I apologize.

434
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,632
But Ms Song...

435
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,949
Supposedly, imagine that I did make
such threats...

436
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,246
- Excuse me?
- Just supposedly... Supposedly...

437
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,243
If I did...

438
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,111
It means our relationship has been
slightly damaged.

439
00:35:52,912 --> 00:35:54,060
Then...

440
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,638
wouldn't it best to be wary
of each other before it breaks?

441
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,723
You look like you have a lot to ask.

442
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,988
- Is it that obvious?
- Yes.

443
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,400
Ask me. What are you so curious about?

444
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,230
I saw the news about the act of terror.

445
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,092
By any chance...

446
00:36:24,077 --> 00:36:26,060
That's right. I ordered it.

447
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,330
The motive has to be strong
so that they won't question it.

448
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,592
It wasn't hard finding a person
with a grudge against all three of them.

449
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,130
Being a reporter means
you build up grudges.

450
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,892
Was it a warning against them?

451
00:36:45,732 --> 00:36:46,966
That was part of it.

452
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,343
I wanted you to know too.

453
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:03,774
I know you better than anyone
in this world.

454
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:12,352
I know better than anyone when you lie.

455
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:14,782
I know what your eyes and
your voice are like.

456
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:19,060
I also know how disappointed
you are in me.

457
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,141
I feel sad for disappointing you.

458
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,740
How hurt must my kind
and righteous son have been?

459
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,050
Mother...

460
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,230
My son.

461
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,447
Can't we just live like before?

462
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,860
I'll do all the dirty work.

463
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:41,187
You can go on vacations
and do everything you want to.

464
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:44,096
You should only see good and
beautiful things.

465
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,709
Live like that.

466
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:14,840
- We're home.
- Are you home?

467
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,810
Come in. Come and eat.

468
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,910
- Yes, yes.
- Sit.

469
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,070
Wow, it's abalone porridge!

470
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,030
I put lots and made it nice and hot.

471
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,390
A knife was put into your body.

472
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:31,010
Your body must be in great shock.

473
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,042
Hurry and eat.

474
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,558
Bon appetit.

475
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,097
- Have it with kimchi.
- Do you want kimchi?

476
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,561
Would you like some kimchi?

477
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,440
You are always one step behind.

478
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,230
Do you want me to do it for you?

479
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,340
Okay.

480
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,600
If you make a mistake, you'll see blood.

481
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,426
I know. Sit down.

482
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:38,090
In horror movies, don't you think
scenes with razors are scary?

483
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,720
Especially when you shave parts like this

484
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,412
if I were to sneeze, the blood from
your throat would splash!

485
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:45,980
Hey!

486
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,617
Don't move. You'll really bleed.

487
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,510
Okay.

488
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,967
Why, those little brats...

489
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,003
I just don't know!

490
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,394
Leave it, Dad. You'll hurt your back.

491
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:03,096
Dad, I had a really strange dream
last night.

492
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,970
What dream was that?

493
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:09,492
- It was such nonsense.
- Tell me.

494
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,660
All dreams are weird.

495
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,910
Well

496
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:19,745
I dreamed that Dal-Po asked me
if he could date In-ha.

497
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,190
You rotten little!

498
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:24,630
Dreaming a total ridiculous
dream like that!

499
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,615
I told you. It was a strange dream.

500
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:34,061
Hey, you! There are strange dreams,
but there is a certain limit!

501
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:38,944
Dal-Po is my son and
In-ha is your daughter.

502
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:44,639
How dare you dream a dream like that?

503
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,453
I know.

504
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,210
It really doesn't make sense.

505
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,421
I don't think it makes any sense either.

506
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,530
Hurry with the Chairwoman Park story
we talked about.

507
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,193
We'll expose the text messages too.

508
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,301
Have it ready for air by today
or tomorrow.

509
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:08,416
Ms Song, I want to do that too,
but the Director will not permit it.

510
00:42:08,507 --> 00:42:10,378
I don't need his permission.
I'll make it happen.

511
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:16,289
I'll submit another item in my name and
change it later to the Chairwoman's story.

512
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,435
What?

513
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,220
- Ms Song, are you crazy?
- I'm not crazy. Chairwoman Park is.

514
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,380
The attack was ordered by her.

515
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,990
It was a warning message from her.

516
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,010
What? Are you serious?

517
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:31,332
If we don't report this quickly,
next time it won't be just a warning.

518
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,383
No, if we report it, it'll be a problem.

519
00:42:33,474 --> 00:42:35,669
Once we report it,
she won't stop with just a warning.

520
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,130
When one person knows,
you keep that person quiet.

521
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,600
When two people know, you keep two quiet.

522
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:45,163
But when 1000 or 10,000 people know,
how do you keep them quiet?

523
00:42:46,384 --> 00:42:48,415
In the end, the world
will have to acknowledge it.

524
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,830
Wow!

525
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,088
Was she always like that?

526
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,410
Human Resources Announcement

527
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:03,011
Captain usually covers Congress or Legal,
why is he being transferred to Culture?

528
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,130
He must have done something wrong.

529
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,952
What about Ms Song?
She's in the Review Department.

530
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,057
What? Is there something to see?

531
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:17,310
- No.
- What? What is it?

532
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,294
What is this? Why am I suddenly
moved to the Culture department?

533
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,072
Am I no longer a Captain?

534
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,150
Ms Song.

535
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,989
You're in the Review Department.

536
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,060
Is this...

537
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,590
a warning from Chairwoman Park too?

538
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,147
So, she's taken away my microphone.

539
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,152
And she'll keep my mouth shut?

540
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,578
Captain, what's that transfer about?
Why, so suddenly?

541
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,120
Because of you...

542
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,648
the transfer happened.

543
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:18,554
Because of me? Is it because...

544
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,130
Captain?

545
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,130
Is it because of the item that I proposed?

546
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:27,681
Yes! I told the Ms Song and she told me
to work on it, and now this happened.

547
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:31,130
- Ms Song told you to work on it?
- That's right.

548
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,729
I couldn't believe it either,
but she did.

549
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,341
But we got stopped by Chairwoman Park.

550
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,997
This transfer is also her work.

551
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:44,963
- Chairwoman Park? Bum-jo's mother?
- Yes.

552
00:44:45,618 --> 00:44:49,310
Ms Song says that the attack
was also her doing.

553
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,916
It was a warning telling us
to keep our mouths shut.

554
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,530
Really? Do you have evidence?

555
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,000
It was just a gut feeling.

556
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,480
I didn't fully believe it, but now that
things turned out this way, I believe it.

557
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,578
You be careful too.

558
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,408
- I'm sorry, Captain.
- It's okay.

559
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,915
Thanks to you, I was going to be
a real reporter for once.

560
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,266
It made me think about
what a reporter is.

561
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,292
I couldn't do it, but you have be
a true reporter until the end.

562
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:19,830
Ms Song

563
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:22,140
- Hello?
- I need to see you.

564
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,576
Yes, Ms Song.

565
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,987
I lack so much as a person.

566
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:39,301
That there was a moment when you were
determined to be a whistle blower

567
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,260
that you were once a reporter

568
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,456
and that you may be regretting
the decision you made 14 years ago.

569
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,596
Naively, I want to believe in that.

570
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,562
I'm here, Ms Song.

571
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,518
You saw the personnel appointments?

572
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:56,803
I'm no longer a Ms Song or a reporter.

573
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:00,582
How do you like your coffee?

574
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,055
What?

575
00:46:03,325 --> 00:46:05,831
Oh, two sugars and two creams.

576
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,369
Just like your dad.

577
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:10,005
So tacky.

578
00:46:11,654 --> 00:46:13,970
I heard from Captain.

579
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:17,342
That you gave the green light
for my story idea.

580
00:46:17,788 --> 00:46:18,729
Yes.

581
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,044
But now it's been blocked.

582
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:25,925
Regrettably.

583
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:33,459
Is that why you were demoted?

584
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,685
Probably.

585
00:46:35,686 --> 00:46:36,820
So...

586
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,823
give this back to Reporter Ki Ha-myung.

587
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,150
- This is...
- Cell phone and the message content.

588
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,627
I got them from Ki Ha-myung.

589
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,486
Please return it all to him.

590
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:58,711
In return, we say the whistle-blower...

591
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:06,160
was me and not you.

592
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:08,506
Mom!

593
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:16,699
Ms Song really told you
to give these back to me?

594
00:47:17,932 --> 00:47:19,529
Yes.

595
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:23,970
But she asked that we say the
whistle-blowing was done by her.

596
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,413
She wanted to report the story herself,

597
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:31,410
but can't since her microphone
was taken away.

598
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,869
She has so much to say,
but can't go on air anymore.

599
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,152
She is quite upset.

600
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:44,278
So, she said she'll find another way
to tell the world.

601
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:47,540
Another way?

602
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,882
What do you mean by another way?

603
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:51,206
Use the government authority.

604
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:55,261
The case from 14 years ago
doesn't hold much power.

605
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:59,098
Even if we tell the world, its statute of
limitation expired long ago.

606
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,199
Chairwoman Park won't get affected by it.

607
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:08,080
So I need a current case,
and help from your friend.

608
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:09,587
My friend?

609
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,915
Go tell this to your friend Ahn Chan Soo.

610
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:16,812
That he should file
a defamation suit against me.

611
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,684
Mom!

612
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,034
Oh, Dal-Po!

613
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,970
Is your arm okay? I was quite worried.

614
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:35,875
It doesn't look like you were.

615
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,641
What's up? I don't really have
case tips to share.

616
00:48:39,732 --> 00:48:43,258
I'm not here for the cases.
I came here to ask you for a favor.

617
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,375
A favor?

618
00:48:45,466 --> 00:48:47,783
Of course I'll do whatever you ask.
What is it?

619
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,810
Something I hope you'd do.

620
00:48:51,144 --> 00:48:53,842
No, actually, something I need you to do.

621
00:48:58,830 --> 00:48:59,863
Defamation?

622
00:48:59,954 --> 00:49:01,118
What are you talking about?

623
00:49:01,209 --> 00:49:05,119
Labeling him as the one responsible
for the factory fire case.

624
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:07,744
If Chan Soo files a defamation suit
for that

625
00:49:08,232 --> 00:49:11,541
my mom will be arraigned and investigated
as the principal offender.

626
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,270
- Sir!
- Oh, Ahn Chan-soo.

627
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,640
What brings you here?
Did you get fired from the precinct post?

628
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:23,490
No way! My department can't function
without me.

629
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:27,850
You should come by.
I'll prepare a warm seat for you.

630
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:30,746
No need. But seriously, why are you here?

631
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,582
Some business at the Civil Affairs office.

632
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,299
Civil Affairs? What for?

633
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,901
To file a suit.

634
00:49:37,992 --> 00:49:38,838
A suit?

635
00:49:39,383 --> 00:49:42,977
I'm filing a defamation suit
against Reporter Song Cha-ok.

636
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:45,580
Right then...

637
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,648
mom will divulge everything
to the police.

638
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,811
The police will then further investigate
and the reporters will cover the story.

639
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,535
That's how she'll tell the world.

640
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,727
Starting from your dad's case
14 years ago,

641
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,420
to connections to Chairwoman Park.

642
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,630
Then my mom and Chairwoman Park
will be the joint principal offenders.

643
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:08,840
From that point...

644
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,391
From that point, you guys keep your
eyes open and report the story as is.

645
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:17,510
Report what the police, the prosecutors,
and I say, and what Chairwoman Park says.

646
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:20,310
Don't miss a single beat
and report everything.

647
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:22,150
No matter what manipulation is at play.

648
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,077
Do not get swamped nor swayed.

649
00:50:24,361 --> 00:50:25,348
Do it right.

650
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,124
You got it?

651
00:50:29,815 --> 00:50:31,539
Okay, I will.

652
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,404
Chairwoman Park will use
money or connections

653
00:50:34,495 --> 00:50:37,150
to get out of this every chance she gets.

654
00:50:37,445 --> 00:50:40,960
The subpoena, indictment, hearing...
Make sure she can't excuse herself.

655
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,159
You guys keep a close watch.

656
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,071
But you...

657
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:50,715
This will be the end for you.
Maybe you will...

658
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:56,923
You will lose everything.
You might have to give up everything.

659
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:03,866
I don't value them that much.

660
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:06,998
All this time...

661
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:10,226
I was feeling a bit tired.

662
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:13,260
I was exhausted.

663
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,547
Mom.

664
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:21,542
Mom.

665
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:31,820
Don't cry.

666
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:35,528
If you're like this...

667
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:41,009
I won't feel comfortable entrusting you
with this work.

668
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,946
Was it this hard for you too?

669
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:11,431
Watching your brother, was it this hard?

670
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:22,512
How did you bear the pain?

671
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,009
How...

672
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:28,107
How did you manage so well?

673
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,587
It was difficult and it's still difficult.

674
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,089
I can't even say
I endured it in past tense.

675
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:44,721
I'm sorry, Dal-Po.

676
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,112
It's right for my mom to come
to this decision...

677
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:53,621
My mom...

678
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:58,502
I feel she chose such a difficult path...

679
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,350
I know.

680
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:09,590
I know.

681
00:53:31,161 --> 00:53:33,751
She made a difficult decision.

682
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:37,484
Does that mean everything
will be exposed?

683
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,957
Our dad's case and Chan-soo's story...

684
00:53:40,447 --> 00:53:41,604
She will tell the truth herself?

685
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:42,850
Yeah.

686
00:53:48,644 --> 00:53:51,379
Then why the long face?
Shouldn't you be happy?

687
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:54,762
I'm sorry, Jae-myung.

688
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:58,068
Honestly, I'm not all that happy.

689
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:00,031
Why not?

690
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,630
What In-ha is going through now...

691
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:06,123
is exactly what I went through
when I reported your story.

692
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,084
It's hard for me to see her that way
and makes me think of you too.

693
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,278
You're at it again. Accusing yourself.

694
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:20,150
I'm only saying this once.

695
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,257
Listen carefully.

696
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:26,137
The day I was supposed to do
the interview with Song Cha-ok,

697
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:28,431
I was planning to end everything.

698
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,485
Song Cha-ok and myself included.

699
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:33,666
When I saw you then...

700
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:36,060
I wanted to live.

701
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,218
How you'd get revenge on Song Cha-ok,

702
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,930
I wanted to witness it.

703
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,314
You saved my life.

704
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,707
Jae-myung.

705
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:51,710
Subpoena

706
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:54,537
Because you reported me
and didn't hide me...

707
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:00,059
you were able to boldly ask questions
to Ms Song and Chairwoman Park.

708
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:03,987
If you had chosen to do differently...

709
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,969
you probably wouldn't have had
the chance to ask.

710
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,418
And a day like today
wouldn't have existed.

711
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:11,538
You understand what I'm saying, right?

712
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:29,930
- Ma'am! Ma'am!
- You startled me.

713
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:31,238
Miss Goo, knock next time.

714
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,904
I apologize. It's an emergency.

715
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,621
Have you heard the news?

716
00:55:35,712 --> 00:55:37,730
Ms Song is being sued for defamation.

717
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:39,244
She's giving her testimony to the police.

718
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,040
Defamation lawsuit?

719
00:55:41,455 --> 00:55:43,250
What for? Who?

720
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:45,583
It's that person, Officer Ahn.

721
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,900
What do we do if Ms Song talks
about you to the police?

722
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,133
She probably will.

723
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,096
She wanted to get sued
so that she could talk.

724
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:58,294
- What? Deliberately?
- Yes.

725
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,417
I prevented her from talking.

726
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,792
She needed an outlet to talk.

727
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,336
It's fine. Let her talk.

728
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,295
That defamation lawsuit...

729
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:11,650
It will end with a small fine,
if it even gets that far.

730
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,773
But ma'am, if the reporters catch on...

731
00:56:14,864 --> 00:56:15,924
So what?

732
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:19,715
Will they even care about it?

733
00:56:19,806 --> 00:56:21,079
Tell Director Yeon to come see me.

734
00:56:25,713 --> 00:56:28,001
Dedicated to serving the nation

735
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,960
Seoul Han River Police Station

736
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:52,030
- Hey, isn't that Ms Song Cha-ok?
- Where?

737
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:55,580
That's her.
I heard she got sued for defamation.

738
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,160
She must be here for questioning.

739
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,760
Are you here as the defendant?

740
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,135
Are you being framed?

741
00:57:02,226 --> 00:57:04,336
- Any comments?
- Are you being framed?

742
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,047
Any comments?

743
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:10,918
Are you here because Officer Ahn
has sued you for defamation?

744
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:13,481
Yes, that's right.

745
00:57:13,572 --> 00:57:14,847
Do you admit to defamation?

746
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,860
That will be revealed
during the investigation.

747
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,280
How are you feeling right now?

748
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,602
Would anyone feel good after being sued?

749
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:28,126
If you're a reporter, don't ask obvious
questions, but ask more unique questions.

750
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,513
Ok. I'm sorry.

751
00:57:34,528 --> 00:57:36,310
The interrogation will take
two to three hours.

752
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:41,012
I'll come back afterward and until then,
please have better questions prepared.

753
00:57:49,248 --> 00:57:52,017
- Wow. She's tough.
- Scary.

754
00:57:52,108 --> 00:57:53,639
I can see lasers coming out of her eyes.

755
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:55,080
So charismatic!

756
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:58,536
I admit that. I have to admit it.

757
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,150
Are you going into the interrogation?

758
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,862
When you're done, I'll come
looking for you with questions.

759
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:28,589
I don't know what a reporter is.

760
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,745
Once I know what a reporter is,
I'll come and find you.

761
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,950
Not as a street mutt, but as a wolf.

762
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:38,679
Then, I'll bark at you for real.

763
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,965
Ki Ha-myung?

764
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:51,378
Now, have you figured out
what a reporter is?

765
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:59,263
Yes, I think I've figured out
the hard parts.

766
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:01,580
Good.

767
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:03,804
Then come...

768
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,547
and bark at me for real.

769
00:59:09,328 --> 00:59:10,839
I'll answer all your questions.

770
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:19,170
Yes. I will.
