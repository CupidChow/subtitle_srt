1
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:11,767
Pinocchio

2
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,167
Why do you think he made
such a reckless decision?

3
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:40,402
-Was he up for a promotion?
-My father would never do that!

4
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:41,901
I'm positive that it was him.

5
00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:44,502
I have Pinocchio Syndrome,
so I can't ever lie!

6
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:45,802
Pinky promise.

7
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,300
You're not lying, right?

8
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:48,467
Ha-myung...

9
00:00:48,534 --> 00:00:50,001
Let's go see your dad.

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,567
Why are you staring at me like that?
Because I'm pretty?

11
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:56,401
That's right. Because you're pretty.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,467
There are many times when we realized
just how small this world truly is.

13
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,750
I'm sure there’s been a time

14
00:01:02,816 --> 00:01:05,585
when you meet a perfect stranger
and come to realize their fate

15
00:01:06,122 --> 00:01:07,282
is tangled with yours.

16
00:01:07,354 --> 00:01:08,474
And Choi In-ha.

17
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:11,708
-You like him, don't you?
-Not at all.

18
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:13,168
-Mom! There's my mom!
-A reward

19
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:15,734
is given out to those
who call in reports of where he is.

20
00:01:15,798 --> 00:01:17,308
That's my mom.

21
00:01:20,197 --> 00:01:21,157
Uncle.

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,720
Whether the fate be good or evil,
it's strange how it intertwines.

23
00:01:26,474 --> 00:01:29,794
We usually call this a fate...

24
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:33,001
...but there's a mathematical
explanation for it.

25
00:01:35,216 --> 00:01:39,863
It's a rule that states everyone
is related to each other in six steps.

26
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:43,799
According to this rule,
you and I are somehow

27
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:46,465
related to each other
within six connections.

28
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:47,554
Isn't it amazing?

29
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:51,025
This phenomenon was named
after this person.

30
00:01:51,114 --> 00:01:53,633
Just what is the name of this actor?

31
00:01:57,213 --> 00:01:59,213
You know, that person...

32
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:03,412
Since it's the last preliminary question,
it might be a bit difficult.

33
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:05,066
I’ll give you 5 seconds.

34
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:06,677
Five seconds starts now!

35
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:14,104
The answer is Kevin Bacon.

36
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:16,992
Kevin Bacon.

37
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:19,524
That’s correct!

38
00:02:23,432 --> 00:02:24,912
That’s right. It was him.

39
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:34,915
Five years ago,

40
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:36,959
after experiencing that incident,

41
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,109
I made up my mind.

42
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:39,902
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

43
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,830
Ha-myung.

44
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:43,680
Let’s go see your dad.

45
00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:47,693
You’re not lying, are you?

46
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:54,993
Let’s not go near the TV station ever.

47
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:57,678
Let’s never associate or speak with those

48
00:02:57,769 --> 00:02:58,673
from the TV station.

49
00:02:58,764 --> 00:03:00,764
Mr Chan-soo comes up to the stage.

50
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,889
My determination was so firm
and clear that I believed

51
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,575
I could never be persuaded.

52
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:08,136
Then now we’ll begin the second
round of the competition

53
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:11,178
between the top and the bottom student
of the school.

54
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:15,634
The reason why I broke that determination
so vainly and decided to stand here

55
00:03:18,494 --> 00:03:20,684
is because of the secret
that I want to keep

56
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:23,014
more than that determination.

57
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:28,841
Episode 2 - The Ugly Duckling

58
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:31,284
Father, I’m going to school.

59
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,810
-Grandfather, I’m going to school.
-Alright.

60
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:35,444
Dal-Po...

61
00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:37,752
...take care of you niece.

62
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,738
And In-ha, you have to
listen to your uncle.

63
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:41,814
Yes.

64
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:44,729
Grandfather.

65
00:03:44,795 --> 00:03:47,035
Grandpa. Grandpa.

66
00:03:47,197 --> 00:03:48,946
I don’t have money.

67
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:51,227
Don’t be like that and buy me a bicycle.

68
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:52,889
If you don’t, I’m going to run away.

69
00:03:52,955 --> 00:03:54,687
This girl.

70
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:58,208
Your uncle gives you a ride
on his bicycle all the time.

71
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:00,462
Why should I buy another bicycle?

72
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:02,365
I mean, everyday, uncle...

73
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:08,574
I feel bad because
he always gives me a ride.

74
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:12,358
I’m fine, my niece.

75
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:13,468
Let’s go.

76
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:21,644
-We’ll be back.
-We’ll be back.

77
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,055
Oh my.

78
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,172
Bye.

79
00:04:26,426 --> 00:04:27,416
Alright.

80
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:31,539
Come home right after school.

81
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:33,971
Alright.

82
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,313
That’s enough. You can stop.

83
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:49,218
Seriously.

84
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:56,694
Ah, In-ha.

85
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,723
You should hurry up.

86
00:05:58,814 --> 00:06:01,330
They were late everyday because of you.

87
00:06:01,421 --> 00:06:02,441
I'm...

88
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,099
...sorry.

89
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:11,155
What? You asked me to let you off
with your own mouth.

90
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,226
You...

91
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,293
...don’t like giving me a ride either.

92
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:15,788
Of course.

93
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:19,323
Do you really hate me that much?

94
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:20,729
Of course.

95
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,705
Let me ask.

96
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,754
Why do you hate me?

97
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,830
Am I your sworn enemy or something?

98
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,360
It sure is my mom.

99
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,755
She seems to loose weight.

100
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:40,232
Isn’t my mom pretty?

101
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:45,032
Of course, you sworn enemy.

102
00:06:56,514 --> 00:06:57,734
Ah, this girl seriously...

103
00:06:57,963 --> 00:07:00,123
Girl, you should come early.

104
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:08,852
Did that All-zero abandon
you again today?

105
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:10,034
Yeah.

106
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,280
If I just had a bike,
I wouldn’t want anything else.

107
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:14,873
I feel like I’m gonna die from running
a marathon every morning.

108
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:17,119
Should I bring you a bike
that I have at home?

109
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,288
There is a bike we don’t use.

110
00:07:20,895 --> 00:07:21,895
Really? Really?

111
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:23,627
Yeah.

112
00:07:23,863 --> 00:07:25,312
But the style is kind of old.

113
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,532
I don’t care about the style.
As long as it runs.

114
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:37,741
What do you think?

115
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:38,894
Can you ride it?

116
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,800
It’s a little...

117
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:41,896
No. It’s totally old, right?

118
00:07:41,987 --> 00:07:44,208
It’s alright. I just need to reform it.

119
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:45,371
Thanks.

120
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,651
Do you want to try it?

121
00:07:50,977 --> 00:07:51,997
Yeah.

122
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,521
It feels great.

123
00:07:56,805 --> 00:07:58,825
Hey. Thanks a lot.

124
00:08:05,905 --> 00:08:06,925
Choi Dal-Po.

125
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:09,188
You’re dead.

126
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:16,354
Hey, Blunt-witch!

127
00:08:18,495 --> 00:08:19,385
This is your...

128
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:30,704
Serves you right, Choi Dal-Po!

129
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:41,703
It’s your aptitude test
and your career plan form.

130
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:43,146
You have to fill it out by next week.

131
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:47,416
Oh, my. What jerk sprayed
the career plan form with muddy water?

132
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:50,641
A half-wit girl muddied it up
all by herself.

133
00:08:51,273 --> 00:08:52,204
Be quiet.

134
00:08:52,894 --> 00:08:56,853
Hey. Her recommended career
is a lawyer, prosecutor and a judge.

135
00:08:56,944 --> 00:08:58,693
They completely suits you.

136
00:08:58,784 --> 00:08:59,641
A lawyer?

137
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:03,007
How can a Blunt-witch who can’t
even lie become a lawyer?

138
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:04,491
I sure can.

139
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:06,323
What does it have to do
with being a lawyer?

140
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:07,742
Of course it has a big correlation.

141
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:11,699
Just think about a Pinocchio like you,
defending a murderer.

142
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:12,946
That’s...

143
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:17,675
The murder evidence of defendant
is all circumstantial.

144
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:19,993
There isn’t even single direct evidence.

145
00:09:20,084 --> 00:09:22,014
If you think that he could be innocent

146
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:25,855
it’s the law to give the benefit
of the doubt to the defendant.

147
00:09:26,378 --> 00:09:27,248
But...

148
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:29,103
during the interview with me,

149
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,969
the defendant gave a statement that he
murdered the victim and he has no remorse.

150
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:35,474
So I, Choi In-ha,

151
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:40,082
with the lawyer’s conscience on
the line contend that he is guilty.

152
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:50,640
I'll kill you!

153
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:55,215
I’ll kill the bastard that put
the lawyer’s badge on you too!

154
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,153
A lawyer like you

155
00:10:00,244 --> 00:10:03,636
would tell the truth instead of taking
the defendant’s side then get stabbed.

156
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:06,591
Instead of that, how about an actress?

157
00:10:07,214 --> 00:10:10,451
Your look would be such a waste
for you to become a lawyer.

158
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:13,046
Do you think so?

159
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:15,466
They said my fortune was
the same as Song Hye-gyo’s.

160
00:10:16,437 --> 00:10:17,455
Actress?

161
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:18,841
How would a girl who can’t lie

162
00:10:18,907 --> 00:10:21,262
-become an actress?
-Of course she can’t.

163
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:23,850
She wouldn’t even be able to do
the easiest act like a corpse.

164
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,299
Why can’t I act like a corpse?

165
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,766
Okay. Good emotion.

166
00:10:34,832 --> 00:10:37,872
Soft wind is blowing.

167
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:40,172
Camera.

168
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:42,178
Zoom in.

169
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:51,216
Assistant.

170
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:56,336
How many times is this?

171
00:10:56,427 --> 00:10:59,462
-You really can’t control your hiccups?
-You know,

172
00:10:59,553 --> 00:11:02,303
that I’m basically a Pinocchio,
and it's obvious when I lied.

173
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:04,725
I’m finely alive,
so when trying to act dead

174
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:06,422
I have no choice but to hiccup.

175
00:11:06,513 --> 00:11:07,763
Isn’t there any stand-in? Huh?

176
00:11:07,854 --> 00:11:08,823
Any stand-in?

177
00:11:08,914 --> 00:11:11,302
It’s already take 21.

178
00:11:11,393 --> 00:11:13,192
At this rate, Soo-young’s
arms will fall off.

179
00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:14,783
Director.

180
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,856
The special effects are great these days.

181
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:20,228
Can’t you just erase the hiccup
with graphics?

182
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,435
Hey! I’ll just be the stand-in!

183
00:11:24,526 --> 00:11:25,868
Somebody get me a wig!

184
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,809
Give me a wig!

185
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:31,030
Actress

186
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:34,016
So, consider to save many people
and give up on becoming actress.

187
00:11:34,107 --> 00:11:37,445
The possibility is lower than Bill Gates
using a private lender.

188
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:41,259
Dal-Po, I think you have a talent
to drive people out with your words.

189
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:42,494
Don’t worry.

190
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,779
When I read the newspaper,

191
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:46,337
our country has more than 20,000 jobs.

192
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,814
Wouldn’t there be a place
for you to work at?

193
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,025
Of course not.

194
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:53,846
People with Pinocchio Syndrome have
less than six percent chance to get a job.

195
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:54,737
Don’t listen to him.

196
00:11:54,803 --> 00:11:57,323
That’s coming from people who have
no career path to begin with.

197
00:11:58,711 --> 00:12:00,274
I don’t have a career path either.

198
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,764
I’m even jealous of typhoons these days.

199
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,365
Paths of those are already set.

200
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:09,438
Look at you all.

201
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:15,632
I told you all to do self-study
but you guys are goofing around.

202
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,903
-Are you all seated?
-Yes.

203
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:23,376
You all know that program called
The Quiz Show Challenge, right?

204
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,987
-Yes.
-You only good at answering.

205
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:30,362
We need to select our school’s
representative to send there.

206
00:12:30,775 --> 00:12:31,785
Really?

207
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,809
What a hit!

208
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,250
I heard they give you 500 dollars
for just appearing on the show.

209
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:37,646
500 dollars is nothing.

210
00:12:37,737 --> 00:12:40,456
You'll get 30,000 dollars if you win!

211
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:42,487
You could buy a boat with that money.

212
00:12:43,164 --> 00:12:45,856
We’re going to have a general
knowledge quiz tomorrow

213
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:47,841
and the first place
will be our representative.

214
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:48,865
No objections?

215
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:52,898
Let’s just do rock, paper, scissor.

216
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:54,680
Let’s just draw lots.

217
00:12:54,771 --> 00:12:56,088
Who said draw lots?

218
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,185
Who is it? Who is it?

219
00:12:58,382 --> 00:13:00,851
You can choose your bride that way later.

220
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:02,022
You got it?

221
00:13:02,537 --> 00:13:04,452
The person is going to be on TV.

222
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,052
A national TV at that.

223
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,087
Then I’ll consider that
there are no objections.

224
00:13:09,153 --> 00:13:10,292
That's it.

225
00:13:10,358 --> 00:13:12,368
Thank you.

226
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:14,732
There’s no need to take the quiz.

227
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:18,957
Chan-soo already won anyway.

228
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:22,282
What? But we have to wait and see.

229
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,186
Common knowledge isn’t about grades.

230
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:34,459
What did you want to tell me?

231
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:37,606
Try this.

232
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:38,912
If you push this...

233
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:40,273
the sound comes out.

234
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:44,981
It sounds nice.

235
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,660
Thanks.

236
00:13:48,484 --> 00:13:50,053
In-ha...

237
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:51,798
I have something to tell you.

238
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:56,602
-What is it?
-If I go on the quiz show...

239
00:13:59,242 --> 00:14:01,432
I’m going to confess
that I like you on the show.

240
00:14:02,031 --> 00:14:04,788
-What?
-When you listen to it, answer me.

241
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,459
-Chan-soo. I...
-Not now.

242
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:08,789
Don't answer now.

243
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,870
I haven’t confessed yet.
When I confess...

244
00:14:11,613 --> 00:14:12,664
...answer me then.

245
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:14,447
Okay? See you.

246
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:24,159
Mom.

247
00:14:24,392 --> 00:14:26,982
Today I received a confession
for the first time.

248
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:28,678
But it’s strange.

249
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:29,994
I feel weird.

250
00:14:30,256 --> 00:14:32,106
I feel like I have indigestion.

251
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:36,693
I thought I’d be nervous and anxious
when I receive confession

252
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:39,885
but I feel I've become
a pine tree on Namsan.

253
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:42,156
I don’t feel anything

254
00:14:42,222 --> 00:14:43,750
as if I’ve put on armor.

255
00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:50,863
-You have something bothering you again?
-Yeah.

256
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,403
If I do this, the blood gathers
in my head and I can think well.

257
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:57,334
I’m doing this for a scientific reason
so don’t look at me like that.

258
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:59,882
I’ve see this for five years
and I’m still shocked.

259
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,209
-Where does your embarrassing act ends?
-That thing!

260
00:15:11,064 --> 00:15:13,128
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

261
00:15:18,177 --> 00:15:20,653
-Please sign the receipt.
-Oh, alright.

262
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,309
Suspect Wanted

263
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:39,890
Sir, what date is it today?

264
00:15:41,837 --> 00:15:43,750
It’s September 15th. Why?

265
00:15:47,434 --> 00:15:48,434
I was just asking.

266
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:50,870
I have something to check.

267
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:54,669
It’s scary here.

268
00:15:54,735 --> 00:15:56,544
I think we came on the wrong road.

269
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:58,379
What is that abandoned factory?

270
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:00,904
It’s been two years
since it was burned down

271
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,578
but they still haven’t demolished it.

272
00:16:02,644 --> 00:16:05,136
-Because of ghost.
-Stop it.

273
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,089
I think there were a lot of people
who died when that factory blew up.

274
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,477
I heard they were all firemen.

275
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:25,892
You have 30 minutes.

276
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:31,330
The test questions selected
from the past The Quiz Show Challenge.

277
00:16:31,396 --> 00:16:35,187
As I’ve said yesterday, the person
with the best score will be chosen

278
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:39,877
and we planned to recommend the person
to represent the school at the show.

279
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:42,769
Ji-hee.

280
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,534
Do you think you’ll see the answer
by looking at my face?

281
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,214
Hurry solve the questions.

282
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:49,058
Ahn Chan-soo

283
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,908
Choi Dal-Po

284
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:08,877
Oh, my. This kid.

285
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,319
His common knowledge is terrible.

286
00:17:12,385 --> 00:17:13,485
That's what I'm saying.

287
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:16,006
How come there isn’t a single
student scored higher than 50?

288
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:18,600
Choi In-ha 92.

289
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:21,072
Its's indeed the one with good
grades has good common knowledge.

290
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:23,726
Ahn Chan-soo 96.

291
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:24,874
My goodness!

292
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:27,035
Do we have to check them all?

293
00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:28,758
Let's just finish it.

294
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:29,782
Hold on.

295
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:32,150
What’s with this kid?

296
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,778
-What’s wrong?
-Why?

297
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:37,447
My God.

298
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:39,424
What’s with this kid?

299
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,830
Perfect score?

300
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:42,817
What? A perfect score?

301
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:44,292
Who is it?

302
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,758
Choi Dal-Po.

303
00:17:48,973 --> 00:17:49,915
Choi Dal-Po?

304
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,753
Choi Dal-Po

305
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,218
Hey, guys!

306
00:17:58,284 --> 00:17:59,736
Did you hear?

307
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:04,913
-The common knowledge quiz result's out.
-Wow, already?

308
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:07,212
-Who got first place?
-Chan-soo? In-ha?

309
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:08,905
The first place is...

310
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:11,916
'All-zero'.

311
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:16,034
-What?
-Why are you saying such a nonsense?

312
00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:20,609
What's wrong?

313
00:18:21,552 --> 00:18:22,766
No one congratulate me?

314
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:23,926
What?

315
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:27,005
Then All-zero will go on the show
as our school’s representative?

316
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:29,807
Does that even make sense?

317
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:41,359
Oppa, I heard All-zero will go
on the show instead of you?

318
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,376
Dal-Po got the first place.

319
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:44,272
What?

320
00:18:44,363 --> 00:18:47,594
How could the last place in the entire
school take first place all of a sudden?

321
00:18:47,797 --> 00:18:49,973
-Does that even make sense?
-Right?

322
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,519
You also think that it
doesn’t make sense, right?

323
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,830
Just in case...

324
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,125
Dal-Po...

325
00:18:56,362 --> 00:18:57,819
You’re right. Cheating...

326
00:18:58,143 --> 00:19:00,438
-He could have cheated.
-Did you hear?

327
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:02,950
They said Dal-Po could have cheated.

328
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:04,069
It’s a secret...

329
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:05,468
They said All-zero cheated.

330
00:19:05,865 --> 00:19:07,878
How bad he must be to be called All-zero.

331
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:09,623
Hey, perhaps...

332
00:19:09,985 --> 00:19:12,403
What if All-zero didn’t cheat...

333
00:19:13,006 --> 00:19:14,478
...but he stole...

334
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,023
He stole the test paper?

335
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,306
This is an accurate news.

336
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:19,997
All-zero stole the test paper.

337
00:19:20,063 --> 00:19:21,423
So he might get expelled.

338
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,227
He really went crazy.

339
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:26,969
Why did he have to even go as far
as steal the test paper?

340
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:29,275
He could have been tempted
by the prize money.

341
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:31,694
You'll get 500 dollars just by getting
on the show.

342
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:33,954
Geez.

343
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,687
How could've he act like nothing's wrong

344
00:19:35,753 --> 00:19:37,635
after he did such a thing?

345
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:39,586
Just look at what he looks.

346
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:41,319
He looks completely like a psychopath.

347
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:47,751
-Look at him.
-He's crazy.

348
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:50,436
-Did you hear?
-What?

349
00:19:50,502 --> 00:19:53,021
-He is a complete psychopath.
-He stole the paper for money.

350
00:19:53,112 --> 00:19:54,931
I heard he was a pickpocket
before adopted.

351
00:19:55,022 --> 00:19:56,618
He's such a dangerous man.

352
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:58,896
I heard his real father
was an ex-convict.

353
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,389
I heard he forced the team to go in.

354
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,471
-Was he up for a promotion?
-Then, he ran away.

355
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:13,490
Say it again.

356
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:14,861
What did you just say?

357
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:17,483
What did I say?

358
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:20,826
-I didn’t say anything.
-If you say something like that again

359
00:20:21,223 --> 00:20:23,391
I’ll punch you in the face ten times then.

360
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:29,162
That must be true.

361
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:31,075
He's a total gangster.

362
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,184
What to do with In-ha.

363
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:33,910
This is a pipe.

364
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:36,262
A pipe blown by surmises.

365
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,794
A pipe blown by jealousies, conjectures.

366
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:43,406
That pipe is so easy to play

367
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:45,356
that anyone can play it.

368
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:49,555
You did steal the test paper.

369
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:51,077
No, I'm not.

370
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,319
'No, I'm not'?

371
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:53,509
You...

372
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:56,321
...don’t even dream
about going on the show.

373
00:20:56,538 --> 00:21:01,505
If you go on this way,
you’ll just humiliate the school.

374
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:13,078
You pathetic kid.

375
00:21:26,402 --> 00:21:29,323
That the blunt monster
with uncounted heads...

376
00:21:29,785 --> 00:21:33,268
The still-discordant
wavering multitude...

377
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:37,181
...can play upon this pipe.

378
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:42,012
This is a line from Shakespeare’s
opening act in “Henry IV” Part 2.

379
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:43,284
So...

380
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:47,664
What is this that’s been
compared to the pipe?

381
00:21:49,951 --> 00:21:52,259
Yes. Ahn Chan-soo just pressed the bell.

382
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,741
If you get this correct,
a new champion will be born.

383
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:56,702
The answer is?

384
00:21:58,975 --> 00:21:59,826
Ru...

385
00:22:00,143 --> 00:22:00,993
Rumor?

386
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:04,907
You just said rumor.

387
00:22:05,944 --> 00:22:08,334
Rumor. It’s correct!

388
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,546
Ahn Chan-soo has become a new champion.

389
00:22:17,214 --> 00:22:18,792
Congratulations.

390
00:22:21,347 --> 00:22:23,463
Our new Champion, Ahn Chan-soo...

391
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,685
Please give us your victory speech.

392
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:29,762
Choi In-ha!

393
00:22:30,576 --> 00:22:32,355
I like you a lot!

394
00:22:37,402 --> 00:22:39,480
That kid. He didn’t say anything
about his teacher.

395
00:22:40,662 --> 00:22:43,458
Go out! Go out!

396
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:46,232
Go out! Go out!

397
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:49,438
Go out!

398
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:51,885
Mom.

399
00:22:52,297 --> 00:22:54,957
I’ve been hiccuping for four days now.

400
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,650
I think it’s a new record.

401
00:22:57,365 --> 00:22:58,794
I've tried to hold my breath.

402
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:03,031
I drank a pitcher of water and tried to
clean the whole house, but it won’t stop.

403
00:23:03,771 --> 00:23:04,969
I feel like I’m dying.

404
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:07,884
I know what to do to make it stop.

405
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:12,453
But I don’t have the courage.

406
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:15,240
What should I do, mom?

407
00:23:15,826 --> 00:23:18,327
There isn’t a person who died
from hiccuping, is there?

408
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:20,309
Geez...

409
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:23,270
How could've he act like nothing's wrong
after he did such a thing?

410
00:23:23,336 --> 00:23:24,510
Just look at what he looks.

411
00:23:24,576 --> 00:23:26,333
-He looks like a psychopath.
-Look at him.

412
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:27,811
He stole the test paper for money.

413
00:23:27,877 --> 00:23:29,618
I heard he was a
pickpocket before adopted.

414
00:23:36,397 --> 00:23:37,243
This won’t do.

415
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:38,984
I have to live first.

416
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:41,959
Letter of Apology

417
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:43,553
At the teachers meeting,

418
00:23:43,644 --> 00:23:46,048
we decided to end it
with you writing a letter of apology.

419
00:23:46,496 --> 00:23:47,924
Even if we make this big,

420
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:50,218
the school’s reputation
will go bad at the most.

421
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:53,667
Why do I have to write
this when I didn’t do it?

422
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:56,763
Why are you insisting
that you didn’t do it?

423
00:23:56,997 --> 00:23:58,996
I didn’t steal the test paper.
It’s not true.

424
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,969
-It’s all just a false rumor.
-Can you prove

425
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,779
that it’s a false rumor?

426
00:24:03,915 --> 00:24:05,005
It’s all just a false rumor!

427
00:24:05,071 --> 00:24:08,952
-Can you prove that it was a false rumor?
-Why we're the one who have to prove that!

428
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,193
Why do I...

429
00:24:12,936 --> 00:24:14,555
have to prove that?

430
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:16,460
Of course you did.

431
00:24:16,526 --> 00:24:18,526
Since you’re the person
directly involved.

432
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:30,337
When I leave this room...

433
00:24:31,195 --> 00:24:34,443
...I’m going to spread a rumor that you
and Ms. Yoon are having an affair...

434
00:24:35,144 --> 00:24:37,750
...and that I saw it with my own eyes.

435
00:24:38,238 --> 00:24:40,793
What? What?!

436
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,947
You're having an affair with me?

437
00:24:44,177 --> 00:24:45,639
What is he talking about?

438
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:47,506
Ms. Yoon, just a moment.

439
00:24:47,824 --> 00:24:49,142
Wait a moment.

440
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:50,574
Dal-Po, you...

441
00:24:51,981 --> 00:24:53,750
Why don’t you try to prove...

442
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:56,396
...that it's not true?

443
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:57,404
-Oh, my God!
-Hey!

444
00:24:57,484 --> 00:24:59,285
Why do I have to...?

445
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:01,428
You’re directly involved with the rumor.

446
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:04,936
If you can’t, you also
should write apology...

447
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:07,208
No. You’ll have to write
a resignation letter.

448
00:25:07,783 --> 00:25:09,494
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Dal-Po!

449
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:10,569
Choi Dal-Po!

450
00:25:10,822 --> 00:25:11,956
Dal-Po!

451
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:13,637
-Choi Dal-Po!
-Seriously... hey!

452
00:25:13,703 --> 00:25:17,022
Did he try to stop me
from getting married or something?

453
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:19,001
What is this?

454
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:20,386
That's...

455
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,151
It’s not like that...

456
00:25:22,242 --> 00:25:23,733
How could we?

457
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,709
Congrats for your first place.

458
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,502
What are you doing right now?

459
00:26:16,593 --> 00:26:17,433
What wrong with her?

460
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:19,386
In-ha, what are you doing?

461
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,363
The hiccups stopped!

462
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:22,715
My clothes.

463
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,956
Choi In-ha, are you crazy?

464
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:27,075
Chan-soo.

465
00:26:27,178 --> 00:26:28,182
I’m sorry.

466
00:26:28,273 --> 00:26:29,997
I can’t accept your confession.

467
00:26:32,668 --> 00:26:33,761
And you guys...

468
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:36,032
You have to apologize to Dal-Po
before you eat the cake.

469
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:38,277
Do you want to get beat up?

470
00:26:38,343 --> 00:26:40,418
Why do we have to apologize to All-zero?

471
00:26:40,484 --> 00:26:43,159
You went around spreading false rumor
without any proof.

472
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:45,337
Is there any proof that
Dal-Po stole the test paper?

473
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:46,424
Proof?

474
00:26:46,663 --> 00:26:49,613
All-zero got a perfect score in a day.

475
00:26:49,725 --> 00:26:51,551
Is there any bigger proof than that?

476
00:26:51,664 --> 00:26:53,866
That’s a speculation, not a proof.

477
00:26:53,978 --> 00:26:56,492
Is it? Then why don’t you
give us a speculation, too?

478
00:26:57,203 --> 00:26:58,949
A speculation of that says

479
00:26:59,015 --> 00:27:02,184
Dal-Po didn’t cheat but got
a perfect score for real.

480
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:04,559
Come on.

481
00:27:06,974 --> 00:27:07,814
Fine.

482
00:27:08,016 --> 00:27:10,191
I’ll bring you proof, not a speculation.

483
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,543
But when I bring you the proof,
you have to apologize to Dal-Po.

484
00:27:14,636 --> 00:27:16,527
And give half of your
prize money to Dal-Po.

485
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,294
Why would he give the
prize money to Dal-Po?

486
00:27:19,135 --> 00:27:20,848
If Dal-Po didn’t steal
the paper for real...

487
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,909
...Dal-Po would’ve gone to the quiz show.

488
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,492
Then that prize money
belongs to Dal-Po too.

489
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,827
I’m being tolerate by saying half.

490
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:29,114
Hey, that’s...

491
00:27:30,928 --> 00:27:31,824
Let’s do that.

492
00:27:32,126 --> 00:27:33,316
I’ll give half.

493
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:36,819
But if you can’t bring the proof...

494
00:27:37,837 --> 00:27:39,035
If I can't?

495
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:43,021
What is it...? You know that thing
Dal-Po says by habit all the time.

496
00:27:44,616 --> 00:27:45,465
No way.

497
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,001
Let me slap you 10 times.

498
00:27:50,642 --> 00:27:51,442
What?

499
00:27:51,508 --> 00:27:52,472
Chan-soo.

500
00:27:52,576 --> 00:27:55,050
-However, she’s a girl.
-Didn’t he say that he likes In-ha?

501
00:27:55,116 --> 00:27:57,085
He got dumped by In-ha

502
00:27:57,151 --> 00:27:59,103
and positively went crazy.

503
00:27:59,956 --> 00:28:01,218
If you’re afraid, never mind.

504
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:03,941
-That jerk...
-Fine.

505
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:05,409
I’ll take that bet.

506
00:28:07,543 --> 00:28:11,322
If I bring the proof, you clearly said
that you’ll share half of your prize.

507
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:12,814
Chan-soo.

508
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:15,626
-Don’t change your words.
-Just you don’t change your words.

509
00:28:15,692 --> 00:28:17,338
If you lose, you'll get slapped 10 times.

510
00:28:17,772 --> 00:28:20,637
I’m not going to go easy on you
just because you’re a girl.

511
00:28:27,555 --> 00:28:28,704
Oh, my.

512
00:28:28,795 --> 00:28:30,795
You’re hiccuping again.

513
00:28:30,955 --> 00:28:33,680
Even you think you’ll
get slapped too, huh?

514
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,676
No. Not at all.

515
00:28:38,361 --> 00:28:39,988
What the...?

516
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,443
What’s wrong with that girl?

517
00:29:07,491 --> 00:29:08,658
What should I do?

518
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,961
Is he really going to slap me 10 times?

519
00:29:13,122 --> 00:29:14,178
I don’t care.

520
00:29:14,537 --> 00:29:15,822
I’ll just get hit.

521
00:29:40,233 --> 00:29:42,947
What is that jerk getting mad at?

522
00:29:51,072 --> 00:29:52,318
Hey, Blunt-witch!

523
00:29:54,772 --> 00:29:55,967
Don’t misunderstand.

524
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:57,787
I didn’t take your side
because I like you.

525
00:29:57,955 --> 00:30:01,347
I had no choice because I felt
like I'm dying from hiccuping.

526
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:04,321
-That’s not what I’m...
-Of course you hope that's not the reason.

527
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:06,437
But that true.
I had no choice but to do it.

528
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:09,185
So, I’m refusing any delusions.

529
00:30:09,863 --> 00:30:11,481
Delusions? What delusions?

530
00:30:12,251 --> 00:30:14,737
You know... Do I have to say that myself?

531
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,711
Fine, I don’t really feel
like hearing it either. Go.

532
00:30:22,285 --> 00:30:25,245
If she has proper eyes, she'd know
that her breaks are broken.

533
00:30:34,836 --> 00:30:37,026
Does that girl have her eyes
on the bottom of her foot?

534
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,465
What’s wrong with this?

535
00:30:56,092 --> 00:30:57,552
What am I going to do...?

536
00:30:57,703 --> 00:30:58,553
Hey!

537
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,656
What should I do?

538
00:31:14,811 --> 00:31:15,755
Choi In-ha!

539
00:31:17,797 --> 00:31:18,932
That girl!

540
00:31:56,324 --> 00:31:58,052
Oh, it’s blood.

541
00:31:58,143 --> 00:31:59,780
Hey, I’m bleeding.

542
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,958
I said I’m bleeding.

543
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,653
Dal... Po...

544
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,433
Hey, Dal-Po!

545
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:11,571
Choi Dal-Po!

546
00:32:11,802 --> 00:32:12,794
Choi Dal-Po!

547
00:32:12,945 --> 00:32:14,049
Dal-Po!

548
00:32:22,394 --> 00:32:23,346
Mister.

549
00:32:23,473 --> 00:32:25,941
What should I do
if my uncle dies like this?

550
00:32:28,151 --> 00:32:29,040
He won’t die.

551
00:32:29,318 --> 00:32:30,454
From what I saw,

552
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,527
he just has a small cut on his head.
A small cut.

553
00:32:33,593 --> 00:32:36,424
Why can’t he wake up
if he has just a small cut?

554
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:38,988
This is a brain hemorrhage.

555
00:32:39,698 --> 00:32:42,265
He can’t hurt his head.

556
00:32:42,356 --> 00:32:44,232
He can’t become stupid.

557
00:32:44,605 --> 00:32:47,005
He’s already an outcast.

558
00:32:47,141 --> 00:32:49,765
He’ll be too pitiful if he's an outcast

559
00:32:49,831 --> 00:32:53,130
and becomes stupid. What should I do?

560
00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:00,975
What if everyone finds out
that he becomes stupid?

561
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,451
Be quiet. Please!

562
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:06,382
Uncle.

563
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,710
Are you awake?

564
00:33:10,992 --> 00:33:11,791
How do you feel?

565
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:14,470
Do you feel nausea or dizziness?

566
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,036
I’m fine.

567
00:33:17,148 --> 00:33:18,937
What’s my name?

568
00:33:19,326 --> 00:33:21,541
How many is this? Tell me.

569
00:33:22,408 --> 00:33:23,463
I don’t know.

570
00:33:25,286 --> 00:33:26,198
What should I do?

571
00:33:26,468 --> 00:33:27,754
What should I do...?

572
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,828
He said he doesn’t know me.

573
00:33:30,082 --> 00:33:32,132
He doesn’t know this.

574
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:34,217
I’m sorry for troubling you.

575
00:33:34,308 --> 00:33:35,942
Let us get off, please.

576
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,389
Why are you taking that off?
Just leave it.

577
00:34:40,141 --> 00:34:42,881
It's okay. If the old man sees,
he’ll be shocked.

578
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:45,106
Do you have a band aid?

579
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:46,282
Yeah.

580
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,713
Don’t tell my father
about the accident today.

581
00:34:49,804 --> 00:34:53,491
Just tell him about you hurting
your ankle from riding the bicycle.

582
00:34:54,012 --> 00:34:56,076
If you add anything,
I’ll get caught lying to him.

583
00:34:56,308 --> 00:34:57,673
Okay.

584
00:35:24,198 --> 00:35:25,692
You got the perfect score

585
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,263
with your own ability, right?

586
00:35:28,305 --> 00:35:29,156
Yeah.

587
00:35:29,426 --> 00:35:32,672
So, you’ve been keeping your ability
all this time and lived like a dummy.

588
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:34,836
Why did you do it?

589
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:39,929
You said your real uncle
was a real dummy?

590
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:44,067
Then you’ve been acting like a dummy
all this time because of grandfather?

591
00:35:44,158 --> 00:35:45,862
You were afraid he’ll get
shocked and collapse?

592
00:35:46,596 --> 00:35:47,442
Yeah.

593
00:35:47,804 --> 00:35:50,221
Then why did you show your ability now?

594
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,811
Did you really want to go
on the quiz show?

595
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,881
Stop asking me. My head hurts.

596
00:36:02,437 --> 00:36:04,134
You won’t get slapped by Chan-soo.

597
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:08,375
-What?
-So...

598
00:36:09,131 --> 00:36:10,519
you don’t have to worry.

599
00:36:34,183 --> 00:36:37,220
Slicing your belly for your owner
who fed you is your original destiny.

600
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:38,577
Oh-soon.

601
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:40,401
That's your fate.

602
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,095
Where are you going?

603
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:54,637
To my friend’s house.

604
00:36:56,962 --> 00:36:59,570
Please don’t let father watch TV tomorrow.

605
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,636
We don’t even have TV.

606
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,377
It’d be harder to tell him to watch it.

607
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:05,429
I’ll be back.

608
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:08,865
You're not taking your bike?

609
00:37:09,365 --> 00:37:10,211
Yes.

610
00:37:10,308 --> 00:37:12,308
I’ll stay over at my friend’s house.

611
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:16,027
-Where is uncle going?
-I don’t know.

612
00:37:16,188 --> 00:37:17,733
He said he’ll stay over at his friend’s.

613
00:37:17,824 --> 00:37:19,695
But he doesn’t have any friends.

614
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,543
They really are all zeros.

615
00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:37,277
What a perfect nickname.

616
00:37:37,343 --> 00:37:38,334
All-zero.

617
00:37:45,983 --> 00:37:46,867
English History

618
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:52,375
This is not a kind of book
that Dal-Po read.

619
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,876
Oh-Chang Union Library?

620
00:37:56,915 --> 00:37:58,105
He borrowed this?

621
00:38:03,654 --> 00:38:04,878
One ticket to Seoul please.

622
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:18,170
There are a lot of books here.

623
00:38:23,248 --> 00:38:24,362
France History

624
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:28,590
He read this too?

625
00:38:30,065 --> 00:38:31,318
And last year at that.

626
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:38,889
No way...

627
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,499
The Quiz Show Challenge Preliminary

628
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,085
Oh, my God!

629
00:39:03,151 --> 00:39:05,231
Did he read all these books?

630
00:39:05,471 --> 00:39:06,388
Choi Dal-Po.

631
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:08,383
Who is he?

632
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,132
Choi Dal-Po got 100 by his skill

633
00:39:34,323 --> 00:39:36,363
I will announce the qualifier
for this week.

634
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:39,912
The ones who passed this week
will appear on October 8th show.

635
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:43,622
You will compete against
the last week’s winner, Ahn Chan-soo.

636
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:47,179
This week’s qualifier is...

637
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:54,158
Now, we'll start the second round
between last week’s winner

638
00:39:54,224 --> 00:39:56,785
Ahn Chan-soo, and the new challenger

639
00:39:56,851 --> 00:39:58,888
Choi Dal-Po.

640
00:40:01,989 --> 00:40:03,906
The final second round
will be a speed quiz

641
00:40:03,972 --> 00:40:06,730
with 30 to 50 points per question.

642
00:40:06,796 --> 00:40:08,528
We have 20 questions prepared.

643
00:40:08,594 --> 00:40:12,758
The winner of this round
will get one win addition.

644
00:40:12,824 --> 00:40:14,415
You two ready?

645
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:15,601
-Yes.
-Yes.

646
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:16,522
Alright.

647
00:40:16,604 --> 00:40:20,181
There’s a proverb in our country
that says 'turning green with envy'.

648
00:40:20,448 --> 00:40:24,053
It means that you feel happy
when you see others feel unhappy.

649
00:40:24,314 --> 00:40:28,065
In German, what is a compound phrase

650
00:40:28,403 --> 00:40:30,368
that combines pain and joy?

651
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:32,756
Yes. Choi Dal-Po.

652
00:40:32,822 --> 00:40:34,694
The answer is Schadenfreude.

653
00:40:34,804 --> 00:40:36,383
Schadenfreude...

654
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,361
That's correct!

655
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,903
I don’t even know
the answer for that one.

656
00:40:45,994 --> 00:40:48,127
All-zero. I think he's not an idiot,

657
00:40:48,218 --> 00:40:49,742
but a total genius.

658
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:51,108
I'll give you the next question.

659
00:40:52,629 --> 00:40:56,919
This means that this person sets trend
and what's popular for the era...

660
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,295
-Yes. Choi Dal-Po.
-Trendsetter.

661
00:40:59,386 --> 00:41:00,727
This person’s specialties

662
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:03,220
are playing violin and deduction...

663
00:41:03,286 --> 00:41:04,429
-Yes.
-Sherlock Holmes.

664
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:07,107
Up, down, charm, strange...

665
00:41:08,147 --> 00:41:11,279
-Quark.
-It has deep connection to shichimi...

666
00:41:11,486 --> 00:41:12,440
Falcon.

667
00:41:12,531 --> 00:41:14,466
During the China’s Cultural Revolution,

668
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:16,867
there were 4 banned books called
'Four Great Classical Novels'.

669
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:19,142
"Dream of the Red Chamber",
"Romance of the Three Kingdoms",

670
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:20,780
"Water Margin", "Journey to the West".

671
00:41:20,871 --> 00:41:22,912
-Dal-Po is so awesome.
-That's correct!

672
00:41:23,003 --> 00:41:24,824
He make it tight with Chan-soo.

673
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,648
So when he got the perfect score,
it wasn't because he cheats,

674
00:41:27,723 --> 00:41:29,425
but it was his real skill.

675
00:41:29,877 --> 00:41:31,045
That kid...

676
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,589
He finally proved his innocence.

677
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:36,834
You won’t get slapped by Chan-soo.

678
00:41:37,694 --> 00:41:38,543
So...

679
00:41:38,922 --> 00:41:40,237
you don’t have to worry.

680
00:41:44,848 --> 00:41:45,968
It was true.

681
00:41:47,328 --> 00:41:48,909
I won’t get slapped.

682
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,924
I will give the last question for today.

683
00:41:53,128 --> 00:41:55,331
Let's take a look at the current scores.

684
00:41:55,689 --> 00:41:58,186
Choi Dal-Po has 440.

685
00:41:58,277 --> 00:42:01,425
Ahn Chan-soo has 410.

686
00:42:01,545 --> 00:42:06,757
Last week’s winner, Ahn Chan-soo,
is losing to the challenger by 30 points.

687
00:42:06,848 --> 00:42:10,260
But we still have the last question
worth 50 points.

688
00:42:10,351 --> 00:42:15,228
So, the person who correctly answer
the question will be today's winner.

689
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:18,050
Okay. This is the last question.

690
00:42:18,862 --> 00:42:21,961
There are four freedoms
that Franklin Roosevelt suggested

691
00:42:22,027 --> 00:42:23,523
at his State of the Union address.

692
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,076
Please correctly mention all
of these four freedoms

693
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:31,020
which is also reflected at the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

694
00:42:32,107 --> 00:42:33,947
Ahn Chan-soo pressed the bell.

695
00:42:34,038 --> 00:42:37,589
Ahn Chan-soo, if you answer it correctly,
you will succeed winning the second time.

696
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,769
The correct answer is?

697
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:43,393
Freedom of speech.

698
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,594
And then...

699
00:42:47,692 --> 00:42:50,633
You have to mention
the rest of the three freedoms

700
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:52,361
to answer correctly.

701
00:42:52,452 --> 00:42:55,675
Since it’s the last question, I will give
five more seconds starting now.

702
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,873
Oh, no.

703
00:42:57,939 --> 00:43:00,441
You'll lose if you press earlier
on that kind of question.

704
00:43:00,532 --> 00:43:01,837
The time is running.

705
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:06,581
That’s too bad.

706
00:43:06,647 --> 00:43:10,438
Automatically, the chance
will go over to Choi Dal-Po.

707
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:11,945
Dal-Po won.

708
00:43:12,144 --> 00:43:12,987
Choi Dal-Po.

709
00:43:13,152 --> 00:43:16,304
If you answer correctly,
the new challenger will get the first win.

710
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:17,371
Okay.

711
00:43:17,763 --> 00:43:19,044
Yes. Choi Dal-Po.

712
00:43:19,669 --> 00:43:22,450
Freedom of worship, freedom from want...

713
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:25,430
and freedom from fear.

714
00:43:28,136 --> 00:43:30,136
You mentioned three of them.

715
00:43:30,227 --> 00:43:34,106
You have to mention the last one to be
the correct answer of the four freedoms.

716
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,676
The last one is...

717
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:38,045
I don't know.

718
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:43,563
What?

719
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,238
What does he mean?

720
00:43:45,304 --> 00:43:47,125
Chan-soo just mentioned the last answer.

721
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,018
You said you don’t know.

722
00:43:49,117 --> 00:43:50,208
Choi Dal-Po.

723
00:43:50,274 --> 00:43:52,762
I’ll give you five more seconds.

724
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:54,979
What is the last freedom?

725
00:43:57,007 --> 00:43:58,307
He’s doing it on purpose.

726
00:43:58,753 --> 00:44:00,285
He’s doing it on purpose?

727
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,891
Choi Dal-Po, that kid,

728
00:44:01,965 --> 00:44:04,512
did that to piss Ahn Chan-soo off
from the beginning.

729
00:44:04,578 --> 00:44:05,947
Although he knew the answer,

730
00:44:06,013 --> 00:44:08,164
he gave it over to Ahn Chan-so,
'You take it!'

731
00:44:08,497 --> 00:44:09,601
As if he's giving alms...

732
00:44:11,297 --> 00:44:12,243
That's too bad.

733
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,622
The chance has gone over
to Ahn Chan-soo again.

734
00:44:15,688 --> 00:44:17,688
If Ahn Chan-soo answers correctly,

735
00:44:17,817 --> 00:44:19,658
you’ll become the winner
of the second win.

736
00:44:19,768 --> 00:44:20,886
Ahn Chan-soo.

737
00:44:26,808 --> 00:44:28,646
What is the four freedoms?

738
00:44:28,823 --> 00:44:30,023
Freedom of worship,

739
00:44:30,365 --> 00:44:31,838
freedom from want,

740
00:44:32,283 --> 00:44:34,683
freedom from fear, and then...

741
00:44:37,688 --> 00:44:39,294
freedom of...

742
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:40,857
speech.

743
00:44:40,923 --> 00:44:44,363
Yes. That’s correct!
Ahn Chan-soo has succeeded to get

744
00:44:44,429 --> 00:44:45,606
the second win.

745
00:44:59,332 --> 00:45:00,484
Wow.

746
00:45:00,816 --> 00:45:04,717
-It’s overwhelming. All-zero.
-Don’t call him All-zero anymore.

747
00:45:04,967 --> 00:45:06,908
Now we’ll have to call him All-hundred.

748
00:45:07,655 --> 00:45:08,939
Don’t you think it’s wonderful?

749
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:10,028
Who?

750
00:45:10,345 --> 00:45:11,902
-All-zero?
-No.

751
00:45:12,836 --> 00:45:14,449
That amazing box.

752
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:16,215
Box?

753
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:17,683
The TV?

754
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:21,405
No one believed it when I say
it was a false rumor so many times.

755
00:45:22,072 --> 00:45:25,105
But once he shows up there,
the false rumor becomes clear in one shot.

756
00:45:25,171 --> 00:45:26,842
Completely clean at that.

757
00:45:27,076 --> 00:45:29,270
-What?
-The people who saw that show

758
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:32,360
won’t be able to say that Dal-Po
stole the test paper now.

759
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,217
Isn’t that really cool?

760
00:45:34,953 --> 00:45:35,942
You...

761
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:37,845
look like a complete fool.

762
00:45:38,964 --> 00:45:40,195
I decided my career path.

763
00:45:45,014 --> 00:45:46,676
Oh, my... Hey!

764
00:45:47,023 --> 00:45:49,701
You can't change it if you write
with a pen. Use pencil!

765
00:45:50,521 --> 00:45:51,842
I will never ever change it!

766
00:45:51,908 --> 00:45:53,239
I decided it clearly.

767
00:45:56,501 --> 00:45:59,690
Isn’t your father going to collapse again
after he watch that?

768
00:45:59,781 --> 00:46:02,909
If he finds out that Dal-Po isn’t
an idiot but a smart one...

769
00:46:03,296 --> 00:46:05,657
He’ll also find out
that Dal-Po is a fake son.

770
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:07,518
-Hello?
-Father.

771
00:46:07,969 --> 00:46:10,110
It’s Dal-pyung. Where are you right now?

772
00:46:10,316 --> 00:46:11,165
I’m at home.

773
00:46:11,693 --> 00:46:14,047
You didn’t watch the TV
or anything did you?

774
00:46:14,113 --> 00:46:16,181
Why? Something's wrong?

775
00:46:16,738 --> 00:46:17,757
No. Nothing.

776
00:46:18,186 --> 00:46:20,642
I’ll buy you dried herring
for dinner tonight.

777
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:21,605
Alright.

778
00:46:22,456 --> 00:46:24,420
-He didn’t watch TV?
-Yes.

779
00:46:25,061 --> 00:46:26,410
Oh, that’s a relief.

780
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:30,431
If he saw it again, he would’ve
collapsed from seizure.

781
00:46:30,756 --> 00:46:31,914
I know.

782
00:46:34,496 --> 00:46:35,719
Why he asked me that?

783
00:46:53,266 --> 00:46:54,671
He intentionally scored zero

784
00:46:58,041 --> 00:47:00,427
You just need to write down
your name and resident number here.

785
00:47:02,072 --> 00:47:04,006
We’re paying you after taking out
22 percent tax,

786
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:06,336
so don’t call me to complain
about the payment.

787
00:47:06,402 --> 00:47:07,644
-Yes.
-Yes.

788
00:47:08,794 --> 00:47:10,673
By the way, how the bet goes?

789
00:47:10,764 --> 00:47:13,381
Is Chan-soo really going
to slap Dal-Po 10 times?

790
00:47:16,578 --> 00:47:18,533
Don’t you think it’s going
to be fun, Director?

791
00:47:21,447 --> 00:47:22,586
I think it's just me.

792
00:47:23,531 --> 00:47:24,398
Write it down.

793
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:25,565
Properly.

794
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:33,010
Choi Dal-Po.

795
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:35,472
Yes?

796
00:47:35,566 --> 00:47:37,714
Why did you give
the last question up to him?

797
00:47:39,854 --> 00:47:40,852
I didn't give up.

798
00:47:41,016 --> 00:47:41,844
I really didn’t know.

799
00:47:41,915 --> 00:47:43,950
Do you think broadcast is a joke?

800
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:47,534
I think you wanted to play a joke on him,

801
00:47:48,008 --> 00:47:49,689
but you should have not play that joke.

802
00:47:50,142 --> 00:47:51,952
You’re so right.

803
00:47:59,036 --> 00:48:00,067
What are you doing?

804
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,728
You're not gonna get on?

805
00:48:01,998 --> 00:48:03,463
Never mind then.

806
00:48:09,628 --> 00:48:11,784
I don’t think broadcasting is a joke.

807
00:48:14,856 --> 00:48:17,623
You can kill a person with one word
from a broadcast.

808
00:48:18,505 --> 00:48:19,475
How dare...

809
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,724
I think that broadcasting a joke?

810
00:48:25,338 --> 00:48:26,962
Since you asked, I’ll answer you.

811
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:29,804
The reason I gave up the last question...

812
00:48:30,895 --> 00:48:32,493
Because if I got the last question...

813
00:48:33,504 --> 00:48:36,226
I would’ve had to come back to a gutter
like this place next week.

814
00:48:39,076 --> 00:48:40,266
This place...

815
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:45,005
is full of human beings thoughtlessly
assumes nonsense and blabbers out.

816
00:48:45,686 --> 00:48:48,630
Tons of people here wear microphones
and cameras as their armbands.

817
00:48:48,721 --> 00:48:52,017
Thinking that I’m breathing the same air
with that disgusting people,

818
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,096
suffocates and makes me sick.

819
00:48:56,582 --> 00:48:58,272
Going back to a broadcasting station...

820
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,490
...is something I hate
much more than death.

821
00:49:04,345 --> 00:49:05,441
Is that...

822
00:49:06,308 --> 00:49:07,489
enough of an answer?

823
00:49:29,685 --> 00:49:30,997
Bring them back, you bastards!

824
00:49:31,152 --> 00:49:32,160
You guys killed them.

825
00:49:32,226 --> 00:49:35,065
You all killed my brother and my mother!

826
00:49:35,892 --> 00:49:39,203
They died because of your words!

827
00:49:45,915 --> 00:49:47,712
I’ll apologize in his stead.

828
00:49:48,191 --> 00:49:49,376
As you see...

829
00:49:49,777 --> 00:49:51,333
he doesn’t have common manners.

830
00:49:51,424 --> 00:49:52,677
He said only just what’s right.

831
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:53,631
Excuse me?

832
00:49:53,722 --> 00:49:54,686
It’s so right...

833
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:57,300
that it’s almost scary.

834
00:50:23,662 --> 00:50:25,215
I’m back from school.

835
00:50:30,681 --> 00:50:32,490
Why is this out here?

836
00:50:33,729 --> 00:50:34,682
No way.

837
00:50:35,705 --> 00:50:37,358
I couldn't sleep.

838
00:50:39,779 --> 00:50:41,634
-I’ll scratch it for you.
-Alright.

839
00:50:41,759 --> 00:50:42,583
Which number?

840
00:50:42,649 --> 00:50:45,589
-Try number 6.
-Number 6.

841
00:50:46,772 --> 00:50:47,843
By the way, grandfather.

842
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:49,489
-Yeah?
-Did you...

843
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:51,204
...go into my room by any chance?

844
00:50:51,605 --> 00:50:53,358
No. Why?

845
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:56,472
No, nothing.

846
00:50:56,861 --> 00:50:59,543
Where's your uncle?
Why did you come alone?

847
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:00,973
Number 7.

848
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:03,094
Uncle is...

849
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:05,485
He'll be home late after
visiting his friend.

850
00:51:05,576 --> 00:51:06,654
Around 8 PM?

851
00:51:07,372 --> 00:51:08,318
8 PM?

852
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:12,051
Seeing that my third joint of this finger

853
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:13,719
be sore like this...

854
00:51:15,917 --> 00:51:18,480
I think it’s going to rain around then.

855
00:51:18,571 --> 00:51:19,929
Did he take an umbrella?

856
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,715
Do you like me, huh?

857
00:51:39,997 --> 00:51:40,976
Are you crazy?

858
00:51:41,363 --> 00:51:42,479
Why would I?

859
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:47,517
I can see everything.

860
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,053
Stop peeking and say it.

861
00:51:51,147 --> 00:51:53,116
Let me just ask you three questions.

862
00:51:54,265 --> 00:51:57,107
Did you pretend to be stupid
on purpose all this time?

863
00:51:57,628 --> 00:51:58,471
Yeah.

864
00:51:59,691 --> 00:52:01,489
Then you should have kept
pretending to be stupid.

865
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,265
Why did you suddenly come out
and cause such a ruckus?

866
00:52:04,356 --> 00:52:05,459
To appear on the quiz show?

867
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:06,751
Unbelievable.

868
00:52:07,323 --> 00:52:08,165
Hey.

869
00:52:08,435 --> 00:52:10,300
Do you know that you’re inconsistent?

870
00:52:11,037 --> 00:52:13,608
You said you hate going to
the TV station more than death?

871
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:14,781
Yeah, I hate it.

872
00:52:14,872 --> 00:52:17,884
So why did you come out
to the quiz show then?

873
00:52:20,016 --> 00:52:22,538
You said three questions.
It's already three.

874
00:52:24,006 --> 00:52:24,851
Wow.

875
00:52:25,221 --> 00:52:26,547
Look at this jerk.

876
00:52:37,444 --> 00:52:39,959
Grandfather’s weather forecast
is 100 percent correct.

877
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,157
Forget it. Don't do anything useless.

878
00:52:47,379 --> 00:52:49,124
He deserves to get soaked in rain.

879
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,712
-Mom!
-Oh, my baby.

880
00:53:02,803 --> 00:53:03,626
You did so well.

881
00:53:03,717 --> 00:53:06,130
I'm proud of you.

882
00:53:25,324 --> 00:53:27,472
If I get soaked in this,
I’m going to freeze to death.

883
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:47,735
Really? Really?

884
00:53:47,864 --> 00:53:50,616
-But the style is quite old.
-I don’t care about style.

885
00:53:50,707 --> 00:53:51,978
As long it runs.

886
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,803
In-ha.

887
00:53:56,157 --> 00:53:58,371
If I go out to the quiz show,

888
00:53:58,671 --> 00:54:00,671
I'll confess that I like you.

889
00:54:01,323 --> 00:54:02,857
-What?
-When you heard it,

890
00:54:02,923 --> 00:54:04,089
please answer me.

891
00:54:06,131 --> 00:54:09,911
As I said yesterday, we plan to select
one person who has the best score

892
00:54:09,977 --> 00:54:13,969
and recommend that person
to represent the school.

893
00:54:25,705 --> 00:54:28,332
Why did you suddenly show your skill now?

894
00:54:34,009 --> 00:54:34,956
Because...

895
00:54:38,105 --> 00:54:38,968
Because I like...

896
00:54:40,161 --> 00:54:41,284
...you.

897
00:54:52,139 --> 00:54:53,220
Hey, All-zero! No.

898
00:54:53,673 --> 00:54:54,766
Dal-Po!

899
00:54:59,942 --> 00:55:00,967
As expected.

900
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,445
I’m going crazy.

901
00:55:02,569 --> 00:55:03,840
I should have try it before I go.

902
00:55:03,906 --> 00:55:05,102
What should I do?

903
00:55:08,522 --> 00:55:09,468
Where did he go?

904
00:55:13,474 --> 00:55:14,731
Dal-Po!

905
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,679
Choi Dal-Po!

906
00:55:18,084 --> 00:55:19,433
Dal-Po!

907
00:55:24,065 --> 00:55:24,905
Oh, my.

908
00:55:33,811 --> 00:55:34,972
It’s cold, so use this.

909
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:35,961
Huh?

910
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,176
Yeah...

911
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,179
Dal-Po, don’t misunderstand.

912
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:44,080
I came because grandfather told me too.

913
00:55:44,146 --> 00:55:46,498
He was so worried that you'll get soaked

914
00:55:46,578 --> 00:55:48,259
so I had to come.

915
00:55:48,797 --> 00:55:49,688
I have no choice.

916
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,316
You started hiccuping now.

917
00:55:54,344 --> 00:55:56,203
It's not because I’m lying.

918
00:55:56,294 --> 00:55:58,447
It's because I'm cold.
I do hiccuping when I’m cold too.

919
00:55:59,194 --> 00:56:02,264
So, I refuse any delusions.

920
00:56:06,287 --> 00:56:08,463
What did you want to tell me earlier?

921
00:56:09,531 --> 00:56:11,162
You said it during the show.

922
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:13,971
'Choi In-ha, if I become
a champion here...'

923
00:56:14,203 --> 00:56:15,464
Then you stopped.

924
00:56:17,126 --> 00:56:18,469
If I become a champion...

925
00:56:24,855 --> 00:56:26,855
Don’t get off from my bike from now on.

926
00:56:28,347 --> 00:56:29,189
Why?

927
00:56:30,416 --> 00:56:31,616
What is that mean?

928
00:56:35,878 --> 00:56:36,971
You don’t possibly...

929
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:44,282
No way.

930
00:56:45,774 --> 00:56:46,915
If I look back...

931
00:56:47,461 --> 00:56:48,602
I should have left then.

932
00:56:52,521 --> 00:56:55,203
It’s a feeling that I should have had
from the beginning.

933
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,102
She was someone I should have not seen.

934
00:56:58,198 --> 00:56:59,959
TV Journalist - Reason:
because I can't lie

935
00:57:03,615 --> 00:57:04,968
My goodness.

936
00:57:11,954 --> 00:57:12,804
Father.

937
00:57:13,726 --> 00:57:15,946
Today is the day of your statute
of limitation ends.

938
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:21,081
I hate those people who condemn you out
as a fugitive enough to kill them...

939
00:57:22,849 --> 00:57:24,692
but however, I hope they were right.

940
00:57:26,438 --> 00:57:27,501
Even you're a fugitive...

941
00:57:28,929 --> 00:57:31,074
or blamed by others, it's fine.

942
00:57:32,022 --> 00:57:32,888
It's just...

943
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:35,575
I hope you're alive.

944
00:57:39,953 --> 00:57:40,905
I miss you.

945
00:57:41,602 --> 00:57:42,454
Father.

946
00:57:46,934 --> 00:57:48,804
Before that feeling grew bigger...

947
00:57:49,867 --> 00:57:51,339
I should have left...

948
00:57:53,619 --> 00:57:55,183
when I could turn back.

949
00:58:05,634 --> 00:58:07,197
There's no way you...

950
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:08,784
What is it?

951
00:58:12,241 --> 00:58:13,852
You’re not having a strange delusions,
are you?

952
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,027
I didn’t become a champion.

953
00:58:17,361 --> 00:58:19,283
So you just have to not get
on my bike like now.

954
00:58:19,649 --> 00:58:21,041
So, I’m refusing...

955
00:58:21,954 --> 00:58:22,823
any delusions.

956
00:58:24,337 --> 00:58:25,354
I know. I know.

957
00:58:25,482 --> 00:58:27,016
I didn’t have delusions.

958
00:58:27,891 --> 00:58:29,755
I’m telling the truth.

959
00:58:30,192 --> 00:58:32,293
It’s so cold that I keep hiccuping.

960
00:58:34,017 --> 00:58:35,477
I thought...

961
00:58:35,711 --> 00:58:37,963
this flutter would go away
as time goes by.

962
00:58:39,826 --> 00:58:40,807
And if it goes away...

963
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:43,174
I thought I could leave easily.

964
00:58:45,165 --> 00:58:47,290
But that was a silly delusion.

965
00:58:50,687 --> 00:58:52,050
It's just an excuse...

966
00:58:53,212 --> 00:58:54,370
to stay beside her.

967
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,481
Mom.

968
00:59:09,318 --> 00:59:11,000
I missed you a lot.

969
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,547
She’s so embarrassing.

970
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,118
What's written on test paper...

971
00:59:14,209 --> 00:59:16,184
It's more like an entertainer
rather than reporter.

972
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:18,683
Are you stupid? Do you think that
number really is your mom’s?

973
00:59:18,774 --> 00:59:20,571
Dal-Po, have you seen my mom before?

974
00:59:20,742 --> 00:59:22,923
I trust what I saw.
Just as I trust you eight years ago.

975
00:59:23,014 --> 00:59:24,798
Why? I don’t want to.

976
00:59:24,889 --> 00:59:26,970
Don't you have a brother and mom
besides your father?

977
00:59:27,073 --> 00:59:28,518
They both died.

978
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,072
I'm so sorry.

979
00:59:30,163 --> 00:59:33,033
-Dal-Po, Dal-Po, don’t be shocked.
-I’m not being shocked right now.

980
00:59:35,007 --> 00:59:35,855
Mom...
