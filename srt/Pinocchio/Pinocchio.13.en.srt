1
00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:11,858
Pinocchio

2
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,430
Did Song Cha-ok check
the death certificate

3
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,060
before she reported it?

4
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,420
No, she didn't.

5
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,530
What about you, Dal-Po, I mean, Ha-myung?

6
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,530
I'm going to go see Ms Song Cha-ok.

7
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,320
On what ground did you conclude
that it was suicide?

8
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,150
-The circumstantial evidence.
-Did you check his death certificate?

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,440
And his family's statements.

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,170
Did you check his death certificate?

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,110
He even left a note.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,030
I asked if you checked
his death certificate.

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,199
There was no reason for it!

14
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:58,914
Because there was other evidence
to indicate that it was suicide!

15
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,639
Thank you...for your response.

16
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,632
Chairman: Please resign for now.

17
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,050
Episode 13 -The Christmas Gift

18
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,970
Jackpot.

19
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,522
She admitted that
she didn’t check the death certificate?

20
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,969
Yeah, and I think that's why
she's not suing or denying anything.

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,824
That's going to
really ruin her reputation.

22
00:01:32,915 --> 00:01:36,141
That death certificate is going to
determine her fate.

23
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:41,909
But you're not concerned?
She's In-ha's mother.

24
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,159
No, not at all.

25
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,910
But it still concerns me.

26
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,570
-It must be worse for you since it's...
-It's over between us.

27
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,488
Let's stop talking about that,
and just tell me what you've found.

28
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,843
Did you say it’s over?

29
00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:55,484
What about you?
Have you met with the fellow drivers?

30
00:01:57,245 --> 00:02:00,769
Yeah, I met with all four of them,
and they all told me the same thing.

31
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,020
That it wasn't a suicide, but that
he died of a coronary heart disease.

32
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,878
Coronary heart disease?

33
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,900
-They all had the same response?
-Yeah.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,020
The owner was right.

35
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,880
Guys, I'm back.

36
00:02:15,297 --> 00:02:16,650
Why does your voice sound so hoarse?

37
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,640
Don't even ask.

38
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,460
I went to meet
with the bus driver's brother

39
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,110
and it was so loud that I had
to keep shouting to be heard.

40
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:26,340
What did he say was the cause of death?

41
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:31,567
Mister, did your brother have
some sort of a chronic illness?

42
00:02:33,893 --> 00:02:35,620
He did?

43
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,840
Then your brother didn't commit suicide?

44
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,340
He said what the owner said is true.

45
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,950
He died of a coronary heart disease.

46
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,113
-Coronary heart disease...
-Why? Is something bothering you?

47
00:02:55,017 --> 00:02:56,767
No, nothing.

48
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,312
Then why did he lie 6 years ago
about his brother committing suicide?

49
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:03,132
I guess he was resentful thinking

50
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:05,418
that his brother committed suicide
from getting fired.

51
00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:06,952
He said that's why he lied.

52
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:10,739
Then Ms Song really did twist the story.

53
00:03:11,022 --> 00:03:14,284
I knew it. Who would ever commit suicide
over 60 cents?

54
00:03:14,384 --> 00:03:15,704
No, that wouldn’t make any sense.

55
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:17,114
But she wanted more impact,

56
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:19,533
that's why she reported it
without checking the death certificate.

57
00:03:20,194 --> 00:03:21,874
-Right?
-Yeah.

58
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:25,419
But why isn't In-ha back yet?

59
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:28,629
We can put an end to Song Cha-ok
once we verify the death certificate.

60
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,059
Death certificate has been verified,
and there are no issues

61
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:43,447
Just as I thought.
There's nothing more to check, right?

62
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:45,268
It's true that Song Cha-ok
manipulated the story.

63
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:48,398
But what's In-ha doing?
Why isn't she back yet?

64
00:03:51,918 --> 00:03:53,885
Something suddenly came up,
and I can't come back right now.

65
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,502
Choi In-ha

66
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:00,494
The line is busy right now,
please leave a message.

67
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:01,619
Is she not answering her phone?

68
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:04,575
No.

69
00:04:04,798 --> 00:04:07,410
-You're not lying, are you?
-No, I'm telling the truth.

70
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,570
Your dream was spot on.

71
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:13,530
I'm sure that you'll get to see the people
that you saw in your dream, too.

72
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,970
Just like I did.

73
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,401
Hey, where are you going now?

74
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,995
Aren't you going to report to your boss?

75
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,095
Certificate of Death

76
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,060
-You're saying the document is forged?
-Yes.

77
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,125
Look right here.
This section should not be empty.

78
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:48,510
If there aren't any relevant circumstance,
then it should say so.

79
00:04:48,861 --> 00:04:53,191
But this blank space means
that there was something, but removed.

80
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:57,357
This document was forged.
This must be looked into.

81
00:04:57,943 --> 00:05:01,378
No, please don't do that.
This document couldn't have been forged.

82
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:03,458
Then it means that the bus owner
must've lied.

83
00:05:03,558 --> 00:05:04,698
We can't have that.

84
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:06,958
Please say that the document
wasn't forged. Please?

85
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:29,948
No, don't come.

86
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:32,488
-Don't come!
-Choi In-ha.

87
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:38,188
Hey, stop right there.

88
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:43,178
Choi In-ha!

89
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:49,008
Choi In-ha!

90
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:57,762
Why are you running away?

91
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:01,200
Don't come any closer.

92
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,369
Why are you hiccuping?

93
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:18,536
You verified the death certificate, right?

94
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:21,158
There's no doubt that
your mom manipulated the story, right?

95
00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:24,376
She did, right?

96
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:29,026
-Dal-Po...
-Tell me that she did!

97
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,981
The death certificate was forged.

98
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:43,056
The original document shows
that it really was a suicide.

99
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,377
The bus owner deceived us.

100
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:52,611
Then you're saying that
your mother was right?

101
00:06:57,706 --> 00:06:59,416
Just why...

102
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:03,666
Why does it have to be you?
We were so close!

103
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:05,855
Of all the people,
why did it have to be you?

104
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:08,380
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:14,657
No, there's no need for you to be sorry.

106
00:07:15,616 --> 00:07:17,110
You just need to keep your mouth shut.

107
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,305
Then it'll be known that your mom
manipulated the story

108
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,189
and she can't be a reporter anymore.

109
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,501
Your mother destroyed
my whole family with her lies...

110
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,770
so who cares about telling one small lie?

111
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,620
That's right way,
and that's the way it should be!

112
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,280
Okay.

113
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,990
Let's leave my mom
be the one who’s wrong.

114
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,290
Everything will be fine
as long as I keep my mouth shut.

115
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,021
That's what I'll do.
I'll keep my mouth shut.

116
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,273
Okay, don't tell anyone about this.

117
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:54,353
I'm going to bring your mom down
no matter what.

118
00:07:54,443 --> 00:07:57,123
For the sake of my poor brother,
I can't let it end like this.

119
00:07:57,213 --> 00:07:58,370
I swear...

120
00:08:00,706 --> 00:08:02,153
to see this all the way through.

121
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:30,215
Hurry up and open the door,
you little brat.

122
00:08:30,393 --> 00:08:32,859
We're about to freeze out here.
Let's hurry up and get inside.

123
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,953
What's the dog's name?

124
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:41,653
-It's Gonzales.
-Gon...

125
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,953
What a heartless brat you are!

126
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:58,141
You are such an unbelievable brat!

127
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:02,923
Does everything work okay in here?

128
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:05,833
-Water comes out okay?
-Yes.

129
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:07,163
The water comes out fine.

130
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:12,793
You're a coldhearted scoundrel.

131
00:09:16,203 --> 00:09:21,173
-Is the boiler gas or does it use fuel?
-It's gas.

132
00:09:21,263 --> 00:09:22,514
What brings you here?

133
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:25,433
I was going to cut off all ties...

134
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:29,293
and not call or get in touch with you
just like you.

135
00:09:29,393 --> 00:09:33,073
But I didn't want to become a rude
and heartless one like you.

136
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,312
That's why I'm here.

137
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,798
I guess it shouldn't get
too drafty in here.

138
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:44,757
Do you have rice?

139
00:09:49,563 --> 00:09:51,228
Yes, I've got plenty.

140
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:04,603
That's my cellphone number.

141
00:10:04,703 --> 00:10:07,443
Please call me right away
if he falls ill or anything.

142
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:11,155
Sure, but what is your relationship
to him?

143
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:13,883
We're brothers.

144
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,023
-He's my older brother.
-Excuse me?

145
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,987
Don't bother seeing us out.
You little brat.

146
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:28,863
You never listen to me.

147
00:10:32,443 --> 00:10:37,577
There's no way I'm un-adopting you,
so you'd better be aware of that.

148
00:10:38,113 --> 00:10:41,953
No matter what anyone says,
you're my son for the rest of your life.

149
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:43,573
Let’s go.

150
00:10:52,363 --> 00:10:54,165
Stop following us.

151
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:57,473
If you keep following us,
then we're never coming back again.

152
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:36,467
Don't skip any meals, don't spare the gas
and turn up the heat on the boiler.

153
00:11:41,763 --> 00:11:43,553
I know how much you're
struggling right now.

154
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:44,913
You're not fine.

155
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:46,753
You'll cry yourself to sleep every night

156
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:48,773
and you'll miss him
every moment of the day.

157
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:51,653
But you'll pretend you're fine
out of pity for your brother.

158
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,603
I know better that better
than anyone else

159
00:11:53,703 --> 00:11:55,453
but I won't worry, or console you either.

160
00:11:55,553 --> 00:11:56,953
Because...

161
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,042
I hate the thought of you
crumbling down even more.

162
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:15,194
You've checked with
all the fellow drivers?

163
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:16,863
-Yes.
-Yes.

164
00:12:16,963 --> 00:12:19,163
All 10 drivers testified
that it wasn't suicide

165
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:21,623
and his family even offered
to interview with us.

166
00:12:21,913 --> 00:12:24,183
No issues with
the death certificate either?

167
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,455
-No, there aren't any issues.
-We've verified it with the hospital.

168
00:12:29,953 --> 00:12:31,763
I'm just asking to be sure...

169
00:12:31,863 --> 00:12:35,705
but you aren't investigating with
the thought of  bringing Song down, right?

170
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,513
Captain Hwang!
We're different from that manipulator.

171
00:12:39,613 --> 00:12:41,533
Everything's been verified accurately.

172
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:42,890
Okay, then.

173
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:46,363
I heard a group of protestors are waiting
for Ms Song Cha-ok at the station.

174
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,953
So take a camera crew
and get whatever you can from the scene.

175
00:12:49,383 --> 00:12:52,333
-Yoon Yu-Rae, do you want to do it?
-No.

176
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:54,473
I believe that Ki Ha-myung should do it.

177
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:56,423
What's gotten into you?

178
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:59,596
I believe that this case holds
a very significant meaning to him.

179
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:03,453
This is a chance for him to get revenge
for that injustice from 13 years ago.

180
00:13:03,553 --> 00:13:04,802
and I can't take it away from him.

181
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,483
Okay.

182
00:13:09,953 --> 00:13:11,296
Then Ki Ha-myung can go.

183
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:13,333
Yes, Sir.

184
00:13:13,423 --> 00:13:15,473
Go for it! I'll be cheering you on.

185
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:39,973
-News cannot be manipulated!
-No, it can't!

186
00:13:40,073 --> 00:13:44,453
-Song Cha-ok should be terminated!
-Terminated!

187
00:13:44,553 --> 00:13:49,543
-Song Cha-ok  must reveal the truth!
-Reveal it!

188
00:13:49,643 --> 00:13:52,803
-Terminate her!
-Do you know what time she'll be coming?

189
00:13:54,023 --> 00:13:55,893
She should be arriving any minute.

190
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:09,852
This doesn't feel right.

191
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,273
I have to film something
that's insulting to our own manager.

192
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:17,443
-Are you guys okay with this?
-Yes.

193
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:20,843
You've been hiccuping since yesterday.

194
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,869
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

195
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:27,459
Sir, we're here.

196
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:31,243
You should let Song Cha-ok have it today.
We'll get it all on camera for you.

197
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:34,123
Okay, I will.

198
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:37,648
Okay, everyone.

199
00:14:38,323 --> 00:14:45,323
Let's make sure to get an apology
from Song Cha-ok today!

200
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:50,134
Here she comes!

201
00:15:07,943 --> 00:15:10,763
Get out of the car and apologize!

202
00:15:10,863 --> 00:15:13,083
Get out of the car right now!

203
00:15:13,763 --> 00:15:18,147
-I'll get out here, so you can go ahead.
-No, you’ll be in big trouble then!

204
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:20,243
That's exactly why I'm getting out.

205
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:22,704
We've even got cameras around here.

206
00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:24,804
So if I just take a few shots...

207
00:15:25,694 --> 00:15:27,624
then that'll just make me a victim.

208
00:15:29,171 --> 00:15:30,974
Manager Sung!

209
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:36,134
Can you please make a statement
about manipulating the story?

210
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:41,491
Apologize!

211
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:46,574
Can you give us a statement?
Do you feel it’s unfair for you?

212
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:48,994
-Why aren't you denying it?
-You manipulated it, right?

213
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:52,195
-Have you heard from your father?
-Why is he still in hiding?

214
00:15:52,295 --> 00:15:53,906
Is it because he feels guilty?

215
00:15:54,006 --> 00:15:58,396
-Why didn't you check the certificate?
-If you're innocent, you wouldn't deny it!

216
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,356
If he's not that sort of a man,
where is he then?

217
00:16:01,446 --> 00:16:03,506
If he's innocent,
he wouldn't be hiding, would he?

218
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:06,176
Exactly, if he's innocent,
why is he still hiding?

219
00:16:06,276 --> 00:16:08,776
-Give us an explanation.
-Why are you remaining silent?

220
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:13,286
You have ruined my life.

221
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:15,601
You know that? Take a good look at this.

222
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:18,646
Where does it say
that it was a suicide, huh?

223
00:16:19,106 --> 00:16:21,206
My business was destroyed because of you.

224
00:16:21,306 --> 00:16:26,074
I've had to struggle through life
while everyone called me a murderer!

225
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:30,709
Reporters like this must be kicked out
from all broadcast stations!

226
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:33,226
-You're right!
-She must be fired!

227
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:37,889
The death certificate had been forged.

228
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:40,379
I checked the original document
and it really was a suicide.

229
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:43,179
The bus owner deceived us.

230
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:47,669
-He's right!
-She must be fired!

231
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:56,788
You're a swindler.

232
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:59,979
Did you think that you'd get away
with ruining someone's life

233
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,679
through your manipulation?

234
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,258
You more than deserve what you're getting!

235
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:17,194
President Cho, you forged the results
of this death certificate, did you not?

236
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:22,539
-Excuse me?
-Please answer the question.

237
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:24,387
Did you forge the document?

238
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,243
What are you talking about?
I didn't forge anything.

239
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:32,730
What is he doing?
Why is he questioning the wrong person?

240
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,870
What is he doing?
You're on Song Cha-ok's side, aren't you?

241
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,656
They are all the same. Get lost!

242
00:17:38,756 --> 00:17:41,020
-Let go.
-We've checked with the hospital.

243
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,130
You removed the part
that said he took sleeping pills.

244
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,434
Why did you forge the death certificate?

245
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,690
-Is that for real?
-What's going on here?

246
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,440
-What's this all about?
-Then it really was a suicide?

247
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,009
All over 60 cents?

248
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,709
All the fellow drivers
and the family of the deceased stated

249
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:02,991
that the cause of death
was coronary heart disease.

250
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:04,435
As if they were instructed by someone.

251
00:18:05,303 --> 00:18:07,563
Is that what you ordered them to say?

252
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:08,935
Please answer the question.

253
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:12,293
-He's right about that.
-That was...

254
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:13,785
Why didn't I notice that myself?

255
00:18:14,263 --> 00:18:17,563
-They asked for an exact cause of death.
-Why is it...

256
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,571
that they would ask you
instead of asking a doctor?

257
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:23,880
What is this? Then he's a swindler?

258
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,623
-He's deceived all of us!
-Please respond to his question.

259
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:31,403
-Why can't you answer his question?
-Answer the question!

260
00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:34,063
-Give us a statement.
-Fine, that's right.

261
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,294
I deceived all of you!

262
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:39,279
Do you want me to do nothing
when my business has been destroyed?

263
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:41,724
I deceived all of you!

264
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:53,228
Did you get his family
to go along with it?

265
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:55,048
Is it true that you forged the document?

266
00:18:55,148 --> 00:18:56,428
What made you decide to do this?

267
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:58,738
How could you fire someone
over a mere 60 cents?

268
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:01,668
Even if it's only 100 cents,
extortion is still an extortion.

269
00:19:01,768 --> 00:19:05,308
-What wrong have I done?
-He's not even human!

270
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,254
What are you doing right now?

271
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:12,628
I was doing the right thing
as a reporter.

272
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:16,348
Something you should've done
13 years ago.

273
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:20,689
There's something that I'd like to ask.

274
00:19:21,098 --> 00:19:24,698
Why is it that people don't believe you
even when you're telling the truth?

275
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:28,067
Why is it that even you
couldn't trust yourself?

276
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:31,387
Are you sure that you're a real reporter?

277
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:38,528
I’ll keep asking you that question.

278
00:19:38,618 --> 00:19:40,938
And until I hear your answer
to that question...

279
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,031
I'm not going to crumble down and fall.

280
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,472
What an arrogant brat.

281
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,847
I'm sorry for the inconvenience
that I've caused.

282
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,156
You should've all seen Dal-Po,
I mean, Ha-myung today.

283
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:37,108
He stood right in front of Song Cha-ok
and asked, 'Are you even a real reporter?'

284
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,988
I got chills up and down my spine
when he asked her that.

285
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:44,488
-That must've been pretty cool.
-It was so cool.

286
00:20:46,263 --> 00:20:49,373
If it wasn't for my sweetie,
I would've liked to accept his feelings.

287
00:20:49,473 --> 00:20:51,275
Feelings? Whose feelings?

288
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,351
You don’t want to know.

289
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:56,145
But do you think that
Ms Song has been hurt at all?

290
00:20:56,435 --> 00:21:00,005
That's what I can't figure out.
It's hard to tell because of the Botox.

291
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:02,288
How can you ever know what she's feeling?

292
00:21:02,705 --> 00:21:05,875
Today will be my last day
as your News Times anchor.

293
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:06,778
What?

294
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:10,382
There have been a lot of negative rumors
surrounding my character lately...

295
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,928
even though they've all been
either a misunderstanding or a lie.

296
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:15,398
But instead of feeling wronged,

297
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:18,972
I'd like to reflect and think about
how I got swept up in such a situation.

298
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:23,392
So in an attempt to show my appreciation
for the faith of my viewers...

299
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:26,117
I have decided to step down
from my anchor position.

300
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:31,198
Starting tomorrow evening,
Mr Yeon Doo-young will be in charge.

301
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:34,089
I guess she suffered some damage.
Definitely suffered some damage.

302
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:35,664
Exactly.

303
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:40,904
From now on, I'll come to you
as a reporter rather than from a studio.

304
00:21:41,344 --> 00:21:45,384
This has been Song Cha-ok
from MSC News Times.

305
00:21:46,364 --> 00:21:47,283
Thank you.

306
00:22:05,674 --> 00:22:08,614
She quit her job just yesterday
and they're already taking it down.

307
00:22:08,714 --> 00:22:10,496
Oh, you're here.

308
00:22:11,034 --> 00:22:13,626
I guess yesterday's events
did have an impact on Ms Song.

309
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:17,004
-Right?
-I guess so.

310
00:22:17,884 --> 00:22:19,415
Did she really quit her job?

311
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,324
She announced it during yesterday's news.

312
00:22:23,424 --> 00:22:24,846
That she'll be a reporter for now.

313
00:22:24,946 --> 00:22:26,422
Guess you really must've shown her.

314
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:31,106
I had my doubts,
but I now I can trust you.

315
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,273
You did great.

316
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,023
No, I wasn't that great.

317
00:22:34,113 --> 00:22:36,529
I was very close to doing
the same thing that she did.

318
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:40,514
But how come you didn't?

319
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:42,924
Because of In-ha.

320
00:22:43,024 --> 00:22:44,834
I realized it yesterday.

321
00:22:44,934 --> 00:22:47,737
I'm no longer going to be a cause
for concern to Dal-Po anymore.

322
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:51,908
I think he'll be able to forget about me,
and do what he needs to do in life.

323
00:22:52,984 --> 00:22:56,604
-Does that make you happy?
-Of course it does.

324
00:22:56,974 --> 00:23:00,094
The guilt made me feel like a sinner
in front of Dal-Po all the time.

325
00:23:01,443 --> 00:23:03,950
But I think I'll be able to sleep
more peacefully from now on.

326
00:23:07,704 --> 00:23:09,251
You should be grateful to her.

327
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:12,940
If she hadn't hiccuped,
then you would've gone out of control.

328
00:23:14,724 --> 00:23:15,874
Yeah.

329
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:19,034
-Have you thanked her?
-No.

330
00:23:19,454 --> 00:23:21,844
I only took my anger out on her,
and blamed her.

331
00:23:22,845 --> 00:23:24,291
And I feel awful about it.

332
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:29,774
You should say that to her, not me.

333
00:23:30,766 --> 00:23:33,034
Apologies should be given
to the person that they're owed to.

334
00:23:33,354 --> 00:23:35,973
Apologizing to anyone else
is just a pathetic act of self remorse.

335
00:23:37,724 --> 00:23:39,244
I know.

336
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:48,567
Want to have dinner with me tonight?

337
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,718
It's my birthday today.

338
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:53,906
I don't have any money to buy you a gift.

339
00:23:54,484 --> 00:23:56,284
I don't need a gift.

340
00:23:56,384 --> 00:23:57,899
Just have dinner with me.

341
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:01,334
Okay then.

342
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:11,674
To be honest,
it's really been a struggle for me.

343
00:24:11,774 --> 00:24:13,813
It got so bad that
I even lost my appetite.

344
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:16,164
You're quite the eater for someone
who's lost her appetite.

345
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,761
One of my biggest dilemmas in life

346
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:21,943
is that I don't lose my appetite
and look fine even when I'm really upset.

347
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,991
What are you struggling with?
What it is that you're so upset about?

348
00:24:25,091 --> 00:24:27,891
I was just upset
at the mere fact of my existence.

349
00:24:27,991 --> 00:24:30,811
I was upset at holding Dal-Po back

350
00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:32,742
and feeling like a sinner
all the time, too.

351
00:24:33,786 --> 00:24:37,431
I'm a reporter, and I was mad
at myself for almost lying for Dal-Po.

352
00:24:38,132 --> 00:24:42,333
But I don't have to lie anymore.
So my appetite has returned...

353
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,599
and even my guts
are making a healthy comeback.

354
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:46,158
Excuse me a moment.

355
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:19,166
You should say that to her, not me.

356
00:25:19,871 --> 00:25:21,895
Apologies should be given
to the person that they're owed to.

357
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,551
Uncle Dal-Po

358
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:43,193
Hello?

359
00:25:46,151 --> 00:25:48,961
-Why are you answering In-ha's phone?
-I'm with her right now.

360
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,013
She excused herself for a quick moment.
What do you want?

361
00:25:52,355 --> 00:25:55,320
-Where are you guys?
-We're at Ana Capri, right by our office.

362
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:56,809
That's not far at all from here.

363
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,607
On the first floor
with the aquarium, right?

364
00:25:58,698 --> 00:25:59,988
Yeah.

365
00:26:00,301 --> 00:26:03,231
What you said about it ending it
between you and In-ha...

366
00:26:03,331 --> 00:26:04,799
that still stands, right?

367
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:10,130
-Yeah.
-Then keep listening.

368
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:14,209
Because this is something that
I want to say to both you and In-ha.

369
00:26:20,276 --> 00:26:22,766
-Feel lighter?
-Yeah, I feel light as a feather now.

370
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:27,898
You said you were grateful to the person
that stole your text messages, right?

371
00:26:27,998 --> 00:26:29,690
Yeah, but what brings that up?

372
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,336
You said he was like a bamboo forest
and a private diary to you...

373
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,633
...and that you were disappointed because
you had no one to text anymore, right?

374
00:26:37,123 --> 00:26:40,634
Yeah, especially right now.
I have so much that I want to say.

375
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,751
The person who stole those texts...

376
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,694
was me.

377
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,550
What?

378
00:26:49,325 --> 00:26:52,828
Your mother forgot
and left her cellphone at my house.

379
00:26:53,451 --> 00:26:55,045
That's how I started
seeing your text messages.

380
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,202
-I can't believe it.
-I'm sorry.

381
00:27:01,293 --> 00:27:04,842
At first, it was just for fun,
then the fun turned into curiosity.

382
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,766
And that curiosity...

383
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,608
made me want to meet you.

384
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,290
That's why I searched for you,
and that's why I'm here now.

385
00:27:16,874 --> 00:27:18,508
I'm very well aware
of whom you have feelings for.

386
00:27:19,335 --> 00:27:22,610
And I also know how badly you want to
erase that person from your heart.

387
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:25,100
I'll help you do that.

388
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:27,628
-Bum-Jo...
-Let's date.

389
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:38,838
-Hey, I...
-You said Dal-Po doesn't care now.

390
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,843
So stop thinking about him
and find a way to get over him yourself.

391
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,497
Okay, let's date.

392
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,114
See? That sort of method
doesn't work for me.

393
00:27:56,205 --> 00:27:59,575
Fooling ourselves into dating each other
is no way to resolve anything.

394
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,411
I'm sorry.

395
00:28:03,238 --> 00:28:05,500
-Then we can start from there.
-What?

396
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,350
I'll continue to treat you well
from now on.

397
00:28:08,148 --> 00:28:09,824
I'll be so good to you...

398
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,054
to the point that you'll no longer
be able to refuse me anymore.

399
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,623
I'm different from Dal-Po.

400
00:28:15,723 --> 00:28:18,737
You don't hold me back,
and you're not a sinner to me either.

401
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:34,213
Thanks for caring for me the way you do.

402
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:37,259
But nothing is going to happen
to the point where I can't refuse you.

403
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:40,086
I won't let myself to be unable
to refuse your feelings for me.

404
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:44,369
Let's just remain friends
like we are now, okay?

405
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,857
Dinner's on me tonight.

406
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:50,535
Because I ate more than you did.

407
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:00,559
I should've offered to split the bill.

408
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:13,279
-Do you offer a payment option?
-It's already been paid.

409
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:15,791
The gentleman you were with
gave us his card when he came in.

410
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:18,379
Really? Thank goodness.

411
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:21,236
No, that's not right.
Cancel that, and put it on my card.

412
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:25,809
Forget it.
It's my birthday, so it's my treat.

413
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,049
Hey, then how about we split it?
Would that make it 125 dollars?

414
00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:37,329
I don't have any cash on me right now.

415
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:39,979
So give me your account number
and I'll wire you the money.

416
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,599
I didn't even get you a gift,
so I'd feel awful if you paid.

417
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:44,600
The worse you feel,
the better it is for me.

418
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:49,978
Get in.

419
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:09,009
I'm well aware of
who you have feelings for.

420
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:11,478
And I also know how badly you want
to erase that person from your heart.

421
00:30:21,449 --> 00:30:23,109
I'm different from Dal-Po.

422
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:26,341
You don't hold me back,
and you're not a sinner to me either.

423
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:37,044
It's not easy to make photocopying
look sexy.

424
00:30:41,803 --> 00:30:44,173
You're really
catching my attention lately, Ki Ha-myung.

425
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:57,309
What do you think she means
by remaining an ordinary reporter?

426
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,390
What if she comes to the meetings
and starts bothering you?

427
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,169
We can't let that happen.

428
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:06,649
I'm going to get trampled down by her
and end up losing the rest of my hair.

429
00:31:06,749 --> 00:31:07,653
No way, that can't happen.

430
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,680
Your mother forgot her cellphone
and left it at my house.

431
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:21,950
That's how I started
seeing your text messages.

432
00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:35,779
I was pretty shocked.

433
00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:38,076
I didn't think you'd step down
from your anchor position.

434
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:40,459
I didn't quit because of what happened.

435
00:31:40,969 --> 00:31:44,389
Sometimes, we should know
how to deal with the public opinion.

436
00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:46,503
Once you dealt with it...

437
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:50,419
is there a chance that you might return?

438
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:53,125
Not just a chance...

439
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:56,354
but I will make my return.

440
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,766
Do you and the Chairman of
Bum-Jo Department store know each other?

441
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:09,701
I've seen her around a few times.
Why do you ask?

442
00:32:10,939 --> 00:32:15,158
Not like that, but personally.
Were you at her house 13 years ago?

443
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:21,340
I'm not sure. I don't remember.

444
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:24,342
-Why?
-I was told you left your phone there.

445
00:32:25,265 --> 00:32:26,460
Then maybe I did.

446
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:28,261
Is that a problem?

447
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:31,665
No, I just find it a bit interesting.

448
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:34,141
The fact that you're actually still here
is more interesting for me.

449
00:32:47,975 --> 00:32:50,083
Chairman: Don't worry,
I don't abandon people that easily.

450
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:06,397
Ma'am, there's been
a small disturbance at the store.

451
00:33:06,497 --> 00:33:08,728
Disturbance? What kind of a disturbance?

452
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:12,376
The Santa that we hired stole something.

453
00:33:12,897 --> 00:33:14,257
What?

454
00:33:15,371 --> 00:33:18,618
-Santa stole something?
-Yes, we were quite flustered ourselves.

455
00:33:18,718 --> 00:33:21,669
Geez, that’s unbelievable.
There must've been lots of kids there.

456
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:24,168
Yes, with it being around Christmas
and all.

457
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:28,108
How are we going to fix the trauma
they received from seeing Santa steal?

458
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:30,658
Come with me. Where store is this?

459
00:33:43,078 --> 00:33:44,278
Why are you staring at me like that?

460
00:33:44,918 --> 00:33:46,907
-Is there something on my face?
-No.

461
00:33:48,808 --> 00:33:52,563
Ki Ha-myung,
do you have any Christmas plans?

462
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:56,736
I have no time for Christmas.
I haven't had any time to make any plans.

463
00:33:56,988 --> 00:33:58,620
Then I guess you don't have any plans.

464
00:33:59,768 --> 00:34:02,424
Then I'll give you
a really big Christmas present.

465
00:34:03,378 --> 00:34:04,804
What present?

466
00:34:05,768 --> 00:34:07,126
I'll tell you on Christmas day.

467
00:34:07,768 --> 00:34:09,072
You're going to be quite shocked.

468
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:26,599
Do you have anything you want to share?

469
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:29,259
-I wouldn't tell you even if I did.
-Then how about a trade?

470
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,907
-We'll trade one for one.
-No thanks.

471
00:34:31,017 --> 00:34:32,210
Come on, how about something tiny?

472
00:34:34,288 --> 00:34:35,289
I'm sorry about the other day.

473
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:38,586
I knew it was cowardly of me,
but I thought you needed to hear it.

474
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:42,597
-Glad you know that it was cowardly.
-But I am not worse than you.

475
00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:43,737
What?

476
00:34:44,067 --> 00:34:46,638
Where do you learn this kind of behavior?

477
00:34:46,907 --> 00:34:49,077
I finally understood after listening
to In-ha yesterday.

478
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:52,607
You use your brother and Ms Song as
an excuse to treat In-ha like a sinner

479
00:34:52,707 --> 00:34:55,117
but you can't even grab onto
or let In-ha go either.

480
00:34:55,507 --> 00:34:58,327
From what I can see, they're not doubts,
but you're just being a coward.

481
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:00,259
-If you're going to end it...
-I'm working on it.

482
00:35:01,897 --> 00:35:03,167
Really?

483
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,777
-Then why don't I help you and In-ha...
-Don't say that you'll help.

484
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:09,231
I'm the one that needs to end it,
not you.

485
00:35:09,321 --> 00:35:11,881
Me trying to get over her
has nothing to do with your feelings.

486
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:14,143
Don't use me as an excuse to sway In-ha.

487
00:35:15,231 --> 00:35:17,159
Hey, I don't think I like your words.

488
00:35:25,043 --> 00:35:26,851
-What's that?
-When have I...

489
00:35:27,481 --> 00:35:29,281
I'm not done talking yet!

490
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:02,581
What is he doing...?

491
00:36:11,051 --> 00:36:12,191
Are you okay?

492
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:14,994
-Are you hurt anywhere?
-No, I'm okay.

493
00:36:18,161 --> 00:36:21,294
Hey, what were you thinking
throwing your shoe at him like that?

494
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,392
Are you okay?

495
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:31,311
-Yu-Rae, are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

496
00:36:31,411 --> 00:36:32,961
I'm okay.

497
00:36:35,301 --> 00:36:37,039
I'm fine. I really am okay.

498
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:39,947
You just didn't see me down there
because I'm so tiny, right?

499
00:36:40,301 --> 00:36:42,027
What's wrong with you?
You're freaking me out.

500
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,371
Dad.

501
00:36:57,331 --> 00:36:58,301
Dad.

502
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:00,501
Dad!

503
00:37:08,281 --> 00:37:10,231
What was that about?
Did you lose the culprit?

504
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:13,565
Listen, can you just let this go
and pretend that it never happened?

505
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:15,505
-No way!
-No way!

506
00:37:19,895 --> 00:37:21,625
I'm only going to tell you guys,

507
00:37:21,715 --> 00:37:24,358
so not a word about me
losing the culprit, okay?

508
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:27,733
Tell us about the Santa first.
If we like it, then we'll bury it.

509
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:32,098
That Santa's been raising his son
who's in middle school all by himself.

510
00:37:37,848 --> 00:37:40,551
All the other students
were carrying around Le Coach backpack

511
00:37:41,035 --> 00:37:44,638
and I think he thought he son was
being bullied for not having one.

512
00:37:50,788 --> 00:37:54,207
That's why he got seasonal work
as Santa Claus at the department store.

513
00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:58,145
And he called his son and told him
that it's a special giveaway.

514
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:01,653
And stole one of those backpacks
and gave it to his son.

515
00:38:02,978 --> 00:38:05,638
Why would he steal that?
Why not just buy him one instead?

516
00:38:05,728 --> 00:38:08,602
-I doubt it costs that much.
-Not everyone can afford to buy a bag.

517
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:11,388
It's not just an ordinary bag.
It's really expensive.

518
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:14,016
It's an imported designer brand
and costs over 800 dollars.

519
00:38:14,788 --> 00:38:16,188
-That expensive?
-So expensive!

520
00:38:16,279 --> 00:38:17,518
For a school backpack?

521
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,802
Then will the Santa get off
with a warning?

522
00:38:19,902 --> 00:38:23,936
It was a misdemeanor, but it's Christmas,
so he might get charged.

523
00:38:24,232 --> 00:38:26,942
-His son is going to be left on his own.
-What are we going to do?

524
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:30,152
-That's really sad.
-It is sad, but it's also ridiculous.

525
00:38:30,252 --> 00:38:32,746
-It's just a simple theft.
-You find this simple?

526
00:38:32,846 --> 00:38:34,709
A kid's about to be on his own
over a backpack.

527
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:37,210
That's not the backpack's fault.
That's the thief's fault.

528
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,755
That backpack is to blame
for a lot of things.

529
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:42,375
It has been the cause
for bullying and violent outbursts

530
00:38:42,465 --> 00:38:43,895
and even an attempted suicide.

531
00:38:43,985 --> 00:38:44,986
Those bags are a huge problem.

532
00:38:45,582 --> 00:38:47,818
Where are these expensive backpacks
being sold?

533
00:38:49,402 --> 00:38:52,042
Bum-Jo Department store
has exclusive sales rights to it.

534
00:39:04,482 --> 00:39:05,782
Seo Bum-Jo.

535
00:39:05,872 --> 00:39:09,037
I'm really sorry to say this,
but your mother was pretty harsh.

536
00:39:10,202 --> 00:39:13,623
She may look very innocent,
but she's actually quite frightening.

537
00:39:13,992 --> 00:39:15,023
Hey, Yoon Yu-Rae.

538
00:39:15,462 --> 00:39:17,244
Get off the heated mat you're sitting on.

539
00:39:17,344 --> 00:39:19,004
My mother brought that here.

540
00:39:19,104 --> 00:39:21,586
How dare you call
my sweet mother frightening.

541
00:39:22,324 --> 00:39:25,064
Well, even her marketing strategies
are frightening.

542
00:39:25,164 --> 00:39:28,237
Don't you think selling school bags
for twice the actual price is too much?

543
00:39:28,663 --> 00:39:33,002
-This is a good item for TV news.
-It's because people are willing to pay.

544
00:39:33,102 --> 00:39:34,539
I don't think it's a good item.

545
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:39,566
Will you take responsibility if this leads
to boycotts against our store?

546
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:46,028
No, don't pour that on!
The sauce is for dipping.

547
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:50,906
What do you think?
Don't you think this is a good topic?

548
00:39:50,997 --> 00:39:53,397
Yeah, I've looked into it, too.

549
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:57,216
I think some sort of a caste system
has been created because of those bags.

550
00:39:57,316 --> 00:40:00,285
-Bullying's also become a serious issue.
-How are the bags to blame for that?

551
00:40:05,606 --> 00:40:07,146
What do you think, In-ha?

552
00:40:07,977 --> 00:40:09,584
I like my sauce poured on top.

553
00:40:09,684 --> 00:40:12,524
That's not what I was referring to.
I meant interviewing the store.

554
00:40:12,624 --> 00:40:13,702
Do you think it is a good item?

555
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:17,935
I...

556
00:40:21,754 --> 00:40:23,052
I think that it makes sense.

557
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:24,952
There are lots of questions to be asked

558
00:40:25,043 --> 00:40:27,187
about the fairness of the
price and marketing.

559
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,553
I'm sorry, Bum-Jo.

560
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:31,119
But I'm going to report this.

561
00:40:34,743 --> 00:40:35,583
Bum-Jo.

562
00:40:36,653 --> 00:40:37,973
Seo Bum-Jo!

563
00:40:42,003 --> 00:40:42,996
Bum-Jo.

564
00:40:43,173 --> 00:40:45,279
You're going to report it
even if I ask you not to, right?

565
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,853
I can't not report it
when I know about it.

566
00:40:47,953 --> 00:40:48,980
I'm sorry.

567
00:40:52,673 --> 00:40:54,740
Fine, report it.

568
00:40:55,543 --> 00:40:58,155
Since it's already to this point,
why don't you do the interview, too?

569
00:40:59,003 --> 00:41:00,695
So that you can feel
really awful about it.

570
00:41:14,323 --> 00:41:18,083
I need to stop concerning myself...
I'm seriously such a loser.

571
00:41:19,263 --> 00:41:22,013
I know that, too. I am a loser.

572
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:25,747
What are you doing over there?

573
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:32,603
I got disciplined for losing control
of that Santa.

574
00:41:32,703 --> 00:41:34,565
I think I may be assigned to patrol duty.

575
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,601
What the heck,
we even kept it buried for you.

576
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:41,821
-Take me out for a drink.
-Hey, today's Christmas Eve.

577
00:41:41,912 --> 00:41:43,848
-Why would I go drinking with you?
-Do you have any other plans?

578
00:41:45,641 --> 00:41:46,730
No.

579
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:57,505
Must be nice... geez.

580
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:04,752
-But you have a wife at home.
-That's why it's even more depressing.

581
00:42:05,131 --> 00:42:07,139
If my wife finds out
that I've been disciplined,

582
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:11,400
then I might really get to meet Jesus
on Christmas.

583
00:42:13,588 --> 00:42:16,471
I know I've got my problems, but you have
your own share of issues, too.

584
00:42:16,989 --> 00:42:19,431
Look at how pathetic you are
on the night of Christmas Eve.

585
00:42:20,033 --> 00:42:22,579
Well, this is actually decent.

586
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:26,600
-Compared to my brother.
-Right.

587
00:42:32,522 --> 00:42:34,756
I even feel guilty about the fact
that I'm having a drink right now.

588
00:42:35,662 --> 00:42:37,662
Even just walking around out and about
makes me feel guilty.

589
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:42,123
I also feel bad about being able
to spend my time with anyone.

590
00:42:43,523 --> 00:42:46,813
I feel bad about laughing
and feeling excited about someone.

591
00:42:48,592 --> 00:42:51,959
Hey, why would you feel guilty
for any of that?

592
00:42:52,379 --> 00:42:55,719
You are not your brother
and he is not you.

593
00:42:57,789 --> 00:43:00,289
Ma'am, can I get another beer?

594
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:06,606
It's me you should feel bad for,
not your brother.

595
00:43:07,706 --> 00:43:10,699
Where's your home?
Tell me what your home address is.

596
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,684
It's in Seoul...

597
00:43:16,229 --> 00:43:18,135
What is this?

598
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:20,221
Hello, misters.

599
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:21,956
Do you remember me?

600
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:25,271
My name is Ahn Chan Soo, and
I'm a friend of In-ha's and Dal-po's.

601
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:28,487
My daughter wasn't enough of a drunk,
so we have to add another to the list?

602
00:43:31,331 --> 00:43:34,011
Oh, my. Why did he have so much to drink?

603
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:39,310
He kept muttering on about
feeling bad and guilty for his brother.

604
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,246
He feels guilty for being able
to walk around outside

605
00:43:42,346 --> 00:43:44,267
and for being able to see
and be around other people...

606
00:43:45,246 --> 00:43:48,386
...and even for being able
to smile at someone.

607
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:51,124
So he kept drinking,
and that's how he ended up so drunk.

608
00:43:52,515 --> 00:43:54,165
Get up, you little brat.

609
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,615
-Father!
-Right?

610
00:43:59,335 --> 00:44:02,453
I brought you some ginkgo nuts.

611
00:44:02,563 --> 00:44:04,021
I know how much you like them.

612
00:44:06,113 --> 00:44:09,095
And I have something for you, too.

613
00:44:09,453 --> 00:44:10,533
Here's some dried squid for you.

614
00:44:13,553 --> 00:44:15,664
It's my Christmas gift for you.

615
00:44:18,796 --> 00:44:22,713
I brought pop corn for In-ha.
This is for In-ha.

616
00:44:26,884 --> 00:44:31,108
That was for your Christmas gifts?
I was wondering why you kept taking those.

617
00:44:31,803 --> 00:44:34,354
I hate this guy!

618
00:44:34,454 --> 00:44:39,864
-You didn't have to bring us anything.
-Father...

619
00:44:40,004 --> 00:44:44,608
-The ginkgo nuts were really good.
-Okay, okay.

620
00:44:58,814 --> 00:45:00,424
In-ha.

621
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:06,544
You're awake?

622
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,157
You should get some more sleep.

623
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:13,873
You're running a fever.

624
00:45:25,624 --> 00:45:27,192
This is a dream, isn't it?

625
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:32,193
Why did you have so much to drink
when you can't even handle it?

626
00:45:33,914 --> 00:45:35,986
Get some more sleep. You look tired.

627
00:45:43,244 --> 00:45:45,367
I can't ask you to be with me right now.

628
00:45:46,704 --> 00:45:47,901
But...

629
00:45:54,974 --> 00:45:57,041
don't go to anyone else.

630
00:46:00,254 --> 00:46:02,277
Okay, I won't.

631
00:46:18,094 --> 00:46:19,549
I don't want to wake up from this dream.

632
00:46:50,954 --> 00:46:52,504
Where am I?

633
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:54,704
Honey, get me some water.

634
00:46:54,804 --> 00:46:56,754
What the heck is he doing here?

635
00:46:58,604 --> 00:47:00,574
It reeks of booze in here.

636
00:47:01,324 --> 00:47:04,481
I made hangover soup for you guys.
Chan-soo.

637
00:47:06,104 --> 00:47:08,064
Wake up and come have some soup.

638
00:47:08,164 --> 00:47:09,281
Mr Choi...

639
00:47:21,014 --> 00:47:23,834
-Sit down and have some breakfast.
-I really need to get going.

640
00:47:23,934 --> 00:47:26,217
We'll be late whether we leave now
or in a few minutes.

641
00:47:29,164 --> 00:47:30,558
Thank you for the meal!

642
00:47:31,794 --> 00:47:34,232
-In-ha, aren't you going to eat?
-I already ate.

643
00:47:36,694 --> 00:47:38,194
Come sit down.

644
00:47:40,104 --> 00:47:42,425
What are you waiting for?
Come on, let's eat.

645
00:47:49,254 --> 00:47:51,788
Your fever's gone. Let's eat.

646
00:47:52,944 --> 00:47:55,398
In-ha, do something
with my brother's hair, would you?

647
00:47:56,004 --> 00:47:57,059
It looks like a bird's nest.

648
00:47:58,754 --> 00:48:00,414
Alright.

649
00:48:09,084 --> 00:48:12,474
I'm sorry about last night.
I must've been drunker than I thought.

650
00:48:12,574 --> 00:48:16,214
-I'll make sure never to...
-This is not a good topic for now.

651
00:48:16,324 --> 00:48:18,424
Let's just eat our breakfast, okay?

652
00:48:18,934 --> 00:48:23,024
Okay, it's a very Merry Christmas.
Let's eat.

653
00:48:23,114 --> 00:48:24,504
-Yes.
-Yes.

654
00:48:24,604 --> 00:48:26,472
-Merry Christmas.
-Okay.

655
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:39,814
I was really worried that your father
might collapse from shock.

656
00:48:39,914 --> 00:48:41,534
He seems to be fine. That's a relief.

657
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:42,557
Sure.

658
00:48:44,995 --> 00:48:45,835
Grim Reaper

659
00:48:46,374 --> 00:48:48,017
I'm dead meat. It's my wife.

660
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:50,765
Hurry and pick up and beg for mercy.

661
00:48:51,406 --> 00:48:53,454
Why should I beg? I'm a man.

662
00:48:55,669 --> 00:48:57,718
Yeah, honey. Merry Christmas!

663
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,706
I'm on my knees right now.

664
00:49:02,192 --> 00:49:04,133
I slept over at Dal-po's house.

665
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:05,393
Really...

666
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:09,891
Why did you file a missing person's
report? I'm a police officer.

667
00:49:14,609 --> 00:49:15,764
I'm sorry.

668
00:49:17,103 --> 00:49:19,629
About what?
That could happen if you're drunk.

669
00:49:19,952 --> 00:49:21,787
I overstepped my boundaries
with you too last time.

670
00:49:21,887 --> 00:49:23,287
It's not that...

671
00:49:23,387 --> 00:49:25,273
I'm sorry about forcing you
into lying that time.

672
00:49:26,446 --> 00:49:27,717
I'm truly sorry.

673
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,337
It wasn't something that
a reporter should have said.

674
00:49:30,437 --> 00:49:32,333
I must have momentarily lost my mind.

675
00:49:32,423 --> 00:49:34,774
That's right. You were too harsh then.

676
00:49:36,523 --> 00:49:39,364
But I've decided to let you off this time

677
00:49:39,464 --> 00:49:40,571
since your questions
to my mom were great.

678
00:49:40,661 --> 00:49:42,943
-Nice?
-It's true.

679
00:49:43,043 --> 00:49:45,313
They were questions
I wanted to ask her myself.

680
00:49:45,815 --> 00:49:47,915
I was happy that you could say
what was on your mind

681
00:49:48,005 --> 00:49:49,475
without tiptoeing around me.

682
00:49:49,565 --> 00:49:51,295
I felt much better, too.

683
00:49:52,975 --> 00:49:54,869
It's gotten comfortable for me
to see you now.

684
00:49:59,025 --> 00:50:00,432
By any chance, In-ha...

685
00:50:05,025 --> 00:50:07,145
Never mind. Let's go.

686
00:50:27,088 --> 00:50:28,676
What are you doing with that ribbon?

687
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:31,635
-Hey, have you seen Ha-myung?
-No, I haven't.

688
00:50:31,735 --> 00:50:34,265
What the heck? He hasn't been
picking up his phone all day.

689
00:50:38,465 --> 00:50:39,769
You're out, Ki Ha-myung.

690
00:50:41,236 --> 00:50:42,076
Geez...

691
00:50:43,219 --> 00:50:45,464
He deserves something really horrible!

692
00:50:56,635 --> 00:50:59,492
That kid's back again. It's cold out, too.

693
00:51:00,055 --> 00:51:01,223
Goodness.

694
00:51:01,864 --> 00:51:03,535
He's that Santa's son, isn't he?

695
00:51:03,635 --> 00:51:04,821
Yes.

696
00:51:05,045 --> 00:51:08,595
Things wouldn't be this bad if it weren't
for that department owner's son.

697
00:51:08,695 --> 00:51:10,465
Department owner?

698
00:51:11,007 --> 00:51:14,091
-Bum-jo's mother?
-Yeah, that badger-looking woman.

699
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,591
Everyone said to go easy on him
and not report him

700
00:51:16,691 --> 00:51:18,259
because they felt  bad for him.

701
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:21,623
But she said to hand him over
to the police and not go easy on him.

702
00:51:21,723 --> 00:51:24,903
Is that right?
She didn't seem that dreadful.

703
00:51:25,003 --> 00:51:26,735
She looked pretty innocent
for her age, too.

704
00:51:26,835 --> 00:51:29,351
That innocent lady said
not to go easy on him

705
00:51:29,471 --> 00:51:31,174
even though he begged for mercy.

706
00:51:31,274 --> 00:51:33,572
Because of her, that kid
got separated from his father,

707
00:51:33,672 --> 00:51:35,535
and I was assigned
to the branch precinct.

708
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:37,864
-She really said that?
-Yeah.

709
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:40,944
That chairman is sneakier than you are.

710
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,237
Hey!

711
00:51:46,345 --> 00:51:48,424
You won't get to see your dad
even if you stand out here.

712
00:51:50,083 --> 00:51:52,455
I'll let you see your dad later on.

713
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:54,564
All right? Go home.

714
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:08,405
Yes. This is Ki Ha-myung
of Han River district.

715
00:52:08,505 --> 00:52:10,803
You know about the Bum-Jo
Department store story today, right?

716
00:52:10,903 --> 00:52:11,887
Yes, Captain.

717
00:52:11,977 --> 00:52:14,234
-Did you obtain permission from them?
-Yes, sir.

718
00:52:14,334 --> 00:52:15,834
I contacted their PR team,

719
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:19,074
but they refused when I told them.
They said they couldn't cooperate.

720
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,004
There's no reporter
that's given a warm welcome.

721
00:52:22,204 --> 00:52:24,844
Because a reporter's job
is to dig up secrets people want to hide.

722
00:52:24,935 --> 00:52:27,395
If they refuse to cooperate even after
we've asked for their permission...

723
00:52:28,929 --> 00:52:30,715
...then, we have no choice
but to barge our way in.

724
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,501
I'm hoping that you'll go easy today.

725
00:52:42,884 --> 00:52:45,524
-What is that supposed to mean?
-I mean...

726
00:52:45,624 --> 00:52:48,334
You don't really like me
all that much lately.

727
00:52:48,434 --> 00:52:51,102
I'm just worried that you'll end up
taking it out on my mom.

728
00:52:52,344 --> 00:52:53,712
Do I look like that kind of person?

729
00:52:53,812 --> 00:52:55,870
Yes. Totally.

730
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,351
You must be out of your mind!

731
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,290
Welcome.

732
00:53:11,463 --> 00:53:12,312
Please stop filming.

733
00:53:14,705 --> 00:53:16,090
Hold on.

734
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:22,725
Are you aware that
there was a stealing incident

735
00:53:22,816 --> 00:53:24,269
because of this bag not too long ago?

736
00:53:24,527 --> 00:53:26,973
Excuse me. Please stop filming.

737
00:53:27,063 --> 00:53:30,044
Why do you charge same bags for more than
twice as much here than overseas?

738
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:31,704
I don't know!

739
00:53:31,794 --> 00:53:33,844
I'm not the one who made the price.

740
00:53:36,784 --> 00:53:39,617
What should we do if they refuse
to give us an interview?

741
00:53:40,147 --> 00:53:43,309
First turn off the cameras,
and then continue to ask the questions.

742
00:53:43,409 --> 00:53:44,663
Turn the cameras off?

743
00:53:44,753 --> 00:53:48,428
We have to keep filming,
but they can't have us film.

744
00:53:50,763 --> 00:53:53,302
Fine, we won't film.

745
00:53:54,603 --> 00:53:55,859
Just talk to us then, huh?

746
00:53:56,709 --> 00:53:59,308
You lower the camera and pretend like
you're not filming when you are.

747
00:53:59,408 --> 00:54:01,233
You're really not filming, right?

748
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:03,503
Take a look.
The camera light is turned off.

749
00:54:06,723 --> 00:54:08,213
We're saved.

750
00:54:08,313 --> 00:54:10,870
From the moment they think that
they aren't being filmed on camera...

751
00:54:11,404 --> 00:54:13,143
...they'll tell you
what they really think.

752
00:54:13,243 --> 00:54:15,493
To be frank with you,
what blame do we have?

753
00:54:15,593 --> 00:54:17,073
It's the customers' problem.

754
00:54:17,173 --> 00:54:19,533
If the expert comes in
and gets to the point at that time,

755
00:54:19,633 --> 00:54:21,503
we can get a better story
that matches up.

756
00:54:22,335 --> 00:54:23,509
An expert?

757
00:54:25,551 --> 00:54:26,823
Welcome.

758
00:54:32,693 --> 00:54:34,683
Miss, how much is this bag?

759
00:54:34,783 --> 00:54:36,843
I brought my mother's credit card
with me.

760
00:54:38,303 --> 00:54:39,914
What type of bag would you like?

761
00:54:41,683 --> 00:54:43,972
I heard that there's a really
popular luxury brand one lately.

762
00:54:44,558 --> 00:54:46,124
Two... what was it?

763
00:54:46,714 --> 00:54:48,770
-Oh, Two Plus level?
-Yes, that one.

764
00:54:49,374 --> 00:54:54,105
These parents have ranked our bags
like they do for beef.

765
00:54:54,878 --> 00:54:57,629
This is a Two Plus
that costs 1,000 dollars.

766
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,974
This is a One Plus
that costs 900 dollars.

767
00:55:00,704 --> 00:55:03,813
Wow, they really are expensive.
I wanted to get one for my niece.

768
00:55:18,864 --> 00:55:21,784
-Let's hurry, I think YGN is here.
-Yes.

769
00:55:23,327 --> 00:55:26,689
You know what they say.
'It's exceptional because it's expensive.'

770
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:28,851
The more expensive it is,
the more customers look for them.

771
00:55:33,314 --> 00:55:34,283
You should stop it.

772
00:55:35,261 --> 00:55:38,484
Do you still have to do that kind of
marketing when it's for highschoolers?

773
00:55:39,474 --> 00:55:40,974
I said that's enough!

774
00:55:42,032 --> 00:55:43,630
What on earth do you want to hear?

775
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:47,411
Are you calling my mother a spine-breaker
who sucks the parents dry of money?

776
00:55:47,502 --> 00:55:50,632
Are you calling her a businesswoman
who's only obsessed with making money?

777
00:55:51,287 --> 00:55:52,673
What is it that you want to say?

778
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:56,563
I want to tell the truth.

779
00:55:56,663 --> 00:55:59,496
If what we have heard so far is true,
then it's exactly what you said.

780
00:56:00,684 --> 00:56:03,405
What? Don't talk about my mom like that.

781
00:56:07,653 --> 00:56:09,033
What are you guys doing?

782
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:10,800
Don't you know
we're in the middle of a scoop?

783
00:56:11,758 --> 00:56:13,297
What are you guys doing?

784
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:16,483
What do you think you're doing, huh?

785
00:56:16,913 --> 00:56:18,483
What are those guys doing?

786
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,673
-Stop it!
-What's with it with you guys, huh?

787
00:56:21,773 --> 00:56:24,083
You'll end up in the news
if you keep this up!

788
00:56:26,653 --> 00:56:28,923
If you have a grudge against me,
then take it out on me!

789
00:56:29,023 --> 00:56:30,598
Don't make my mother look like a snob!

790
00:56:30,688 --> 00:56:32,568
Look at this
with an objective reporter's eye.

791
00:56:32,678 --> 00:56:34,348
Can't you see how wrong your mother is?

792
00:56:34,438 --> 00:56:36,758
Stop it. Your words are
too harsh right now.

793
00:56:39,878 --> 00:56:40,919
What?

794
00:56:41,019 --> 00:56:44,274
I think it's too early for you
to speak of business skills or snobbery

795
00:56:44,374 --> 00:56:46,075
without hearing Bum-jo's mother's
side of the story.

796
00:56:47,609 --> 00:56:48,449
You seriously...

797
00:57:02,754 --> 00:57:05,848
Bum-Jo Department Store
Current Sales Report

798
00:57:13,827 --> 00:57:15,524
Stay out of this for the time being.

799
00:57:16,444 --> 00:57:18,504
I'm sorry for causing trouble for you.

800
00:57:18,604 --> 00:57:19,904
Don't worry.

801
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:22,294
I don't cast people aside that easily.

802
00:57:22,394 --> 00:57:24,299
I'll trust you and wait for your word.

803
00:57:43,851 --> 00:57:45,279
As expected, it was a dream.

804
00:58:14,634 --> 00:58:16,531
But why is that shirt so big on you?

805
00:58:17,248 --> 00:58:19,243
This used to be one of Dal-po's shirts.

806
00:58:19,343 --> 00:58:21,563
You should sew some buttons on that.

807
00:58:21,663 --> 00:58:23,600
It's so cold out.

808
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,183
Is that right?

809
00:58:34,523 --> 00:58:35,457
Thanks.

810
00:58:36,518 --> 00:58:37,789
For taking my side.

811
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,729
I didn't take your side.
Don't be mistaken.

812
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,699
-My eyes are going to strain.
-What are you doing?

813
00:59:09,824 --> 00:59:10,567
Dal-Po.

814
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:12,387
We haven't met in 13 years.

815
00:59:12,697 --> 00:59:14,097
That's how close we are.

816
00:59:14,197 --> 00:59:16,347
I think your mother used the news
for her own marketing.

817
00:59:16,437 --> 00:59:18,592
Crazy bastard.
Say something that makes sense.

818
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:22,050
-Something's starting to bother people.
-October 23th, 2000...

819
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,080
Ki Ha-myung.

820
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:25,533
Breaking news. Near the Han River...

821
00:59:25,633 --> 00:59:27,452
How many missing people?
And how many injured?
