1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,760
Pinocchio

2
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,332
New police of hope carries out duty
to the fullest

3
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,110
Hello.

4
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,890
I'm Kang Seong-hak,
a new trainee from NTS.

5
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,510
Welcome.

6
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,714
It's your first time doing mawari?

7
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,540
Mawari: slang term for a trainee reporter
who collect news at a police station

8
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,610
3 days later

9
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,000
Nice to meet you.

10
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,160
I'm trainee reporter
from YGN, Choi Dal-Po.

11
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,430
Welcome.

12
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,010
It's your first time doing mawari?

13
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,800
They were similar to zombies.

14
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,210
Zombies that stayed awake
and starved for 24 hours.

15
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,760
And not long after...

16
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,860
I became a zombie like them.

17
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,330
Episode 6 - The Adventures
of 15 Year Old Boy

18
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,780
6 hours earlier

19
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,990
So dirty.

20
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,090
Boss.

21
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,260
How can you be so senseless
to cut your fingernails at work?

22
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,060
You're so senseless to
be watching TV at work.

23
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,000
Turn it off quickly.

24
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,060
There are so many ways to show
that you're a single father.

25
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,250
Isn't a reporter supposed
to communicate the truth?

26
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,280
I think any news reports relayed
by a reporter who can't lie

27
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,940
-...can only build...
-Huh? This?

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,690
- Isn't this your daughter?
- No.

29
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm confident.

30
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,030
As you just saw,
I'm a Pinocchio that can't lie.

31
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,250
Your daughter was a reporter?

32
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,200
I'm the first Pinocchio
reporter in Korea.

33
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,900
She looks amazing now
that she put make up on.

34
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,490
How can a daughter like that
come out of someone like you?

35
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,030
It's such a mystery.

36
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,900
I will only relay the truth.

37
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,160
- Welcome.
- Second.

38
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,490
I promise...

39
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,510
-...to keep my first rule.
-Who is this?

40
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,150
Aren't you perhaps...

41
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,100
...the person on the news?

42
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,730
Your name is...

43
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,360
Song... Song...

44
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,470
I'm Song Cha-ok.

45
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,960
That's right.

46
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,490
What brings you here?

47
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,350
Are you looking for a house?

48
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,290
But please let me have
your autograph first.

49
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,470
I'm sorry but I'm going to talk
with this person first.

50
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,630
With who?

51
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,230
With boss?

52
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,740
Do you two know each other?

53
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,000
She's my ex-wife.

54
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,890
Leave us alone for a bit.

55
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,550
No way.

56
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,530
You're awesome.

57
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,820
I really respect you, boss.

58
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,060
That's amazing.

59
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,660
Mystery solved.

60
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,430
Mystery solved.

61
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,050
What's going on?

62
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,430
I had something to talk about.

63
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,360
It's about In-ha.

64
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,410
On last 26th...`

65
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,090
poisonous matter was detected on the
body discovered at the fire incident

66
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,360
at Han River container yard.

67
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,590
The police is now expanding
the investigations.

68
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,190
The police assumed that it was a
simple fire accident at the time

69
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,978
but after a thorough autopsy

70
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,320
the poisonous matter was detected.

71
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,020
The police say that Mr Moon who has
debt connections with both men

72
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,530
went in hiding after the incident.

73
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,011
They are investigating to see
if there's a connection with the case.

74
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,970
Are you Mr Moon Duk-soo?

75
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,990
No one will find out...

76
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,680
about your death.

77
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,290
They'll believe you're hiding somewhere.

78
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,540
Everyone in this world

79
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,900
will remember you as the devil
that killed your juniors for money.

80
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,730
Here's the next news.

81
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,460
- Civil servant...
- My goodness.

82
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,540
He's an evil man.

83
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,080
He killed his juniors just because of money?

84
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,230
We have to arrest him

85
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,640
and annihilate his entire
family and relatives.

86
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,830
You're right.

87
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,260
Oh, that's right.

88
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,880
Here, I got the repair cost
for your bumper.

89
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,910
I told you that you didn't need to.

90
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,650
“I told you that you didn't need to.”

91
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,570
I did it because I knew you'll say that.

92
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,370
How are you planning to survive
in this harsh world being so gentle?

93
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,930
I'm not that gentle.

94
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,830
By the way, what did he say?

95
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,510
Did he compensate easily?

96
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,530
Of course.

97
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,070
He said he was waiting for your call.

98
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,180
He had well behaved and had good manners.

99
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,340
Now that I see you...

100
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,980
I think he looked a lot like you.

101
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,670
Like me?

102
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,530
Yeah.

103
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,040
He was tall

104
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,310
and his eyes were long and bright.

105
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,270
He looked a lot like you.

106
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,660
This.

107
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,160
Today is the announcement which police
station we'll be stationed at, right?

108
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,260
Yeah.

109
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,500
But the candidate who will be under the
Nitpicker is currently Choi Dal-Po, right?

110
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,590
As long as there's no change,
don't you think so?

111
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,410
It was huge that he ditched last time.

112
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,390
That's too bad.

113
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,990
He was working hard other times.

114
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,350
Yeah.

115
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,090
- Captain isn't here yet, right?
- No.

116
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,230
Did you just finish?

117
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,940
Yeah.

118
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,500
I stayed up two full nights.

119
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Are you ready for mawari?
Did you buy hot packs?

120
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,360
Why do I need that?

121
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,050
Oh, my goodness.

122
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,620
You really don't know anything.
Hot packs are basic for mawari.

123
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,780
Since it's urgent,
I'll give you some of mine.

124
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,400
This is hot pack for your long johns.

125
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,448
Careful not to stick it to your skin
or you'll get burned.

126
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,340
They say if you do mawari,
you can't even eat well.

127
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,158
You'll need it when it's urgent.

128
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,210
You know cell phone is more
important than your life, right?

129
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:17,691
Back up battery is a must.

130
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,300
Fighting.

131
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,750
You'll do well.

132
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,820
And don't cry.

133
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,750
Thanks.

134
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,530
But you guys are doing
the mawari too though.

135
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,730
Everyone is here?

136
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,430
- Yes.
- Yes, Cap.

137
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,950
From about an hour from now,
starting at 11 PM

138
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,350
you'll be assigned to a police station,
fire station, courthouse and hospital

139
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,730
to report any case that's happening.

140
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,780
Do you understand?

141
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,850
Yes, Sir.

142
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,460
Once you start mawari, it will be
impossible to go home for a while.

143
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,620
So change into comfortable clothing

144
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,740
and pack everything you need including
outerwear, inner wear and toiletries.

145
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,380
Yes, Sir.

146
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,220
Then I will announce your district.

147
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,550
- First, Mapo District. Cha Woo-chul.
- Yes, Sir.

148
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,610
- Gwanak District. Min Hye-young.
- Yes, Sir.

149
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,250
Han River District. Choi Dal-Po.

150
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,820
Yes, Sir.

151
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,520
And Yoon Yoo-Rae is also
Han River District.

152
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Why?

153
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,160
I mean...

154
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,710
Isn't it a rule to put one trainee
per district?

155
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,930
Who made that kind of rule?

156
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,630
I think I made it myself.

157
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,880
Do you not like Han River District?

158
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,680
No. I like it.

159
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,730
I'll be going.

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,830
Yeah?

161
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,820
My district has been assigned
two trainees.

162
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,280
Since I have no younger reporter under me,
I'm going to tired twice as much.

163
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,860
What do you mean why?

164
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,610
It's because...

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,479
...I have to take care
of the two by myself.

166
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,460
Yoon Yoo-Rae.

167
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Are you crying?

168
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,330
No, Sir.

169
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,720
I just yawned.

170
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,110
Are you alright?

171
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,360
Yeah.

172
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,830
Can you give back what I gave you before?

173
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,520
Okay.

174
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,920
The back up battery too.

175
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,330
Oh, my.

176
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,590
Senior Jang Hyun-gyu

177
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,300
Yes, hello.

178
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,360
Hello?

179
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,940
Are you kidding me?
Answer the phone properly!

180
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,700
Yes. I'm Han River trainee, Choi Dal-Po.

181
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,910
Where are you now?

182
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,350
I'm waiting for the elevator.

183
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,070
How are you still waiting for elevator!

184
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,570
Run immediately!

185
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,810
Yes. I understand.

186
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
Poor guys.

187
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,430
Do your best.

188
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,120
- Let's see each other again alive.
- Cheer up.

189
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,720
Other colleagues have
already started the mawari.

190
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,840
You two are starting now because
you're special employees.

191
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
You'll have to catch up hard.

192
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,670
Why are you speaking
honorifics to young trainee?

193
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:56,760
Speak casually.

194
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,730
When the time comes.

195
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,550
If you get to Han River by 11 PM, you'll
have time to pack your things, right?

196
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,950
Yes. That's enough.

197
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,570
Are you treating tenderly
because they have connections?

198
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,410
Don't do that and treat
them like you usually do.

199
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,980
Do I look like I'm treating you tenderly?

200
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,070
No, it just seems like
you're a nice person.

201
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:21,860
We'll do our best!

202
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,340
Then work hard.

203
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,500
Yes.

204
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,660
Are you walking right now?

205
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,470
- Excuse me?
- Sorry?

206
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,060
I'm just worried.

207
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,580
I heard that YGN is starting
their mawari today also.

208
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,080
If you're moving that slow,

209
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,800
I might transform into
an outdated and uncivilized person.

210
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,670
That kind of worry.

211
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,390
I'm not sure what you mean...

212
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,510
He's telling us to run, you idiot.

213
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:00,749
Yes. This is Choi In-ha.

214
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,680
You'll be answering the phone before
it rings three times when I call.

215
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,400
Whether you're going poop or
sleeping, you have to answer.

216
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,600
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

217
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,970
- I understand.
- Your breathing is calm.

218
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,920
You must be walking leisurely.

219
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,790
I'm running but I'll run faster.

220
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,380
We'll begin the news competition against
YGN at the same time in 48 hours.

221
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,840
I hope you stay alert.

222
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,740
Your breathing is nice.

223
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,110
Do you have anything to say?

224
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
No.

225
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,340
I'll treat you well.

226
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,860
The report will be given during
24 hours in two hour interval.

227
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,910
Choi Dal-Po will report even hours and
Yoon Yoo-Rae will report odd hours.

228
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,710
If you find a case, you'll report right
away with no delay for even one second.

229
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,860
Do you understand?

230
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,900
As soon as you arrive, find out the
organization of four police stations

231
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,859
within Han River District, and contact
information of Chiefs and team leaders.

232
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,550
Report is the life for mawari.

233
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,830
Check on police station,
rift valley and fire station every hour.

234
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,300
Don't lose any case that
happens and report it.

235
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,350
Do you understand?

236
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,840
Yes. I understand.

237
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,580
You can't share information with other
trainees or be generous to them.

238
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,590
They are not your colleagues
but your competitors.

239
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,710
Do you understand?

240
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,120
Yes, I understand.

241
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,030
Uncle.

242
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,369
Why are you coming out of there?

243
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,830
It's...

244
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,190
What is this?

245
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,242
You didn't tell him that
you've become MSC reporter?

246
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,030
Let's greet each other first.

247
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,634
We met each other once
at the interview, right?

248
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,060
I'm Seo Bum-Jo who became
MSC reporter with In-ha...

249
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,960
as a special employee.

250
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,130
Special employee? What special employee?

251
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,740
I received a call from mom.

252
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,100
She asked me if I wanted to be an intern.

253
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,680
She said she needed me for PR, so...

254
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
For PR?

255
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,380
A promise from Korea's
first Pinocchio reporter

256
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,890
You should hear her till end.

257
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,080
I don't think she finished.

258
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,630
Let go.

259
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
Uncle!

260
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:28,770
Uncle!

261
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:29,830
That bastard!

262
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,230
What is this?

263
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,360
Did I just curse?

264
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,230
What in the world?

265
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,210
Uncle.

266
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Dal-Po.

267
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:50,960
Let go!

268
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,120
Listen to me.

269
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,721
Why do you want to be a reporter so bad?

270
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,760
You want to go to your mom, that bad?

271
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,300
Even when abandoned you, used you
and stepped all over your pride.

272
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,000
It's not because of mom but you!

273
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,150
- What?
- Choi Dal-Po, you started this.

274
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,060
I started this because of you.

275
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,820
What are you talking about?

276
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,030
Eight years ago...

277
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,020
- Quark.
- When you went to the quiz...

278
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,200
and destroyed that bad rumors

279
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,770
as I watched it...

280
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,310
I feel my heart was burning.

281
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,570
That's right.

282
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,200
As I watched you on TV, when teacher and
all the kids changed their minds...

283
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,330
That All-zero.

284
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,030
It seems like he's a genius
rather than an idiot.

285
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,360
Do you know how gratifying
and thrilling it was?

286
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,630
It was from then...

287
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,490
...that I started dreaming
about becoming a reporter.

288
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,800
It's because of me?

289
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,600
That's right.

290
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,500
It's not my mom but you.

291
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,580
That day still remains here...

292
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,910
so wonderfully.

293
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,500
Enough that not even
a second could be erased.

294
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,320
That's why I made it all the way here.

295
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,230
No matter how much dad opposes

296
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,560
and no matter how mom steps
on my pride, it doesn't matter.

297
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,667
I'm going to pursue it.

298
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,830
I don't need you to cheer me on anymore.

299
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,730
No.

300
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,970
I would like you to continue
to nitpick and oppose me. So that...

301
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,718
I can fall out of love with you
and settle my feelings easily.

302
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,428
In-ha.

303
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,490
Those guys...

304
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,220
The more you stop me, the more
I'm just going to want to do it.

305
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,090
You know right? That I'm a rebel.

306
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,470
My personality is nasty so when
someone stops me, I do it more.

307
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,380
So there's no use for you
to try to stop me.

308
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,690
Why are you pretending
to be a mom so suddenly?

309
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,280
Now that you saw her

310
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,660
and you want to take her again?

311
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,560
No.

312
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,010
It's because I don't want
to take her again.

313
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,490
You have to take good care of her,
so that she won't come to me.

314
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,490
What are you talking about?

315
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,200
I know In-ha well.

316
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,760
If you stop her, she does more and if you
tell her not to go, she'll go further.

317
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,050
Just like me.

318
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,830
So don't be a parent who turns
his own child into a sinner

319
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
and let her do what she wants.

320
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,920
That's the only way for you
to keep In-ha by your side.

321
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,810
How will you convince your father?

322
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,200
If he finds out you and that woman...

323
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,560
I mean...

324
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,450
you and your mom are working
at the same TV station,

325
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,930
he'll be quite distressed.

326
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,390
Why are you talking about me
when I'm not here?

327
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,360
Dad.

328
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,550
Sir.

329
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,810
Leave me out of this.

330
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't have any intention to
stop In-ha to become a reporter.

331
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,500
What is this?

332
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,630
High Heels.

333
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,060
You can't be on the TV
wearing something like that.

334
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,700
Then I can be a reporter?

335
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,700
Go ahead.

336
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,660
Can I work at MSC?

337
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,560
Go ahead.

338
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,890
Then dad, are you cheering me on?

339
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
No.

340
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,980
- Thanks, Dad.
- Hey hey.

341
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,460
- I said I'm not cheering you on.
- Oh, dad.

342
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,890
Get down. You're breaking my back.

343
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,580
Thanks, Dad.

344
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,830
What are you thanking for?

345
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,450
Get down.

346
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,600
Where are you sleeping?

347
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,400
There's a place for reporters
to sleep at the police station.

348
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,570
It's not a place like the
holding cell, right?

349
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,820
No way. The reporters sleep there.

350
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,360
It can't be like the holding cell.

351
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,360
Don't worry too much.

352
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,990
You have to call me if it's too hard.

353
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,920
What is a mom good for?
Use me like a chance card.

354
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,530
Don't endure foolishly.

355
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,450
Okay?

356
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,620
Yes, mother.

357
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,660
You're not supposed to hang high
heels on your neck but wear them.

358
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,990
When you're on mawari, you have to walk
tens of kilometers so I can't wear these.

359
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,053
I have to finish my training to wear them,
so I'll hang them on my neck till then.

360
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,120
Since you started, go as far as you can.

361
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,990
Let me live by spending money
my daughter gives me.

362
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,060
Yes.

363
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,560
Dad.

364
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,000
Dad.

365
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,740
I'm going to wear these
until they're completely worn out.

366
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,000
Stop it. It's going to rot.

367
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,040
Dad...

368
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,130
Oh, my.

369
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,720
What's with this ruckus?

370
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,080
Oh, my.

371
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,460
Here.

372
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,060
That mawari or whatever...

373
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,710
must mean that you're living at
the police station or something.

374
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Yes, sort of.

375
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,400
I have to go around the police station,

376
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,490
fire station and courthouse
for 24 hours and look for a case.

377
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:28,100
So I can't come home for a while.

378
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,030
Hey.

379
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,160
Hey.

380
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,450
Dal-Po.

381
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,550
I bought gloves.

382
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,640
Wear these when it's cold
while you collect news.

383
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,350
Why do you keep spending money on me?

384
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,564
You don't even have money.

385
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,200
That's why...

386
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,280
That's why...

387
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,980
What money would I have?

388
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,260
Oh, my.

389
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,890
Pack up.

390
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,160
Pack your things.

391
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,820
No way...

392
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,470
My third.

393
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,910
My fourth.

394
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,690
My fourth.

395
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,390
My fourth.

396
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,320
Father!

397
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,290
You make money so you could spend it.

398
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,890
Seriously.

399
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,490
What district are you, uncle?

400
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Han River District.

401
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,680
What about you?

402
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,500
Me too.

403
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:19,750
That's good.

404
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,050
If we compete and screw each other

405
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,660
I should fall out of love with you.

406
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,560
Don't you think so?

407
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,250
Yeah.

408
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,200
I'm not going to go easy on you.

409
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,890
So don't go easy on me.

410
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,260
Okay.

411
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:34,790
Right.

412
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,830
I'm going to return these.

413
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:40,760
Why?

414
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,490
I feel like I can finally settle
the feelings I have for you.

415
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,830
It's not settled yet.

416
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,850
Sorry.

417
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,130
I must have been hasty.

418
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,360
Don't worry.

419
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,000
I should be able to settle it soon.

420
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,030
Darn it. Darn it. I'm going crazy.

421
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,400
Han River Police station
quickly please, Sir.

422
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,300
Yes.

423
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,170
To Han River Police station, Sir.

424
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,490
There'll be traffic if we take flyover,
so turn left and take the main road.

425
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Nice to meet you.

426
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,420
I'm YNG trainee, Choi Dal-Po.

427
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,680
Welcome.

428
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,990
It's your first time doing mawari, right?

429
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,000
Who is this?

430
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,610
Choi Dal-Po?

431
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,900
Ahn Chan-soo?

432
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,220
How long as it been?

433
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,660
Yeah.

434
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,890
Yeah, it's the first time since
graduation, so about seven years?

435
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,698
Have you been well?

436
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:46,680
You've really succeeded.

437
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,110
You looked like a total idiot
when we were in Hyangri-do.

438
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:52,231
You used to wear rubber shoes
and go around with runny nose.

439
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,560
I didn't have runny nose.

440
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,713
By the way, what are you doing here?

441
00:24:56,804 --> 00:24:57,912
Police ID Card

442
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,140
You're a police officer?

443
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,310
Yeah, it's been four years already.

444
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,010
Let's go talk over there.

445
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,060
There are too many trash reporters here.

446
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,070
Yeah.

447
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,320
Those guys whine like flies everyday

448
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,530
begging and asking for news.

449
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,250
I don't know who made it, but
trash reporter is a perfect term.

450
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,260
Did you see?

451
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,800
Choi In-ha, that Blunt Witch
became a trash reporter too.

452
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,740
She was on the TV advertisement a lot.

453
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,800
Yeah.

454
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,960
I became a reporter, too.

455
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,520
- What?
- A reporter.

456
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,900
A trash reporter like you said.

457
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,400
You did?

458
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,900
Yeah.

459
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,680
A country bumpkin has succeeded.

460
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,240
You're a trainee like them?

461
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,730
Yeah.

462
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,240
Excuse me, where is the press room?

463
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
Choi In-ha.

464
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,400
Ahn Chan-soo?

465
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,830
We're going to end up
having our reunion here.

466
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,300
How in the world do we meet here?

467
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,550
But there's a press room
in a place like this?

468
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,520
The Han River District trainees
sleep in the press room here.

469
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,100
The trainees who are on mawari

470
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:14,811
are 13 including you two.

471
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,160
We have one more trainee.

472
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,590
Yoon Yoo-Rae, a female reporter.

473
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,650
We have one more also.

474
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:20,141
A male reporter named Seo Bum-Jo.

475
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,702
There are 15 trainees, then.

476
00:26:22,793 --> 00:26:24,823
There's going to be a big
competition for the press room.

477
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,749
Competition?

478
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,490
There are a lot of reporters
with only one place to sleep.

479
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,142
You might have to sleep outside.

480
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,934
Is the press room facility nice?

481
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,920
Of course.

482
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,545
It's Han River Police station's pride.

483
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,000
Dal-Po, you're here? I just got here now.

484
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,230
What's wrong?

485
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,260
This is the press room.

486
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,770
Why aren't you going in?

487
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,970
Is this the press room?

488
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,300
I think so.

489
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,370
What do you think? It's great, right?

490
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,800
Mother.

491
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,630
This is a strange world.

492
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,610
In order to survive in this world...

493
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,260
I have to overcome the human limitation.

494
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,020
Detective Team 2

495
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,580
Is there any case or accident?

496
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,980
No.

497
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,370
- Is there any case or accident?
- No.

498
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,910
- Is there any...
- No.

499
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,560
Detective, please...

500
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,180
It doesn't matter even
if it's a small one.

501
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,370
I said nothing.

502
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,670
Just give me a real small one.

503
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,760
There isn't any.

504
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,670
Don't be like that,
just give me a small one.

505
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,530
I said no.

506
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,030
Sir.

507
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:51,000
I said there's no case.

508
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,400
Small one is okay.

509
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,990
Is there not even a spousal dispute?

510
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,690
Where are the numerous cases
that fill the news everyday?

511
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,060
I just...

512
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,200
can't find them in this world.

513
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,000
If we don't find any cases...

514
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,850
we'll get busted by our seniors.

515
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,160
I found out after I came here.

516
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,660
There are so many...

517
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,940
various things exist in the world.

518
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,640
I'm sorry.

519
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:21,760
Are you crying?

520
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,250
I'm not crying. It's rhinitis.

521
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,910
- We get scolded if...
- I'm sorry.

522
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,350
-...we cry here.
-Sorry for what?

523
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,410
I'm sorry.

524
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,640
No. I didn't sleep.

525
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,100
I'm sorry.

526
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,010
I slept.

527
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,810
We get scolded if we sleep.

528
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,030
Yes.

529
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,290
That's right.

530
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,250
How can you eat at a time like this?

531
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,580
- I'm sorry.
- We get scolded if we eat.

532
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:52,511
I'm sorry.

533
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,390
Are you bragging for not eating?

534
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,240
No. I'm sorry.

535
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,830
We get scolded if we don't eat.

536
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,070
Mother.

537
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,160
Why did I come to this bizarre world?

538
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,180
Eat. So that you can live.

539
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,120
Thanks.

540
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,130
Wow.

541
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,010
We have to give a Nobel Prize
to whoever invented this.

542
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,200
Is it really your first time
eating this kimbap?

543
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,220
Yeah.

544
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,460
I can't eat the whites.

545
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,090
- Do you want to eat it?
- Really?

546
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,620
I can't eat the yolk.

547
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,680
Are you sure you're a son of conglomerate?

548
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,700
Why?

549
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,600
You can't believe it?

550
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,850
Or do you feel repulsed?

551
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,500
No.

552
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,260
If it's true, I think you're
a pretty decent conglomerate.

553
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,656
You didn't show off and make
a big deal about money.

554
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,740
Thanks for thinking highly of me.

555
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,980
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

556
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,060
Mother.

557
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,740
There is someone who adapts better
than anyone in this harsh world.

558
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,430
Can't you take me when you go
on the investigation this time?

559
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,120
I know that area well since I drove taxi.

560
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,570
You're like a ghost.

561
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,600
How did you know that?

562
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,370
I can't take you with me,
but you can stop by later.

563
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,500
- You said there's not even a small case!
- You said there's no spousal dispute.

564
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,640
Of course there's no small
case in a Major Case squad.

565
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,300
Hey, I heard that bastard...

566
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,330
is a son of conglomerate?

567
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:02,270
He goes around doing whatever he wants in
this jungle like place as if he's Tarzan.

568
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,960
He even seduced police officers.

569
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,250
Why is he suffering when
he has a lot of money?

570
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,929
Does he perhaps have some kind
of relationship with In-ha?

571
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,600
It's not like that.

572
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,200
Let's go.

573
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,700
Mother.

574
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,360
That Tarzan...

575
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:22,500
is beginning...

576
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,560
get on my nerves.

577
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,360
By the way,

578
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,046
do you have other secret source than me?

579
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:32,210
There's a rumor that you have more
information than our team leader.

580
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,230
What's your secret?

581
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:35,370
It's just luck.

582
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,830
Don't be like that and tell me honestly.

583
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,860
I'll keep it to myself.

584
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,010
It's really just luck.

585
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,490
A while ago, a senior told me to
match shredded paper as punishment.

586
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,100
There was a lot of information
about your police station.

587
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,910
Since I came to them with that,
I can get sources easily.

588
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,630
Did you memorize all that?

589
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,030
Yeah.

590
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,430
But...

591
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,790
from what I remember...

592
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,556
I don't think were close enough
to be like this.

593
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,050
If you disappoint me like this,
I won't be your source.

594
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,030
I handle an enormous case this time.

595
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,190
You know it, right?
The container fire case.

596
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,340
Yeah.

597
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,140
But didn't that case already get solved?

598
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,190
It's a murder disguised
as a fire accident.

599
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,550
There is motive and
the suspect is on the run.

600
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,010
Everything matches, so what else?

601
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,400
Rather than there's something else,

602
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,020
it feels like there is a puzzle piece
that is not fitting.

603
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,000
Feeling?

604
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,360
That's all?

605
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,360
Yeah.

606
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
A feeling. A sense.

607
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,400
That's everything for detectives.

608
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,190
Anyway, when I figure that out,

609
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,610
I want an exclusive interview.

610
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,160
With title Ahn Chan-soo in huge font.

611
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,730
That unyield brat.

612
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,690
Did you look for your brother?

613
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,860
Is he alive?

614
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,530
Yes.

615
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,890
My brother took my father's remains.

616
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,080
Then did you meet him?

617
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,780
I went to the police station and
pleaded for my brother's contact.

618
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,021
But they said they can't
if I can't prove my family relationship.

619
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,270
There's no way to prove
that you're Ki Ha-myung?

620
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,000
There must be an adoption record.

621
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,540
Before I was adopted,

622
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,680
it was more important for me
to hide the name Ki Ha-myung.

623
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:46,150
I lied and said that I couldn't remember.

624
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:51,705
Which police station that have
your brother's contact information?

625
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:53,990
Jeongwoo Police station.

626
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,250
Hello.

627
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,160
Let me connect
to Jeongwoo Police station, please.

628
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,860
Yeah, dad.

629
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,870
- I'm about to get some sleep now.
- You haven't slept yet?

630
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,550
I couldn't sleep a wink all this time.

631
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,320
I can't even sleep
more than two hours now.

632
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,760
I have to give a report at 4.

633
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,900
What about Dal-Po?

634
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,900
Uncle?

635
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,490
Don't even talk about it.
He's like an enemy than an uncle.

636
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,290
He has no mercy since we're competitor.
We even eat separately.

637
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,490
Alright. Get some sleep.

638
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,840
Yeah, I got it. Get some sleep.

639
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,470
A thief!

640
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,140
It was from then...

641
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,750
that I started dreaming
about be a reporter.

642
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,570
It's because of me?

643
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,140
That's right.

644
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,020
It's not my mom but you.

645
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,130
That day still remains here...

646
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,410
so wonderfully.

647
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,270
Enough that not even
a second could be erased.

648
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,500
Choi Dal-Po.

649
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,500
What was that earlier?

650
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,690
I saw it. I saw everything.

651
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,240
What you did to In-ha...

652
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,430
Don't you think...

653
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,330
it's not something an uncle
should do to his niece?

654
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,170
Don't you think it has nothing
to do with you, too?

655
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,730
Of course...

656
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,900
...not.

657
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,000
But...

658
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,400
I think it'll have something to do
with me soon.

659
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,930
Let's talk again when it's got
something to do with you later.

660
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,800
Right now...

661
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,700
it seems like you're being impudent.

662
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,600
He didn't even know
In-ha for a long time.

663
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,780
It's been quite a while.

664
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,490
Much...

665
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,450
more...

666
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,783
than you think.

667
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,150
Starting today,

668
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,740
MSC news will be together
with your 10 PM.

669
00:40:07,586 --> 00:40:09,449
MSC News Times and YGN News 22
competes today at 10 PM.

670
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,980
I'll pick YGN.

671
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,680
- I'm...
- Dong-joo bets 10 dollars.

672
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,060
-20 dollars on YGN.
-Seonbaenim.

673
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,080
-20 dollars on YGN.
-I'll bet on YGN too.

674
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,100
20 dollars.

675
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,270
I'm Jae-hwang. Jae-hwang.

676
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,140
Jae-hwang bets 20 dollars on YGN.

677
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:28,050
YGN and MSC news
will finally face off tonight at 10 PM.

678
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,400
Then I'll pick...

679
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,510
YGN to win and bet 20 dollars.

680
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,780
Jong-kyu hyung bets 20 dollars.

681
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,060
I'll bet 10 dollars on YGN, too.

682
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,810
It's a sure thing to bet on the side
with strong history, right?

683
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,130
Han Kwon-joo,

684
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,198
bets 10 dollars on YGN.

685
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,530
Hwang seonbae.

686
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,486
I don't bet.

687
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:50,537
You really.

688
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,170
You live too strict.

689
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,610
Which side do you bet on?

690
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,370
It will be MSC for sure, right?

691
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,770
Of course I will...

692
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,790
choose YGN.

693
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,340
Kim Gong-joo bets 10 dollars on YGN.

694
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,500
Hey, man.

695
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,430
Even if there is no chance of winning,

696
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,404
a person from MSC shouldn't do that.

697
00:41:14,495 --> 00:41:17,095
I'm a reporter before I enter MSC.

698
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,930
I can't twist the facts.

699
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,311
Right, Hwang seonbae?

700
00:41:22,402 --> 00:41:25,742
Something that hasn't happen is not fact.

701
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,600
Is it?

702
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,370
But it won't be a bet.

703
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,780
No one bets on MSC.

704
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,900
Chan-soo.

705
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,420
Just give me anything.

706
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,940
I have nothing to report at 12:00.

707
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,380
Just give me something to write up.

708
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,710
Pickpocket or a mob case,
just give me anything.

709
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,610
I couldn't report anything at 10.

710
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,360
I'm dead if I don't
report again this time.

711
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,910
Just go to Dal-Po and ask
him to give you one.

712
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,690
He seemed like he took a lot cases.

713
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,260
No way.

714
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,560
Please give me something.

715
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,400
Didn't you say that...

716
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,670
you liked me when we were in high school?

717
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:15,660
I know.

718
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,300
Why in the world did I like you?

719
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,930
Now that I look at you,
I just can't understand it.

720
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,830
And I got married.

721
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,570
Hey, if someone sees us
they'll think that,

722
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,890
I'm coming onto you or something.

723
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,239
I'm so dumbfounded.

724
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,050
Fine, you're so cheap.
I won't ask anymore.

725
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,030
Hey, you only need something to write up?

726
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,160
Yeah. Anything small.

727
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:44,990
Ma'am.

728
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,690
It's already been three hours.

729
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,939
If you overly exercise like this,
you won't lose weight...

730
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,093
...but losing your life.

731
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,300
I'm going crazy.

732
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,700
I heard it from the Chief earlier.

733
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,590
About an hour ago, a lady died
at Youngtop Fitness Center.

734
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,000
Ma'am!

735
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,730
She exercised excessively
and died of heart attack.

736
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,740
It's a simple death case. And then?

737
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,000
It's not our team's case,
so I don't know more.

738
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,430
But can this be a news?

739
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,360
It doesn't matter.

740
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,550
I just need to report it.

741
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:19,840
Hey. Thank you so much.

742
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,830
You saved me.

743
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,620
Hey, just get your eye booger out.

744
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,330
Youngtop Fitness Center.

745
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,330
Heart attack.

746
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,320
A lady.

747
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:40,460
Yoon Yoo-Rae.

748
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:41,460
No way...

749
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,800
Seonbae, this is Yoon
Yoo-Rae from Han River.

750
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,770
An hour ago, a lady died of a
heart attack at a fitness center.

751
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:49,770
Hey! That blood sucking wench!

752
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:57,530
Really?

753
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,020
How old was the fitness center lady?

754
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,130
You don't know?

755
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,490
What about family relations?

756
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,420
If she died of a heart attack,

757
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,860
does she have a chronic disease?

758
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,820
Did you get the CCTV footage?

759
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,620
Don't you know that it won't work
without video!

760
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,800
Go get it within an hour!

761
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,440
You know what day it is, right?

762
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:22,840
Let's get tensed!

763
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,390
No content.

764
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,120
No topic.

765
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:31,040
Why would they report
something like that?

766
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,680
Are they just trying to write an essay?

767
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,530
I'm really worried about your trainees.

768
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:38,560
That brat!

769
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,990
Yeah, Reporter Choi In-ha.

770
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,510
Do you have anything special?

771
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:45,760
What about her age?

772
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,000
What about family relations?

773
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,790
She has any chronic disease?

774
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,800
What about CCTV?

775
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,710
Are you bragging that you don't know!

776
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:58,860
Please find out within the hour.

777
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:00,490
It's an hour.

778
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,860
No content.

779
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:13,100
No topic.

780
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,680
What to do?

781
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:20,920
We're even.

782
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:23,560
Hey, Choi In-ha.

783
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,880
What's the story about fitness center?

784
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,320
Il-joo seonbae told me to find
it out with you in an hour.

785
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,830
I don't know. I just reported
and totally got bit.

786
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,860
I'll go to the hospital,
so you go to the fitness center.

787
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:34,770
Okay.

788
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,990
I just reported on. I don't know why
they're making such a big deal.

789
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,500
Today is the first day we're competing
against MSC, so it's understandable.

790
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,680
You go to the hospital.
I'll go to the fitness center.

791
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:48,650
Okay.

792
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:01,960
Hey.

793
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,330
Hey!

794
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,260
Hey! Hey! Hey!

795
00:46:09,092 --> 00:46:09,929
Admission and Discharge
Outpatient Administration Office

796
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,790
I came because I heard
that my aunt died while exercising.

797
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,530
Can I find out what exactly happened?

798
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,000
She's lying. She's a reporter.

799
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,200
Hey!

800
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,830
Let me request for an interview.

801
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,000
Hello.

802
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:31,960
Take these first.

803
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:41,370
I'd like an interview, as well.

804
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,920
Hello. I'm from MSC.

805
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:52,820
The lady who died at a fitness center
a while ago came in ambulance...

806
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,430
Hello. I'm from YGN.

807
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:56,330
That girl!

808
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,730
The patient's accurate age is...

809
00:46:58,130 --> 00:46:59,630
The accurate cause of the accident...

810
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,050
Did her family visit?

811
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,430
Where is...?

812
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:06,660
That blood sucking wench.

813
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,710
- The age of fitness center lady?
- They said she's 51.

814
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,400
They said?

815
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,690
Are you a spokesperson? A messenger?

816
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,170
Report facts that you verified yourself!

817
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,380
No. She is 51 years old.
I checked her health record.

818
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,330
- Any chronic disease?
- What about chronic disease?

819
00:47:23,421 --> 00:47:24,830
She was extremely obese with over 90 kg.

820
00:47:24,921 --> 00:47:27,181
At the time of death,
they said she lost her weight to...

821
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:28,866
She lost her weight to 70 kg.

822
00:47:28,957 --> 00:47:29,757
Why did she lose weight?

823
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,690
Don't you think it was just dieting?

824
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,610
I'm the one who is asking questions!

825
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,209
There must've been a reason
to lost her weight so rapidly.

826
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:41,110
I haven't figured out the reason yet.

827
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:42,780
What could you don't figure it out?

828
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:45,000
Should I go there to figure it out?

829
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,630
I'm sorry. I'll verify it right away.

830
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,500
Family relations?

831
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,420
She's alone.

832
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,690
She has a daughter and
she divorced two years ago.

833
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,810
Currently she is raised by
her ex-husband in Busan.

834
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,160
- Did you go to the morgue?
- Yes.

835
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,510
But there was no family or relatives.

836
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,000
What about the CCTV?

837
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,170
They said they absolutely can't show it.

838
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,630
Of course they did.

839
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,720
How could they show it?

840
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,060
I'm sorry.

841
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,700
Any side has the CCTV footage,
makes it exclusive news.

842
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,300
You know what happens
if we get screwed, right?

843
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,590
Yes. I understand.

844
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,720
Is there anything you found?

845
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:29,970
Nothing much.

846
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:32,484
I even searched her trash can
at her house.

847
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:38,250
By the way, is this even news?

848
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,460
It's simply someone try
to lose weight and died.

849
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,800
It's not like someone killed her.
It's just a gossip.

850
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,730
How is this a news?

851
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,450
There was a student died of exhaustion

852
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,350
after riding a bike for six hours
to lose weight.

853
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,678
They can tie them together
and make a special report.

854
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:00,640
But only under the premise
that we get the CCTV footage.

855
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,060
Hey.

856
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:09,460
What happened to your face?

857
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,290
That lady...

858
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,410
She loaded briquettes for living.

859
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,200
It may stained while I make interviews.

860
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,380
What do you mean by loading?

861
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,200
Over here too.

862
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:21,260
Loading briquettes onto the car.

863
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,590
A woman did something like that?

864
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,160
She must've been hard up for money.

865
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,500
She worked even last night.

866
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:28,140
Even if she was hard up for money.

867
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,870
Stay still. I'll wipe it for you.

868
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:33,340
The elevator is here.

869
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:45,310
That lady's ex-husband remarried?

870
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:46,241
Yes.

871
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,330
Has it been about two months?

872
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,230
On top of that,

873
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,860
he married a former 90s Miss Choon-hyang.

874
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:58,670
I'm sure she wanted to lose weight since
her ex-husband marrying someone skinny.

875
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,380
It's not much of a case,
so please leave now.

876
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,500
Then it was then when the lady
signed up for the fitness center?

877
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:07,810
Yes, I said so.

878
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,570
Sir, did you perhaps give them the CCTV?

879
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:14,660
No. Never.

880
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,040
Why would I want to advertise
someone died here?

881
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:20,300
If you don't give it, reporters
will take the outdoors.

882
00:50:20,391 --> 00:50:21,361
Isn't that worse?

883
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,930
No one could figure it out that
it's here only by the interior.

884
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,200
Yes, right.

885
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:30,826
We'll take care of the blurring perfectly.

886
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,500
We're trainees so if we just go back,
our seniors will kill us.

887
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:40,450
We have to get something
we can report on.

888
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:41,321
Please?

889
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,370
Kindhearted owner.

890
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,390
Handsome owner.

891
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,358
Please just once.

892
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,830
Hey.

893
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,730
What are you doing?

894
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,030
You should do that too.

895
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,100
Please just once.

896
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:57,110
I can't.

897
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,540
What if I hiccuped?

898
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,160
Then can't you just show us the CCTV?

899
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:04,730
I really just have to show it?

900
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,440
No!

901
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,550
You can't just show us.

902
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,840
Yes. It's fine.

903
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:10,860
Thank you.

904
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:11,830
Hey!

905
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,100
She collapsed while measuring her weight.

906
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,360
Move your head. I can't see.

907
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:38,530
It's clear now, right?

908
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,590
Stop bothering me and leave.

909
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:47,270
We completely fail
if we don't get CCTV footage.

910
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:51,020
Why did that Choi Dal-Po say something
out of the blue and ruin it. So unlucky.

911
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,320
Right?

912
00:51:53,474 --> 00:51:55,850
Yeah, I know. It's so unlucky.

913
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:59,000
I'm going crazy.

914
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,020
It's not unlucky.

915
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:04,110
If it wasn't for Dal-Po, we probably
couldn't even see the CCTV.

916
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:05,290
I admit it.

917
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:07,740
You still can't settle
your feelings for him?

918
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,180
Yeah.

919
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,060
I'm trying but I can't.

920
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,610
Why am I so pathetic?

921
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,340
It's almost time to report.

922
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,550
Let's hurry up and go.

923
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,730
Should we go back in and beg him
to give us the CCTV even now?

924
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:27,110
I don't think it will work.

925
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,440
I recorded the CCTV here.

926
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,130
What?

927
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:38,730
I secretly recorded it
while watching the CCTV earlier.

928
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,430
Great!

929
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,430
Did it really record?

930
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,340
Yeah.

931
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,730
I checked it earlier.

932
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:44,890
Pretty good image quality.

933
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:49,660
You're the best. I admit.

934
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,023
Oh, yeah! Let's go.

935
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:58,470
Ahn Chan-soo.

936
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,880
You still working on the report
for container fire case?

937
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:02,940
Yes. There is something suspicious.

938
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,000
What is suspicious about it?

939
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,990
Isn't it a murder case
disguised as fire accident?

940
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,490
Moon Duk-soo is clearly the suspect.

941
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:13,390
There is a motive related to debts.

942
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,390
What else is left to dig up?

943
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:17,330
That Moon Duk-soo...

944
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,371
I traced his cell phone
but something is strange.

945
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,460
It's so elusive that we caught his signal

946
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:52,490
in Haeundae and also in Gangnam.

947
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:56,000
There is no record of
credit card usage either.

948
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:59,000
He left without even a penny.

949
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,056
I just don't know how he's going
around without any money.

950
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,660
His cell phone, as well.

951
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,500
How it turns on and off
is a bit unnatural.

952
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:11,340
It almost feels like he's trying to show
that he's going around the whole country.

953
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:13,460
We'd be thankful if he tries to show us.

954
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:14,750
That's the problem.

955
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,630
He's only showing enough
to not get caught.

956
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:21,960
He chooses only crowded places
to turn it on and off.

957
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:24,130
But isn't it strange?

958
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,650
For a fugitive...

959
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,090
to be only going to crowded places?

960
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,820
The truth is scattered here
and there in pieces

961
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,400
doesn't show us its complete self.

962
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,830
It's your turn to report, right?

963
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,800
Yeah.

964
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,410
Let's organize the report.

965
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,470
First of all, this lady

966
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,090
was usually big and strong
like a man, enough to load briquettes.

967
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:58,290
One, two, three.

968
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,230
But one day,

969
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:04,090
she heard that her ex-husband
was getting remarried.

970
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,580
And as she saw his skinny wife.

971
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:19,110
From then on, she made up
her mind to lose her weight.

972
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,720
Twenty kilos in two months.

973
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,670
She had fatty liver symptoms

974
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:28,070
and she had a heart attack due to
exhaustion from excessive exercise.

975
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:31,000
The ambulance arrived,
but she was already dead.

976
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:32,430
How was it? Isn't it perfect?

977
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:33,630
Can you report it?

978
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,140
Yeah, I can.

979
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,170
What's wrong?

980
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,110
It's...

981
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:44,990
I can't report like this.

982
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,400
Why not?

983
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:47,760
Something is strange.

984
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,500
There's something I don't understand.

985
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,460
Try hard to understand even if you don't.

986
00:55:52,551 --> 00:55:54,701
We'll be in big trouble
if you don't report now.

987
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:56,720
I want to but I can't.

988
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:59,000
You know, I'm going to hiccup again.

989
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,860
When the thing we found
is not the truth...

990
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:09,160
the truth gave us
a very trivial and small signal.

991
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,060
That's called...

992
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:14,560
suspicion.

993
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,840
It is strange.

994
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:21,850
But it's not enough to change the suspect.

995
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:24,560
Is it?

996
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,740
Isn't it strange?

997
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,850
A woman who wants to lose weight
to be pretty,

998
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,300
exercises with last World Cup
T-shirt and loose pants on?

999
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,810
And I tried loading briquettes.

1000
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,480
I couldn't wash it off easily.

1001
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,820
That lady's hands must've been worse.

1002
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:41,840
If she was trying to be pretty

1003
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,820
wouldn't she look
for a different job first?

1004
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,730
It is strange.

1005
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,550
But it's not enough to change this report.

1006
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:55,630
The truth that looks perfect
with a trivial piece.

1007
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:57,830
Suspicion.

1008
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,300
Let's go to the morgue one more time.

1009
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:03,810
Go there again?

1010
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,520
Write New Mail

1011
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:37,000
Once we gave up on that suspicion,
the real truth hides itself.

1012
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,807
Seoul Han River Police Station Midi Hall

1013
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:06,430
I'll tell you beforehand.

1014
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,390
We have...an exclusive news today.

1015
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,120
Yeah.

1016
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,860
I'm listening. Keep talking.

1017
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:25,870
Okay. I got it.

1018
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,290
Make it about one minute and a half.

1019
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:32,980
We have an exclusive news too.

1020
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:43,159
MSC

1021
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:44,450
Nothing is as it seems.

1022
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,540
Put aside picture, exclusive news
and viewer rating competition...

1023
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,880
I'm saying that we should betray YGN.

1024
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,179
Good evening, everyone.

1025
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:14,103
This is Choi In-ha from MSC news.

1026
00:59:14,194 --> 00:59:16,040
People often say
that news is like an onion.

1027
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:19,680
The more you peel the layer called
truth, the more new truth coming up.

1028
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,940
We found out the real truth.

1029
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:26,499
Don't worry. I'll wipe up all the
cases tonight and bring them.

1030
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:27,910
It will cause more harm.

1031
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,070
- Go in.
- You can't do this to me now.

1032
00:59:30,161 --> 00:59:32,861
- Choi Dal-Po cause trouble again?
- He hasn't returned yet.
