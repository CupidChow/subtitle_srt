1
00:00:09,501 --> 00:00:11,968
Pinocchio

2
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:38,525
You know, going back to office each night
to monitor news has been like hell for me.

3
00:00:38,616 --> 00:00:40,579
But I'm impatient to go there tonight.

4
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,092
Why? Because our report is being aired?

5
00:00:43,183 --> 00:00:44,792
Of course.

6
00:00:44,883 --> 00:00:46,051
We're the first among all trainees.

7
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:48,630
Besides, we're the only one
who gets the CCTV footage.

8
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:50,731
On top of that, it's our first
day going up against MSC.

9
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,009
It's a heck of a start.

10
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,779
Isn't it?

11
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:56,435
Yeah.

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,482
I feel bad for her.

13
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:06,097
She might get into a big trouble with
her seniors when they see our footage.

14
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,367
Choi In-ha.

15
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:13,271
-What?
-We got CCTV footage of the gym.

16
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,887
I just wanted you to know that.

17
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:16,519
Are you out of your mind?
Why did you tell her?

18
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:17,726
You said you felt bad.

19
00:01:21,793 --> 00:01:23,727
Exclusive, whatever!

20
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:25,625
You just made a mistake...

21
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:32,139
That brat!

22
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,365
What? What mistake?

23
00:01:34,456 --> 00:01:36,410
We're the only one who gets
the CCTV footage, right?

24
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:37,964
I don't know.

25
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:51,198
Episode 7 -The Frog in the Well

26
00:01:52,931 --> 00:01:53,865
The manuscript ready?

27
00:01:53,956 --> 00:01:55,297
I'll start the recording first.

28
00:01:55,388 --> 00:01:56,598
Are you sure it's exclusive?

29
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:57,523
Yeah.

30
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:02,706
-Are you sure we got the CCTV exclusively?
-Yes.

31
00:02:02,797 --> 00:02:05,445
I just checked with the gym and
they didn't give it to anyone.

32
00:02:05,536 --> 00:02:07,347
How many items are there before this?

33
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,179
Since it was a strait item,
it's a three line news brief

34
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,941
when we didn’t have CCTV footage.

35
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:15,038
How many minutes we have
if we make it as a top story?

36
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:17,693
We can make a topic of extreme diet
that cost lives and add news

37
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:22,068
about a high school student who died
after six hours on the bike last week

38
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,919
along with interview from a specialist.

39
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,294
I think that'd be two minutes worth.

40
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:29,453
Okay. That'll be enough
to make it as a top story.

41
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:33,520
Let's move the ice fishing story
over to the weekend news.

42
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:37,417
I don't think we need to air
the ice fishing story on a day like this.

43
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:40,610
Isn't it better to pull
the story of the gym lady up

44
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,085
and humiliate YGN?

45
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:44,010
You're right.

46
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:48,057
If we air it first then they'll realize
they make a wrong topic.

47
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:49,757
They would be flustered and panic.

48
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:53,015
They'd be so chaotic whether to kill
the story or make another topic.

49
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:54,699
Don't make them kill, just let them air.

50
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,957
Let's put ours on the back.

51
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:57,057
What?

52
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:01,840
I'm suggesting to stab YGN in the back.

53
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,734
What? Why are they pulling back our
exclusive news on the gym lady?

54
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:11,159
It's a chance to humiliate YGN.

55
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,383
They didn't intend to humiliate YGN,

56
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,700
but to screw them up.

57
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,301
I beg your pardon?

58
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:20,139
They let YGN fall
into their own trap first.

59
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:23,422
This is the perfect trap to bring
down YGN, the number one credibility news.

60
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:25,296
There's no way Ms Song will let go of it.

61
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:29,912
She really is a fighter.

62
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:33,722
Those two finally did it.

63
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,242
I was worried since they got in
because of connection.

64
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:40,467
I'm not sure. I think it's still too early
to say that.

65
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,504
Uncle Dal-Po

66
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,086
Hey, you can't take that call.

67
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:48,444
It's Choi Dal-Po, isn't it?

68
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,661
You saw how they're gloating about
having an exclusive news earlier.

69
00:03:51,752 --> 00:03:52,785
We have to gloat back.

70
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:55,719
Don't be such an amateur.

71
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,586
If we tell them now, they're going
to add more to their story.

72
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,819
Any mistakes, and we'll
be the one humiliated.

73
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:01,808
You may be right.

74
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:09,552
Are these the two who got the scoop

75
00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:11,580
-on the death at the gym?
-Yes.

76
00:04:11,671 --> 00:04:13,848
We'd be in a big trouble without them.

77
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:15,636
They really did a great job today.

78
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,477
You’re overpraise.

79
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:21,217
I don't think it's overpraise.

80
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:23,709
Isn't that true?

81
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:24,976
Hey.

82
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,675
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:29,806
As a Pinocchio, I don't
know how to be modest.

84
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,955
I like your honesty.

85
00:04:34,046 --> 00:04:37,621
Keep up the brazen good work.

86
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:38,546
Okay?

87
00:04:41,636 --> 00:04:42,599
You've worked hard.

88
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,088
Good job.

89
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,221
The number you are calling
is not responding.

90
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:56,829
Forget it. Don’t worry.

91
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,287
She was just bluffing.

92
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:01,399
You know In-ha can't bluff
since she's a Pinocchio.

93
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,155
I'm sure it's nothing.

94
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,721
I checked with the gym.

95
00:05:04,812 --> 00:05:06,291
No other reporters came by after we left.

96
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:09,824
Choi Dal-Po, Yoon Yu-Rae!

97
00:05:09,915 --> 00:05:11,282
I heard you two pulled a big one.

98
00:05:12,824 --> 00:05:13,730
It's not that big deal.

99
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:14,854
How did you do it?

100
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:17,347
It was around noon earlier.

101
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:20,754
I just got this strange feeling as I
was walked past the Homicide Division.

102
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:23,911
So I put my stethoscope up to
the door and scooped the story.

103
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:25,511
Stethoscope...

104
00:05:26,544 --> 00:05:29,121
Then how did you get the
CCTV footage from the gym?

105
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:31,454
They adamantly refused to show it to us.

106
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:32,321
So I seduced him...

107
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:35,748
...and succeeded in getting
him to show it to us.

108
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,305
Then, Dal-Po secretly taped the
screen with his cellphone.

109
00:05:40,782 --> 00:05:44,349
You know, the impact a TV news can make is
all depends on what is shown on screen.

110
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,867
I'm sure they'll make a brief news
since they don't have the footage.

111
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,582
Exclusive, whatever!

112
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:51,515
You're making a big mistake...

113
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:02,848
Is there any reason for a blue-collar
lady to lose 20kg in just 2 months??

114
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:04,104
You're back to that again?

115
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:07,316
Her ex-husband just got remarried
to a former beauty pageant queen.

116
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:09,776
I'm sure she must've been a shock,
and quickly wanted to get pretty.

117
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:14,067
A lady who wants to get pretty still has
the bad perm and works out in those pants?

118
00:06:14,158 --> 00:06:15,900
-Don't you find that strange?
-Not really.

119
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,691
You can just ignore that.

120
00:06:18,782 --> 00:06:20,016
Did you meet with her family?

121
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:21,433
No, we didn't.

122
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:24,054
No family members showed up
at the hospital mortuary.

123
00:06:24,145 --> 00:06:26,046
Her ex-husband lived in Busan
and didn't answer his phone.

124
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:27,921
I'm going back to the hospital.

125
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,287
Are you out of your mind?

126
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:31,545
The news is about to start.
We have to watch it.

127
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:33,521
Hey.

128
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,188
Hey!

129
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:53,787
Earlier this afternoon, at a
fitness center near Han River

130
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:56,000
an obese woman in her 50s

131
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:57,992
is seen running on the treadmill.

132
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,599
Han River Funeral Hall

133
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,705
Deceased: Im Yang-soon

134
00:07:14,796 --> 00:07:17,414
Has Ms Im Yang-soon's wake been prepared?

135
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:18,615
Did her family members arrive?

136
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:19,551
Ah, yes.

137
00:07:19,683 --> 00:07:22,170
Her daughter came from Busan
earlier this afternoon.

138
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:25,049
There she is.

139
00:07:25,882 --> 00:07:27,270
-Thank you.
-Yes.

140
00:07:40,816 --> 00:07:42,257
Are you...

141
00:07:42,816 --> 00:07:44,516
...Ms Im Yang-soon's daughter?

142
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:45,817
Yes.

143
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:48,261
Who are you?

144
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,740
I'm Choi Dal-Po, a reporter from YGN.

145
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:57,893
I'd like to ask something
regarding your late mother.

146
00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:00,716
I already...

147
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:06,776
...gave an interview
to some reporters from MSC.

148
00:08:20,982 --> 00:08:22,796
ON AIR

149
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,784
Good evening.

150
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:31,316
Here's your news for December
2nd from YGN News 22.

151
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:33,377
Good evening, everyone.

152
00:08:33,468 --> 00:08:37,509
MSC News Times now comes
to you live at 10:00.

153
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,574
It's great to be here.

154
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,668
Liver...

155
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:43,620
...transplant?

156
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,932
I'm in the final stages of cirrhosis,

157
00:08:47,591 --> 00:08:50,234
I need to get a liver transplant
in order to survive.

158
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:53,691
My mother has the same blood type as I do

159
00:08:54,224 --> 00:08:56,591
and wants to be my liver donor.

160
00:08:57,992 --> 00:08:59,493
But the doctor told her

161
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:02,027
that my mother has a fatty liver

162
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:06,060
and that she'd have to lose about 30kg
before she could donate her liver to me.

163
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:09,193
So I gave up on receiving
a liver transplant.

164
00:09:10,226 --> 00:09:12,393
Because I thought losing
that amount of weight

165
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,793
in that short of time
would be just impossible.

166
00:09:16,726 --> 00:09:18,726
I thought my mom had given up, too.

167
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:19,993
But...

168
00:09:22,892 --> 00:09:23,726
That's why...

169
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,394
That's why she pushed herself so hard.

170
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,492
It's my fault that my mother passed away.

171
00:09:31,526 --> 00:09:32,726
She wanted to save my life

172
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:35,259
by immediately donating her liver to me.

173
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:37,693
She pushed herself so hard
to lose the weight...

174
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:41,193
And that's why she passed away.

175
00:09:46,793 --> 00:09:47,896
Here's your next news.

176
00:09:48,493 --> 00:09:50,353
The constant battle to lose weight.

177
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:53,959
The fatally overt determination
to win against the battle

178
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,235
has cost another woman
her life this afternoon

179
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:57,860
-after last week's incident.
-No.

180
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:58,793
Stop it.

181
00:10:01,826 --> 00:10:02,736
Please turn that off.

182
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:05,660
Earlier this afternoon, at a
fitness center near Han River

183
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:07,893
an obese woman in her 50's

184
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,635
-is seen running...
-Please turn that off!

185
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:11,793
Where's the remote?

186
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:14,116
She has been running for
three straight hours and...

187
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:16,749
-Mom?
-...collapsed while she weighs herself.

188
00:10:18,397 --> 00:10:19,831
Frightened people come running...

189
00:10:19,863 --> 00:10:20,831
Is that...

190
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,167
...my mom on TV?

191
00:10:24,264 --> 00:10:25,473
Eventually, this woman...

192
00:10:25,564 --> 00:10:27,065
Please turn that off right now!

193
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:28,464
Where is that remote?

194
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:31,747
She over exercised to lose wight...

195
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:34,664
Mom...

196
00:10:36,431 --> 00:10:40,062
Healthy dieting is beneficial
to one's health,

197
00:10:40,153 --> 00:10:41,524
but if it's too extreme

198
00:10:41,615 --> 00:10:43,518
it can cause serious health issues.

199
00:10:43,994 --> 00:10:46,379
In most extreme cases, it can even lead

200
00:10:46,404 --> 00:10:49,335
to death because of sudden heart attacks.

201
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,376
So, one must take proper precautions.

202
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,726
That's not true.

203
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,997
My mom wasn't losing
the weight for looks.

204
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:01,060
It was because of me...

205
00:11:02,643 --> 00:11:06,148
She was losing weight to save my life.

206
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,226
Mom...

207
00:11:09,948 --> 00:11:13,230
Dieting in moderation is
beneficial for appearance,

208
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:15,757
but in extreme cases, it can become fatal

209
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:17,721
even leading one to their death.

210
00:11:18,326 --> 00:11:20,432
It's Jang Hyun-gyu from YGN News.

211
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:26,003
I'm sorry.

212
00:11:27,698 --> 00:11:29,088
I'm so sorry.

213
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,371
It's doctor's advice that
there's no other way

214
00:11:32,623 --> 00:11:34,891
to prevent obesity, except to eat less

215
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:36,736
and move more.

216
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:38,470
What could be greater

217
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:41,069
than a mother's love for her child?

218
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:43,843
In order to donate her
liver to her daughter,

219
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:46,305
a woman pushed herself to
the extreme to lose weight

220
00:11:46,396 --> 00:11:48,625
and tragically died
of a sudden heart attack

221
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:50,277
while exercising.

222
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:51,368
A liver transplant?

223
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:53,243
What does that mean?

224
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:55,369
Exclusive news from Reporter Lee Il-joo.

225
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,389
Song Hyun-joo, a high school girl,

226
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,872
cries by her mother's funerary
picture alone in her wheelchair.

227
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,424
Miss Song's mother, Ms Im Yang-soon,

228
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,902
within last two months

229
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:08,229
...has lost her weight
from 90 kg to 70 kg.

230
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,184
Choi Dal-Po!

231
00:12:09,385 --> 00:12:11,589
Yoon Yu-Rae! What the heck is this?
A liver transplant?

232
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:13,478
That's...

233
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:15,051
Jang Hyun-gyu!

234
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:17,927
What happened with that?

235
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:20,541
What's that liver transplant?
You didn't checked?

236
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:22,244
I'm not sure...

237
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:23,844
I'm sorry, I didn't check.

238
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:25,049
Hwang Gyo-dong!

239
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,051
What's this all about?

240
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:29,162
A liver transplant changes
the entire story!

241
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:30,518
I'm sorry.

242
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:31,982
It wasn't fully investigated.

243
00:12:32,787 --> 00:12:35,491
In order to donate her liver
to her daughter who is suffering

244
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:37,030
from a deadly disease

245
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,863
which hardens the liver,
the mother take an extreme diet

246
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:41,773
to save the life of...

247
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:43,045
Where is Choi dal-Po?

248
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:46,938
My mom said she had no money...

249
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:51,642
...and that all she could do
for me was to donate her own liver.

250
00:12:53,342 --> 00:12:54,489
She'll lose her weight...

251
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:57,019
and save me even if it killed her.

252
00:13:00,705 --> 00:13:01,539
Yes, we're sorry.

253
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,674
Yes, this is YGN.

254
00:13:03,474 --> 00:13:03,933
Yes.

255
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:07,249
News are often compared to an onion.

256
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:10,104
Because with every layer
that's peeled off,

257
00:13:10,195 --> 00:13:12,027
another layer of truth gets revealed.

258
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,164
The saddest diet news that you
have just heard from us

259
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,382
seemed no different

260
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:22,702
than any other extreme diet
related death incident, at first.

261
00:13:23,277 --> 00:13:26,931
However, as you would peel an onion

262
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:30,511
upon deeper digging and further
investigation, we were able to find out

263
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:34,035
the ultimate truth of the story.

264
00:13:36,093 --> 00:13:41,029
MSC News Times will do our best to bring
you the accurate truth in the future.

265
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:45,769
We will reach a reasonable compromise
and will not bend the truth.

266
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,854
That anchor is good.

267
00:13:46,945 --> 00:13:48,754
That’s very much like MSC.

268
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:50,429
-That's how news should be.
-It is.

269
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,587
That is all for the night
from MSC News Times.

270
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:53,927
Thank you.

271
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:56,360
People believe that a Pinocchio is
only capable of telling the truth.

272
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,586
And people...

273
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:02,283
also believe that reporters
only report the truth.

274
00:15:03,454 --> 00:15:06,655
Pinocchios and reporters
should've been aware of that.

275
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,909
The fact that people believe whatever
they say unconditionality, so...

276
00:15:10,981 --> 00:15:13,822
They should've been awared of how much more
deadly their words can be than others.

277
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:16,428
I know.

278
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,861
I know, but...

279
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:20,596
They should've been careful...

280
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:21,870
...and careful some more.

281
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:24,296
Not knowing that is their mistake!

282
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:27,518
I was careful.

283
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:29,521
I made dozens of calls.

284
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:33,074
I interviewed everyone at the hospital,
the gym, and even her coworkers.

285
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:36,765
How could I've been
more careful than that?

286
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:39,547
Looking at you, Candidate 444...

287
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,399
I now realize the reason
why a Pinocchio...

288
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:46,331
can't be a reporter.

289
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:49,820
How dangerous it'd be if
someone who ignores

290
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:52,397
the fact that they could make
mistake, to become a reporter.

291
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,058
How scary it is to speak recklessly

292
00:15:55,305 --> 00:15:57,675
when not even aware of the
weight their words carry.

293
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,394
I see it now.

294
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:09,228
Are those words...

295
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,595
...directed towards me?

296
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:17,261
Yes.

297
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,275
You're pathetic.

298
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
Choi Dal-Po.

299
00:17:01,748 --> 00:17:03,954
Seoul Han River Police Station

300
00:17:05,973 --> 00:17:07,708
Hey, where's Choi Dal-Po?

301
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,208
Why? So you can gloat in his face?

302
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,133
Of course.

303
00:17:10,224 --> 00:17:12,309
You have no idea how he
ignored me all these years.

304
00:17:12,394 --> 00:17:14,004
-So, where is he?
-I don't know.

305
00:17:14,095 --> 00:17:15,329
I couldn't reach him since last night.

306
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,950
I think he's in hiding, so let
me know when you find him.

307
00:17:19,195 --> 00:17:20,029
In hiding?

308
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:21,096
That's no good.

309
00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:22,796
I have tons to say to him.

310
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:26,829
My back.

311
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:28,929
I wonder if I slept wrong last night.

312
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:31,238
The number you are calling...

313
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:32,396
-What?
-...is not responding.

314
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:34,872
-He's refusing my phone call?
-Leave a message after the beep.

315
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:36,876
14 percent versus 12 percent.

316
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:38,429
Even though we did win,

317
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,032
we can't say that we actually won.

318
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:42,274
Our ratings went from 20 percent
down to 14 percent.

319
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:43,827
That's the same thing as having lost.

320
00:17:43,918 --> 00:17:46,466
What is worse, thinking
about viewers complains...

321
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:49,833
Oh, my God.
That's indeed pretty much a nightmare.

322
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,056
Put down the viewer rating.

323
00:17:54,831 --> 00:17:57,042
Let's not look at the viewer
rating for the time being.

324
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:57,765
But Mr Director,

325
00:17:57,856 --> 00:18:01,708
how can we not pay attention to viewer
ratings when we'll go on against MSC?

326
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,316
There's even not much difference.

327
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,087
That would be like going
into the battlefield blind.

328
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:09,711
Guess you're right.

329
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:11,189
Then, I'll pull it back up.

330
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,945
No.

331
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,137
Mr Director.

332
00:18:15,697 --> 00:18:18,784
Okay, let's not fight
and just do our job.

333
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,272
We were too focused on competing
against MSC

334
00:18:21,363 --> 00:18:23,494
that we neglected to uncover
the truth like we used to.

335
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:27,924
There could be a repeat of this sort
of mistake if we lose our focus again.

336
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:30,790
So let's forget about competing

337
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:32,981
for visual, exclusive news
and viewer rating

338
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:35,489
and pay full attention
to uncover the truth.

339
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,542
Is that understood?

340
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,674
-Yes, Sir.
-Yes, Sir.

341
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:41,122
Okay, let's get started.

342
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:42,814
What's the hottest issue for today?

343
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:46,329
It was so close.

344
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:49,512
Seonbae!

345
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,619
Congratulations on winning
the viewer rating.

346
00:18:52,154 --> 00:18:54,821
Wow, I knew you wouldn't disappoint.

347
00:18:55,187 --> 00:18:57,220
I don't think it's anything
to be congratulated.

348
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,393
You surely should be congratulated.

349
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:02,489
Not everyone can come in at first place.

350
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:06,155
I shouldn't have changed my bet.

351
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:07,788
I'm out of my money now.

352
00:19:08,154 --> 00:19:10,647
However, everyone thought that
there will be a double difference.

353
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:14,168
We can actually say MSC is the winner
with only two percent difference.

354
00:19:15,105 --> 00:19:18,255
In that case, am I the winner?

355
00:19:19,987 --> 00:19:21,287
No, we can't have that.

356
00:19:21,378 --> 00:19:22,745
A bet is a bet.

357
00:19:23,987 --> 00:19:26,246
That closing remark about
the onion was great.

358
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:28,218
That really boosted up your image.

359
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:31,047
It wasn't go that far.

360
00:19:32,012 --> 00:19:33,980
A little bit.

361
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:37,980
Then how about this for the next bet?

362
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:42,297
MSC News will take the lead in viewer
rating within the next two weeks.

363
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:46,196
That's a tough bet.

364
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:49,854
Yeah, sure they can.

365
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:51,277
Me too.

366
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:55,080
-MSC win.
-Me, too.

367
00:19:58,379 --> 00:20:00,284
Since that's the company I work for...

368
00:20:01,412 --> 00:20:03,512
I have no other choice
but to stay loyal to it.

369
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:06,126
Hwang seonbae, you're not betting
this time either, right?

370
00:20:25,913 --> 00:20:27,414
-Yeah.
-It's me, Jang Hyun-gyu.

371
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,614
Choi Dal-Po hasn't back to
his assigned district yet.

372
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:38,824
Captain

373
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:45,768
53 missed calls

374
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:50,566
Scrub harder.

375
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:56,480
That's it.

376
00:20:57,613 --> 00:20:58,447
Geez...

377
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:00,266
Oh, my.

378
00:21:01,713 --> 00:21:04,180
Who turned this bathwater so filthy?

379
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:07,112
Is this from me, or you?

380
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:09,514
-It's me, Father.
-Huh?

381
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,563
The pressroom is a total mess.

382
00:21:11,982 --> 00:21:14,498
I don't have time to wash
my hair and brush my teeth.

383
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:16,930
Wearing the same socks and
underwear for a week is a given.

384
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:19,655
It really doesn't fit for any human.

385
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:21,220
Oh, my goodness.

386
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:25,125
It really is nasty work.

387
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:27,449
One reporter even has a cockroach
laid its eggs on his head.

388
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,789
And it's just accepted that
we'll all get athlete's foot.

389
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,714
And then...

390
00:21:31,521 --> 00:21:32,355
Hey.

391
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:33,280
Dal-Po.

392
00:21:33,688 --> 00:21:34,414
Yes?

393
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:38,740
Shall we bathe separately?

394
00:21:39,254 --> 00:21:40,662
No, this is fine for me.

395
00:21:42,963 --> 00:21:44,639
I'm sure it's fine for you.

396
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,465
Is Choi Dal-Po not coming?

397
00:21:52,585 --> 00:21:53,971
Did he quit or something?

398
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,550
I don't know, he didn't answer my calls.

399
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,930
I don't care.

400
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:59,999
I guess the gym lady's story
was quite a shock to him.

401
00:22:00,254 --> 00:22:03,521
Who knew the story would have such
a tragic truth hidden behind it?

402
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:04,504
That's what I'm saying.

403
00:22:04,595 --> 00:22:07,079
Did that Nitpicker Jang
not bust you for it?

404
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,828
No, he's been very quiet.

405
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:10,286
I thought I'd get killed.

406
00:22:11,478 --> 00:22:12,644
But that's what scares me even more.

407
00:22:15,111 --> 00:22:16,111
What's that?

408
00:22:19,745 --> 00:22:20,545
Is that a silky chicken?

409
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:27,178
Wait!

410
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:28,577
That's Ms Park Rosa!

411
00:22:28,668 --> 00:22:30,668
-Chairwoman of Bum-Jo Department Store.
-Really?

412
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:31,977
That silky chicken?

413
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:33,744
Yes, that's her.

414
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,878
I'm sure since my oppa models
for that store.

415
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,142
You said you're an only daughter?

416
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:38,467
You have a model brother?

417
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:43,784
Excuse me, but aren't you Ms Park Rosa?

418
00:22:44,246 --> 00:22:45,761
Can you tell us what brings you here?

419
00:22:45,852 --> 00:22:47,385
I came to see my son.

420
00:22:47,795 --> 00:22:48,740
Where's the pressroom?

421
00:22:49,394 --> 00:22:50,295
The pressroom?

422
00:22:51,227 --> 00:22:52,227
Your son's name is...?

423
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:53,262
Bum-Jo.

424
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:54,595
Seo Bum-Jo.

425
00:22:54,795 --> 00:22:55,411
What?

426
00:22:56,836 --> 00:22:58,103
He really is a conglomerate?

427
00:22:58,194 --> 00:22:59,726
-Mother.
-My son.

428
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:03,716
My son!

429
00:23:04,528 --> 00:23:05,581
Mother, you came.

430
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:07,083
No, Son!

431
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:13,047
My son...

432
00:23:17,861 --> 00:23:20,021
Mother, just throw those
clothes away, please.

433
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:22,139
They may be stylish,
but no functionality.

434
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,597
They don't keep me warm at all.

435
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:25,172
You should've told me sooner.

436
00:23:25,263 --> 00:23:28,249
How could you not say anything
until reduced down to this state?

437
00:23:29,138 --> 00:23:29,984
It's so warm.

438
00:23:31,738 --> 00:23:33,511
Mother, did you see the news last night?

439
00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:34,830
Of course, I did.

440
00:23:35,377 --> 00:23:37,964
I heard that you covered
the liver transplant story?

441
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:41,180
I did it with In-ha.

442
00:23:41,644 --> 00:23:43,720
But you know what's so surprising?

443
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,784
The ill daughter had no money for surgery

444
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,608
and she lost her liver donor
since her mother died.

445
00:23:49,817 --> 00:23:51,483
But after that news aired,

446
00:23:51,574 --> 00:23:53,824
a liver donor just appeared
out of nowhere!

447
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:54,752
Really?

448
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:57,387
Plus, many people are sending donations.

449
00:23:57,485 --> 00:23:59,073
She didn't have to worry
about surgery fee.

450
00:23:59,851 --> 00:24:01,716
Are you that excited about it?

451
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,174
Of course it's exciting.

452
00:24:03,516 --> 00:24:04,916
A word saved a person's life.

453
00:24:05,183 --> 00:24:06,195
Isn't that wonderful?

454
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,069
Yes, it's wonderful.

455
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,560
But I thought you'd never ask me
for any favors. What's the matter?

456
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:14,136
It's because of In-ha.

457
00:24:14,702 --> 00:24:15,536
In-ha?

458
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:16,636
That Pinocchio?

459
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:17,835
Yes.

460
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:20,569
In-ha is a little sick right now.

461
00:24:22,268 --> 00:24:24,347
Did you bring everything
that I asked for?

462
00:24:27,302 --> 00:24:28,136
Hey.

463
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,469
You can't get sick in here.

464
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:33,880
You'll get all officers and
reporters here sick too.

465
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:35,341
I know.

466
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,432
Just give me a case, instead of this.

467
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:40,769
That would make me feel better.

468
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,104
Have you heard from Dal-Po yet?

469
00:24:44,195 --> 00:24:46,295
I was just about to ask
you the same thing.

470
00:24:46,593 --> 00:24:48,260
I haven't seen him. Something happened?

471
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:50,214
No, it's nothing.

472
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,160
Who are you?

473
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,059
What are you guys doing?

474
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:58,959
Just some cleaning.

475
00:24:59,327 --> 00:25:01,232
It's a very harsh environment here.

476
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:04,294
Please lay out the electric
pad under her spot.

477
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,211
Hello, Miss Choi In-ha.

478
00:25:07,344 --> 00:25:08,892
I've heard a lot about you.

479
00:25:09,143 --> 00:25:10,477
I'm Bum-jo's mom.

480
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,434
Oh, yes.

481
00:25:14,243 --> 00:25:15,211
Nice to meet you.

482
00:25:15,477 --> 00:25:16,615
Please sit down.

483
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:22,186
Bum-Jo told me that you don't
like to spend money like this.

484
00:25:22,284 --> 00:25:25,317
But since you're sick now,
just endure even if you don't like it...

485
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,317
The smell of a clean blanket.

486
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:31,541
I feel like alive.

487
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:35,494
Oh, this feels so warm!

488
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:38,889
Awesome! It's a heater!

489
00:25:39,685 --> 00:25:40,553
Corn snacks.

490
00:25:40,685 --> 00:25:41,865
Chocolate bar.

491
00:25:42,111 --> 00:25:44,926
Ma'am, how did you know me so well?

492
00:25:49,484 --> 00:25:51,418
Are you sure she doesn't
like things like this?

493
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:54,432
She must be really sick.

494
00:26:01,084 --> 00:26:03,052
I don't think the reporter is something
a human being should do.

495
00:26:04,318 --> 00:26:05,152
Eat this.

496
00:26:06,451 --> 00:26:08,363
I have to take a cab when I do mawari.

497
00:26:08,454 --> 00:26:11,322
I heard one month of taxi fare
and a phone bill is nearly 2000 dollars.

498
00:26:11,428 --> 00:26:13,296
But I have to pay for
those with my own money.

499
00:26:13,362 --> 00:26:14,429
Does it even make sense?

500
00:26:14,695 --> 00:26:16,593
No, that's ridiculous.

501
00:26:18,295 --> 00:26:19,428
Father...

502
00:26:19,729 --> 00:26:21,468
I can't keep up with this
nonsense anymore.

503
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,542
We avoid poop not because
we're afraid, because it's filthy.

504
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:24,467
That's right.

505
00:26:24,544 --> 00:26:25,684
Just quit.

506
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:29,774
Why bother doing something so absurd?

507
00:26:30,578 --> 00:26:31,412
But...

508
00:26:32,244 --> 00:26:35,173
you got that proverb flipped around.

509
00:26:35,711 --> 00:26:38,278
We avoid poop not because it's filthy,

510
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,646
it's because we're afraid of it.

511
00:26:40,811 --> 00:26:43,264
No, you've got it flipped around.

512
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:45,101
We avoid poop because it's filthy.

513
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:47,684
No, it's not.

514
00:26:47,944 --> 00:26:49,543
But if that's the case,

515
00:26:49,778 --> 00:26:51,845
if the poop is filthy,

516
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,210
someone who cleans it
who wants avoids it the most.

517
00:26:57,778 --> 00:26:59,442
Sure you afraid.

518
00:26:59,845 --> 00:27:01,312
Since its dirt might rub off on you.

519
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,538
You certainly avoid it since you afraid.

520
00:27:06,611 --> 00:27:09,479
My mom wasn't losing the weight
because she wants to get pretty.

521
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:11,878
Mom...

522
00:27:13,311 --> 00:27:14,311
I'm sorry.

523
00:27:16,044 --> 00:27:17,344
I'm so very sorry.

524
00:27:20,144 --> 00:27:21,244
Yes, Father.

525
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:25,964
The truth is, I ran because I scared.

526
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:27,545
Right?

527
00:27:28,077 --> 00:27:30,139
You had it flipped around,
and I had it right.

528
00:27:30,678 --> 00:27:33,919
You're avoiding the poop
because you're scared.

529
00:27:35,177 --> 00:27:38,478
I run at it, thinking I could
just clean up that poop.

530
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:40,244
But that wasn't it.

531
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:42,712
Being a reporter scared me.

532
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,045
It was much scarier...

533
00:27:46,277 --> 00:27:47,412
than I ever thought.

534
00:27:47,944 --> 00:27:48,944
Really?

535
00:27:49,411 --> 00:27:50,645
Then, you'll be fine now.

536
00:27:53,344 --> 00:27:54,178
I beg your pardon?

537
00:27:54,711 --> 00:27:57,545
It's a problem if you run at something
without knowing to be fearful of it.

538
00:27:57,636 --> 00:28:00,205
But you'll be fine as long as you know it.

539
00:28:01,544 --> 00:28:03,811
You won't get into a big trouble anymore.

540
00:28:09,044 --> 00:28:11,783
Eat this tail and cheer up.

541
00:28:13,977 --> 00:28:14,733
Yes, Father.

542
00:28:15,244 --> 00:28:16,670
Father, this is just so unfair.

543
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:21,489
You only care about your first-born
and you always forget me.

544
00:28:21,745 --> 00:28:23,646
Hurry up and come here.

545
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:25,512
Come and have a seat.

546
00:28:27,811 --> 00:28:29,939
There's plenty of eel.

547
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:32,110
But there's no tail.

548
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,611
No tail!

549
00:28:47,803 --> 00:28:50,337
Nitpicker Jang, Yoon Yoo-Rae,
Ahn Chan-soo, Captain

550
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:53,813
Niece In-ha

551
00:28:59,077 --> 00:29:01,478
Let's be reporters together, In-ha.

552
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:19,245
I'm Choi Dal-Po, trainee
for Han River district.

553
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:20,612
I will return now.

554
00:29:24,811 --> 00:29:26,278
Why are you standing here like that?

555
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:31,945
Choi Dal-Po disappeared for a while
and now he's on his way back here.

556
00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:33,611
So? What about it?

557
00:29:33,877 --> 00:29:34,711
I mean...

558
00:29:35,144 --> 00:29:37,158
You know, most trainees throws a fit

559
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:39,676
or hands in their resignation
after having disappeared.

560
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,796
I doubt that.

561
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,267
Choi Dal-Po didn't seem that way to me.

562
00:29:45,511 --> 00:29:47,503
You can't judge him by his appearance.

563
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:50,811
I heard that Mr Head
Department who looks calm

564
00:29:50,845 --> 00:29:54,457
threatened his superiors, pretending to
jump off the roof when he was a trainee.

565
00:29:54,548 --> 00:29:56,681
I'm going to kill myself!

566
00:29:56,772 --> 00:29:58,172
Just calm down.

567
00:29:59,004 --> 00:30:01,207
Hey, hey, Won-goo!

568
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:05,353
Oh, my. If we're going to talk about
that, then you are the champion.

569
00:30:06,423 --> 00:30:07,597
Daddy, it's him!

570
00:30:08,088 --> 00:30:09,863
How dare you torment my son!

571
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:16,214
Your father came to the office

572
00:30:16,305 --> 00:30:19,215
and threw snakes at Hwang Gyo-dong
since you told him he was tormenting you.

573
00:30:19,306 --> 00:30:21,614
Would I did that if he
didn't bug me persistently?

574
00:30:21,705 --> 00:30:23,424
Oh, is that right?

575
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:25,556
Then I guess you were
bugging Choi Dal-Po, too?

576
00:30:25,647 --> 00:30:26,847
Enough for him to throw a fit?

577
00:30:27,681 --> 00:30:29,869
Well, I was just trying to be...

578
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:37,368
You came.

579
00:30:40,514 --> 00:30:42,608
I apologize for the trouble I've caused.

580
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:44,574
Go in. Captain is waiting for you.

581
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:46,242
Yes, Sir.

582
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,074
Yeah.

583
00:30:52,942 --> 00:30:55,844
Don't talk back even you get scolded
and don't cry either...

584
00:30:56,475 --> 00:30:56,992
Oh, my.

585
00:30:57,727 --> 00:30:59,142
You just worry about yourself.

586
00:31:01,575 --> 00:31:02,443
I was just...

587
00:31:11,942 --> 00:31:12,776
You're back.

588
00:31:13,908 --> 00:31:14,742
I'm sorry.

589
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:16,274
I have no excuses.

590
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,530
What I did was wrong.

591
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:18,858
As long as you aware.

592
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:20,034
Get back to your district.

593
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,034
Pardon me?

594
00:31:24,188 --> 00:31:25,108
Yes, Sir.

595
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:32,727
Is that it?

596
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:35,186
I came fully prepared to be disciplined.

597
00:31:35,252 --> 00:31:36,475
It was a pretty big mistake

598
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:38,311
just to be let off the
hook so easily, indeed.

599
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,130
Then, why are you letting it slide?

600
00:31:40,262 --> 00:31:41,484
You get one chance.

601
00:31:42,262 --> 00:31:44,230
Since I've made a similar mistake myself.

602
00:31:45,296 --> 00:31:46,164
A similar...

603
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:47,863
...mistake?

604
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:48,863
Yeah.

605
00:31:49,396 --> 00:31:50,912
Thirteen years ago...

606
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:54,429
I imprecisely portrayed
the head of a family as a murderer

607
00:31:55,296 --> 00:31:56,630
and because of that news

608
00:31:57,496 --> 00:31:59,430
the whole family was tragically ruined.

609
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:07,629
Then...

610
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,196
how did you ever overcome it?

611
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:14,396
I couldn't.

612
00:32:15,129 --> 00:32:16,496
I ran away, just like you did.

613
00:32:17,262 --> 00:32:18,429
I quit being a reporter.

614
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:21,405
I moved to another department
and become a producer.

615
00:32:21,496 --> 00:32:22,696
And five years later...

616
00:32:25,962 --> 00:32:28,905
I met the son of that man on a quiz show.

617
00:32:35,763 --> 00:32:37,615
Then why did you come back as a reporter?

618
00:32:39,663 --> 00:32:41,063
Because seeing that man's son...

619
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:44,096
...made me ashamed.

620
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:48,356
As if he caught me hiding
because I was scared.

621
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,531
That's why I came back
to news department.

622
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:56,496
How did it feel to come back?

623
00:32:58,629 --> 00:32:59,463
Is reporter...

624
00:33:01,262 --> 00:33:02,421
...something you can do?

625
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:08,257
I feel like my whole body

626
00:33:08,629 --> 00:33:11,252
is being pricked by thousands of needles.

627
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:20,130
Isn't this the first flu
you've had since high school?

628
00:33:20,763 --> 00:33:21,432
Yeah.

629
00:33:24,596 --> 00:33:26,086
But how did you know that?

630
00:33:28,363 --> 00:33:30,518
You told me that awhile back.

631
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,997
Anyway, I think this flu is no joke.

632
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:34,897
Let's tell seonbae and
take you to the hospital.

633
00:33:34,988 --> 00:33:35,822
-Okay?
-No.

634
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:38,396
I just barely make points.

635
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:40,363
I can't lose it over the simple flu.

636
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:43,563
But I don't even have the strength
to move my fingers.

637
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:46,263
Chan-soo!

638
00:33:46,995 --> 00:33:47,829
Choi In-ha.

639
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:52,029
What's that?

640
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:54,644
An investigation report?
Or a case report?

641
00:33:54,735 --> 00:33:55,735
Are you going to get approval?

642
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:58,273
Get away! You can get me catch a cold.

643
00:33:59,714 --> 00:34:00,844
Tell me about it first.

644
00:34:00,943 --> 00:34:02,476
I'll get you catch a cold
if you don't tell me.

645
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:05,728
It's nothing, just a phone call log.

646
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:06,919
What call log?

647
00:34:08,977 --> 00:34:11,650
It's the recent container fire case's
suspect, Moon Duk-soo's call log.

648
00:34:11,741 --> 00:34:13,191
You won't understand even if you see it.

649
00:34:13,282 --> 00:34:15,079
We might need it down the road.

650
00:34:15,377 --> 00:34:16,868
Seo Bum-Jo, take a picture.

651
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:17,516
Okay!

652
00:34:18,344 --> 00:34:19,279
No, you can't have it.

653
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,809
Customer name: Moon Duk-soo

654
00:34:33,077 --> 00:34:34,900
Outgoing Calls

655
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,044
Moon Duk-soo's call log.

656
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:39,267
Choi Dal-Po.

657
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:40,425
Are you back now?

658
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:41,338
Yeah.

659
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,238
You just memorized
the whole list, didn't you?

660
00:34:44,724 --> 00:34:45,658
Maybe.

661
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,157
In-ha.

662
00:34:47,357 --> 00:34:48,197
We need to talk.

663
00:34:48,524 --> 00:34:51,228
In-ha seems to have much
to say to you, anyway.

664
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:53,053
She kept looking for
you while you're away.

665
00:34:54,323 --> 00:34:56,224
I have nothing to say.

666
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,890
We have to go to Traffic
Accident Department.

667
00:35:02,357 --> 00:35:03,865
Okay, let's go.

668
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,290
What's wrong with her?

669
00:35:07,381 --> 00:35:08,648
It's like she's avoiding you.

670
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,024
Yeah. She is avoiding me.

671
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,124
Why?

672
00:35:13,857 --> 00:35:15,624
I said some things I shouldn't have said.

673
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,724
You still haven't fixed that habit?

674
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:21,057
Back in high school, you used to say...

675
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,589
You have to let me finish, man!

676
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,980
That's why people says you're rude, man!

677
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,358
Come on, hyungnim.

678
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,362
We just saw a wrecker come in.
How can you say there was no accident?

679
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,522
-What kind of an accident was it?
-I told you it was nothing.

680
00:35:33,857 --> 00:35:35,391
We're investigating it now,
so come back later.

681
00:35:35,891 --> 00:35:37,892
I promise we'll be back later.

682
00:35:40,106 --> 00:35:41,118
In-ha.

683
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:42,043
In-ha!

684
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:46,251
I'm okay.

685
00:35:47,451 --> 00:35:48,760
Where do we have to go next?

686
00:35:50,751 --> 00:35:52,370
We have to go around
the precinct station.

687
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,860
You think you can manage?

688
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:56,151
I told you that I'm fine.

689
00:35:56,618 --> 00:35:57,493
This won't do.

690
00:35:57,584 --> 00:35:58,684
I'm going to call my mom.

691
00:35:58,751 --> 00:35:59,585
Are you out of your mind?

692
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:02,889
Who would do mawari with a luxurious car?

693
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,165
We'd get in a lot of trouble.

694
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,841
I'll take your punishment,
so don't worry.

695
00:36:14,997 --> 00:36:17,127
New police of hope carries
out duty to the fullest

696
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:18,365
Hey, Choi Dal-Po!

697
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:20,064
Why you didn't answer my calls?

698
00:36:20,155 --> 00:36:22,255
Do you know how hard it was for
me to do all the work by myself?

699
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:27,631
What the heck?

700
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,085
That Chairman came back?

701
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,897
Watch your head.

702
00:36:31,453 --> 00:36:32,320
Where are those two going?

703
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,530
No way!

704
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,836
They're doing mawari with that car?

705
00:36:47,063 --> 00:36:47,897
Yeah.

706
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,766
I'm so jealous!

707
00:36:51,297 --> 00:36:52,198
That must be nice.

708
00:36:52,397 --> 00:36:55,304
She's partnered up with a rich boy,
and making her rounds in a nice car.

709
00:36:56,797 --> 00:37:00,164
All I got was a trashy partner who makes
me do all the hard work by myself.

710
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:03,770
I'm sorry for being a trashy partner.

711
00:37:08,084 --> 00:37:08,871
As long as you know.

712
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:11,196
Do you have anything to report?

713
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,692
No, they're all minor stuff.

714
00:37:13,938 --> 00:37:15,531
Just tell me even though it's all minor.

715
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:18,978
Just a simple DUI case.
That's already been reported.

716
00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:21,741
Your friend gave me this one,
but I'm passing on it.

717
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,471
Hey, I'm not passing on anything anymore.

718
00:37:24,562 --> 00:37:26,562
-Just tell me.
-It's about that container fire.

719
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,539
Nothing much to it.

720
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,235
That suspect on the run, Moon Duk-soo.

721
00:37:29,506 --> 00:37:31,164
He's actually someone we know.

722
00:37:31,464 --> 00:37:32,731
-Someone we know?
-Yeah.

723
00:37:33,096 --> 00:37:35,506
You know the factory explosion
news we saw during our interview?

724
00:37:35,597 --> 00:37:38,383
Remember Mr Moon from the interview who
said that he tried to stop the Fire Chief?

725
00:37:39,464 --> 00:37:40,298
It's him.

726
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:45,998
The Chief insisted
to go in there aimlessly.

727
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,157
It's nothing. I just amazed.

728
00:37:49,464 --> 00:37:50,631
That's him?

729
00:37:54,197 --> 00:37:55,197
Thank you.

730
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,203
You really don't have to do all this.

731
00:37:57,732 --> 00:37:59,107
Of course, I should.

732
00:37:59,198 --> 00:38:00,238
Since it's my son's request.

733
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:01,564
Don't worry.

734
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:04,678
I'll get you all the cases tonight.

735
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:15,231
Thank you all for your hard work.

736
00:38:16,096 --> 00:38:17,730
Are there any cases today?

737
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:21,422
-I beg your pardon?
-My son is a reporter.

738
00:38:21,513 --> 00:38:23,013
He's looking for a case
that he can report on.

739
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:26,129
Oh, this is for you.

740
00:38:26,421 --> 00:38:26,950
Yes.

741
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,600
Anything?

742
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:34,433
How can there not be any cases?

743
00:38:34,524 --> 00:38:35,993
Crimes are committed everywhere.

744
00:38:36,084 --> 00:38:37,560
Just take a look at the news.

745
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:39,851
Where do you think those news surged up?

746
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,543
This is where they all surged up.

747
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:44,418
Oh my.

748
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:46,110
Sir.

749
00:38:49,351 --> 00:38:50,906
So tell me...

750
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:55,004
Why did you get drunk and
smash the billboard sign?

751
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:00,104
You must have a reason.

752
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:02,219
Hey!

753
00:39:02,484 --> 00:39:03,770
Tell me.

754
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,752
There was a DUI case by a college
student at Junghwa Police Station.

755
00:39:08,884 --> 00:39:10,578
His blood alcohol level was...

756
00:39:10,669 --> 00:39:12,087
0.06 percent.

757
00:39:12,178 --> 00:39:14,461
...0.06 percent which will have
his driver license revoked...

758
00:39:15,112 --> 00:39:15,882
License suspended.

759
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:17,711
I mean, his license...

760
00:39:18,278 --> 00:39:19,411
...suspended.

761
00:39:19,836 --> 00:39:21,479
Yes, I understand.

762
00:39:24,853 --> 00:39:26,613
Thank you, Ma'am.

763
00:39:27,244 --> 00:39:29,411
I was able to make the
report, all thanks to you.

764
00:39:29,945 --> 00:39:30,779
That's good to hear.

765
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:33,145
Since we're done in Junghwa district,

766
00:39:33,255 --> 00:39:36,255
now take us to police
station in Eungam district.

767
00:39:36,346 --> 00:39:37,472
Yes, Ma'am.

768
00:39:38,912 --> 00:39:39,746
Mother.

769
00:39:40,146 --> 00:39:41,711
Let's go back to Han River Police Station.

770
00:39:41,802 --> 00:39:43,776
I think she needs to get some rest
at the pressroom.

771
00:39:44,379 --> 00:39:45,602
No, I'm fine.

772
00:39:45,702 --> 00:39:46,455
I am totally fine.

773
00:39:46,546 --> 00:39:48,006
No, you're not.

774
00:39:48,097 --> 00:39:50,203
You'll only interfere our job.
Just go back.

775
00:39:50,294 --> 00:39:52,560
My mother and I can handle the rest.

776
00:39:52,627 --> 00:39:54,192
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.

777
00:39:54,283 --> 00:39:55,375
Go get some rest.

778
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:58,533
-Mr Jung, Han River Police Station.
-Yes, Ma'am.

779
00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:26,551
Toilet seat

780
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:31,865
It feels warm.

781
00:40:58,308 --> 00:40:59,659
Why is a girl sleeping there?

782
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,983
I think she's a reporter.

783
00:41:01,074 --> 00:41:02,042
I wonder if she's sick.

784
00:41:07,197 --> 00:41:08,967
-Choi In-ha!
-Don't come near me.

785
00:41:09,058 --> 00:41:10,306
Don't come near me. Go away!

786
00:41:10,397 --> 00:41:11,231
Be quiet.

787
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:13,949
Hey, put me down.

788
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:16,707
Get away from me.

789
00:41:17,614 --> 00:41:18,482
Don’t move.

790
00:41:18,614 --> 00:41:19,914
You need to go to the hospital.

791
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:20,881
No.

792
00:41:21,447 --> 00:41:22,956
This cold is extreme.

793
00:41:23,813 --> 00:41:25,580
You'd get into trouble
if you get sick, too.

794
00:41:25,813 --> 00:41:26,647
What?

795
00:41:27,014 --> 00:41:28,882
You've been avoiding me
because of that cold?

796
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:31,560
This really hurts.

797
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,014
I can't get you sick.

798
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:37,785
You dumb idiot!

799
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:45,125
She's got shingles.

800
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,007
-Pardon me?
-She must've been in a great pain.

801
00:41:48,098 --> 00:41:49,432
How did she endure that?

802
00:41:50,907 --> 00:41:51,741
Is that...

803
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:53,861
...contagious?

804
00:41:53,952 --> 00:41:55,217
How is that important right now?

805
00:41:55,308 --> 00:41:56,223
Don't worry.

806
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:58,118
It usually doesn't infect adults.

807
00:41:58,822 --> 00:41:59,822
That's a relief.

808
00:42:01,657 --> 00:42:03,185
I have so many things...

809
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:05,733
...to say to you.

810
00:42:07,423 --> 00:42:09,164
How can you fall asleep now, you idiot?

811
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,965
I've given her
some antiviral drug and painkiller.

812
00:42:12,056 --> 00:42:13,303
She'd be better soon.

813
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:15,998
Make her get some rest at
home once she wakes up.

814
00:42:16,164 --> 00:42:17,164
Thank you.

815
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:30,465
Cheer up...

816
00:43:18,865 --> 00:43:19,875
Uncle.

817
00:43:22,364 --> 00:43:23,422
Are you there?

818
00:43:23,731 --> 00:43:24,996
Yeah, I'm here.

819
00:43:25,964 --> 00:43:26,964
I have to say...

820
00:43:43,698 --> 00:43:44,798
Dal-Po...

821
00:43:50,531 --> 00:43:51,714
Dal-Po.

822
00:43:52,665 --> 00:43:53,763
Yeah, what is it?

823
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:55,231
I'm here.

824
00:43:56,365 --> 00:43:58,732
I have so much to tell you.

825
00:43:59,198 --> 00:44:00,032
I...

826
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:04,023
Just get some sleep for now.
You can tell me later.

827
00:44:39,798 --> 00:44:42,665
You must've been crazy, you crazy hand!

828
00:45:43,832 --> 00:45:44,832
In-ha.

829
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:46,165
Hey, In-ha.

830
00:45:46,631 --> 00:45:47,806
I... I'm okay.

831
00:45:47,897 --> 00:45:48,531
I'm all better now.

832
00:45:48,755 --> 00:45:49,623
I'm okay.

833
00:45:50,822 --> 00:45:51,706
Choi In-ha!

834
00:45:55,822 --> 00:45:57,509
Hey, stop right there!

835
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:58,861
You don't put your shoes on!

836
00:45:58,952 --> 00:46:00,139
I'll stop when you stop!

837
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:01,131
Okay, I've stopped!

838
00:46:01,781 --> 00:46:02,615
I've stopped.

839
00:46:03,548 --> 00:46:05,063
Let's go back inside.
You're still a patient.

840
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:07,015
Hey!

841
00:46:07,414 --> 00:46:09,315
I really have a lot to say to you.

842
00:46:09,947 --> 00:46:12,857
I've been avoiding as not to get you
sick, but since it's not, I'll tell you.

843
00:46:13,214 --> 00:46:14,159
Okay, go ahead.

844
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:16,481
You know that news on
the gym lady, right?

845
00:46:16,915 --> 00:46:18,282
I dug that up.

846
00:46:18,581 --> 00:46:21,052
I was going to report it like you
guys, but I started hiccuping.

847
00:46:21,143 --> 00:46:22,944
Why? As I feel something wasn't right.

848
00:46:23,302 --> 00:46:25,995
That's why I went back to the hospital
and there I met the daughter.

849
00:46:27,281 --> 00:46:27,841
I know.

850
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:30,766
You said I shouldn't be a reporter
since I'm a Pinocchio, right?

851
00:46:31,397 --> 00:46:32,465
But what are you going to do now?

852
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,438
It precisely because I'm a Pinocchio
that I humiliate you guys!

853
00:46:35,529 --> 00:46:36,596
Because I'm a Pinocchio!

854
00:46:41,105 --> 00:46:41,939
I know.

855
00:46:42,739 --> 00:46:44,075
You were right, and I was wrong.

856
00:46:45,071 --> 00:46:45,723
I'm sorry.

857
00:46:46,393 --> 00:46:47,860
I apologize for what I
said at the interview.

858
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:48,939
Hey!

859
00:46:49,038 --> 00:46:51,522
You can't apologize already.
I'm not finished yet!

860
00:46:52,338 --> 00:46:53,172
Okay.

861
00:46:53,271 --> 00:46:54,000
Keep going.

862
00:46:56,171 --> 00:46:58,944
I still remember every single word
you said to me during the interview.

863
00:46:59,138 --> 00:47:00,672
I'm really good at holding grudges.

864
00:47:00,763 --> 00:47:02,264
Remember what you said to me?

865
00:47:02,572 --> 00:47:06,339
That people like me who don't know the
weight our words carry can't be reporters.

866
00:47:06,772 --> 00:47:07,805
What about you, then?

867
00:47:08,138 --> 00:47:10,129
Did you know the weight of
your words as you blabbers?

868
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,520
You think you have what it takes to
be a reporter? I don't think so!

869
00:47:14,405 --> 00:47:15,239
Yeah.

870
00:47:16,338 --> 00:47:17,482
Just like you said...

871
00:47:18,105 --> 00:47:18,933
I wasn't a reporter.

872
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:21,172
I was...

873
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:23,153
...terrible.

874
00:47:25,372 --> 00:47:26,206
Really?

875
00:47:26,788 --> 00:47:28,369
I feel much better now.

876
00:47:28,705 --> 00:47:32,203
Seeing you get humiliated after disrespect
I've had all these years is like...

877
00:47:32,294 --> 00:47:33,575
Serves you right!

878
00:47:36,638 --> 00:47:38,762
It makes me feel great!

879
00:47:38,853 --> 00:47:40,740
I'll humiliate you
occasionally in the future.

880
00:47:41,271 --> 00:47:44,538
I'm so excited to think of you
look so down like this even more.

881
00:47:46,105 --> 00:47:46,805
You're lying.

882
00:47:50,038 --> 00:47:50,872
Okay, fine.

883
00:47:51,505 --> 00:47:52,772
I was worried about you.

884
00:47:53,372 --> 00:47:56,839
I was right and you were wrong, but it
annoys me that I was worried about you.

885
00:48:02,071 --> 00:48:03,104
I'm listening.

886
00:48:05,505 --> 00:48:07,439
I was worried when you're not around.

887
00:48:08,372 --> 00:48:10,873
Whether you were blaming
yourself or hurt so much.

888
00:48:11,605 --> 00:48:13,302
I kept worrying, and worried some more.

889
00:48:21,238 --> 00:48:22,887
You're a reporter from the rival company,

890
00:48:23,071 --> 00:48:25,789
but it annoys me for acting like
an amateur and worrying about you.

891
00:48:33,238 --> 00:48:34,639
Why is this so hard?

892
00:48:35,205 --> 00:48:36,139
It's not a big deal,

893
00:48:36,405 --> 00:48:39,271
but why can't I just get over you?
Making me so pathetic.

894
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:54,506
Pretend you didn't hear that either.

895
00:48:55,538 --> 00:48:56,538
I'm sorry.

896
00:48:59,871 --> 00:49:01,605
I always asked you to forget what I say.

897
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:05,005
You must find me pathetic and exhausting.

898
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,279
I have no idea what I'm doing.

899
00:49:11,597 --> 00:49:14,057
I must be too cold to
think clearly right now.

900
00:49:26,372 --> 00:49:27,620
Hey, what are...?

901
00:49:30,338 --> 00:49:31,241
Because it's cold.

902
00:49:32,871 --> 00:49:34,672
I must also be too cold to think clearly.

903
00:49:36,871 --> 00:49:37,871
Dal-Po...

904
00:49:50,305 --> 00:49:51,139
Seonbae.

905
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,712
They also do DUI check on at dawn?

906
00:49:53,844 --> 00:49:54,678
Excuse me.

907
00:49:55,345 --> 00:49:56,522
Yes?

908
00:49:56,613 --> 00:49:58,307
I just want to ask something.

909
00:50:00,404 --> 00:50:02,676
That woman standing next to the anchor,

910
00:50:03,178 --> 00:50:04,083
is she a reporter, too?

911
00:50:04,844 --> 00:50:05,678
Yes.

912
00:50:06,144 --> 00:50:06,978
Why do you ask?

913
00:50:07,844 --> 00:50:09,349
They both just look like.

914
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:10,791
You have a good eyes.

915
00:50:10,977 --> 00:50:12,718
They're mother and daughter.

916
00:50:18,478 --> 00:50:19,346
No wonder...

917
00:50:20,712 --> 00:50:22,490
Thank you for letting me know.

918
00:50:29,535 --> 00:50:30,758
Where have I seen him before?

919
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,929
He looks familiar.

920
00:50:50,265 --> 00:50:51,487
Long time no see.

921
00:50:51,578 --> 00:50:52,594
How have you guys been?

922
00:50:52,685 --> 00:50:53,749
In-ha!

923
00:50:53,815 --> 00:50:55,267
-Choi In-ha.
-How are you feeling?

924
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:56,553
-Are you all better now?
-Yeah.

925
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:59,037
I've been sleeping for days like a
corpse, and I feel all better now.

926
00:50:59,952 --> 00:51:01,499
Hey, what are you doing like a pervert?

927
00:51:01,741 --> 00:51:03,620
You washed your hair? With shampoo?

928
00:51:04,653 --> 00:51:06,684
Of course. I took some
day off and went home.

929
00:51:09,619 --> 00:51:10,393
That must be nice.

930
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,355
I'm too healthy that I don't get sick.

931
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:18,941
You really are all better now?

932
00:51:19,325 --> 00:51:20,859
Yeah, I feel like...

933
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:23,534
...I can do mawari all over
Seoul if they told me to.

934
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,455
That's Dal-Po.

935
00:51:27,086 --> 00:51:27,958
Hey, Choi Dal-Po!

936
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:30,553
Your niece just came back.

937
00:51:35,201 --> 00:51:35,890
Where?

938
00:51:38,424 --> 00:51:39,594
She was just here.

939
00:51:40,529 --> 00:51:41,399
She is.

940
00:51:41,529 --> 00:51:42,586
Where did she go suddenly?

941
00:51:58,129 --> 00:51:58,838
Hey.

942
00:51:59,028 --> 00:52:00,762
You're not make things up with In-ha yet?

943
00:52:01,995 --> 00:52:03,162
You're dangerous lately.

944
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:04,863
Seong-hak asked me about you, too.

945
00:52:04,962 --> 00:52:07,329
He said you look at In-ha so fondly

946
00:52:07,729 --> 00:52:09,843
that you two don't seems
to be just uncle and niece.

947
00:52:10,562 --> 00:52:13,080
As if you like her as a woman.

948
00:52:18,729 --> 00:52:19,706
I do like her as a woman.

949
00:52:21,329 --> 00:52:22,177
Am I not allowed to?

950
00:52:22,863 --> 00:52:23,552
What?

951
00:52:34,229 --> 00:52:35,725
Geez, you're back again?

952
00:52:35,816 --> 00:52:37,150
Let me get some work done.

953
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:40,925
You said that there are some puzzle
pieces didn't seem right last time.

954
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:43,125
I'm just asking to share
those puzzle pieces.

955
00:52:43,591 --> 00:52:45,624
Who knows? Maybe I can
help you put it together.

956
00:52:45,691 --> 00:52:47,025
I told you that it's no big deal.

957
00:52:47,057 --> 00:52:49,227
My boss told me to give up, so I did.

958
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:50,585
I know you're lying.

959
00:52:51,261 --> 00:52:53,661
Why would you see Moon Duk-soo's
call log when you give up?

960
00:52:53,994 --> 00:52:54,962
Tell me the truth.

961
00:52:55,194 --> 00:52:57,294
You're looking
for Moon Duk-soo's accomplice.

962
00:52:57,428 --> 00:52:58,875
-Aren't you?
-No, I'm not.

963
00:52:59,261 --> 00:53:01,394
I tried all of them,
but I couldn't find anything.

964
00:53:01,594 --> 00:53:02,428
They all have alibi.

965
00:53:03,127 --> 00:53:04,427
Sure you tried everything?

966
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:08,395
Well, n-not everything.

967
00:53:08,528 --> 00:53:09,554
But mostly everything.

968
00:53:10,728 --> 00:53:12,229
So, you haven't tried everything?

969
00:53:23,528 --> 00:53:25,414
You seriously memorized
all those numbers?

970
00:53:25,628 --> 00:53:26,651
At a glimpse?

971
00:53:26,927 --> 00:53:27,761
Yeah.

972
00:53:28,327 --> 00:53:31,041
This is Moon Duk-soo's call
log before he went missing.

973
00:53:31,161 --> 00:53:32,086
Let's look through it.

974
00:53:32,761 --> 00:53:33,961
No, you do it yourself.

975
00:53:34,052 --> 00:53:36,759
Why are you dwelling on an old case
when we've got tons to report?

976
00:53:37,094 --> 00:53:38,628
Are they your enemy or something?

977
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,938
I've told you.

978
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:43,895
I'm not going to pass
on anything anymore.

979
00:53:47,594 --> 00:53:48,231
Wait...

980
00:53:48,561 --> 00:53:51,091
-What is it?
-I think I know this number.

981
00:53:51,594 --> 00:53:52,417
What number?

982
00:53:57,221 --> 00:53:58,537
Bumper

983
00:53:58,628 --> 00:53:59,828
Oh, you do know the number.

984
00:54:00,494 --> 00:54:01,471
Who is 'Bumper'?

985
00:54:02,561 --> 00:54:05,098
You don't need to worry about the bumper.

986
00:54:08,561 --> 00:54:11,062
I hit someone's bumper recently
and I paid a compensation for.

987
00:54:11,194 --> 00:54:12,207
It's his number.

988
00:54:12,327 --> 00:54:13,228
Really?

989
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:14,661
Wow, what a small world.

990
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:15,894
Give him a call.

991
00:54:16,327 --> 00:54:16,884
Yeah.

992
00:54:22,161 --> 00:54:22,995
Hello?

993
00:54:23,194 --> 00:54:23,969
Yes.

994
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,410
Hello, do you remember me?

995
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,429
I was the one who scratched your bumper.

996
00:54:33,953 --> 00:54:35,300
Tower Dal-Po

997
00:54:36,027 --> 00:54:37,194
Yeah, where are you now?

998
00:54:37,294 --> 00:54:38,909
I'm out at Zenon Square now.

999
00:54:39,127 --> 00:54:41,510
Are you out shopping instead
of doing your work?

1000
00:54:42,661 --> 00:54:44,505
No, do you remember Moon Duk-soo?

1001
00:54:44,596 --> 00:54:45,954
The container fire case suspect.

1002
00:54:46,045 --> 00:54:49,479
I'm here to meet one of the
people from his call log list.

1003
00:54:49,795 --> 00:54:50,836
Are you a detective?

1004
00:54:50,927 --> 00:54:52,334
Why would you meet him?

1005
00:54:52,628 --> 00:54:54,532
You never know, he can be an accomplice.

1006
00:54:54,761 --> 00:54:57,221
Even if he isn't, he could possibly
know where Moon Duk-soo is.

1007
00:54:57,317 --> 00:54:58,337
You brat!

1008
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:00,262
Who told you to do that on your own?

1009
00:55:00,921 --> 00:55:02,403
Bumper

1010
00:55:03,161 --> 00:55:05,129
Sorry, but he's beeping
in on the other line.

1011
00:55:05,361 --> 00:55:07,128
I'll call back when I'm done here.

1012
00:55:07,528 --> 00:55:08,728
Hey, Choi Dal-Po!

1013
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:09,653
Hey!

1014
00:55:10,461 --> 00:55:11,295
Yes.

1015
00:55:12,795 --> 00:55:14,095
Geez, he's driving me crazy.

1016
00:55:14,927 --> 00:55:15,761
Why?

1017
00:55:16,294 --> 00:55:17,694
Choi Dal-Po cause trouble again?

1018
00:55:17,761 --> 00:55:18,595
Yes.

1019
00:55:18,694 --> 00:55:20,428
He pulled a real good one this time.

1020
00:55:20,594 --> 00:55:23,495
He's out digging up a case on his
own instead of doing mawari.

1021
00:55:23,895 --> 00:55:25,695
Of course, a reporter
supposed to dig up a case.

1022
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,428
He's not just digging it up...

1023
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:31,428
But he didn't listen to me!

1024
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:33,519
He didn't listen!

1025
00:55:38,694 --> 00:55:39,961
Chief...

1026
00:55:40,561 --> 00:55:43,012
Moon Duk-soo's cellphone
location has been traced.

1027
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,737
He's at Zenon Square right now.

1028
00:55:45,812 --> 00:55:46,845
Oh my...

1029
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:49,020
How could we find him
in that crowded place?

1030
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:50,765
-Go and check first.
-Yes, Sir.

1031
00:55:51,645 --> 00:55:52,712
Hey, you two go with him.

1032
00:55:52,803 --> 00:55:53,637
Yes, Sir.

1033
00:55:55,011 --> 00:55:57,211
Choi Dal-Po, that brat isn't
answering his phone now!

1034
00:55:57,578 --> 00:55:59,510
He’s not listening to me!

1035
00:56:05,044 --> 00:56:05,878
Choi Dal-Po.

1036
00:56:07,745 --> 00:56:08,745
Not bad.

1037
00:56:11,211 --> 00:56:12,617
How did it feel to come back?

1038
00:56:14,645 --> 00:56:15,479
Is reporter...

1039
00:56:17,278 --> 00:56:18,345
...something you can do?

1040
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:22,545
Are you asking whether
you can handle this job?

1041
00:56:25,678 --> 00:56:26,512
Yes.

1042
00:56:27,411 --> 00:56:28,411
I'm not sure.

1043
00:56:30,445 --> 00:56:32,212
I think it's too early...

1044
00:56:33,144 --> 00:56:34,878
...for you to ask that question.

1045
00:56:37,278 --> 00:56:40,345
You're going to see, hear, and deliver
a lot of cases in the future.

1046
00:56:41,445 --> 00:56:43,143
Cases that are much more

1047
00:56:43,378 --> 00:56:45,808
difficult to solve and handle
than the gym lady's case.

1048
00:56:47,178 --> 00:56:48,309
I'm wearing a black coat.

1049
00:56:58,378 --> 00:56:59,645
Yes, I see you.

1050
00:57:18,345 --> 00:57:21,227
Cases where you can't make
neither choice nor judgment...

1051
00:57:26,244 --> 00:57:28,212
...and even something you can't imagine.

1052
00:57:41,977 --> 00:57:44,845
I told Mr Han that you didn't
need to pay for the bumper.

1053
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,778
But he came to you to pay for it instead.

1054
00:57:49,844 --> 00:57:51,111
I haven't introduced myself.

1055
00:57:52,244 --> 00:57:53,631
My name is Ki Jae-myung.

1056
00:57:55,178 --> 00:57:56,512
Reporting such a case

1057
00:57:57,044 --> 00:57:59,741
could mean life or death for someone.

1058
00:58:01,844 --> 00:58:03,545
When you come across a case like that

1059
00:58:04,311 --> 00:58:05,621
ask me again then.

1060
00:58:14,478 --> 00:58:15,312
What is...

1061
00:58:16,877 --> 00:58:17,877
...your name again?

1062
00:58:18,911 --> 00:58:19,745
It's Jae-myung.

1063
00:58:20,445 --> 00:58:21,279
Ki Jae-myung.

1064
00:58:27,745 --> 00:58:28,745
Will I be able...

1065
00:58:30,411 --> 00:58:31,778
...to handle it?

1066
00:58:38,345 --> 00:58:40,225
What was your name again?

1067
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:53,279
My name is...

1068
00:58:54,678 --> 00:58:57,123
...Choi Dal-Po.

1069
00:59:24,911 --> 00:59:26,812
13 years is just a long time.

1070
00:59:27,011 --> 00:59:29,631
-Hyung.
-Why are you eating all by yourself?

1071
00:59:29,722 --> 00:59:31,489
You should've called up your girlfriend.

1072
00:59:32,044 --> 00:59:34,139
Tell them to get a good picture of people

1073
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:36,320
falling on an icy street.
And the reporter is...

1074
00:59:36,411 --> 00:59:37,411
I'll write up a decent report!

1075
00:59:41,237 --> 00:59:41,995
Congratulations.
