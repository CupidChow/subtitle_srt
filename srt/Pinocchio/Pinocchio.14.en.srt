1
00:00:09,986 --> 00:00:11,867
Pinocchio

2
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,114
You know the saying that goes,
“It’s a luxury because it’s expensive."

3
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,306
It has to be expensive
for people to want it.

4
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,740
You should stop.

5
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,289
But they’re bags that students carry.

6
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:48,942
Do you have to do luxury item marketing?

7
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,200
I said stop!

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,085
Just what do you want to hear?

9
00:00:54,459 --> 00:00:57,875
Are you saying that my mother
is a spine breaker of these parents?

10
00:00:57,966 --> 00:01:01,355
That she does luxury item marketing
because she's crazy about money?

11
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,115
Just what do you want to say?

12
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:07,030
I want to tell the truth.

13
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:09,943
If the story is just as we covered so far,
it’s exactly as you said.

14
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:13,849
What? Don't talk about my mom like that.

15
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,829
What are you guys doing?

16
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:21,596
Don’t you know that
we’re in the middle of a scoop?

17
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:23,734
What are you guys doing?

18
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:26,993
What are you doing right now?

19
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:29,395
Why are they doing that?

20
00:01:29,486 --> 00:01:32,249
-Stop!
-Hey, why are you doing this?

21
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:34,049
If you keep this up,
you’ll be the ones on the news.

22
00:01:37,402 --> 00:01:39,110
If you’re upset with me,
take it out of me.

23
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,067
Don’t make my mother into a snob.

24
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,219
Look at this
with an objective reporter's eye.

25
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:44,702
Can't you see how wrong this is?

26
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:47,242
Stop. Your words are too harsh right now.

27
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:51,362
What?

28
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:54,736
I think it's too early for you
to speak of business skills or snobbery

29
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:56,109
without hearing her side of the story.

30
00:01:58,056 --> 00:01:59,556
You...

31
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,752
Ms Chairwoman,
your son is here at the store.

32
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,892
My son?

33
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:29,780
Thank you for taking my side.

34
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,348
I wasn’t taking your side.
Don't be mistaken.

35
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,138
Son?

36
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,021
What are you doing here?

37
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:44,830
Who are all these people?

38
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,316
Mother...

39
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,030
Episode 14 -Hansel and Gretel

40
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,177
That’s too bad.

41
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:06,405
So, what happened to that Santa?

42
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:10,262
He was arrested and will be transferred
to the prosecution soon.

43
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:12,160
What in the world...

44
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,626
I'm so upset something like that happened
because of a bag from my store.

45
00:03:15,726 --> 00:03:19,946
What am I going to do?
I stirred up trouble, didn’t I?

46
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:23,639
What do I have to do?
Should I issue a public apology?

47
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:25,783
No. It’s not like that.

48
00:03:25,883 --> 00:03:27,817
You don't need to apologize for this.

49
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:30,200
I’m sorry but I’d like to request
your cooperation in covering this.

50
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:33,415
It'd be great if you'll allow us
to film and interview the employees.

51
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,905
Hey, you!

52
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:37,095
It's okay. Of course I should.

53
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:40,857
If you need anything else, tell me.

54
00:03:42,465 --> 00:03:45,969
Mother. If the report goes out,
people might start a boycott.

55
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:48,759
If that’s what the customers want,
I’ll have to go with it. What can I do?

56
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:52,756
Ms Goh, Please go help them
with covering the story.

57
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:53,778
Mother, that's...

58
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:56,316
If you need anything, please tell her.

59
00:03:56,885 --> 00:03:58,407
Yes. Thank you.

60
00:03:58,507 --> 00:04:00,348
Ma'am, you are so cool!

61
00:04:02,696 --> 00:04:03,536
Thank you.

62
00:04:05,006 --> 00:04:07,057
Mother, I'm sorry.

63
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:11,383
It's all right, Son. Don't worry.

64
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:32,317
I don’t know. I don't remember.

65
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,424
This looks like my mom’s. Why is it here?

66
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:39,874
I heard that
you left your cell phone there.

67
00:04:39,974 --> 00:04:41,309
I guess I did.

68
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:57,212
Ki Ha-myung.

69
00:04:57,782 --> 00:05:00,735
What did you do on Christmas Eve?
You didn’t answer your phone.

70
00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:03,432
I was a little sick.

71
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,920
Really?

72
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:08,929
I knew it. I was...

73
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:10,049
That's what is was.

74
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:11,454
Of course.

75
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:15,002
Are you alright? Are you all better?

76
00:05:16,702 --> 00:05:17,542
What are you doing?

77
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:20,041
You never know.

78
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:22,685
What do you mean?

79
00:05:23,877 --> 00:05:26,382
Are you still suspicious
of Bum-Jo’s mother?

80
00:05:28,837 --> 00:05:32,564
From what I saw,
Bum-Jo’s mother is a total heroine.

81
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:34,684
She revealed all of it so honestly.

82
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:36,585
I take back what I said about
her being creepy.

83
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,189
I'm not so sure.

84
00:05:39,844 --> 00:05:42,269
What’s wrong? What's bothering you?

85
00:05:52,494 --> 00:05:54,364
You can start talking
when the cue sign is given.

86
00:05:57,074 --> 00:05:58,694
This product is exactly the...

87
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:01,447
They are called One Plus grade
among the parents...

88
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:05,034
It’s 100 percent handmade product
made with alligator leather...

89
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:06,679
Button goes like this.

90
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:10,009
It’s discounted 100 dollars.
We’re offering it at 900 dollars.

91
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:18,029
Your mother left her cell phone
at my house once.

92
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,189
Didn’t you visit the Chairwoman’s home
13 years ago?

93
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:22,257
I don't remember. Why?

94
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:26,859
It's alright.

95
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,573
The back side looks neat, right?

96
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,134
Yes, alright.

97
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:32,450
Don’t you think Seo Bum-Jo’s mother
is amazing?

98
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,813
When it's broadcast,
sales and image damage will be great

99
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:37,802
but she said all that was okay.
She’s a great person, isn't she?

100
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:39,702
Yeah, I agree.

101
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:43,565
What’s with you? Why are you hiccuping?

102
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:45,837
You don’t think that she’s a great person?

103
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:47,902
I guess not.

104
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:50,959
Are you suspicious of Bum-Jo’s mother,
like Ha-myung?

105
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:53,404
Yeah, I think so.

106
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:58,319
Yoon Yoo-Rae. Let’s start reporting.

107
00:06:58,632 --> 00:07:00,027
Okay!

108
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:02,730
Choi In-ha. You come here too.

109
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,830
Okay.

110
00:07:04,964 --> 00:07:07,977
A-E-I-O-U.

111
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:10,101
Among the students...

112
00:07:12,902 --> 00:07:15,352
Hey! Are you going to do the report
wearing that school uniform?

113
00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:19,935
Put this on.

114
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,864
Yes.

115
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:25,856
Since we don’t know which one we'll use,
let’s do several.

116
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:28,964
Yes.

117
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:35,761
Among the students,
so-called Le Coq Son crisis is happening.

118
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:38,575
This bag is over a thousand dollars.

119
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:43,294
But from 50 percent to 70 percent
of students are carrying them.

120
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:46,826
Even though they’re from the same brand,
they are ranked based on the price.

121
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:50,944
The more expensive it is,
the more snobby they can be.

122
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:54,897
Among the teenagers,
this bag is sensationally popular...

123
00:07:54,988 --> 00:07:57,230
...but it can be a big burden for parents.

124
00:07:57,606 --> 00:08:00,076
To put it bluntly, what did we do wrong?

125
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:01,686
It's the customers' fault.

126
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:04,350
They put grading on our bags
like Korean beef.

127
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,760
This is two plus grade
and costs 1000 dollars.

128
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,370
This is one plus grade
and costs 900 dollars.

129
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,310
You know the saying that goes,
“it’s a luxury because it’s expensive."

130
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,346
It has to be expensive
for people to want it.

131
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:20,346
Mother. I'm sorry.

132
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:24,137
The news is reporting the department store
in a very negative light.

133
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:30,042
You need an expensive luxury item
to be treated well.

134
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:34,174
We are concerned that this ostentation
may have infected even the young students.

135
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:36,528
This is Choi In-ha from MSC news.

136
00:08:41,902 --> 00:08:43,247
It’s alright son.

137
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:46,216
After I saw the news, I realized that
I should have been more thoughtful.

138
00:08:46,672 --> 00:08:47,916
I’m reflecting on my actions.

139
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,100
Is that from your mother?

140
00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:58,782
Yeah. She’s acting like she’s not,
but she must be very upset.

141
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:01,628
Why are you making me feel sorry?

142
00:09:03,302 --> 00:09:05,952
I told you.
I’m going to keep making you feel sorry.

143
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,546
I’m so upset.

144
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:38,102
Ma'am.

145
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:40,775
Is this yours?

146
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:45,875
Where did you find it?

147
00:09:45,966 --> 00:09:47,067
I was looking for it for a while.

148
00:09:47,555 --> 00:09:49,655
-I have something to ask you.
-What is it?

149
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:52,918
What's your relationship with
the Chairwoman of Bum-Jo Department store?

150
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:58,582
I told you.
We’re just acquaintances from the past.

151
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,374
-And you haven't contacted her recently?
-Why do you keep asking me that?

152
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:06,421
That earring... I found it
in the Chairwoman’s office today.

153
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:10,557
If you're meeting her now
like you did 13 years ago.

154
00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:12,883
Aren’t you more than just acquaintances?

155
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:16,553
You met me after 13 years too.

156
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:21,347
It’s just that much. Are you satisfied?

157
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:52,687
How was my report today?
I was quite awkward wasn’t I?

158
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:56,091
No. You did well. Very eloquently.

159
00:10:56,512 --> 00:10:58,480
Really? Of course.

160
00:10:59,322 --> 00:11:00,806
In your eyes, what wouldn't...

161
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:07,222
This won’t do.
I’m going to go get some coffee.

162
00:11:07,322 --> 00:11:08,493
Make sure no one touches these.

163
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,320
Okay. I’ll have a macchiato.

164
00:11:17,497 --> 00:11:18,652
Should I help him a bit?

165
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:46,427
Hey. What is this?

166
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:49,166
Ha-myung was putting it together.

167
00:11:49,662 --> 00:11:50,502
What?

168
00:11:50,785 --> 00:11:52,707
He said it was very important.

169
00:11:53,732 --> 00:11:55,862
He was putting it together
for three hours.

170
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:57,388
Where did he go?

171
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,725
He said he was going to go get coffee.

172
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:01,359
Damn it!

173
00:12:04,762 --> 00:12:07,312
Sung-hwa, I will put these together
so don't tell Dal-Po...

174
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:08,865
I mean, Ha-myung. Okay?

175
00:12:15,052 --> 00:12:16,478
Chan-soo. Chan-soo.

176
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:19,102
Let’s put these together, please?

177
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:20,742
I’m good. I’m not in the mood.

178
00:12:20,832 --> 00:12:23,154
A friend shouldn’t be like this.
This is very urgent!

179
00:12:23,254 --> 00:12:24,821
You shouldn’t be doing this to a friend.

180
00:12:24,921 --> 00:12:28,291
It’s my last day in the squad. And you're
asking me for a favor, not comforting me?

181
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:31,491
Yeah. It will be a meaningful end
to your life at the serious crime squad.

182
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:33,841
I’m sorry. I guess it’s not.

183
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:50,841
Hey, Kang Sung-Han.
Where did all the shredded papers go?

184
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:55,166
-Choi In-ha took them and ran away.
-What? Where?

185
00:12:56,263 --> 00:12:58,070
I wouldn’t know.

186
00:13:24,318 --> 00:13:27,101
My eyes are going to fall out.

187
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:35,021
Wait. Wait. You can’t come here.
These might fly away.

188
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:36,625
What are you doing?

189
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:40,708
Dal-Po.

190
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,961
I’m telling you the truth.
I wasn’t trying to run away with them.

191
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:51,934
I was going to put them together
and bring it to you.

192
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:57,200
I’m sorry about earlier.

193
00:13:58,895 --> 00:14:01,372
I spoke bluntly without hearing the story.

194
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,410
Yeah.

195
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,720
Drink it.

196
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:12,039
Thanks.

197
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:16,327
By the way, why did you think
Bum-Jo’s mother is suspicious?

198
00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:20,351
Everyone said that they should let
the Santa thief go,

199
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:22,552
but she said no.

200
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:26,860
It seemed like she heard it from us
for the first time in her office.

201
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,692
-Really?
-Yeah.

202
00:14:32,148 --> 00:14:35,824
Manager Hyun didn’t seem like
she was really trying to interfere.

203
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:38,211
She was pretending to stop us
but let us to film.

204
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:41,493
Like she was intentionally
letting us cover the story.

205
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:49,061
Yeah. And one more thing...

206
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:53,401
The texts that I sent to my mom,
Bum-Jo received them all this time.

207
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:59,531
That happened because
my mom left her cell phone at his house.

208
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:00,742
13 years ago.

209
00:15:01,753 --> 00:15:02,689
13 years ago?

210
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,460
Then they knew each other 13 years ago?

211
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:09,741
Yeah. And I think
they’re still meeting each other.

212
00:15:10,098 --> 00:15:13,285
I found my mom’s earring
in her office today.

213
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:19,601
By the way, where did you find these?

214
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,707
From the trash can near her office.

215
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,746
I don’t think...

216
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,242
Bum-Jo’s mother is the person
that we knew before.

217
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:30,291
Yeah.

218
00:15:51,969 --> 00:15:53,041
Why did you come here?

219
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:54,990
Did you come to see
what happened to the store?

220
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:56,360
Yeah.

221
00:15:57,346 --> 00:16:01,173
How is it? Do you feel great now
that the store is empty?

222
00:16:02,513 --> 00:16:05,121
It's crowded.
You can't even step your foot in.

223
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:06,485
What?

224
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,049
Your mother...
I think she used the news as marketing.

225
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:13,600
You crazy bastard.

226
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,651
You just the crossed line.

227
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:18,039
How can you say that
after seeing my mother yesterday?

228
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:20,077
You think my mother is
so shrewd like that?

229
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:25,211
This came out of the paper shredder
in her office yesterday.

230
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:26,202
What is this?

231
00:16:26,302 --> 00:16:27,487
Additional order form for that bag.

232
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,202
She issued this order form right after
we requested for the coverage.

233
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:32,364
What?

234
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:35,442
Your mother already knew
that people wouldn’t boycott,

235
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:39,448
but rather flock once the news goes out.

236
00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:41,851
That doesn't make sense.
Why would people...

237
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:43,829
Go check it yourself.

238
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:03,902
Crazy bastard. He's not making any sense.

239
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:21,232
You’re not out of this item, are you?

240
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,689
Don’t worry. We put in additional orders,
so everyone can buy it.

241
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:27,129
-Would you like the Two Plus one?
-Of course.

242
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:29,720
I came all the way from Yeonju
to buy this.

243
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,020
-Is this the one on the news?
-Yes, you're right.

244
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,759
This is the bag
that came out on TV yesterday.

245
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,230
Mother.

246
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,080
-We need to talk.
-Son.

247
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,632
What are you doing here at this hour?

248
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:56,602
Would you excuse us?

249
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,353
What is it?

250
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,736
I’m just coming from the bag store.

251
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:08,483
I saw it earlier and I was so surprised.

252
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:12,283
I was worried that I might have
to close the shop after the news.

253
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:16,403
But the customers were flocking
since this morning.

254
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:17,793
I was so surprised.

255
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:25,793
-Were you really surprised?
-Of course I was.

256
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:30,031
Then what is this?

257
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:33,043
You said it was unexpected,

258
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:35,860
...but you put in additional order
even before the news came out?

259
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,629
-How did you...
-Please answer me.

260
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,129
Did you use our news for marketing?

261
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:48,198
I’m so flustered.

262
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:52,263
It's not what you think it is.

263
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,121
But...

264
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,701
Let’s put it bluntly
and say that I used the news.

265
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,070
What did I do wrong?

266
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:11,947
Ma'am, why don't we just
let this go quietly?

267
00:19:12,047 --> 00:19:15,327
We got the bag back
and his son is watching too.

268
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:17,959
It's Christmas.

269
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:22,007
We can’t let him go.

270
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:23,544
Hand him over to the police.

271
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:29,087
Then it will become a case
and the reporters will come.

272
00:19:29,691 --> 00:19:32,459
My son is on the news
and I sold the products.

273
00:19:33,194 --> 00:19:35,570
Everyone who wanted to buy them,
bought them to their hearts' content.

274
00:19:35,887 --> 00:19:38,509
There’s nothing bad.
What's so wrong about that?

275
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:40,700
I'm asking because I'm really curious.

276
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,172
Then you really knew ahead of time...

277
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:46,396
that this would happen?

278
00:19:46,949 --> 00:19:48,639
It will be a problem
if the reporters come.

279
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:50,819
They'll just talk about
how expensive they are

280
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:53,065
and we might be slandered.
Reporting him might be a bit...

281
00:19:53,165 --> 00:19:55,945
That's exactly why I'm reporting him.

282
00:19:56,035 --> 00:19:57,340
That way everyone will get curious...

283
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,905
and come in to find out themselves.

284
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:04,725
Why would I waste such a good opportunity?
We have to use it.

285
00:20:04,825 --> 00:20:06,125
Put it the additional order right away.

286
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:07,815
And...

287
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,616
the reporters will be here,
so make an appointment for make up.

288
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:13,936
That's how customers feel.

289
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,969
Instead of a cheap product, they want
expensive things for attention.

290
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:22,146
I knew how they think and used it.

291
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:23,487
Is that wrong?

292
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:25,692
Is that what you think, son?

293
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:35,190
I'm...

294
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:37,458
going to go.

295
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:40,915
You’re not going to have dinner together?

296
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,034
I shouldn't have let him be a reporter.

297
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,362
I don’t think you should drive right now.

298
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:22,681
I'll do it.

299
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:35,491
You were right.

300
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:39,647
My mother was a merchant
who even does a luxury item marketing...

301
00:21:43,488 --> 00:21:45,285
...because she’s so crazy about money.

302
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:50,525
If it weren't for you...

303
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:53,656
I wouldn’t have found that out.

304
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:57,678
I'm sorry.

305
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,716
Is this is how you felt too?

306
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:07,710
When you found out that your brother
wasn’t who you thought he was...

307
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:11,618
Did you feel like this?

308
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:15,365
Yeah.

309
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,887
It must've been difficult for you.

310
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:22,661
Yeah.

311
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:46,400
Thanks for what happened today.

312
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,200
But this is separate
from things related to In-ha.

313
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:52,199
Let’s say we’re even
after I buy you dinner tonight.

314
00:22:52,478 --> 00:22:53,759
It’s fine.

315
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:57,363
-Instead...
-What? What? Instead what?

316
00:22:57,581 --> 00:22:58,781
I have something to ask you.

317
00:22:59,031 --> 00:23:02,164
You said that Song Cha-ok left her phone
at your house 13 years ago, right?

318
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,265
Yeah.

319
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:05,315
Do remember what day it was?

320
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:08,610
Of course I remember that day.
It’s the first day I got In-ha’s text.

321
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:12,890
-When was it?
-October 23rd, 2000.

322
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:16,620
Why?

323
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:21,564
My mother passed away
on October 22nd, 2000.

324
00:23:22,005 --> 00:23:23,017
What?

325
00:23:40,645 --> 00:23:43,369
What happened 13 years ago?

326
00:23:48,225 --> 00:23:51,022
Then I’ll get going, Ms Chairwoman.

327
00:23:51,345 --> 00:23:53,327
Thank you for everything.

328
00:23:55,505 --> 00:23:57,215
I'm the one who's grateful.

329
00:23:57,315 --> 00:24:00,215
-Thank you for your hard work.
-Of course.

330
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:05,225
You know, right?

331
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:07,053
I don’t ever abandon my people.

332
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:11,405
And I know what it feels like
to go through divorce.

333
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:13,699
It’s really not something you should do.

334
00:24:14,473 --> 00:24:17,945
I hope this promotion will be
a comfort to you at least.

335
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:31,983
Seo Bum-Jo

336
00:24:33,365 --> 00:24:34,801
Whose cell phone is this?

337
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:47,641
The family of fireman Ki H-sang
commits suicide.

338
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:52,875
October 23rd, 2000.

339
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,356
Hey, you’re not looking down on me
just because I was demoted, are you?

340
00:25:04,456 --> 00:25:08,166
There's a lot of cases here too,
so make sure you stop by often.

341
00:25:11,489 --> 00:25:13,686
I know. I got it. I’ll be there.

342
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:15,617
Are you going to stop by the patrol unit?

343
00:25:16,453 --> 00:25:19,400
This is Chan-soo's first week on the team,
I should go see him.

344
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,014
Did he say that there was a case?

345
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:25,101
It’s probably taxi fare dispute
or domestic dispute.

346
00:25:25,888 --> 00:25:28,566
Then go without me.
I’m going to stop by Gihwa Police station.

347
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:32,449
Come on.
Let’s go together and encourage Chan-soo.

348
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,397
If you really want me to,
I’ll go with you.

349
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:45,195
Fine.
Let’s just say that I really want to.

350
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,751
-Ahn Chan-soo.
-Friend!

351
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:55,535
Your friend is here too?
Sit down. I’ll brief you on the cases.

352
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,290
Alright.

353
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:04,496
Your mood is quite different from
when you were at the serious crime squad.

354
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,260
I know. Back then,
you didn’t want to give us anything.

355
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,670
When did I do that?
You guys can't abandon me.

356
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,064
Don’t ignore me because I’m doing patrol
and stop by often, okay?

357
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,676
We’ll see after listening to the cases.
What were the cases?

358
00:26:15,496 --> 00:26:17,196
Yesterday a man in his 50s called

359
00:26:17,306 --> 00:26:19,363
saying he’s being assaulted
at the horse racetrack.

360
00:26:19,523 --> 00:26:20,136
And?

361
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,539
It was a false report so he was fined
released with a warning.

362
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:24,593
-Hey!
-You want to die?

363
00:26:24,703 --> 00:26:26,065
There’s another. This is the real one.

364
00:26:26,424 --> 00:26:29,675
Yesterday at a factory in Tongsa-dong,
there was a report on gas tank explosion.

365
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:32,066
Gas tank? How many kilograms?

366
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:34,516
0.2 kg?

367
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:36,785
0.2 kg?

368
00:26:37,248 --> 00:26:38,511
220 gram...

369
00:26:39,755 --> 00:26:42,145
-Household butane gas?
-Yeah.

370
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:44,023
I think it exploded
when he was making ramen.

371
00:26:44,123 --> 00:26:45,311
Hey, do you want to die?

372
00:26:45,411 --> 00:26:48,101
-Give us a real case.
-I'm leaving.

373
00:26:48,201 --> 00:26:49,639
Is the size of the case that important?

374
00:26:49,739 --> 00:26:51,129
Ahn Chan-soo!

375
00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:53,074
Are you going to keep leaving
your cell phone at home?

376
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:01,972
-Ji-hee!
-Ji-hee!

377
00:27:02,063 --> 00:27:03,354
Who is Ji-hee?

378
00:27:05,317 --> 00:27:08,370
It’s so good to see you, In-ha.

379
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,408
Choi Dal-Po!

380
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:16,143
I did see you on TV
but you’ve really become successful.

381
00:27:17,408 --> 00:27:20,225
I heard a lot about you guys
from my husband.

382
00:27:20,698 --> 00:27:21,690
Husband?

383
00:27:22,568 --> 00:27:25,805
-Did you marry Ji-hee?
-Yeah.

384
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:28,449
-Why didn't you tell us?
-You didn't ask.

385
00:27:33,108 --> 00:27:34,683
Who is this? Your nephew?

386
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:36,146
No, my son.

387
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,063
-You son?
-Son?

388
00:27:39,443 --> 00:27:40,283
Whoa.

389
00:27:43,283 --> 00:27:46,487
That's awesome. Then the four of you
went to the same high school?

390
00:27:46,587 --> 00:27:48,376
Yeah. 14th class of Chungpo High school.

391
00:27:50,275 --> 00:27:53,926
Hey. What do I have to do
to have a son like this at your age?

392
00:27:54,677 --> 00:27:58,523
It's not hard. If you get pregnant
right after high school, it could happen.

393
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:01,372
You guys got married
because you got pregnant?

394
00:28:03,947 --> 00:28:05,510
Yeah. Pregnancy before marriage.

395
00:28:06,037 --> 00:28:07,979
Anyway, it’s great that I met you.

396
00:28:09,777 --> 00:28:11,174
Ta-da.

397
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,900
It’s our third child’s first birthday
this weekend.

398
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:19,072
-Make sure you come to celebrate.
-A third child?

399
00:28:19,702 --> 00:28:23,202
-Then there’s another one?
-Wow, you're really fortunate!

400
00:28:23,587 --> 00:28:27,120
I'm not fortunate. Alcohol is the enemy.

401
00:28:28,304 --> 00:28:30,170
Second one is a girl.

402
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,737
A first birthday party for the third kid?
You have no conscience.

403
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:36,878
My conscience has been gone
since the day he was born.

404
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,683
Now talk about you guys.

405
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:46,839
It looks like you’re dating.

406
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,840
No, it's not like that.

407
00:28:49,931 --> 00:28:51,828
I know. That’s nonsense.

408
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:56,133
I’ve been living
on my good senses for years.

409
00:28:56,233 --> 00:29:00,501
The way you two look at each other
is suspicious.

410
00:29:00,934 --> 00:29:03,893
You guys like each other, don't you?

411
00:29:04,413 --> 00:29:05,824
That's...

412
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:07,992
-We broke up after going out for a bit.
-What?

413
00:29:08,092 --> 00:29:09,282
Really?

414
00:29:10,063 --> 00:29:10,957
Why?

415
00:29:11,057 --> 00:29:13,370
When? Where? How long? Why?

416
00:29:15,857 --> 00:29:17,111
Let's talk about something else.

417
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:20,632
That’s right. Let's talk about you guys.

418
00:29:20,732 --> 00:29:22,119
Do you have a picture of your daughter?

419
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:31,524
Are you going to the birthday party?

420
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:34,192
Your hood.

421
00:29:35,652 --> 00:29:37,412
I don’t know. If I have time.

422
00:29:38,492 --> 00:29:41,417
If I go, what should I get as a gift?
Gold is so expensive...

423
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:45,312
It is expensive.

424
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:47,052
That’s right. It would be weirder

425
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,422
if he never had a girlfriend
with that face and age.

426
00:29:49,832 --> 00:29:51,772
A guy who's always been single isn't fun.

427
00:29:51,872 --> 00:29:53,332
And it was only for a little while.

428
00:29:53,532 --> 00:29:55,592
There’s no problem
if it was just a little while.

429
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:02,585
In-ha, how come you’re not with Bum-Jo?

430
00:30:02,685 --> 00:30:04,878
Bum-Jo took a day off, he’s moving out.

431
00:30:04,978 --> 00:30:06,401
-Move out?
-Yeah.

432
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:07,953
He wants to be independent
so he left home.

433
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:12,261
What, is he going through puberty now?
Why is he going to be independent?

434
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:13,214
He’s funny, right?

435
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:15,985
He must have been shocked
by the bag incident.

436
00:30:16,461 --> 00:30:19,481
Yeah. He probably felt
betrayed by his mother.

437
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:34,440
Ms Koh, you need to check the air filter.
Please check it.

438
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:40,909
-Put a recliner in front of the TV.
-Yes.

439
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:47,581
You said Song Cha-ok left her phone
at your house 13 years ago, right?

440
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:51,563
-Do you remember the date?
-October 23rd, 2000.

441
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:56,791
My mother passed away on October 22nd.

442
00:30:58,196 --> 00:30:59,341
Mother.

443
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,902
I have something to ask you.

444
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:04,555
Have you decided to talk to me now?

445
00:31:08,078 --> 00:31:09,911
I heard something from Ki Ha-myung.

446
00:31:10,011 --> 00:31:14,062
You met with Song Cha-ok
on October 23rd, 2000, right?

447
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:16,281
I'm not sure.

448
00:31:16,611 --> 00:31:19,769
If it’s 2000, it was 13 years ago.
How could I remember that?

449
00:31:20,748 --> 00:31:24,781
I understand. If you can’t answer me,
then I’ll find out myself.

450
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:26,117
Stop doing that.

451
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:28,560
You don’t have to be a reporter
to your mom.

452
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:31,392
You have to be a son.

453
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:33,989
I’ll arrange here myself.

454
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:37,417
I don’t need air filter or a recliner.

455
00:31:57,495 --> 00:32:00,888
-Are you alright, Ma'am?
-No.

456
00:32:00,978 --> 00:32:05,098
He’s starting to bother me.
That Ki Ha-myung.

457
00:32:18,828 --> 00:32:20,698
He said he was sorry for his brother.

458
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:23,008
Sorry that he can be on the streets.

459
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,052
And that he can meet people.

460
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,066
And even that he can look
at someone and smile.

461
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,289
That's how he got so drunk like this.

462
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:32,942
Hey, Dal-pyung.

463
00:32:34,271 --> 00:32:38,269
When people are drunk, they usually...

464
00:32:39,027 --> 00:32:40,833
tell the truth, right?

465
00:32:42,229 --> 00:32:43,166
That’s right.

466
00:32:43,256 --> 00:32:45,601
That's why there's a phrase
"the truth in wine".

467
00:32:49,106 --> 00:32:50,426
Father.

468
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,256
Did I say something wrong yesterday?

469
00:32:54,745 --> 00:32:58,258
Everything that you say is wrong.

470
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,590
Where are you going, father?

471
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:45,974
Ki Jae-myung. Relationship: Family

472
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,366
I heard a lot from Ha-myung.

473
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:56,819
I wanted to meet you sometime
and thank you.

474
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:04,517
Thank you so much
for saving my brother, Ha-myung.

475
00:34:07,236 --> 00:34:08,906
You two are...

476
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:11,390
so much alike.

477
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:16,289
You two brothers are so good looking.

478
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:22,306
-Is that a compliment?
-Yes, of course.

479
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,230
It was definitely a compliment.

480
00:34:28,302 --> 00:34:34,116
You lived not knowing about Dal-Po
for the past 13 years.

481
00:34:34,514 --> 00:34:36,496
So...

482
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:44,023
I want to tell you how Dal-Po grew up.

483
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:49,395
What do you think?
Would it be okay if I visited you often?

484
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:50,983
Of course.

485
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,777
I’d be thankful if you could tell me.

486
00:34:52,877 --> 00:34:54,167
Really?

487
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,832
Then...

488
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,094
Take a look at these.

489
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:07,957
These are six months after Dal-Po
was taken out of the sea.

490
00:35:09,581 --> 00:35:13,669
-Is this... Ha-myung?
-Yeah.

491
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,231
Why is his hair like that...?

492
00:35:20,127 --> 00:35:21,543
It's...

493
00:35:23,311 --> 00:35:25,534
It’s a long story.

494
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:29,569
At the time, I lost my mind for a bit.

495
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,616
So I mistook him as...

496
00:35:35,622 --> 00:35:41,677
my son who died 40 years ago.

497
00:35:52,578 --> 00:35:54,187
You can’t visit Ki Jae-myung today.

498
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:56,127
Today’s visitation is over for him.

499
00:35:56,817 --> 00:35:59,853
There’s no way.
I’m the only one who would visit him.

500
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,079
Someone else visited him
just a little while ago.

501
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,496
Who could it be?

502
00:36:06,427 --> 00:36:08,297
No way. Is it Ahn Chan-soo?

503
00:36:10,407 --> 00:36:12,697
You visited my brother, didn’t you?

504
00:36:13,183 --> 00:36:15,312
You brat. You should have told me
you were going to visit him.

505
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:20,155
I didn’t visit him.
I was really busy today.

506
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:21,987
Really?

507
00:36:22,846 --> 00:36:23,997
Then who was it?

508
00:36:24,547 --> 00:36:26,047
Breaking news.

509
00:36:26,147 --> 00:36:29,569
Tonight around 7 PM,
a factory in Han River district

510
00:36:29,669 --> 00:36:32,069
caught fire along with the sound
of big explosion.

511
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:33,380
Reporter Jang Hyun-gyu.

512
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:36,922
Yes. It was at a waste-disposal plant
in Han River district.

513
00:36:37,022 --> 00:36:40,335
The fire was reported
to the fire department at 7:05 PM today.

514
00:36:40,806 --> 00:36:43,827
42 fire engines arrived at the scene
and are trying to put out the fire,

515
00:36:43,957 --> 00:36:45,577
but the fire is not easily contained.

516
00:36:45,677 --> 00:36:47,080
A waste-disposal plant.

517
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,876
Yes. This is Ki Ha-myung
in Han River sector.

518
00:36:53,765 --> 00:36:55,006
Yes. I’m watching it right now.

519
00:36:55,106 --> 00:36:56,366
I’ll be right in.

520
00:36:57,037 --> 00:36:58,996
-Hey. I have to go in.
-Dal-Po.

521
00:36:59,766 --> 00:37:00,926
What?

522
00:37:01,016 --> 00:37:02,686
That plant...

523
00:37:02,786 --> 00:37:05,086
That’s the plant that I was at yesterday.

524
00:37:05,186 --> 00:37:08,826
-The one with the butane gas explosion.
-What?

525
00:37:09,956 --> 00:37:13,326
The fire is in the internal workspace
and the large storage at the plant.

526
00:37:13,426 --> 00:37:15,776
The firemen are having difficulty
entering the storage.

527
00:37:15,876 --> 00:37:19,246
It was revealed that there were around
70 people working inside the plant.

528
00:37:19,346 --> 00:37:23,866
About 40 people evacuated
but 30 of them haven’t been rescued yet.

529
00:37:23,966 --> 00:37:27,206
The exact number of the lives lost
hasn’t been verified yet.

530
00:37:27,986 --> 00:37:29,226
Among the evacuated,

531
00:37:29,336 --> 00:37:32,126
there are many who were seriously injured
by the explosion.

532
00:37:32,226 --> 00:37:35,326
On top of the missing people,
massive casualty is expected.

533
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:37,776
This is Lee Il-joo from MSC news.

534
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:52,701
How many are missing?
What about the injured?

535
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:57,906
-Is it the official announcement?
-It hasn’t been made yet.

536
00:37:58,216 --> 00:37:59,476
Yes.

537
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:05,446
Chief. I’m coming in.

538
00:38:06,097 --> 00:38:07,721
Gogwang Hospital...

539
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:12,658
It’s not Ohgwang but Gogwang.
It has the most injured.

540
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:14,090
So send Lee Il-joo there.

541
00:38:18,868 --> 00:38:20,867
Let’s go to Gogwang Hospital quickly.

542
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:30,388
Accidents aren't predictable,
and lives aren't dispensable.

543
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:32,548
It's dangerous, move out!

544
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:46,629
What happened? Please tell us one thing.

545
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:50,530
Just one thing please.
What was the cause of the fire?

546
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,199
Please give us a statement.

547
00:38:57,249 --> 00:38:59,334
I'm sorry, but...

548
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:02,387
What do you think was the cause?

549
00:39:13,649 --> 00:39:16,469
-Dad!
-Dad!

550
00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:17,789
There's still one missing.

551
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:21,599
The fire broke out at
a waste-disposal plant at 1:10 AM.

552
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:23,969
This is the scene of the fire.

553
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:26,679
Currently there are around
40 fire engines at the scene.

554
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:30,164
The fire has been suppressed
but it’s covered with black smoke.

555
00:39:53,857 --> 00:39:56,044
Jang Hyun-gyu, find out the cause
and the extent of the damage.

556
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,258
16 confirmed deaths so far, is that right?

557
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:00,832
Yes, I've checked both
the fire department and the police.

558
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:04,322
Find out why the casualty was so great and
why early suppression wasn’t done quickly.

559
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:05,692
-Yoon Yoo-Rae.
-Yes?

560
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:09,252
Secure the CCTV near the plant, black box,
and witness testimony

561
00:40:09,343 --> 00:40:10,677
and check the situation of the explosion.

562
00:40:10,962 --> 00:40:12,527
-Yes, Captain.
-And Ki Ha-myung.

563
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:13,621
Yes.

564
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:17,702
Meet with the plant worker and find out
what waste material they were disposing,

565
00:40:17,871 --> 00:40:22,031
and find out if there were similar cases
in the past.

566
00:40:22,911 --> 00:40:24,091
Yes, Captain.

567
00:40:31,461 --> 00:40:33,817
Continue as if I’m not here.

568
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,229
This meeting is led by the captain.

569
00:40:37,497 --> 00:40:38,888
Okay.

570
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,137
Il-joo, reconstruct the circumstances
of the accident and make a graphic.

571
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:48,238
Call the experts and find out the causes.

572
00:40:48,338 --> 00:40:49,178
Yes, Captain.

573
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:54,015
Seo Bum-Jo, find the official announcement
from the police and the fire department.

574
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:58,348
Choi In-ha. Find out if there were
any similar cases in the past.

575
00:40:58,885 --> 00:41:01,318
Isn’t interviewing the bereaved family
the most important?

576
00:41:04,615 --> 00:41:08,355
See if there were newly weds
or head of the household among them.

577
00:41:08,756 --> 00:41:10,748
Look for the most coherent person
among the injured

578
00:41:10,848 --> 00:41:12,823
and hear about the accident directly.

579
00:41:14,617 --> 00:41:16,850
Chief, that’s...

580
00:41:17,468 --> 00:41:20,020
Think about what the viewers
really want to know

581
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,850
before you start preparing.

582
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:31,590
Now, really think that I’m not here
and continue.

583
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,376
It's because you keep interrupting.

584
00:41:38,354 --> 00:41:41,905
Who should take charge of
the Accident Response Site Headquarters?

585
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,580
It's been a while,
how about we meet for lunch today?

586
00:41:56,484 --> 00:42:00,281
Everyone be careful and
if report right away if there are changes.

587
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:03,921
-And secure the video well.
-Yes.

588
00:42:08,231 --> 00:42:09,071
Ki Ha-myung.

589
00:42:26,891 --> 00:42:29,152
Why does Captain only giving
something like this to you?

590
00:42:30,392 --> 00:42:32,978
Why did you do to captain
that he only favors you?

591
00:42:33,078 --> 00:42:35,506
You’re being childish.
It’s not like that.

592
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:37,398
Michungri waste-disposal plant fire

593
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:39,499
That's from 13 years ago.

594
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:42,792
-The one where your father died on duty.
-Yeah.

595
00:42:42,883 --> 00:42:45,207
They must be the material
that Captain gathered 13 years ago.

596
00:42:46,547 --> 00:42:49,782
I was thinking that incident
was quite similar to this incident.

597
00:42:49,882 --> 00:42:52,428
-I guess your Captain thought the same.
-Yeah.

598
00:42:53,202 --> 00:42:56,542
That’s why he thought that
it would be meaningful for me to find out.

599
00:42:57,442 --> 00:42:58,971
Was it like that?

600
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,022
You should have said so.

601
00:43:08,492 --> 00:43:10,452
Well, it could be like that.

602
00:43:10,552 --> 00:43:14,360
They’ve lived together for over 10 years
so they just get each other.

603
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:16,942
But what can they do?
It’s already over between them.

604
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:18,638
There’s nothing for me to worry about.

605
00:43:25,642 --> 00:43:27,352
I’m so late, aren’t I?

606
00:43:27,452 --> 00:43:30,127
There was so much traffic
since it’s the end of the year.

607
00:43:30,751 --> 00:43:32,444
No you’re not. I just got here as well.

608
00:43:33,909 --> 00:43:35,643
You’ve been struggling a lot
these days, haven’t you?

609
00:43:36,862 --> 00:43:37,982
No, not at all.

610
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:41,470
It’s nice to remember the time
I was a news reporter.

611
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:43,332
I asked you to meet

612
00:43:43,432 --> 00:43:46,721
because I had a favor to ask
regarding this fire incident.

613
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,511
It seems there are a lot of similarities
with the incident from 13 years ago.

614
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:10,874
They had an explosion
although they were both average-sized.

615
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,514
Also, they both had high casualties.

616
00:44:16,137 --> 00:44:17,604
Why did the explosion occur?

617
00:44:19,501 --> 00:44:22,095
It seems like there were explosive waste
among the waste.

618
00:44:24,139 --> 00:44:25,738
Illegal explosive waste.

619
00:44:26,371 --> 00:44:27,756
Bum-Jo, you...

620
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:33,411
Someone got me curious about the incident
from 13 years ago,

621
00:44:33,521 --> 00:44:34,588
so I looked into it.

622
00:44:34,961 --> 00:44:39,531
I’m afraid that this incident might get
linked to the one from 13 years ago.

623
00:44:39,891 --> 00:44:43,326
It did come up during the meeting today.

624
00:44:44,632 --> 00:44:46,302
I knew it.

625
00:44:46,897 --> 00:44:50,681
Even my son is bringing that up,

626
00:44:50,781 --> 00:44:52,215
so I'm worried.

627
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:55,908
-Your son?
-He's a reporter after all.

628
00:44:56,451 --> 00:44:57,921
Anyway...

629
00:44:58,551 --> 00:45:00,306
now is a sensitive time.

630
00:45:00,591 --> 00:45:04,041
we can’t have past things come out
because of this,

631
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:05,851
so we should take precautions.

632
00:45:08,241 --> 00:45:09,428
Take a look at this...

633
00:45:10,991 --> 00:45:13,215
and see if you can change the flow.

634
00:45:14,951 --> 00:45:16,182
What is this?

635
00:45:16,282 --> 00:45:20,312
I'm close to the assemblyman
who authorized that plant.

636
00:45:21,053 --> 00:45:24,431
He was worried that public criticism
would reach him somehow...

637
00:45:25,585 --> 00:45:27,874
so I gave him the tip from 13 years ago.

638
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:33,459
This will be quite helpful to you,
just like it was back then.

639
00:45:44,389 --> 00:45:46,239
It’s almost impossible to find articles

640
00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:48,829
about the decision on the plant
or the business owner from 13 years ago.

641
00:45:49,149 --> 00:45:50,730
I could only find snippets

642
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:53,143
and an agreement
was reached with the family.

643
00:45:53,243 --> 00:45:55,393
So they just got probation
and community service.

644
00:45:55,533 --> 00:45:58,753
That's all?
When nine people lost their lives?

645
00:46:00,109 --> 00:46:01,579
It’s all about Ki Ho-sang.

646
00:46:01,863 --> 00:46:03,288
They’re all about Ki Ho-sang.

647
00:46:04,383 --> 00:46:07,743
It’s about your father. I’m sorry.

648
00:46:08,553 --> 00:46:09,873
I didn’t know either.

649
00:46:09,973 --> 00:46:11,835
That there wasn't much news
about the punishment.

650
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,585
This is ridiculous.

651
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,915
Your father didn't start the fire,
so why did they focus on him so much?

652
00:46:17,015 --> 00:46:20,102
If someone had to be held responsible, they
should've gotten who started the fire.

653
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:24,097
Why did it turn out like this?
What is the problem?

654
00:46:24,197 --> 00:46:27,757
Looking at all the articles now,
it’s quite awkward and too much.

655
00:46:27,857 --> 00:46:30,784
Like they intentionally drove the interest
towards your father.

656
00:46:31,564 --> 00:46:34,926
So there's nothing on the plant owner
or the business owner, right?

657
00:46:35,327 --> 00:46:39,382
They were all kept anonymous,
so it's hard to tell.

658
00:46:44,237 --> 00:46:45,306
Ha-myung.

659
00:46:45,557 --> 00:46:47,296
Ki Ha-myung, where are you going?

660
00:46:48,657 --> 00:46:50,031
Why is he like that all of a sudden?

661
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:55,302
-He’s getting suspicious.
-Suspicion? What suspicion?

662
00:46:58,686 --> 00:47:02,287
A suspicion that his father may have been
a victim of media manipulation.

663
00:47:07,227 --> 00:47:08,137
Ki Ho-sang is alive.

664
00:47:09,087 --> 00:47:10,147
A Pinocchio Syndrome witness
came forward.

665
00:47:10,237 --> 00:47:11,547
Ki Ho-san’s whereabouts a mystery.

666
00:47:11,647 --> 00:47:13,647
Police's shocking realization
of his whereabouts.

667
00:47:14,297 --> 00:47:16,887
Can Ki avoid legal disputes.
Forceful suppression of fireman Ki.

668
00:47:16,987 --> 00:47:19,537
Prosecution reviews the charge
of negligence resulting in death.

669
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:31,514
And he's starting to get curious about
why those things happened to his father.

670
00:47:39,817 --> 00:47:40,907
Captain

671
00:47:41,007 --> 00:47:43,514
-I have something to ask you.
-What is it?

672
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:46,709
This incident has a lot of similarities
with the incident from 13 years ago.

673
00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:50,189
The direction of the story's going towards
the cause of the accident and the fire,

674
00:47:50,289 --> 00:47:52,736
but why didn’t it go that way
13 years ago?

675
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:55,609
Why did the blame go towards my father
who had no responsibility of the fire?

676
00:47:59,186 --> 00:48:02,465
At first, we were going towards
finding the responsible one.

677
00:48:03,586 --> 00:48:05,102
But at some point...

678
00:48:05,846 --> 00:48:07,311
it shifted towards your father.

679
00:48:09,491 --> 00:48:11,371
Are you saying that
someone did it on purpose?

680
00:48:12,796 --> 00:48:13,647
I don’t know that either.

681
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,523
It’s just a speculation.

682
00:48:17,691 --> 00:48:19,949
Captain.
MSC is giving an exclusive new right now!

683
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:27,004
Over 41 people were injured from
yesterday's waste factory explosion.

684
00:48:27,303 --> 00:48:32,090
Turns out, there is a suspicion that
it was due to one policeman's fault.

685
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,038
MSC exclusively secured the CCTV footage

686
00:48:36,138 --> 00:48:38,838
of the waste-disposal plant
the day before the explosion.

687
00:48:39,138 --> 00:48:40,674
Here’s the report from
reporter Song Cha-ok.

688
00:48:41,405 --> 00:48:46,088
This is the scene of the fire
where over 40 people died or injured.

689
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:50,844
The fire is extinguished, but the smell
of the toxic gas is still evident.

690
00:48:51,166 --> 00:48:56,348
The CCTV footage reveals that
the fire could've been prevented.

691
00:48:56,438 --> 00:48:58,353
That’s a talent.

692
00:48:58,453 --> 00:49:00,933
How did they get that footage?

693
00:49:01,783 --> 00:49:03,443
That's a real talent.

694
00:49:04,932 --> 00:49:06,307
The day before the fire,

695
00:49:06,407 --> 00:49:09,787
one policeman comes inside the plant
after a report of an explosion.

696
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:13,037
The policeman talks to an employee

697
00:49:13,137 --> 00:49:17,547
and then leaves the plant
after taking a brief look at the scene.

698
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,867
The time that he spent here is
less than five minutes.

699
00:49:20,967 --> 00:49:23,947
-That's Chan-soo.
-Chan-soo?

700
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:25,437
No way.

701
00:49:25,537 --> 00:49:27,377
Your old friend, Ahn Chan-soo?

702
00:49:30,087 --> 00:49:32,957
The policeman in question, Mr. Ahn
from the patrol division...

703
00:49:33,057 --> 00:49:36,296
...revealed that he didn’t follow up
in particular at that time.

704
00:49:36,396 --> 00:49:39,266
It didn’t seem like anything
so I just left.

705
00:49:39,366 --> 00:49:42,706
I was there for 5 or 10 minutes.

706
00:49:42,806 --> 00:49:45,795
That’s nonsense.
That kind of flimsy report isn't news!

707
00:49:45,895 --> 00:49:50,113
Even the employees all agree
that police investigation was sloppy.

708
00:49:50,213 --> 00:49:53,062
He just asked few questions and left.

709
00:49:59,143 --> 00:50:02,263
-Yes, Team Leader.
-You crazy bastard!

710
00:50:02,363 --> 00:50:04,396
Why did you do that kind of interview
and dig your own grave??

711
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,960
They said it was just an interview,
I didn't think much of it.

712
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,910
How could you not think much of it?

713
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:13,216
How are you going to take care of that?

714
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,540
Team Leader.

715
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,350
Did I really mess up?

716
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,690
He just dismissed an explosion...

717
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,280
Did I...

718
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:22,880
...really do that?

719
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:28,990
Coincidentally, over 40 people either died
or were injured the next day.

720
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,670
It keeps repeating itself...

721
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,020
That police officer...

722
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:36,683
...is my friend.

723
00:50:36,774 --> 00:50:40,034
People can only feel miserable about this.

724
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:42,610
-What?
-He’s my friend Ahn Chan-soo.

725
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:44,433
This is Song Cha-ok from MSC.

726
00:50:46,632 --> 00:50:48,500
How could this be because of Ahn Chan-soo?

727
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,088
How could she do that?

728
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,740
This is nonsense.

729
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:54,544
Chan-soo said that
he only checked the butane gas explosion.

730
00:50:54,644 --> 00:50:56,674
That couldn’t have been
the cause of the accident.

731
00:50:57,124 --> 00:51:00,734
It’s really similar with that incident
from 13 years ago.

732
00:51:05,204 --> 00:51:07,134
I think it was like this then.

733
00:51:08,084 --> 00:51:10,240
Everyone was looking for
the cause of the fire.

734
00:51:11,144 --> 00:51:13,144
Then suddenly,
your father’s story jumped out...

735
00:51:13,244 --> 00:51:14,715
...just like Chan-soo now.

736
00:51:17,204 --> 00:51:18,604
So...

737
00:51:18,704 --> 00:51:21,494
people fell for that nonsense?

738
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:23,924
Did you do that too?

739
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,173
I'm sorry.

740
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:32,581
It may sound like an excuse...

741
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:35,464
but I thought that was right at that time.

742
00:51:39,544 --> 00:51:41,424
When a dog barks...

743
00:51:41,524 --> 00:51:44,274
all the other dogs start barking
without knowing the reason.

744
00:51:47,074 --> 00:51:49,224
Now that I see it, I understand.

745
00:51:50,124 --> 00:51:52,208
I was the dog in the neighborhood.

746
00:52:04,734 --> 00:52:08,294
Chief is not in her right mind.
How is it Ahn Chan-soo's fault?

747
00:52:08,394 --> 00:52:10,014
How could she conclude it so easily?

748
00:52:10,114 --> 00:52:11,896
-Does this make sense?
-It doesn't.

749
00:52:57,114 --> 00:52:58,084
Chief.

750
00:52:58,194 --> 00:53:01,654
This exclusive makes no sense.
How could this be Ahn Chan-soo’s fault?

751
00:53:03,784 --> 00:53:05,541
He's your friend, right?

752
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:09,554
You're being irrational
because he’s your friend

753
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:13,607
and I don’t intend to respond to
every little thing that has no logic.

754
00:53:15,107 --> 00:53:19,574
I'm not his friend
and I didn’t lose my rationality.

755
00:53:19,684 --> 00:53:21,074
Would you respond to me then?

756
00:53:22,236 --> 00:53:26,474
The report that policeman received was
an explosion of a household butane gas.

757
00:53:26,887 --> 00:53:28,529
It has nothing to do with this case.

758
00:53:28,974 --> 00:53:31,440
Of course he will say that
it’s got nothing to do with the case.

759
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,800
Would he say it's his fault?

760
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:35,330
Did you meet with the employee
who reported the explosion?

761
00:53:36,577 --> 00:53:39,030
I was going to, but he was unconscious.

762
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,370
-It was so sad.
-It means that you didn’t meet him.

763
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,919
Then what proof are you saying that
Ahn is responsible for this incident?

764
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:48,502
Let me ask you.

765
00:53:49,339 --> 00:53:52,479
What proof do you have that Ahn
is not responsible?

766
00:53:53,017 --> 00:53:56,667
I have the CCTV footage as my evidence.
But what’s your evidence?

767
00:53:58,827 --> 00:54:01,408
And I just posed the suspicion.
I didn’t conclude it.

768
00:54:01,508 --> 00:54:03,861
-How is that a problem?
-It is a problem.

769
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:06,391
People will accept that as truth.

770
00:54:06,481 --> 00:54:07,885
Just like 13 years ago.

771
00:54:13,101 --> 00:54:16,787
Why are you bringing up
what happened 13 years ago here?

772
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:21,351
You also used shallow evidence that time
and destroyed a family.

773
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:24,370
Then bring me at least
one shallow evidence and argue!

774
00:54:25,591 --> 00:54:27,821
Don’t shelter one sidedly
just because he’s your friend.

775
00:54:27,921 --> 00:54:30,921
Bring proper evidence as a reporter
and pose a suspicion.

776
00:54:34,081 --> 00:54:35,703
I’ll bring the evidence and come back.

777
00:54:41,261 --> 00:54:44,031
I’ll find the evidence that
Ahn Chan-soo is not responsible.

778
00:54:44,131 --> 00:54:48,766
I will not lose someone powerlessly
like 13 years ago.

779
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:55,098
I will turn the flow
that you’re trying to change...

780
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,038
back to where it should no matter what.

781
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:35,894
-What brings you here?
-I’ll get right to the point.

782
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:39,761
-My son likes your daughter.
-Excuse me?

783
00:55:40,691 --> 00:55:43,251
-My In-ha?
-Yes.

784
00:55:43,511 --> 00:55:47,031
-Didn’t you know?
-No, I didn't know.

785
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:51,731
But I will make sure to control her.
I’ll tell her not to go near your son.

786
00:55:51,841 --> 00:55:55,051
-You can’t do that.
-Excuse me?

787
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:59,191
I came to ask you
to look favorably on my son.

788
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,321
-What did you say?
-Please help him.

789
00:56:03,421 --> 00:56:06,291
Please cheer on my son.

790
00:56:08,941 --> 00:56:12,584
What in the world?
The Chairwoman's son as a son-in-law...

791
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,152
My fate is finally turning out well.

792
00:56:17,771 --> 00:56:19,146
My goodness.

793
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:25,291
I don't want to.

794
00:56:25,391 --> 00:56:29,777
Why not? You might find your real family
if you go on TV.

795
00:56:30,381 --> 00:56:31,687
I don't want to find them!

796
00:56:32,451 --> 00:56:33,523
Dal-Po.

797
00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:40,090
I don't want to find them.

798
00:56:40,921 --> 00:56:42,578
So please...

799
00:56:43,621 --> 00:56:45,250
Please, mister.

800
00:56:45,658 --> 00:56:48,376
You... You remember your family,
don’t you?

801
00:56:49,891 --> 00:56:50,763
Don't you?

802
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:54,567
Tell me what kind of people they were.

803
00:56:57,021 --> 00:56:59,146
Did they commit great sins or something?

804
00:57:00,461 --> 00:57:01,781
Is that why you're in hiding?

805
00:57:12,261 --> 00:57:15,763
Ohgwang and Godori and one two three...

806
00:57:16,861 --> 00:57:20,964
Three go, Kwangbak and Pibak
so you owe me 8 dollars and 40 cents.

807
00:57:23,531 --> 00:57:25,741
What if...

808
00:57:25,841 --> 00:57:29,781
some rich guy likes In-ha?
What do I do then?

809
00:57:29,881 --> 00:57:32,261
If he has a lot of money, that’s great.

810
00:57:32,361 --> 00:57:36,124
But does In-ha like him?

811
00:57:37,091 --> 00:57:39,131
What if...

812
00:57:39,231 --> 00:57:42,324
In-ha likes someone who has nothing?

813
00:57:42,424 --> 00:57:43,424
Really?

814
00:57:43,524 --> 00:57:49,827
-Then you should just...
-No, you can't be hasty!

815
00:57:50,037 --> 00:57:52,355
He's awfully rich.

816
00:57:52,455 --> 00:57:55,439
He’s like someone who has Ohgwang,
Mungta and has Godori.

817
00:57:55,579 --> 00:57:59,606
The other guy is has like Gwangbak, Pibak
and even Gaepae.

818
00:57:59,706 --> 00:58:01,936
-There’s that much difference?
-Yes.

819
00:58:02,036 --> 00:58:04,474
They are so far apart from each other.

820
00:58:06,966 --> 00:58:09,517
-Then you should have that poor guy...
-Father!

821
00:58:09,617 --> 00:58:12,539
You said In-ha likes this guy?

822
00:58:13,807 --> 00:58:18,662
Hey, you’re not a small minded guy
who would sell off your child.

823
00:58:18,762 --> 00:58:20,702
I am a small minded guy.

824
00:58:20,802 --> 00:58:23,566
It’s not even as big
as a small soy sauce dish.

825
00:58:27,676 --> 00:58:31,142
You shouldn’t compare like that.

826
00:58:32,824 --> 00:58:36,682
If you start to compare,
your happiness is finished...

827
00:58:37,215 --> 00:58:38,490
...and your unhappiness will begin.

828
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:39,700
In-ha.

829
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:42,984
I can’t hold on to you right now.

830
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:46,180
But...

831
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:48,119
Don’t go toward someone else.

832
00:58:55,346 --> 00:58:57,338
Okay. I won't.
