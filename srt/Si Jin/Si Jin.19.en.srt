[Episode 19]

12
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,340
Don't tell me

13
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,080
I have to divorce her for real?

14
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,910
Who told you to divorce her?

15
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,340
Sometimes,

16
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,740
I'm just angry at you

17
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,039
because you always take her side.

18
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,080
Ziyu.

19
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,210
What's going on with you today?

20
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,640
In the past,
if I had asked you to divorce her,

21
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,110
you would have gone to war with me.

22
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,810
But why are you

23
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,840
the one bringing this up today?

24
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,280
I was just worried that you

25
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,310
might actually force me to divorce Yi

26
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,410
in a moment of anger.

27
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,680
Since you didn't actually mean it,

28
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,210
you should have told me sooner,

29
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,910
so I wouldn't have worried.

30
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,140
If I told you about it,

31
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,280
you'd tell Yi

32
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,079
right away.

33
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,610
Then she'll have nothing to fear

34
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,540
and will show me

35
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,810
even less respect.

36
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,079
All right. I won't tell her.

37
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,280
She and her sister

38
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,480
are together all the time.

39
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,610
My wife and I

40
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,210
are no longer as close.

41
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,010
She's just

42
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,280
an unmarried girl.

43
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,140
She'll return

44
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,010
to Count of Dongping's Mansion
eventually.

45
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,210
She won't stay here for long.

46
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,810
You should send your men

47
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,480
to look for Qing'er

48
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,840
and see where she went.

49
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,710
Yes, Mother.

50
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,210
Miss Jiang?

51
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,880
Miss Jiang,

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,940
did you two rescue me?

53
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,610
You were right.

54
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,410
Zhu Ziyu didn't intend

55
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,310
to keep his promise at all.

56
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:22,710
Now that I'm useless to him,

57
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,480
he wants to silence me.

58
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,740
Mr. Yu, Miss Jiang,
I'll definitely repay your kindness

59
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,040
in the future.

60
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,440
You don't need to be so courteous.

61
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,740
You should let her
be courteous for once.

62
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,110
We need you

63
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,910
to do us a favor.

64
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,079
Have you already dealt with Qing'er?

65
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,910
I have.

66
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,310
I've already made sure

67
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,410
she has disappeared
without a trace, dead or alive.

68
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,510
Sir, where's my sister?

69
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,940
I beg you. Please spare her.

70
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,480
Deliver a letter for me.

71
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,640
If you do my bidding,

72
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,140
once the deed is done,

73
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,310
not only will I keep her alive,

74
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,140
but I'll also set her free.

75
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,640
But if you can't even complete

76
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,710
such a small task,

77
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,110
you should think about the consequences

78
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,280
your sister might face.

79
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,680
Good.

80
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,440
Miss Yu'er.

81
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,240
Someone is waiting for you
in the carriage.

82
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:15,940
Yu'er!

83
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,240
Qing'er?

84
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,710
Yu'er, hurry and get in.

85
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,080
Qing'er, are you all right?

86
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,610
Zhu Ziyu already promised me

87
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,880
that he would set you free soon.

88
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,440
But why are you

89
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,140
together with Miss Jiang?

90
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,909
Set me free?

91
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,240
To Zhu Ziyu,

92
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,240
I'm already

93
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,240
a lifeless corpse.

94
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,510
Of course, I'm free.

95
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,440
What do you mean?

96
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,710
Zhu Ziyu was worried
that I might betray him.

97
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,909
He wanted to silence me.

98
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,210
Luckily, Miss Jiang and Mr. Yu saved me

99
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,210
despite past grievances.

100
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,409
If not, we would have already

101
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:58,680
been separated by death.

102
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,310
Yu'er,

103
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,880
you looked like you were in a hurry.

104
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,140
Were you trying

105
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,940
to deliver letters on Zhu Ziyu's behalf?

106
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,080
This...

107
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,010
Yu'er, it's all right.

108
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,510
Zhu Ziyu is untrustworthy.

109
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,480
The only way

110
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,680
for us to survive

111
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,740
is by helping Miss Jiang.

112
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,280
Let's hand the letter to Miss Jiang.

113
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,840
Plans have changed.
Wait for my good news.

114
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,409
Wait!

115
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,409
Yu'er, don't worry.

116
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,680
I have a way

117
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,210
to set you two free.

118
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,410
Miss.

119
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,340
Mr. Zhu

120
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,640
sent Qing'er here
to relay a message again.

121
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,040
Mr. Zhu said

122
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,610
he would wait for you

123
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,840
at a discreet residence.

124
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,110
He has something urgent to tell you.

125
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,940
He sent me here
so that I could take you there.

126
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:40,940
Mr. Zhu.

127
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,280
I've already relayed the message.

128
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,010
The lady said

129
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,080
she would wait for you
at a discreet residence.

130
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,840
She sent me here
so that I could take you there.

131
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,240
She's raring to see me, huh?

132
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,159
Mr. Zhu,

133
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,830
the lady is inside.

134
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,990
How could I come back

135
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,710
in one piece

136
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,080
if those were just rumors?

137
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,350
In the abandoned house

138
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,400
of Liyu Alley right ahead,

139
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,230
the beauty is waiting for me to see her.

140
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,870
Who are you trying to fool here?

141
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,440
Do you think Mrs. Zhu

142
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,470
has lost her mind?

143
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,470
You all have to believe me.

144
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,510
Seeing is believing.

145
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,230
Today,

146
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,400
I'll take you all to see for yourselves.

147
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,870
It's right ahead!

148
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,440
We'll be there soon.

149
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,200
Let's have a look.

150
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,920
I've missed you very much.

151
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,630
Give me a little more time.

152
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,590
I'll think of a way

153
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,800
to divorce Jiang Yi.

154
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,630
No.

155
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,160
I'll get rid of her.

156
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,960
How long do I have to wait?

157
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,590
If you keep this up,

158
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,920
I'll start to doubt

159
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
your sincerity

160
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,960
toward me.

161
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,230
Before this,

162
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,920
Previously, Cui Mingyue
had people monitor

163
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,200
the Zhu family in an attempt to harm Yi.

164
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,350
But she did not join forces
with Zhu Ziyu.

165
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,040
I never expected that,

166
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,800
due to fate's twists,

167
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,870
the two of them would conspire

168
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,750
to kill my sister.

169
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,200
Your Highness, heaven and earth can bear

170
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,960
witness to my devotion to you,

171
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,560
but those two sisters
are quite hard to deal with.

172
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,470
They also have a powerful commandant

173
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,590
helping them out.

174
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,990
Commandant?

175
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,560
It's Yu Qi
of the Capital Administration Office.

176
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:36,990
Yu Qi?

177
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,320
He's actually in Lingshui?

178
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,920
Your Highness, do you know him?

179
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,400
How would I know him?

180
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,990
Yu,

181
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,200
are you saying

182
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,960
that you can't get rid of her

183
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,440
as long as Jiang Si is here?

184
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,040
Even Yunshui House's
meticulously crafted plan

185
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,160
was ruined by her.

186
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,400
I'm afraid we'll give ourselves away

187
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,630
if we act recklessly.

188
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,830
Wasn't Qing'er's identity

189
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,230
already exposed?

190
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,110
Why did you send her
to relay your message?

191
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,680
Don't worry.

192
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,400
I've gotten rid of her.

193
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,510
Since she was of no use to me,

194
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,280
death was a better end for her.

195
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,440
That was her twin sister, Yu'er.

196
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,630
They just look alike.

197
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,080
Once the deed is done,

198
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,400
I'll kill her too.

199
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,920
What about

200
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,440
Meng Nan
of the Caiyun Troupe?

201
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,200
He said he wanted to stay by my side

202
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,590
and make me happy.

203
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,230
He's just a theater actor.

204
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,080
How dare he harbor
such wishful thinking?

205
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,870
How dare that wretched nobody

206
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,230
keep showing his face
before Your Highness?

207
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,400
He's pretty good at the drums.

208
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,560
He looks quite dashing too.

209
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,160
At least I can keep him around

210
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,040
to entertain me.

211
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,280
After all,

212
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,280
you can't keep me company every day.

213
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,400
Of course, I wish to spend every day

214
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,280
with you.

215
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,870
Your Highness, you made me a promise.

216
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,320
You'll be married to me, right?

217
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,280
In the future,

218
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,830
you're not allowed
to look at other men again.

219
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,560
It's right ahead.

220
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,320
We're almost there.

221
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,350
Meng Nan is such a fool.

222
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,510
I told him to spread rumors

223
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,630
about Jiang Yi.

224
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,680
I didn't expect him to do my bidding.

225
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,920
I'm just worried

226
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,960
that Meng Nan might give us away

227
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,510
after the authorities arrest him.

228
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,710
Give us away?

229
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,510
From start to finish,

230
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,110
he has never seen my face.

231
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,590
You've never shown yourself either.

232
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,110
We used Qing'er as our messenger.

233
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,440
Are you scared now?

234
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,230
Your Highness, we'll do as you say.

235
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,110
This is the place.

236
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,680
Push it open!

237
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,200
Open the door!

238
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,960
Did you call them here?

239
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,080
Don't worry. I'm here.

240
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,710
- Open the door!
- Hurry!

241
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,990
They're forcing the front door open,
and the back door is blocked.

242
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,710
We have nowhere to hide.

243
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,750
You fool! We fell for their trick!

244
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,630
Let's go.

245
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,230
Meng Nan.

246
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,710
Turns out the one dated with Mr. Meng

247
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,920
is a man.

248
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,510
Are you blind?

249
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,210
Can't you tell

250
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:23,910
that there's a girl behind him?

251
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,140
Yes.

252
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,320
You're right.

253
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,280
What are you all doing here?

254
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,800
This is the Zhu family's territory.

255
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,590
Hurry and scram.

256
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,080
Dear, are you all right?

257
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,160
Don't leave yet.

258
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,920
Yi.

259
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,560
Was Ziyu addressing her as you?

260
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,440
Yi.

261
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,990
You kept a mistress outside
behind my sister's back.

262
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,990
Now, people have exposed you.

263
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,590
Even so, you still tried
to use my sister

264
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,680
as your escape ticket, huh?

265
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,440
So, you fell for someone else.

266
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,800
You tried to harm me

267
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,440
with all those despicable means

268
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,470
all because of her, didn't you?

269
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,440
Yi, this is a misunderstanding.

270
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,440
Don't let your sister
sow discord between us.

271
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,320
At this moment,

272
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,830
you still dare to say
that I'm sowing discord?

273
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,470
A man and a woman
caught in a hidden alley.

274
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,560
How is this a misunderstanding?

275
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,830
Go ahead and explain yourself.

276
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,680
Everyone here can be our judge.

277
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,040
That's right!

278
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,630
Miss.

279
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,630
How long do you plan to hide your face?

280
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,710
You have the guts to date a married man,

281
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,320
but you don't have the guts
to show yourself, huh?

282
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,110
Everyone, take a look!

283
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,280
Let's see

284
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,230
which family she belongs to.

285
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,470
Jiang Si, how audacious of you!

286
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,280
I'm no match for you in this regard.

287
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,510
Do you two know each other?

288
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,230
Cui Mingyue.

289
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,320
Seems like the Princess Royal's Mansion
is capable indeed.

290
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,160
They kept the news

291
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,200
tightly under wraps.

292
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,630
Not long ago,

293
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,440
Cui Mingyue attempted
to murder my brother but failed.

294
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,400
She was demoted by His Majesty.

295
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,990
It made her

296
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:55,990
hate our family even more.

297
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,230
Do you truly think

298
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,400
that the only daughter
of the Princess Royal

299
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,630
will fall for someone like you?

300
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,830
Do you trust her or me?

301
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:07,920
Your choice.

302
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,630
Let go.

303
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,630
Since you've seen

304
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,710
that Mingyue and I are in love,

305
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,750
let's part ways peacefully.

306
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,870
It's her,

307
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,560
the Princess Royal.

308
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,110
Mother?

309
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,800
Your Highness,

310
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,400
Mingyue and I love each other.

311
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,110
Please give us your blessings.

312
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,800
Mother,

313
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,800
Zhu Ziyu deceived me.

314
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,350
When I first came to Lingshui,

315
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,440
he pestered me

316
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,280
with his sweet words.

317
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,350
Mother, please trust me.

318
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,800
Zhu Ziyu, you better know
what's good for you.

319
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,400
If you dare to pester her again,

320
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,200
I'll take your life.

321
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,310
Your Highness,

322
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,310
by shielding Princess Mingyue like this,

323
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,470
you are aiding and abetting evil.

324
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,230
Insolence!

325
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,400
Princess Mingyue
has no regard for human life

326
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,680
and treats others as mere ants.

327
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,270
Sooner or later,
she'll make a grave mistake,

328
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,790
and there will be no turning back.

329
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,270
Are you teaching me

330
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,790
how to educate my child?

331
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,710
Your Highness,
you must know better than anyone

332
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,550
how His Majesty
dealt with the transgression

333
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,680
of the Marquis of Changxing's only son.

334
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,160
Jiang Si, how dare you?

335
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,550
Princess Mingyue, you said

336
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,070
that Zhu Ziyu deceived you

337
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,920
with his sweet words.

338
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,990
But to me,

339
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,880
this is nothing more
than a carefully orchestrated trap

340
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,960
of yours.

341
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,790
You tried to harm my sister

342
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,440
so that you could vent
your frustrations from being demoted.

343
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,270
You do have a silver tongue.

344
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,230
However, I hate it

345
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,710
when people threaten me.

346
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:48,960
Stop!

347
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,840
What are you up to?

348
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,310
Are you Yu Qi?

349
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,470
Since when did the jurisdiction

350
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,070
of the Capital Administration Office
extend to this area?

351
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,640
Your Highness, we're no match for you.

352
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,470
You hold absolute power,

353
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,160
both inside and outside

354
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,120
the city.

355
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,600
Yu Qi, how dare you make
such presumptuous remarks

356
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,640
about the Princess Royal?

357
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,440
I dare not do so.

358
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,230
Your Highness, unlike you,

359
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
I dare not disregard the law.

360
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,160
This is a reminder from me.

361
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,680
The case of Jinshui River

362
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,960
has already been concluded
by His Majesty.

363
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,960
Mingyue was just a victim.

364
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,310
Today's matter is settled.

365
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,160
If you all keep it a secret,

366
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,640
I shall

367
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,270
let you off.

368
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,790
Since there's no way to avoid them,

369
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,120
I should be ready to face my foes.

370
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,270
Yi, I was foolish and led astray.

371
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Can you please forgive me?

372
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,510
As you wish,

373
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,360
we shall get a divorce.

374
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,610
[Zhu Mansion]

375
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,110
[Mr. Zhu]

376
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,790
You scoundrel!

377
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,990
Someone! Bring me my cane!

378
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,230
Today,

379
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,750
I shall beat this unfilial son to death

380
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,230
to uphold my family's honor!

381
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,120
But Dear...

382
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,990
Don't interrupt me!

383
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,510
It's all because you spoiled him.

384
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,640
Yi.

385
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,400
Don't worry.

386
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,030
I'll give you an account

387
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,550
and uphold justice for you.

388
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,710
My only wish is to get a divorce.

389
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,550
Yi, get up.

390
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,960
Yi.

391
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,440
Although Ziyu

392
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,600
has committed an unpardonable sin,

393
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,960
you should consider

394
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,270
Yan's best interest.

395
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,640
You are husband and wife after all.

396
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,310
You can definitely
overcome this obstacle.

397
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:07,990
Yan...

398
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,470
Mr. Zhu,

399
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,030
if we truly wanted to uphold justice,

400
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,200
we would've brought

401
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,200
this case

402
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,310
to the local authorities.

403
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,470
We're discussing this
behind closed doors

404
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,550
precisely because

405
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,750
Yi had considered Yan's best interest.

406
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,440
Given the current situation,

407
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,640
we must take Yan with us as well.

408
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,470
You're just an unmarried girl.

409
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,160
What gives you the right

410
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,920
to decide for your sister?

411
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,550
Yi,

412
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,680
I know

413
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,440
that you aren't ruthless enough

414
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,880
to make that decision.

415
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,510
Am I right?

416
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,640
If you get divorced

417
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,030
and have a young girl to raise,

418
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,360
how can you manage

419
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,200
in the future?

420
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,960
Madam Zhu, you don't need
to worry about that.

421
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,200
Even if we fall on hard times,

422
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,990
our family
can still provide for its own.

423
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,120
Ziyu,

424
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,270
kowtow and apologize to Yi.

425
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,880
Promise her that you won't do it again.

426
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,400
Yi.

427
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,960
I'm heartless and ungrateful.

428
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,200
I've let you down.

429
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,510
Yi,

430
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,230
can you please give me another chance?

431
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,960
You tried to harm your wife

432
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,200
and have an affair with a noble lady.

433
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,600
You were truly heartless and ungrateful.

434
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,360
Since Yi

435
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,310
has already

436
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,230
seen your true colors,

437
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,990
why would she give you a chance

438
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,470
and continue spending
the rest of her life with you?

439
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,640
Harm his wife?

440
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,400
You mustn't spout nonsense.

441
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,120
Mr. Zhu,

442
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,680
not long before this,

443
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,360
the horse pulling my sister's carriage

444
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
was startled.

445
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,640
She almost lost her life.

446
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,120
Have you all

447
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,510
gotten to the bottom of it?

448
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:45,840
Well...

449
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,990
I had long suspected

450
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,990
that Zhu Ziyu was the mastermind

451
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,070
behind the incident.

452
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,470
Coincidentally, Commandant Yu
of the Capital Administration Office

453
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,310
was there

454
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,840
to witness the entire process too.

455
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,960
Mr. Zhu,

456
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,360
you better think this through.

457
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,310
If you don't agree with the divorce,

458
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,710
we shall report the carriage case

459
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,400
to the local authorities.

460
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,030
By then,

461
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,640
if Zhu Ziyu

462
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,790
is deemed to be related to the case,

463
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,120
you and your son's career will be...

464
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,120
The Zhu family

465
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,600
should sign
the letter of divorce immediately.

466
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,710
From now on,

467
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,200
my sister and your son

468
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,550
shall be separated.

469
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,600
No matter what happens,

470
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,550
they shall never cross paths again.

471
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,990
If not,
we shall see each other in court.

472
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,550
Since she wants a divorce,

473
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,270
I'll give her that.

474
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,360
Mother, you've always wanted me

475
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,120
to divorce her, right?

476
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,790
We shall do it today.

477
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,510
As for Yan,

478
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,840
she's just a girl.

479
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,750
She'll eventually
be married off to someone else.

480
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,360
If they want her,

481
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,680
they can take her with them.

482
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,680
We can't just

483
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,840
let them bring the case to the court

484
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,680
and ruin your son's future.

I knew it.

00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,750
You only refused
to admit our relationship

00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,790
that I scattered.

563
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,550
What a shame.

564
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,600
You failed to kill Jiang Yi.

565
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:40,880
However,

566
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,550
I witnessed the separation
between you two

567
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,710
and the heartbroken expression
on Jiang Yi's face.

568
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,120
It was pretty fun.

569
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,030
You took me for a fool

570
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,360
and you caused my wife
and child to leave me.

571
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,880
Yet it was all just for fun?

572
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,440
Of course.

573
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,400
Life is a long journey.

574
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,550
And I don't lack anything.

575
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,270
I need

576
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,360
to pass my time somehow.

577
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,270
Zhu Ziyu.

578
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,360
You saw it for yourself.

579
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,200
People who offend me

580
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,960
will face dire consequences.

581
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,990
Therefore,

582
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840
you should hand over
the item like the dog you are.

583
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,510
If not,

584
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,120
getting a divorce
will be the least of your concerns.

585
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,640
A shattered family.

586
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,400
How does that sound?

587
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,680
That's more like it.

588
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,710
[Fenglin Inn]

589
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,070
Aunt,

590
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,790
which of them looks better?

591
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,200
I think these two look better.

592
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,230
Place them together, then.

593
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,120
Aunt.

594
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,680
Yan, stop for a second.

595
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,680
Finish this wonton first.

596
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,360
Sure.

597
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,640
What should you say now?

598
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,920
Thank you, big brother.

599
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,360
That's not right.

600
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:01,960
I'm the same age

601
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,230
as your aunt.

602
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,070
You have to call me Uncle.

603
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,360
She's your Aunt. I'm your Uncle.

604
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,680
Thank you, Uncle.

605
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,600
Good girl.

606
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,070
Here.

607
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,880
Let me feed you.

608
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,310
It's hot. Be careful.

609
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,030
Have some soup first.

610
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,230
Uncle, you keep staring at Aunt.

611
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,030
You have no time to check the wonton.

612
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,790
I haven't had the chance.

613
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,680
Commandant Yu,

614
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,270
thank you for helping us out
all this while.

615
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,710
Please don't stand on ceremony.

616
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,120
Protecting the people's interest

617
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,030
is the duty

618
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,920
of the Capital Administration Office.

619
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
Besides, Jiang Zhan and I

620
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,120
are best friends.

621
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,440
His family is my family.

622
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,160
Zhan is truly lucky

623
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,070
to have a friend like you.

624
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,840
I'm also lucky

625
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,880
to have a friend like him.

626
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,510
It's fine. It's not burned.

627
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,550
Let me blow it for you.

628
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
I'll entrust them

629
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,880
to you now.

630
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,840
Don't worry.

631
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:40,880
They won't starve

632
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,070
as long as I'm around.

633
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,790
Miss Si,

634
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,160
actually,

635
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,640
I've always wanted

636
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,160
to give you this painting.

637
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,030
What is this?

638
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,200
Since you're asking me,

639
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,990
I'll tell you the truth.

640
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,070
I rescued your sister for two reasons.

641
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,790
First, it's to uphold justice.

642
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,120
Second, it's to repay
your family's favor.

643
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,750
Repay our favor?

644
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,120
A life-saving favor.

645
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,030
Your mother, Su Ke,

646
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,270
once rescued me.

647
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,070
My mother?

648
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,360
My parents passed away when I was young.

649
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,120
Before their passing,

650
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,990
they entrusted me to the Caiyun Troupe.

651
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,200
I had just passed the age of 15.

652
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,310
They bullied me for being young

653
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,640
and alone.

654
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,640
I couldn't resist their bullying,

655
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,360
yet I couldn't swallow the grievances

656
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,640
and let them bully me.

657
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,440
I ran out

658
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,550
of the Caiyun Troupe out of spite.

659
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
I never expected

660
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,990
to encounter
human traffickers on the way.

661
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
I was almost beaten to death.

662
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,310
Luckily,

663
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,200
Su Ke was there to rescue me.

664
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,440
Help me!

665
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,740
[Su Ke, Jiang Si's Mother]
Help me!

666
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,120
Mr. Cui.

667
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,640
Scram!

668
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,400
Yes, sir.

669
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:53,880
Miss.

670
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,360
Miss, are you all right?

671
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,270
Miss?

672
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,710
Miss?

673
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,440
The year Su took me in

674
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,680
was the best year of my life.

675
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,070
Su was a noble lady,

676
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,200
but she took in a theater actor.

677
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,550
Plenty of people
were gossiping about her.

678
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,960
Mr. Su wanted to send me away.

679
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,710
But Su said

680
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,840
that others could say
whatever they wanted.

681
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,960
There's no need to care about them.

682
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,840
Even if they did send me away,

683
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,600
people

684
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,880
would still gossip about them.

685
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,510
Although Su didn't mind it,

686
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,990
I didn't want to cause her trouble.

687
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,840
I still returned to the Caiyun Troupe.

688
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,070
But her words

689
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,840
truly enlightened me.

690
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,510
Since then,

691
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,960
I was no longer affected

692
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,470
by rumors and gossip.

693
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,790
I made her a promise.

694
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,470
I'd perform the best dance for her

695
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,230
once I return

696
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,710
after mastering my skills.

697
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,230
Thank you,

698
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,230
Miss Fei.

699
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,470
Thank you for sharing this with me.

700
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,920
Mother passed away

701
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,920
right after I was born.

702
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,880
I've never

703
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,360
met her before.

704
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,920
All these years,

705
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
I could only sketch out

706
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,280
her face in my mind

707
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,150
by relying on the words
people use to describe her.

708
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,960
Miss Fei,

709
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,590
I'm very envious of you.

710
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,239
I'm envious that you were able

711
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,510
to spend so much time with her.

712
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,030
Our bond is enduring.
Until we meet again.

713
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,360
Yan, be careful.

714
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,320
Careful.

715
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,960
You all can depart before me.

716
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,150
Yes, sir.

717
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,800
Mr. Yu.

718
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,800
I have a question

719
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,280
I wish to ask you

720
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,670
before my departure.

721
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,670
Mr. Yu, please go ahead.

722
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,030
You observed us in secret

723
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,840
in the woods back then, right?

724
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,070
Mr. Yu, you must be mistaken.

725
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,990
I was doing my rounds in another area.

726
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,550
I rushed there

727
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,470
upon hearing the startled horse.

728
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:05,960
Commandant Xie, you said
I risked my life to save them.

729
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,440
But you were the same.

730
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,340
[Border of Ling'an]

731
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,310
[Count of Dongping's Mansion]

732
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,030
Greetings, Grandmother.

733
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,110
Yan,

734
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,800
hurry and kowtow to Great-grandmother.

735
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,760
Si,

736
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,240
you've truly grown fearless.

737
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,720
Are you

738
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,800
the head of our family now?

739
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,280
This is a huge deal,

740
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,110
yet you didn't even notify your brother

741
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,990
or your father.

742
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,240
How dare you hide the news

743
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,550
and bring them back

744
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,240
in secret?

745
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,510
Grandmother, it was my intention.

746
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,360
Si was reluctant

747
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,400
to refuse me.

748
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,880
Enough. Stop covering up for her.

749
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,720
You think

750
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,070
I don't know you two well enough?

751

Mother.

752
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,510
It was an urgent matter.

753
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,110
Yi swallowed a lot of grievances
when she was there.

754
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,880
Si saving Yi

755
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,440
from the lion's den

756
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,440
is the most important thing.

757
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,670
It's understandable

758
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,400
that they couldn't notify us in time.

759
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,880
Now, there are

760
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,240
two such cases.

761
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,400
She annulled the engagement

762
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
and she got a divorce.

763
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,240
What have we done to deserve this?

764
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,510
Grandmother,

765
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,550
Ji Chongyi and Zhu Ziyu

766
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,670
were the ones who had committed sins.

767
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,150
It has nothing to do with my sisters.

768
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,510
From now on, I shall defend the family.

769
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,470
No one else

770
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,840
can bully the girls again.

771
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,470
Yan, come. Get up.

772
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,470
Go and greet Great-grandmother.

773
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,550
Go now.

774
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,880
Great-grandmother.

775
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,400
Let me hold your hands.

776
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,070
Yi, get up.

777
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,550
Have some fruits.

778
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,550
One for each hand.

779
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,840
Hold them properly.

780
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,190
Go now.

781
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,630
Each generation forges its own path.

782
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,760
From now on, I'll stay out

783
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,510
of your affairs.

784
00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:01,610
[Haitang House]

[The road ahead is long,
and no difficulty is insurmountable.]

787
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,630
You must be lying.

788
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,960
Why would Princess Royal kill Yu Qi?

789
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,030
She already got her way.

790
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,070
Why should I deceive you?

791
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,280
Zhou couldn't conquer Nanwu
after a battle of attrition.

792
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,840
They also suffered defeat lately.

793
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,110
Princess Royal pushed the blame

794
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,110
on the Red Plume Cavalry.

795
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,440
She executed Yu Qi,

796
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,880
their leader.

798
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,110
How could that be?

799
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,760
That's impossible.

800
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,670
Our men have infiltrated Yangui

801
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,920
for a long time.

802
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,110
Our news source is reliable.

had slaughtered my family

and my husband.

I'm going

808
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,990
to invade Changle Palace with you all

809
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,240
and kill them

810
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,670
to avenge my family

811
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,240

You're still alive?

814
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,110
So, you're the Nanwu Saintess.

815
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,320
I'm not her.

816
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,920
I'm here to seek vengeance!

The imperial court

818
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,070
is under my command.

00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,240
You don't get to do what you like.

820
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,550
Let's see

821
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,760
if it's you who has the final say today,

822
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,990
or my sword.

823
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:46,840
This

824
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,760
is for my family.

825
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,030
You and your daughter, Cui Mingyue,

826
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,110
had slaughtered innocent civilians.

827
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,320
My father, brother, and sister

828
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,590
all suffered and died in agony
because of you two.

829

Today,

830
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,440
I will avenge them.

00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:03,960
This

832
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,360
is for my husband,

833
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,800
Yu Qi.

834
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,760
Why did you kill him too?

835
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,110
Do you truly think

836
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,800
he's simply the Yu Qi you know?

837
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,840
Even if I die here,

838
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,070
your life is irreversible.

839
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,030
Shut up!

840
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,670
I was born and raised

841
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,240
in Zhou.

842
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,760
But you and your daughter

843
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,240
insisted on cornering me,

844
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,400
causing me to have no shelter
in my homeland.

845
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
This

846
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,630
is for myself.

847
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,440
I've gotten my revenge.

848
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:35,990
I've gotten my revenge.

849
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,320

are all safe.

853
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,840
Perhaps I'm no longer
the bringer of misfortune.

854
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,070
Yu Qi will surely be safe too.

855
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,710
Should I still miss out on him?
