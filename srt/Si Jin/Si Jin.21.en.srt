00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,760
You will never

196
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,160
seek to harm our nation.

197
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Saintess or not,

198
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,710
it won't matter.

199
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,790
What if I actually

200
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,310
defected to Nanwu?

201
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,710
What would you do?

202
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,790
I would protect Zhou.

203
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,920
I will keep you safe.

204
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,200
[Capital Administration Office]

205
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,760
Commandant Yu.

206
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,030
A decree from the palace.

207
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,430
The Mid-Autumn Hunt

208
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,950
will be held on Mount Cuiluo.

209
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,670
Those above the seventh rank
must participate.

210
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,319
The Mid-Autumn Hunt?

211
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:07,510
Yes.

212
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,119
Plenty of officials

213
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,400
would use this opportunity

214
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,319
to showcase their abilities
before His Majesty.

215
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,900
[Count of Dongping's Mansion]

216
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,640
So,

217
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,270
about Mr. Xiao...

218
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,710
Qiao,

219
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,080
you should meet him.

220
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,840
Madam Xiao and I

221
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,670
will go with you.

222
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,270
I will be waiting

223
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,080
in one of the side chambers.

224
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,270
And

225
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:44,920
Madam Ruan

226
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,320
could have a look as well.

227
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:46,920
Anmou.

228
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,920
How could you?

229
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,030
She is right, Father!

230
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,320
Please reconsider.

231
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:51,750
Father.

232
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,840
Have I upset you in some way?

233
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,430
It's too late.

234
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,880
Too late.

235
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,470
It's all too late!

236
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,880
The Xiao family prefers you.

237
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,230
They want to meet you.

238
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,120
Madam Xiao took matters
into her own hands

239
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,710
and agreed.

240
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,160
She even used

241
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,320
our family seal

242
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,470
on the letter to them.

243
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,400
What else can we do?

244
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,750
You are Qiao's father.

245
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,120
If you object,

246
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,270
they'll have to give up.

247
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,710
Father!

248
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,640
I need your help.

249
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,080
Father! Please help her!

250
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,080
Qiao is...

251
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,670
He is the son of Lingbei's governor!

252
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,990
I will lose my job

253
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,120
if I keep ruffling feathers!

254
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,510
If it were that simple,

255
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,430
I could've sent a letter instead.

256
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,990
That settles it. You're meeting him.

257
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,510
Qiao.

258
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,030
Qiao.

259
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,840
Madam Xiao.

260
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,160
Any words from Xiaoxiang Garden?

261
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,670
Mr. Anmou said yes.

262
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,160
They can't refuse.

263
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,360
However,
Miss Qiao is rather crestfallen.

264
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,880
Who knows what she does

265
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,320
locking herself in the room?

266
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,190
According to the kitchen staff,

267
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,600
she barely touched the food

268
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,230
they sent her.

269
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,800
She is young and insensible.

270
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,750
We found her an influential family.

271
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,560
She is from the second branch.

272
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,670
She can't get

273
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,920
a better husband than that.

274
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:52,640
Unbelievable.

275
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,120
We've all

276
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,080
been through struggles.

277
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,840
Keep an eye on her.

278
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,920
Tell the kitchen staff
to bring her decent food.

279
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,920
She mustn't starve.

280
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,160
Yes.

281
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,160
How thoughtful of you, Madam Xiao.

282
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,640
Wait.

283
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,600
Just to be safe,

284
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,360
bring her here.

285
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,320
Pei, how are things
in your married life?

286
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,670
Rest assured, Mother.

287
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,640
He treats me well.

288
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,990
You're now all grown-up and married.

289
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,030
You're become mature and thoughtful.

290
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,080
Pei, you've always

291
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,470
been my favorite.

292
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,920
She is always sweet when she sees me.

293
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,840
Such a nice and obedient girl.

294
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,560
Indeed.

295
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,840
Miss Pei always listens
to you, Madam Xiao.

296
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,400
Now that you're married,

297
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,560
I started missing you

298
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,190
since I don't get to see you
all the time.

299
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,080
I was wayward and immature.

300
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,190
Thank you for tolerating me.

301
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,510
You're married.

302
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,670
It's a great relief.

303
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
However, I am now worried

304
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,120
about Jiang Qiao's

305
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,640
betrothal.

306
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,920
It's time

307
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,320
she gets married.

308
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,990
She can't spend her life

309
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,510
in this mansion.

310
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,080
The son of the Xiao family

311
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,400
is a great candidate.

312
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,230
Talk some sense into her.

313
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,640
Miss Pei.

314
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,560
I don't mean to be rude,

315
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,880
but Madam Xiao's lecture
comes from her concern

316
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,600
for your best interest.

317
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,750
She asked for your help

318
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,080
convincing Miss Qiao

319
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,640
for our family's harmony.

320
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,510
Perhaps you could

321
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,800
reconsider?

322
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,030
Alright, Nanny Li.

323
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,560
I must go now.

324
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,510
Why is Pei

325
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,470
getting involved
with the Yaxin Garden again?

326
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,470
You should leave the room

327
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,880
more often for sunshine.

328
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,600
That should

329
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,270
take the edge off.

330
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,160
Sometimes, things will pass

331
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,640
once we start

332
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,560
coming around.

333
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,950
I am tired.

334
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,190
I shall take a nap.

335
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,320
You sent for me

336
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,640
for this thing?

337
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,080
Of course.

338
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,950
The box contains a mechanism.

339
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,080
I know.

340
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,160
Can you open it?

341
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,120
Absolutely.

342
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,470
Contracts?

343
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,320
All were signed

344
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,230
by Manager Du.

345
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,030
These people

346
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,080
are all knees deep in gambling debts.

347
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,160
The contracts say
they can finish one job

348
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,560
for the Nightingale Sect

349
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,670
to waive the debts.

350
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,320
Minister of Rites.

351
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,510
Very well.

352
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,750
After I capture all of them,

353
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,950
I'll get some answers out of them.

354
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,560
Use an excuse unrelated

355
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,230
to the sect.

356
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,030
Understood.

357
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,710
We wouldn't want to alert the enemy.

358
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,430
"The hunt begins
at the third quarter of the Wu hour."

359
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,430
"Glory to Nanwu,
ruins to Emperor Jingming."

360
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,840
The Nanwu language is banned in Zhou.

361
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,360
How can you read it?

362
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,640
It seems you're familiar
with the language too.

363
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,560
Does it mean the Nightingale Sect

364
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,920
is making a move
during the Mid-Autumn Hunt?

365
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,950
Emperor Jingming died this year
in my past life.

366
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,160
But he died from an illness.

367
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,880
Was his death connected

368
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,840
to the Nightingale Sect?

369
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,640
What was that?

370
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
If they make a move during the hunt,

371
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,430
we must stop them

372
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,950
at all costs.

373
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,710
But why at the third quarter
of the Wu hour?

374
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,600
The third quarter of the Wu hour.

375
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,950
Why would they

376
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,510
choose this time?

377
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,840
It's the hour of Wu.

378
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,470
Why isn't the meal here yet?

379
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,990
At this rate,

380
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:16,880
the punishment

381
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,920
will take a toll on you.

382
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,360
Besides,

383
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,080
today is Mid-Autumn.

384
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:27,670
Wait.

385
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,940
Why has the sky gone dark?

386
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:30,540
A shadow

387
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,230
fell across the sun,
stealing its light.

388
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,920
There will be a great calamity!

389
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,950
Why are they ringing the bell?

390
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,840
Madam, Emperor Jingming passed away.

391
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,670
The bell is sounded
to mourn his passing.

392
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,710
Why?

393
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,510
It means

394
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,430
His Majesty died during a solar eclipse.

395
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,560
It's said they didn't even

396
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,190
get to light the candle.

397
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,430
This can't be happening.

398
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,120
A solar eclipse.

399
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,560
A quarter before midday,
there will be a solar eclipse.

400
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,360
How do you know about the eclipse?

401
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,120
I am the Saintess.

402
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,470
I can foresee the future.

403
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,160
Why so surprised?

404
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,190
Alright.

405
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,710
It seems

406
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,360
the Nightingale Sect

407
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,320
will use the eclipse

408
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,510
to assassinate His Majesty.

409
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,750
Will you be at the Mid-Autumn Hunt?

410
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:30,670
Certainly.

411
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,510
Will you help me?

412
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,500
[From Jiang Qiao]

413
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:46,600
[Sent by Jiang Qiao]

414
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,600
[Main Hall
of the Capital Administration Office]

415
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,120
Sort the testimonies we collected

416
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,270
last night.

417
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,320
Yes, sir.

418
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,360
You've worked non-stop for a day.

419
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:01,950
You need rest.

420
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,320
Dismissed.

421
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,990
Thank you, Commandant Yu.

422
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,080
Any progress?

423
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,430
They are mere gamblers.

424
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,030
A fine and a few days in jail

425
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:35,920
will suffice.

426
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,880
But they said

427
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,400
the underground gambling parlor

428
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,470
has operated for years.

429
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,120
Yet, we never found out.

430
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,030
Thankfully, you were here.

431
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,640
You acted swiftly.

432
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,510
You thwarted the operation
that brought harm to the world.

433
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,800
I'm flattered, Mr. Zhen.

434
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,320
Since you hold me in such high regard,

435
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,920
I am obliged to assist you.

436
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,470
How about this?

437
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,030
Give me a warrant.

438
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,160
I'll interrogate the Minister of Rites,

439
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,560
Zhou Yi.

440
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,560
Really?

441
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,230
Yes.

442
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,510
You don't need a warrant.

443
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,360
Why?

444
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,640
He is one of the arrested gamblers.

445
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,320
What are the odds?

446
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,840
Miss Jiang.

447
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,800
Mr. Zhen.

448
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
I didn't expect to see you here.

449
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,270
The Director of the Census Division?

450
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,510
The Director of the Evaluation Division,
Ministry of Personnel.

451
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,800
The Assistant Division Director,
Ministry of Personnel.

452
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,510
The Vice Minister of the Division
of Gardens, Forestry, and Hunting.

453
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,950
I thought the officials were clean.

454
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:11,880
Yet,

455
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,320
a small gambling parlor

456
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,320
[Contract]
manages to ensnare our officials

457
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:18,230
in debt traps and make them
spill confidential information.

458
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:18,840
Yes.

459
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:19,920
Mr. Zhen.

460
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,470
This gambling parlor might be

461
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,360
connected to the Nightingale Sect.

462
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,160
What?

463
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,750
Madam Ruan.

464
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:45,840
I am sorry.

465
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,560
I failed as a daughter.

466
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,160
I must go now.

467
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,750
Qiao?

468
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,430
When we spoke earlier today,

469
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,400
I noticed something unusual.

470
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,320
So, I kept an eye on you.

471
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,030
Are you running away?

472
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,320
Yes. I must leave.

473
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,510
Where can you possibly go?

474
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:31,880
Anywhere but here.

475
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,470
Because of the betrothal?

476
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,030
I can't make any decisions

477
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,430
about how my life should be.

478
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,120
I might as well leave.

479
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,270
I'm done being a noble lady
trapped in this mansion.

480
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,190
From now on, I'm just me.

481
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,840
For better or worse,

482
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,920
my life shall be my own.

483
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:47,990
But you've never

484
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,320
ventured beyond these walls.

485
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,990
If you forsake

486
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,230
this sheltered life,

487
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:52,950
how will you survive

488
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,640
in the harsh world?

489
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:53,920
The world holds countless dangers

490
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,320
you can't even imagine.

491
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,230
Are you worried about me?

492
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,470
Or are you concerned

493
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,160
about giving Madam Xiao
a proper explanation?

494
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,400
How is this about her?

495
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,710
I saw it when Nanny Li walked you back

496
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,840
to the Xiaoxiang Garden.

497
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,160
What's wrong?

498
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,080
Is something the matter?

499
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,710
Miss Qiao, are you leaving?

500
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,360
Start talking.

501
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,880
It's the middle of the night.

502
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,360
What trouble did you get into this time?

503
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,640
Old Madam,

504
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,640
the servants heard some noises

505
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,750
when patrolling

506
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,710
the Xiaoxiang Garden.

507
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,400
I was concerned.

508
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,950
So, I went there with a group.

509
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,510
To my surprise,

510
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:51,320
Miss Qiao was planning
to run away from home.

511
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:52,800
What?

512
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,640
Are you sure about this?

513
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,920
I'm certain of it.

514
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,710
Miss Qiao was carrying

515
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,990
this traveling sack with her.

516
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,400
There was

517
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,880
a farewell letter on the desk.

518
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,300
[From Jiang Qiao]

519
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,270
See for yourself.

520
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,990
This is her handwriting.

521
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,430
It's your daughter.

522
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,120
Were you really trying to leave

523
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,510
this family?

524
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,230
Anmou.

525
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,920
She must have been too anxious

526
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,800
over the engagement.

527
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,920
She would never dare

528
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,800
leave this family behind.

529
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,120
Qiao, quick.

530
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,670
Apologize
to your grandmother and father.

531
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,430
Qiao.

532
00:33:59,230 --> 00:33:59,710
Yes.

533
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,320
I've failed as a daughter.

534
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,200
Why you...?

535
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:02,760
You...

536
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,720
What about your parents and siblings?

537
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,990
Are you leaving them too?

538
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:10,030
This family is abandoning me.

539
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,679
I'd rather wander the world freely

540
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,429
than be married off like an object.

541
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,429
We haven't settled on the marriage.

542
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:18,630
Even if

543
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,429
you are displeased
with this arrangement,

544
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,030
we can always

545
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,679
talk things out.

546
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,920
Grandmother, what else
do you expect me to say?

547
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:29,030
My will

548
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,719
means nothing compared

549
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,110
to a letter with a family seal.

550
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,110
All right. I'll accept it.

551
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,360
Thank you.

552
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,150
Mother.

553
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,030
Hurry. Take it inside.
Place it on her bed.

554
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,400
Afu, help her out.

555
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,280
No need for that.

556
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,030
She can do it alone.

557
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,360
You can make us some tea.

558
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,070
Here, Mother.

559
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,110
The family seal is a symbol
of our honor!

560
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:54,920
We only agreed

561
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,760
to meet in person.

562
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,430
We haven't decided on the engagement.

563
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,630
The meeting is insignificant.

564
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,030
So are the engagement

565
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,200
and my marriage.

566
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,950
What exactly counts as serious

567
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:03,760
in your book?

568
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,590
I don't want

569
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,800
to spend my life

570
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,400
accomplishing nothing.

571
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,880
The daughters in this family

572
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,510
have mastered the art of arguments.

573
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,920
They have no respect for manners.

574
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,430
I can't believe it.

575
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,400
Look at what you've done.

576
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,680
I don't want to be troubled.

577
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,510
Anmou, this is for your branch

578
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,550
to deal with.

579
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,720
Yes, Mother.

580
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,510
Lock her up.

581
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,760
Make sure she reflects on what she did.

582
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,800
Anmou, have mercy on Qiao.

583
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,590
You're no better.

584
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,720
You failed to educate her.

585
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,510
As punishment,
copy the virtues ten times!

586
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,630
You should learn

587
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,430
how others

588
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,720
educate their children!

589
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,430
The children are acting up

590
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,630
because someone broke the rules.

591

Mr. Zhou!

594

Don't leave us here!

606
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,320
Madam Ruan.

607
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,720
Do you fault me for this?

608
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,070
For what, exactly?

609
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,470
For my rash action
that got us into trouble,

610
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,510
for running away.

611
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,630
When you ran away,

612
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,110
everything nice

613
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,630
the family has given you

614
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:30,680
was as good as

615
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,840
denied by you.

616
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,320
Of course your father

617
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,720
feels disheartened.

618
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,400
But I know

619
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,240
you still care about

620
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,760
this family.

621
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,720
Even I have a place in your heart.

622
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,240
You and Father,

623
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,430
and the others

624
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,720
have treated me well.

625
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,760
I will never forget that.

626
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,470
I'd hate to cast all of that aside.

627
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,320
But I feel so lost

628
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,070
and helpless.

629
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,280
I know.

630
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,200
I understand your woes.

631
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,920
Sorry, Madam Ruan.

632
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,630
I know you've always

633
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,950
been so cautious

634
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,200
with everything in this family

635
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,840
as though you are walking on eggshells.

636
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,030
But now,

637
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,630
because of me...

638
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,990
It's alright.

639
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,680
Don't worry about it.

640
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,200
Why would I care about

641
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,200
their opinions?

642
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,150
You and Pei

643
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,880
are my only daughters.

644
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,760
If you're happy,

645
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,760
then I shall be content.

646
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,430
I'll help you copy the books.

647
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,470
Silly girl.

648
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,990
Why are you asking
for punishment yourself?

649
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,360
Madam Ruan, Qiao?

650
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,320
Pei.

651
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,800
Madam Ruan, Qiao.

652
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,200
I got you some snacks

653
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,280
from the Guangju Parlor.

654
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,470
Freshly made.

655
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,360
They are still warm.

656
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,630
This is

657
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,950
Qiao's favorite.

658
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,510
They smell delightful.

659
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,950
Qiao, try them out.

660
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,800
I'm not hungry.

661
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,110
I'll make some tea.

662
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:49,840
Yes.

663
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,760
Never mind.

664
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,200
I'm not parched.

665
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,720
It's rare we three

666
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,240
get together like this.

667
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,800
Let's have some tea together.

668
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,760
Maybe someone here

669
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,840
would rather be in the Yaxin Garden.

670
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,680
She might just be avoiding us.

671
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,800
Qiao, why did you say that?

672
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,950
I brought you snacks.

673
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,150
Yet, you bashed me for no reason.

674
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,320
You're unreasonable.

675
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,550
You know very well

676
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,920
why you came here.

677
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,470
I never thought

678
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,150
you still ingratiate yourself
with Madam Xiao

679
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,240
after you're married.

680
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,630
What can she

681
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,720
possibly give you?

682
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,400
Madam Xiao?

683
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,320
Pei, what have you done?

684
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,110
Why would I do that?

685
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,360
It's a baseless claim.

686
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,430
Madam Ruan,

687
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,200
I saw Nanny Li walk her back

688
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,590
with my own eyes.

689
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,680
Pei and Madam Xiao

690
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,840
spoke in private.

691
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,280
Afterward, she tried
to convince me to meet Mr. Xiao.

692
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,430
That was exactly Madam Xiao's idea.

693
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,800
As soon as I left the bedroom,

694
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,680
Pei showed up out of nowhere.

695
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,030
And then, Nanny Li happened

696
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,950
to arrive

697
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,150
and caught me as I left.

698
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,510
I bet

699
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,200
Pei informed them

700
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,070
of my decision to leave.

701
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,510
Pei, have you lost your mind?

702
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,510
Why are you getting involved with them?

703
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,720
Did the past

704
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,400
teach you nothing?

705
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,200
Is that what you think of me?

706
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,920
You have a track record.

707
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,360
I didn't think...

708
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,510
Old habits die hard.

709
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,950
Qiao is your sister!

710
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:29,760
How could you

711
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,430
help Madam Xiao plot against her?

712
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,110
Since you hold such disdain for me...

713
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,800
I shouldn't stay.

714
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,470
I should leave,

715
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:39,430
not her.

716
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,430
After a quarrel in the Xiaoxiang Garden,

717
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,470
Miss Pei packed her belongings

718
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,360
and left.

719
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,470
She must have gone home.

720
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,550
There's pouring rain

721
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,840
from Ling'an to Lingbei.

722
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,510
The letter will take a few more days

723
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,200
to reach the Xiao family.

724
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,990
That wouldn't be bad.

725
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,320
Jiang Qiao can use some time

726
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,400
to come around.

727
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,030
Good results take time.

729
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,280
lately?

730
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,760
None of the children

731
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,720

734

prepared some dishes

735
