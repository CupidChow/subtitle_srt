=Episode 1=

11
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,130
(Zhengyang Gate)
(In the 10th year of Qingyuan,)

12
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,340
(the Grand Princess dominated the court.)

13
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,680
(When her tyranny shook the state,)

14
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,550
(Tiande Hall)
(Nanwu invaded Dazhou.)

15
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,590
(Chaos arose.)

16
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,560
I was born

17
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,000
and raised in Dazhou,

18
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,510
but you and your daughter

19
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,040
mean to kill me for good,

20
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,120
leaving me no chance of survival.

21
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,800
(I never thought)

22
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,360
(I'd be killed by you.)

23
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,900
(Yu)

24
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,520
(If I had a second chance,)

25
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,150
(would things end up differently?)

26
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,540
(Jiang Si, Earl Dongping's Daughter)

27
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,300
(Friends Gather Together)

28
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,140
(Ling'an)

29
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,670
You're awake, Miss.

30
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,350
Have some water

31
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,840
and eat something.

32
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,100
(Yu Qi, Chief of Chiyu Cavalry)

33
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,060
Are you feeling better?

34
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,830
Why did you kill me?

35
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,720
Why would I kill you?

36
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,800
Why did I save your life?

37
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,670
Hey, Miss, why did you slap him?

38
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,100
(Long Dan)
Last night, you fell into

39
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,500
(Yu Qi's Guard)
the Jinshui River!

40
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,430
Chief saved your life!

41
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,040
He didn't kill you.

42
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Jinshui River?

43
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,150
Chief, maybe

44
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,070
her brain was damaged

45
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,390
when she almost drowned.

46
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,120
Don't mind her attitude.

47
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,270
(How did I fall into that river?)

48
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,000
(Could it be...?)

49
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,830
What time is it now?

50
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,190
A little past the Shen hour.

51
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,270
You rested here for almost a day.

52
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,110
Which year is it?

53
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,000
You slapped Chief.

54
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,190
Shouldn't you apologize first?

55
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,310
Answer my question!

56
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,720
The 23rd year of Jingming.

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,430
The 23rd year of Jingming...

58
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,480
How come?

59
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,160
(This is 10 years ago!)

60
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,670
Drowned...

61
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,430
Ji Chongyi...

62
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,380
(Jinshui River)

63
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,880
Here you go.

64
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,960
Young Master Ji!

65
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,120
Miss Si!

66
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,400
Leave now.

67
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,440
Miss Si...

68
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,470
Young Master Ji,

69
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,070
we've engaged.

70
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,800
How could you cheat on me?

71
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,120
It's not what it looks like.

72
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,600
Listen to me, I can explain, alright?

73
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,510
- Miss Si.
- You're still protecting her!

74
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,630
Jiang Si, I can explain!

75
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,640
Jiang Si!

76
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,640
Jiang Si!

77
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,670
(That year,)

78
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,750
(Ji Chongyi pushed me into that river.)

79
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,830
(If this is 10 years ago,)

80
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,750
(then my family members)

81
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,750
(are still alive.)

82
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,230
Miss,

83
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,120
do you still feel unwell?

84
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,720
Do you need to see a physician?

85
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,710
No, thanks.

86
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,240
I was in a trance. I'm fine.

87
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,640
Thanks for your help.

88
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,430
I need to go home.

89
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,460
My family must be worried.

90
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,460
Good day.

91
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,760
I'll walk you home.

92
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,110
No need.

93
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,670
My family is conservative.

94
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,640
It's inconvenient.

95
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,400
You were soaking wet.

96
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,710
Don't catch a cold.

97
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,960
I'm Yu Qi.

98
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,310
May I know your name?

99
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,120
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

100
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,160
Chief,

101
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,750
why did you bring her back?

102
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,840
To let her know me.

103
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,100
She fell into the water!

104
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,510
I saw Nanwu's Flame Totem on her neck.

105
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,040
Perhaps

106
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,600
she's their spy.

107
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,600
If so, why did you let her go?

108
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Following that fish,

109
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,910
we'll find the shoal.

110
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,600
Freshly baked Milk Cakes!

111
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,600
Take a look!

112
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,200
Sister, Milk Cakes are so good!

113
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,720
Let's buy some to eat at night.

114
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,270
Take a look, sir.

115
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,550
Cheap and tasty!

116
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,960
Take a look.

117
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,840
Freshly baked Milk Cakes.

118
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,870
Would you like some, Miss?

119
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,390
Sister,

120
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,030
help.

121
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,110
Brother!

122
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,160
Go!

123
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,080
Move!

124
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,560
Si,

125
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,080
turn around.

126
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,320
Go home!

127
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,120
Go home!

128
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,550
Move! Keep going!

129
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,560
Father!

130
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,060
(Earl Dongping's Mansion, Funeral)

131
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,940

132

(Did Father and Brother)

134
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,240
(fail to survive as last time?)

135
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,390
The body was retrieved just now.

136
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,840
Did he drown?

137
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,550
Look at the cut on his face.

138
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,030
Right.

139
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,030
His family must be rich.

140
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,870
His clothes are nice.

141
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,270
Young Master Zhan!

142
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,000
Zhan!

143
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
Zhan!

144
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,790
Observer Jiang Ancheng
of the Directorate of Astronomy

(Execution)
altered the horoscope.

146
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,200
He shall be executed

147
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,840
for such a capital crime!

148
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,780
(Execution)

149
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,680
Si,

150
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,720
go home!

151
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,320
(I'm back.)

152
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,630
(Are you two alright?)

153
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,910
There you are, Miss Si. This is great!

154
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,200
Miss... Miss Si!

155
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,120
- Miss Si!
- Go!

156
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,030
Miss Si is back. Go!

157
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,150
Miss Si, you're back.

158
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,240
Thank goodness!

159
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,440
Miss Si, didn't you...?

160
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,630
Miss Si,

161
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,230
you're back!

162
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,240
Ms. Xiao asked us to put together

163
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,150
this funeral.

164
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,960
I see.

165
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,910
You may leave.

166
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,220
(Tablet of Jiang Si
of Earl Dongping's Mansion)

167
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,220
(Tablet of Jiang Si
of Earl Dongping's Mansion)

168
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,060
(They're fine.)

169
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,510
(It's my tablet.)

170
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,150
How useless!

171
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,960
Didn't I pay the carpenter two more taels

172
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,270
of silver to make the coffin

173
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,240
overnight?

174
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,030
Look what time it is now!

175
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,080
Where's the coffin?

176
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,030
My Lady, I heard that Young Master Ji

177
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,480
pushed Miss Si into the water.

178
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,630
What?

179
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,910
Poor Miss Si.

180
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,960
She was so unfortunate.

181
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Duke An's heir

182
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,240
pushed his fiancée

183
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,390
into the water.

184
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,750
Even the wildest rumor wouldn't say so.

185
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,240
Bring some food to the riverside.

186
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,910
The First Branch's servants are there

187
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,390
looking for her body.

188
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,600
Also, tell them to take a break

189
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,480
when they're tired.

190
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,480
They'll find the body sooner or later.

191
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,750
Is the troupe all set?

192
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,440
Aunt Xiao.

193
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,420
(Mrs. Li, Stewardess of the Second Branch)

194
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,020
Miss... Miss Si!

195
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,620
(Wife of the Second Branch)
My Lady!

196
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,460
(Ms. Xiao)
My Lady!

197
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
My goodness!

198
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,560
She... You...

199
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,920
What...?

200
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,510
You're back, Miss Si.

201
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,750
Yes, I am.

202
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,510
You must be disappointed.

203
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,550
It really is you, Si.

204
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,840
We thought

205
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,240
something bad happened to you.

206
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,550
Your father and the servants

207
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,910
are looking for you by the river.

208
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,000
Never mind. Forget that.

209
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,150
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

210
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,440
Were you too excited

211
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,750
to sleep?

212
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,550
Good heavens!

213
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,630
I can't be wronged like that.

214
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,030
Should the sky fall,

215
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,440
someone has to hold it.

216
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,790
Your father is a useless alcoholic.

217
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,270
Your brother is a good-for-nothing.

218
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,390
Your mother died when giving birth to you.

219
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,910
Things like funerals can't go wrong.

220
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,000
Only I can prepare it

221
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,150
for you.

222
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,270
He's a freeloader and loser

223
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,510
while you're a jinx who caused

224
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,350
your mother's death.

225
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,510
Motherless children like you

226
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,960
are indeed ill-mannered

227
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,870
and uncultured!

228
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,510
- Are you alright?
- My Lady.

229
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,350
I'm fine.

230
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,190
The money wasn't stolen.

231
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,320
The accountant made a mistake.

232
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,750
Still, I need to

233
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,600
teach them a lesson

234
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,320
for offending seniors.

235
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,000
They'll kneel there.

236
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,390
They can't get up.

237
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,750
My Lady!

238
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,440
Aunt Xiao,

239
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,000
there was a bug on your face.

240
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,510
Did it bite you?

241
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,630
I...

242
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,360
Use the other hand next time.

243
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,590
I...

244
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,960
The elegiac couplets,

245
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,360
the chosen tunes,

246
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,630
and the coffin for today's funeral

247
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,240
are to your taste, aren't they?

248
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,600
You know I'm a jinx.

249
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,680
You'd better stay away from me.

250
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,320
Or if something bad happens to you,

251
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,730
that'll be terrible.

252
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,790
But when that day comes,

253
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,080
I'll prepare

254
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,880
all those things you like

255
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,800
for your funeral.

256
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,680
My Lady!

257
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,870
Miss!

258
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,500
(Aman, Jiang Si's Maid)

259
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,350
Aman.

260
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,560
I'm back.

261
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,960
I'm home.

262
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,590
Come on. Let's go see my father.

263
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,000
Jiang... Jiang Si...

264
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,670
What are you looking at?

265
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,160
Get rid of these!

266
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,350
Now!

267
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,480
Your father and brother

268
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,750
are waiting by the Jinshui River.

269
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,920
They refuse to leave.

270
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,590
What are those bottles and jars

271
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,590
you just grabbed for?

272
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,000
Master went to look for you

273
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,840
with tons of servants

274
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,270
and hired all the skilled swimmers

275
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,240
in Ling'an.

276
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,240
He said he'd find you

277
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,310
at all costs.

278
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,480
But Ms. Xiao,

279
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,720
who held the key to the vault,

280
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,070
refused to pay a penny.

281
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,550
Young Master Zhan had me

282
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,270
come back to pawn some valuables

283
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,440
to gather as much money as possible.

284
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,160
Nothing here.

285
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,430
Anything over there?

286
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,480
Let me see.

287
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,240
What about the east of the bridge?

288
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,590
Nothing.

289
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,590
Look carefully.

290
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,510
Master, all of us have been looking

291
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,850
- for a day and a night.
- There.

292
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,000
There's no sign of her or her body.

293
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,040
Shall we continue?

294
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,210
Of course.

295
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,990
(Jiang Ancheng, Earl, Si's Father)
Keep going

296
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,760
(Jiang Zhan, Si's Brother)
until we find her!

297
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,510
You only paid us 10 strings of coppers.

298
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,480
That wasn't enough to pay us.

299
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,430
Father,

300
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,680
that was the only thing

301
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,810
Mother left to you.

302
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,070
It's all I have

303
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,200
at the moment.

304
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,610
I'll figure something out.

305
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,870
Look,

306
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,590
I have artworks and antiques at home.

307
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,880
They're worth some money.

308
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,830
Once we're done here,

309
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,790
go back with me to get them.

310
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,880
They're all yours.

311
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,160
Please help me find my daughter.

312
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,480
Please.

313
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,160
I can only count on you!

314
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,400
Fine. I'll do a good deed

315
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,240
for you.

316
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,350
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

317
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,880
Thank you very much!

318
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,200
Thank you all!

319
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,190
Father!

320
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,030
Brother!

321
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,870
Father!

322
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,480
Father,

323
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,240
I hear as if

324
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,750
Si is calling me.

325
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,110
How I wish that was true!

326
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,000
So do I.

327
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
My head's spinning.

328
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,000
I keep hearing Si calling me, too.

329
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,430
Brother!

330
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,880
Brother!

331
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,000
Father!

332
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,590
I see Si.

333
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,030
I also see her

334
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,920
in front of me all the time.

335
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,440
Brother, I'm here!

336
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,670
Sister!

337
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,350
When your mother passed away,

338
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,720
I kept seeing her, too.

339
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,920
Sister!

340
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,060
- Brother!
- I fear Si is unlikely to survive.

341
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,920
- Sister!
- I failed to protect her.

342
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,440
Father, it's her! It's Si!

343
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,240
Master, it really is Miss Si!

344
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,800
Father!

345
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,430
Si!

346
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,790
Is it you, Si?

347
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,630
Father!

348
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,900
- Si!
- Sister!

349
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,880
Si!

350
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,310
Si!

351
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,640
I'm fine, Father.

352
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,070
That's good. That's great.

353
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,590
Didn't you drown? Are you alright?

354
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,590
I'm good, Father.

355
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,610
I thought I'd never see you again.

356
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,610
Brother, promise me

357
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,620
- I...
- to never

358
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,070
go near the Jinshui River again.

359
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,910
I won't. I won't.

360
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,000
No, stay away from all rivers!

361
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,240
Sure, sure, I will.

362
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,240
Father, you have to promise me

363
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,750
not to go back
to the Directorate of Astronomy.

364
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,270
- Alright?
- Fine. Alright.

365
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,590
Do not work there ever again.

366
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,430
You have my word.

367
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,000
From now on,

368
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'll stay at home

369
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,640
to be with you.

370
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:47,540
(Yunmeng Inn)

371
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,880
Chief, I've checked her out.

372
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,540
Jiang Si ranks fourth

373
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,580
in Earl Dongping's Mansion.

374
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,830
Her father is Earl Dongping.

375
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,890
Her mother's family was
the richest in Lingshui.

376
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,750
She passed away

377
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,830
when Jiang Si was born.

378
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,240
Earl Dongping made a scene back then,

379
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,390
which cost him his post

380
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,400
and hereditary rank.

381
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,540
He hasn't bounced back hence.

382
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,720
That's why

383
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,000
people call

384
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,350
Jiang Si a...

385
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,760
A what?

386
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,630
Your tea.

387
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,350
A jinx

388
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,400
because of her mother's death

389
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,880
and the fall of her clan.

390
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,950
How absurd.

391
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,590
People always blame misfortune

392
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,350
on the weak and innocent.

393
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,870
What else?

394
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,400
Right now, Ms. Xiao

395
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,200
of the Second Branch is taking charge.

396
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,000
Seeing the clan falling,

397
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,070
she meant to marry her off

398
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,240
in haste to the third heir

399
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,920
of Duke An's Mansion,

400
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,000
Ji Chongyi,

401
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,070
on the 8th of next month.

402
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,560
What?

403
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,280
Cancel it?

404
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,550
Ji Chongyi cheated on me with someone else.

405
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,030
He lied to me

406
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,790
and made me almost drown to silence me.

407
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,920
How could I marry such an animal?

408
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,920
Si is right.

409
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,400
But you're fine, aren't you?

410
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,750
I know your father is mad

411
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,920
about Young Master Ji's affair.

412
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
So am I.

413
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,480
But his family is rich and powerful.

414
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,920
If you two get married,

415
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,480
you'll be his wife.

416
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,720
I won't marry him whatsoever.

417
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,150
Si,

418
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,560
I feel bad

419
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,880
for your suffering.

420
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,350
But do you know

421
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,070
how much I did

422
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,400
for this marriage?

423
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,110
I went to great lengths

424
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,720
to marry you up.

425
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,240
All the girls in town

426
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,640
are envious of you.

427
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,960
If it's that good, why not

428
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,310
marry Jiang Pei to him?

429
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,350
That's right.

430
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,110
You two siblings are ganging up on me

431
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,510
as if I'm ill-willed against you.

432
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,510
They didn't mean that.

433
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,530
Brother,

434
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,390
Si was meek

435
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,590
before she almost drowned.

436
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,000
But it seems

437
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,590
that her only good quality

438
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,880
has been washed away

439
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,720
by the Jinshui River.

440
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,560
Xiao,

441
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,960
that was uncalled for!

442
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,030
Be that as it may,

443
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,110
what I said is true.

444
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,640
Don't you want to

445
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,720
marry her up?

446
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,030
Wouldn't your wife want her
to marry a good man?

447
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,590
Were she alive,

448
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,920
she'd also marry her into Duke An's Mansion!

449
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,590
Will you marry him or not?

450
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,440
I will not.

451
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,830
Were her mother alive,

452
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,900
she'd think the same as me.

453
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,030
We just want our children

454
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,070
to lead a peaceful life.

455
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,880
I'm being respectful to you, Brother.

456
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,400
This marriage isn't up to you

457
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,270
or me.

458
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,550
When Mother comes back,

459
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,230
let her decide!

460
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,920
I dare you!

- Here.
- They're all your favorites.

Don't eat without me!

487
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,310
This is for you.

488

Roast chicken from the Guangju Restaurant.

489
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,790
It's your favorite, Si.

490
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,070
My favorite?

491
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,640
You like it more than her.

492
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,830
It's our favorite.

493
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,000
We're having this family dinner

494
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,640
for Si's safe return.

495
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,960
She'll be blessed for sure.

496
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,900
Cheers!

497
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,630
By the way,

498
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,720
after you fell,

499
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,850
who got you out of the water?

500
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,550
A stranger who happened to pass by

501
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,390
saved me.

502
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,640
We should

503
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,790
thank that person properly.

504
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,760
Of course.

505
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,040
No need, Father.

506
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,310
I didn't ask his name.

507
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,960
We won't be able to find him.

508
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,590
How come you forgot to ask his name?

509
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,750
He saved your life.

510
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,830
- You...
- Father,

511
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,880
she must've been too terrified to ask.

512
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,590
Si,

513
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,430
are you sure

514
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,830
that you'll cancel your engagement?

515
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,000
Father,

516
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,110
Ji Chongyi cheated on me with another girl.

517
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,550
He betrayed me.

518
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,950
Besides,

519
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,160
he showed no respect

520
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,830
for our engagement at all.

521
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,750
How could I lower myself to marry him

522
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,480
and suffer a lifetime

523
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,160
of misery?

524
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,830
Don't marry him then.

525
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,750
That pig

526
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,070
doesn't deserve you at all.

527
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,760
Sister,

528
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,030
whatever you do,

529
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,060
I'll always have your back.

530
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,510
I'll go to Duke An's Mansion tomorrow

531
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,960
to return their betrothal gifts.

532
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,510
Mrs. Li, let's hear it.

533
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,580
Yes.

534
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,920
A pair of filigree gold hairpins.

535
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,160
300 bolts of silk.

536
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,640
(Jiang Pei)
A phoenix-head ewer with pearl patterns

537
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,360
(Si's 5th Cousin)
and beast-face patterns.

538
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:13,920
An amphora

539
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,030
with lotus patterns.

540
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,000
5,000 taels of silver.

541
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,350
200 taels of gold.

542
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,760
Mother,

543
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,880
look at these valuables.

544
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,830
Were I the one to get married,

545
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,270
all of them would be yours.

546
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,310
You wouldn't need

547
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,150
that nasty Jiang Si.

548
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,390
Whoever it is,

549
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,000
these are mine.

550
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
Pei,

551
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,400
don't be so cheap.

552
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,270
To marry yourself up,

553
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,200
you have to improve in all areas.

554
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,830
No wonder Jiang Si

555
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,060
outshines you.

556
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,480
Yes.

557
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,270
Lesson learned, Mother.

558
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
Speaking of her,

559
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,310
do you notice that she's changed

560
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,750
since she almost drowned?

561
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,270
She wouldn't dare talk back

562
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,110
to you in the past.

563
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,270
A naive girl like her

564
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,590
can't do too much.

565
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,800
Let her be.

566
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,480
Mrs. Li,

567
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,880
put them away

568
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,160
in a secret place.

569
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,160
Without the betrothal gifts,

570
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,480
let's see if she can cancel the engagement.

571
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,270
Father, Sister,

572
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,830
I've thought it over.

573
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,860
Tomorrow, the Tournament

574
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,590
held once
every three years will begin.

575
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,550
Tri-ministries will select officials there.

576
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,590
If I win,

577
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,640
I'll be the Commandant

578
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,980
of the Capital Security Office.

579
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,760
Then

580
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,070
I'll move out with you two.

581
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,040
We'll be out of Aunt Xiao's control.

582
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,590
Good boy.

583
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,750
You've grown up.

584
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,640
But you can't go.

585
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,160
Why?

586
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,480
Don't you know how weak you are?

587
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,960
The Tournament

588
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,480
isn't a joke.

589
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
- I...
- It's easy to join it but hard to

590
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,790
- make it out alive.
- Si...

591
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,630
I agree with Father.

592
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,310
You cannot go, Brother.

593
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,480
It sounds perilous.

594
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,320
I...

595
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,920
It's settled.

596
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,550
Don't bring it up ever again.

597
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,030
Father, why didn't you eat the chicken foot

598
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,920
on your plate?

599
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,020
Don't change the subject.

600
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,830
Did you hear

601
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,670
what I just said?

602
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,350
The palm in the middle tastes the best.

603
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,160
Listen, if you go,

604
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,670
I'll break your legs when you get back.

605
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,640
Foodies love to eat chicken feet.

606
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,350
The more you nibble,
the better they taste.

607
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,590
Why aren't you eating them?

608
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,110
I've got a drumstick.

609
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,160
So I can only eat the feet?

610
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,030
(Father, Brother,)

611
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,160
(it's so good)

612
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,350
(to see you again.)

613
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,280
(Thankfully,)

614
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,760
(it's not too late.)

615
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,200
(Father, Brother,)

616
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,480
(this time, I'll protect you)

617
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,310
(by all means.)

618
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,460
(Zhou)

619
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:44,460
(Grill Ground)

620
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:53,460
(Fight)

621
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,320
General Cui.

622
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,240
Marquis.

623
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,160
- Please.
- Please.

624
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,460
(Cao Yong, Marquis Changxing)

625
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,460
(Cui Xu, Bulwark-general of the State)

626
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,880
Xingyu, step forward.

627
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,110
Greet General Cui.

628
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,940
(Cao Xingyu, Marquis Changxing's Heir)
Greetings, General.

629
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,310
You'll have a lot to learn from him

630
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,510
in the Capital Security Office.

631
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,200
Thanks in advance, General.

632
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,160
The Tournament this year

633
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,000
sets no rules or regulations.

634
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,960
If one falls from the platform,

635
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,350
he'll lose.

636
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,240
The ultimate winner

637
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,070
will be the new Commandant

638
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,350
of the Capital Security Office.

639
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,590
Begin!

640
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,720
(Father, Sister,)

641
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,400
(wait and see.)

642
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,310
(I'll win for sure.)

643
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,070
Yes!

644
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,910
Good!

645
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,390
Fall now.

646
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,160
Good job!

647
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,270
Nice!

648
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,000
Chief, Zheng is here as expected.

649
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,530
I'll separate him from others.

650
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,740
(Zheng Ming, Inspector-general)

651
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,840
Excuse me.

652
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,440
- Coming through.
- Excuse me.

653
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,640
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me!

654
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,480
Excuse me!

655
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,800
Brother!

656
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,560
Sister!

657
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,440
Brother!

658
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,390
Did you see that?

659
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,160
A piece of cake.

660
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,590
Ji,

661
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,510
when did Zhan become so skilled?

662
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,270
He paid those guys to lose.

663
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,440
Don't worry, Miss Si.

664
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,830
Next.

665
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,920
Go, Brother!

666
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:54,140
(Palace Security Office)

667
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,630
Please excuse me.

668
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:21,950
Sure.

669
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,030
General Zheng.

670
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,640
Sorry.

671
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,190
Now, I should call you

672
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,110
Inspector-general Zheng.

673
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,160
How have you been?

674
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,760
Long time no see, Mr. Yu.

675
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,510
When did you arrive in Ling'an

676
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,440
unannounced?

677
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,520
I could've picked you up.

678
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,280
Zheng Ming,

679
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,480
what is it like to rise high

680
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,480
at the cost of your comrades' lives,

681
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,030
huh?

682
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,140
(The South)

683
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,840
Bring it on!

684
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,550
Remember the Battle of the Longgu Pass?

685
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,960
Hadn't you leaked intelligence

686
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,800
to Nanwu,

687
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,380
my deputy

688
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,580
(Xue Qiang, Deputy of Chiyu Cavalry)
wouldn't have died.

689
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,480
You must be joking, General Yu.

690
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

691
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,550
Go on!

692
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,790
Good!

693
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,590
Brother-in-law, you...

694
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,840
Recognize this?

695
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,350
It's

696
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,190
the totem of Nanwu's Saintess.

697
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,590
Nanwu's Saintess?

698
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,710
Nanwu believes

699
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,280
the Saintess appears, Nanwu thrives.

700
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,480
Dazhou will be theirs.

701
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,580
They set up the Nightingale Division

702
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,300
to look for her.

703
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,910
But over the past few years,

704
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,300
they've found nothing.

705
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,150
That's all I know.

706
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,070
Please spare me, gentlemen.

707
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,590
Spare you?

708
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,400
So many soldiers died because of you.

709
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,360
Did you spare them

710
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,590
back then?

711
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,550
Brother!

712
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,000
Brother!

713
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:21,960
Brother!

714
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,110
No!

715
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,200
Stop!

716
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,280
Brother!

717
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,030
Who was it?

718
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,070
(Yu Qi?)

719
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,880
(What's he doing here?)

720
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,230
What a busybody.

721
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,840
You're dead!

722
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,800
How dare he break in!

723
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,030
Guards, seize him!

724
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,190
He already fell.

725
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,550
Some win, some lose.

726
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,440
Your son did his best.

727
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,280
Are you alright?

728
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,280
Hold on.

729
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,800
I'm here to announce

730
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,120
that the winner of the Tournament this year

731
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,590
is this young man.

732
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,730
Not only is he skilled

733
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,600
but he's also noble.

734
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,000
Talents like him

735
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,800
are exactly what our state needs.

736
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,770
May I know your name?

737
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,290
Will you be the Commandant

738
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,590
of the Capital Security Office

739
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,280
to keep Ling'an safe?

740
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,340
I'm Yu Qi.

741
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,890
I helped him not to be an official,

742
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,140
but I did disrupt

743
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,080
the Tournament

744
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,140
and the selection of the Commandant.

745
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,980
I feel guilty about it.

746
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,660
I'm willing to fill the vacancy

747
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,860
until you find the best candidate.

748
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,100
Very well!

749
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,420
Yes! Great!

750
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,940
(They've never met before.)

751
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,700
(Why did Yu Qi help my brother?)

752
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,300
(Seeing him in Ling'an)

753
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,190
(and become the Commandant,)

754
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,180
(I wonder)

755
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,140
(what changed everything.)

756
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,050
Good!

757
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,380
Thank you, Yu Qi.

758
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,660
I'll bow to you.

759
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,700
No need.

760
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,500
Don't tear your injuries.

761
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,300
Mr. Yu,

762
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,690
we're from Earl Dongping's Mansion.

763
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:42,900
I'm Jiang Zhan.

764
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,780
This is my younger sister,

765
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,100
Jiang Si.

766
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,900
Greetings, Miss Jiang.

767
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,940
Where are you staying, Mr. Yu?

768
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,770
I'll visit you and thank you later.

769
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,620
I just arrived without an abode.

770
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,460
Why don't you stay at our place?

771
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,100
Brother,

772
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,700
he must've come to Ling'an

773
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,860
for important business.

774
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,060
It's rude to make decisions for him.

775
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,940
My apologies.

776
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,260
It's fine, Miss Jiang.

777
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,180
I'm new here.

778
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,460
I don't know

779
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,660
where I can buy a house.

780
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,140
You've found the right person.

781
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,020
The residence next to our mansion

782
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,420
happens to be vacant...

783
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,290
There are tons of them

784
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,660
in town for rent or sale,

785
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,860
such as those in the further western suburbs.

786
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,060
If those ones are far,

787
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,460
there are some on the south side

788
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,300
close to shops.

789
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,660
Thanks, Miss Jiang.

790
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,820
Those she said are way too far.

791
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,220
The one next to our mansion

792
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,180
is available.

793
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,520
If you live there, we can

794
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,380
see each other often.

795
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,460
Mr. Yu,

796
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,980
where did you come from?

797
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,020
The South, Yangui.

798
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,700
Yangui lies at the southern border

799
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,660
right next to Nanwu.

800
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,370
It's really beautiful.

801
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,260
Has any of you been there?

802
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,180
(Yangui)

803
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,020
Yangui is so beautiful.

804
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,660
I've never seen

805
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,620
such breathtaking views in my hometown.

806
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,720
There's a lot more for you to discover.

807
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,660
We'll explore all of them

808
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:12,860
together.

809
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,140
(Hadn't I ended up in the South,)

810
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,140
(we wouldn't have met.)

811
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:23,900
(He once said he had)

812
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,060
(never returned to Ling'an.)

813
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,500
(Was that a lie?)

814
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,380
The two of us

815
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,940
haven't even gone out of town once.

816
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,180
(That matches Long Dan's findings.)

817
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,100
(But if she never went to the South,)

818
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,620
(how did she become Nanwu's Saintess?)

819
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,820
The South is far away.

820
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,260
Even if my sister went there,

821
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,580
she'd cry and scream halfway,

822
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,260
insisting on coming back.

823
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,900
Brother, you're injured.

824
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,020
Let's go home.

825
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,860
You need to rest.

826
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,260
- I...
- See you.

827
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,660
Good day.

828
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,380
See you, Mr. Yu.

829
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,980
Do come and visit me.

830
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,660
I think he and I are

831
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,260
meant to be friends.

832
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,660
Did you see

833
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,530
that he was interested in everything I said?

834
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,540
We're like-minded. That's rare.

835
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,660
Sister, why did I feel

836
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,700
you were eager to get rid of him?

837
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,780
I meant to

838
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,820
invite him to our place someday.

839
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,460
Brother, we'd better

840
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,140
not get too close to him.

841
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,660
Why?

842
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,700
Hadn't it been for him just now,

843
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,780
the two of us

844
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,620
would've died.

845
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,780
I know,

846
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,820
but we barely know him.

847
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,300
It's best to be cautious.

848
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,420
Pack up everything.

849
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,100
Are we going back to Yangui?

850
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:35,900
We're staying here.

851
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,140
Chief,

852
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,660
it's quite risky to return

853
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,860
without permission.

854
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,980
All those Chiyu Cavalrymen

855
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,950
are still waiting for us.

856
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,020
I think we should go back.

857
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,020
Chief!

858
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,100
I've got new leads

859
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,940
and seen the Saintess's Totem.

860
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,660
I can't leave now.

861
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:05,100
