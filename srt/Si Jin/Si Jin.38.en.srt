00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,120
Princess Royal Rong Yang

192
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,240
shall be the regent for the time being.

193
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,920
Dear subjects, please assist her

194
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,400
and create a prosperous era together.

195
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,080
The decree will be carried out.

196
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,600
A female ruler?

197
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,320
This is outrageous.

198
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,080
That's right. It's against the law.

199
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,560
Aunt, how come Father is sick?

200
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,080
Why did I have no idea about it at all?

201
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,680
You have to ask yourself

202
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,200
why His Majesty only sought my help

203
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,200
at such moments.

204
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,640
Your Highness,

205
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,280
what kind of illness
has His Majesty been diagnosed with?

206
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,680
The Nanwu troops
are pressuring our borders.

207
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,040
And, the Nanwu Saintess has disrupted
the order of the court.

208
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,800
His Majesty was consumed by rage.

209
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,720
He fell ill due to his worries.

210
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,280
May I check the decree?

211
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,120
Such audacity!

212
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,640
How dare you doubt His Majesty?

213
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,960
This is a sudden event.

214
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,040
I need to confirm

215
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,960
His Majesty's will

216
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,320
before obeying his order.

217
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,600
Royal Guards!

218
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,240
I will obey His Majesty's decree

219
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,640
and assist Her Highness
with everything I have.

220
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,320
The matter of appointing a regent
is indeed of great importance.

221
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,840
His Majesty would only entrust it

222
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,040
to the one he trusts the most.

223
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,920
And that is Her Highness.

224
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,400
I shall comply
with His Majesty's decree.

225
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,640
Zhang!

226
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,160
I shall submit to His Majesty's command.

227
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,800
I am dutifully bound
to His Majesty's edict.

228
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,920
I shall adhere unwaveringly
to His Majesty's orders.

229
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,960
I will faithfully conform
to His Majesty's directive.

230
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,920
Your Majesty,

231
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,680
is Her Highness

232
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,640
trying to usurp the throne?

233
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,120
I don't think Rong Yang
harbors such intentions.

234
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,000
But the Marquis of Changxing

235
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,440
has wild ambitions.

236
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,080
The tension will surely intensify.

237
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,920
If I keep the imperial jade seal
with me,

238
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,720
the realm will fall

239
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,080
once they get their hands on it.

240
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,840
Therefore, instruct Xiaochengzi

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,560
to hand the real one

242
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,560
to Zhen Heng in secret.

243
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,360
I assume

244
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,360
Jin will receive the seal soon.

245
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,480
Your Majesty, do you trust

246
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,600
Prince Yan that much?

247
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,560
I

248
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,360
do not misjudge people.

249
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,000
Where's Prince Yan?

250
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,120
Your Highness,

251
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,040
Prince Yan isn't present today.

252
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,200
He has been absent for some time.

253
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,240
Seems like he has escaped Ling'an

254
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,440
together with Jiang Si.

255
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,560
Cao Yong, Marquis of Changxing,
relay my order.

256
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,600
Yes, Your Highness.

257
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,600
Prince Yan

258
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,120
aided Jiang Si, the Nanwu Saintess,
in escaping from prison.

259
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,520
He has fled from punishment.
Arrest him immediately.

260
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,400
I will interrogate him myself.

261
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,320
Yes, Your Highness.

262
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,840
Aunt?

263
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,520
What crime have I committed?

264
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,200
Here you are.

265
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,320
Where's Jiang Si?

266
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,840
Isn't she in prison?

267
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,400
Prince Yan, since you're here,

268
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,000
it'll save me from making a trip.

269
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,920
Someone. Arrest Prince Yan.

270
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,520
How dare you!

271
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,240
Aunt,

272
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,240
he's going to commit insubordination

273
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,760
in front of your eyes.

274
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,480
Such audacity!

275
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,360
I understand now.

276
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,080
Aunt, you're acting as a regent.

277
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,120
But Cao Yong

278
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,080
intends

279
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,880
to kill your nephew.

280
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,240
I dare not do so!

281
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,880
No one dares to touch you

282
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,840
when I'm around.

283
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,480
As long as

284
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,280
you don't collude
with the Nanwu Saintess,

285
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,400
no one will dare

286
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,640
to make things difficult for you.

287
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,240
Yes, Aunt.

288
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,800
[Tiande Hall]

289
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,160
Mr. Zhen, is that you?

290
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,760
Your Highness, it's me.

291
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,960
Mr. Zhen, Aunt...

292
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,720
The Princess Royal has rebelled.

293
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,960
A rebellion?

294
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,360
How is His Majesty, then?

295
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,480
I don't know.

296
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,880
The Gale Guards

297
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,160
have surrounded Father's palace.

298
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,720
The imperial palace
is filled with troops.

299
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,160
The Imperial Insignia Guards
are usually the ones on duty.

300
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:28,920
Why

301
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
are the Gale Guards on duty today?

302
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,360
[Funing Palace]
Your Highness,

303
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,800
it was all arranged by His Majesty.

304
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,120
We were just following orders.

305
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,680
Is that so?

306
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,720
Your Highness!

307
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,600
Your Highness.

308
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,840
His Majesty has issued a decree.

309
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,480
He's not seeing anyone today.

310
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,920
Why can't we see His Majesty

311
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,880
if he's merely sick?

312
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,440
Even if the officials can't see him,

313
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,800
can't his sons

314
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,520
see him?

315
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,640
Father, I seek an audience with you.

316
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,680
I request an audience, Father.

317
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,319
Your Highness!

318
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,400
What's with the commotion out there?

319
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,119
I think I heard

320
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,520
Lang and Zhang.

321
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,000
Why are you putting us on the spot?

322
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,160
Seems like His Majesty is truly sick.

323
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,920
Mr. Han,

324
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,160
keep guard over here.

325
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,160
Do not let anyone

326
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,480
interrupt His Majesty's rest.

327
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,230
[Funing Palace]

328
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,880
Your Majesty,

329
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,880
they wish to see you.

330
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,520
But suddenly, there's no news of them.

331
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,560
Were they stopped by the guards?

332
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,480
Your Majesty.

333
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,440
Do you want me

334
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,440
to deliver a secret message
to the princes?

335
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,680
Do you think Rong Yang

336
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,840
is that easy to deal with?

337
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,360
I'm afraid that you might be gone

338
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,520
before the letter is delivered.

339
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,000
Zhang, I wonder

340
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,480
when you've established
an alliance with the Princess Royal.

341
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,040
Now, you're even disregarding

342
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,640
Father's life.

343
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,760
I assume

344
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,560
Aunt has promised you
considerable benefits.

345
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,160
For example, helping you
to ascend the throne.

346
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,320
Such words are sheer treason.

347
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,720
Your Highness,

348
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,040
you should stop saying things like that.

349
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,760
Zhang.

350
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,280
Father's current predicament

351
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,560
won't do us any good.

352
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,720
The best solution is for us

353
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,840
to join hands

354
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,520
and rescue Father.

355
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,720
Father said he was sick.

356
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,760
Aunt has devoted herself
to serving the realm.

357
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,040
She's even more dutiful than us

358
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,920
even though we're Father's sons.

359
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,560
But Your Highness,

360
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,120
you suspect Aunt
for harboring an ulterior motive.

361
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,440
Please pardon me
as I cannot agree with you.

362
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,320
So, Prince Qi joined Aunt

363
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,360
long ago.

364
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,800
If that's the case,

365
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,360
I won't be soft-hearted.

366
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,320
The Crown Prince tried
to persuade Prince Qi

367
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,280
to deal with you together.

368
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,400
But Prince Qi rejected him

369
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,040
and supported your role as a regent.

370
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,000
He was always great
at assessing situations.

371
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,000
He and His Majesty

372
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,720
only had a superficial connection.

373
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,000
To protect himself,

374
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,920
he'd never risk himself for the Emperor.

375
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,720
But it's different for the Crown Prince.

376
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,000
Guess what he'll do.

377
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,280
Tell him to come

378
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,080
and have a meal with me tomorrow.

379
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,800
I want to see

380
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,640
how long he can struggle.

381
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,120
Chuchu, you and Si should leave first.

382
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,440
Du'er and I will guard the rear.

383
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,400
We'll split up

384
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,240
and meet at the Southern Frontier.

385
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,480
Don't worry.

386
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,120
We'll be leaving now.

387
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,120
Let's go.

388
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,600
Zhan.

389
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,600
Take care.

390
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,680
Let's go.

391
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,000
How's Father's condition?

392
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,760
Princess Fuqing said

393
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,760
His Majesty has been detained.

394
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,280
Right now, the most important thing

395
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:43,880
is

396
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,520
to come up with a way
to rescue His Majesty.

397
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,720
Now, the Imperial Insignia Guards

398
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,760
have been swapped out.

399
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,840
Only the Royal Guards, the Gale Guards,

400
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,840
and the Marquis of Changxing's troops
are inside the palace.

401
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,760
We're outnumbered.

402
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,280
If we barge in recklessly,

403
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,960
not only will we not be able
to rescue His Majesty,

404
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,680
but it might also backfire on us.

405
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,840
You're right.

406
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,920
No one in Ling'an City

407
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,120
dares oppose the Princess Royal now.

408
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I received an urgent message
from the front.

409
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,160
Nanwu has invaded Zhou.

410
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,440
Many cities

411
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,400
were already under their attack.

412
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,520
This is my first time
acting as a regent.

413
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,880
At such critical moments.

414
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,200
Perhaps this is the time

415
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,720
for me to establish my authority.

416
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,640
Marquis, do you have
any great solutions?

417
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,680
Your Highness.

418
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,040
According to my knowledge,

419
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,840
they're attacking us

420
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,480
because of the Saintess.

421
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,880
If we're able to capture her,

422
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,200
we'll be able

423
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,560
to deal with the invasion of Nanwu.

424
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,760
Notify all keeps

425
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,200
to strictly inspect all personnel.

426
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,040
We must find her as soon as possible.

427
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,160
If anyone can still topple
the Marquis of Changxing,

428
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,600
and turn the tide,

429
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,960
it rests with one person alone.

430
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,360
Cui Xu?

431
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,000
That's right.

432
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,200
But Mr. Cui

433
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,280
is the Princess Royal's husband.

434
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,680
Will he help us out?

435
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,720
Mr. Cui

436
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,280
is a loyal subject of the realm.

437
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,200
He would never join

438
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,320
the corrupt ranks of her.

439
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
Where is he housing his troops?

440
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,760
Yanxi Military Camp.

441
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,320
Deliver a message
to the Red Plume Cavalry.

442
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,240
Ask them to receive us.

443
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,640
We'll head for Mr. Cui's main camp.

444
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,600
Yes, sir!

445
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,960
You all have to be careful too.

446
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,920
If we can come up with this idea,

447
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,480
I'm sure the Marquis of Changxing

448
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,440
and the Princess Royal can too.

449
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,520
Once they discover

450
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,240
your tracks,

451
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,400
they'll send their men after you.

452
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,280
The Princess Royal wants
to establish her authority now.

453
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,360
She'll target the ministers.

454
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,560
You're in a lot of danger now.

455
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,760
Why don't you come with me?

456
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,680
The imperial palace
is filled with troops.

457
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,600
I'm scared.

458
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,760
Your Highness, don't be scared.

459
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,040
I'll come up with a solution.

460
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,800
If anything happens in the palace,

461
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,400
you can fly the kite.

462
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,240
If I see it,

463
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,480
I'll come and find you.

464
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,440
You must be careful.

465
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,760
Your Highness,

466
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,640
I'll remain in Ling'an.

467
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Her Majesty and Princess Fuqing

468
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,320
are still in the palace.

469
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,360
Someone has to deal with Princess Royal.

470
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,160
It's also more convenient
for me to receive you

471
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,520
when you return.

472
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,640
All right.

473
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,160
Take care.

474
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,960
If possible,

475
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,680
try and probe

476
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,880
the Crown Prince and Prince Qi's stance.

477
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,480
We might be able

478
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,200
to get another ally
against this formidable foe.

479
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,280
Go.

480
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,280
Zhan, what should we do?

481
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,080
Don't fall behind.

482
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,000
She's suspicious.

483
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,800
Stop her!

484
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,160
That's the Nanwu Saintess!

485
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
Hurry and go after her!

486
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
Give chase! Quickly!

487
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,760
Move fast! Stop right there!

488
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,600
Jiang Si.

489
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,000
How are you feeling?

490
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,280
I'm fine.

491
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,880
We need to get there
as soon as possible.

492
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,480
I'll get some water.

493
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,360
It doesn't look like them.

494
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,520
Forget it. Let's go.

495
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,320
Your Highness,

496
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,120
there are reports from the common folks.

497
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:45,960
They said

498
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,320
they saw someone
resembling the Nanwu Saintess

499
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,280
heading to the South.

500
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,120
The Southern Frontier.

501
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,200
I'm sure they're heading there.

502
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,920
Prince Yan can mobilize
the Red Plume Cavalry.

503
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,160
Cui Xu's army is there as well.

504
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,720
Jiang Si

505
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,000
can rally the Nanwu people too.

506
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
Do they think

507
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,160
they can win against me like this?

508
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,440
Shijiu, issue an imperial decree.

509
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,520
Order the Red Plume Cavalry
and Cui Xu's army

510
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,000
to storm into Nanwu
and fight to the death.

511
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,520
They shall not return

512
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,280
until Nanwu is eradicated.

513
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,000
His Majesty has issued
a decree for my capture.

514
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,480
I wonder how my family

515
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,040
is doing.

516
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,600
Will they be implicated?

517
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,480
I don't know

518
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,840
if Zhan and the rest are doing well.

519
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,200
Will they be pursued?

520
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,280
No one is chasing us

521
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,280
along the way.

522
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,480
I don't think they'll meet any.

523
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
I hope so.

524
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,080
May all go well.

525
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,200
It will.

526
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,800

00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,000
we'll reach Yangui

539
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,680
after crossing the mountain ahead.

540
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,600
Can you still go on?

541
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,280
I'm fine.

542
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,280
We have no time to waste. Let's go.

543
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,870
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

544
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,280
Your Highness.

545
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,520
The Crown Princess and the young prince

546
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,640
have been sent to their hometown.

547
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,840
All of you

548
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,840
are elite suicide warriors chosen by me.

549
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,600
Tomorrow's our only chance.

550
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
We have to risk it all.

551
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,320
Enter the palace with me

552
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,520
under the guise of musicians.

553
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,280
- Yes, Your Highness!
- Yes, Your Highness!

554
00:27:59,480 --> 00:27:59,880
Your Highness,

555
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,280
we couldn't find Yu Jin.

556
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,360
If so,

557
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,360
send more men to achieve the task.

558
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,120
Find him

559
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,040
by hook or by crook.

560
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:08,720
Yes, Your Highness.

561
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,360
Your Highness,

562
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,400
the Crown Prince seeks an audience.

563
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,240
Let him in.

564
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,720
Greetings, Aunt.

565
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,600
Your Highness,

566
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,640
what is this?

567
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,440
Aunt,

568
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
these are the musicians

569
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,720
I've gathered.

570
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,280
All of them are excellent professionals.

571
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,080
A few days ago,

572
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,920
I said something inappropriate

573
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,120
in court

574
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,680
because I was worried about Father.

575
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,840
Aunt, I realize I may have offended you.

576
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
I've come to offer my apologies.

577
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,960
Under your rule,

578
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,840
Zhou will

579
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,240
prosper.

580
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,120
You're sensible indeed.

581
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,320
Take your seat.

582
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,440
Lang.

583
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,040
What do you think about my role

584
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,440
as the state regent?

585
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,240
I wish

586
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,600
to hear your true opinion.

587
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,400
I disagreed

588
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,960
with the way you acted.

589
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,240
Logically speaking,

590
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,960
I should be the regent.

591
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,440
Are those your heartfelt words?

592
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,960
Aunt, please don't get me wrong.

593
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,720
I understood

594
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,000
your efforts soon after.

595
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,440
That's why I came here
to apologize to you.

596
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,120
I knew that I wasn't capable enough.

597
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,040
If something happens,

598
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,800
Father will punish me.

599
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,480
Most importantly,

600
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,000
Aunt, you did so

601
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,560
for my own good.

602
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,120
I still have much to learn.

603
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,920
I'm glad you understand that.

604
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,480
Aunt, you've devoted yourself
to the realm.

605
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,320
Let me offer you a toast.

606
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,840
Your Majesty.

607
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:08,880
Speak.

608
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,720
What's wrong?

609
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,840
Father is in danger.

610
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,360
You don't intend to help me
ascend the throne.

611
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,080
And, you even killed my mother.

612
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,480
I'm going to avenge her!

613
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,440
The Princess Royal

614
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,120
has killed the Crown Prince!

615
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,840
Greetings, Your Highness.

616
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,400
I've canceled
this morning's court session.

617
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,760
I heard

618
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,880
that someone gathered the officials

619
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,520
and impeached me together.

620
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,400
You've devoted yourself wholeheartedly
to Zhou's well-being.

621
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,360
How could we let those fools

622
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,200
slander you?

623
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,680
Logically speaking,

624
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,120
you should wish for me

625
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,200
to retain power over the court

626
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,840
so that I can help you
ascend the throne.

627
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,360
But now,

628
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,800
those old fools

629
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,560
are making my head hurt.

630
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,120
I need

631
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
a strong hand

632
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,040
to help me keep them under control.

633
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,600
Prince Qi, you're a prince.

634
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,440
It all falls on you

635
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,440
whether or not
you're willing to do me this favor.

636
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,000
Aunt, it's only fitting and proper
for you to act as regent.

637
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,320
I shall serve you
with everything I have.

638
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,520
Very well.

639
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,920
Relay my message.

640
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,240
Last night, the Crown Prince
suddenly rebelled.

641
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,040
I've already sentenced him to death.

642
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,040
He shall serve as my example.

643
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,000
I'll swear loyalty to you alone!

644
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,200
Zhang, you're a smart man.

645
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,720
You should know what to do.

646
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,640
I understand.

647
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,720
I heard

648
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,800
that Prince Qi
has joined the Princess Royal.

649
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,400
What about Jin?

650
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
Prince Yan

651
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,240
has left Ling'an overnight.

652
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,840
Seems like

653
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,240
there's only one man in the entire Zhou

654
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,400
who can stand against Rong Yang.

655
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,080
Your Majesty,
are you referring to Mr. Cui?

656
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,320
Will Prince Yan and Mr. Cui

657
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,880
join hands and come to the court's aid?

658
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,170
[Yangui]

659
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,170
[Zhou]

660
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,520
Mr. Yu, welcome back.

661
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,440
All of you, rise.

662
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,440
Chief, what took you so long?

663
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,800
Are our brothers okay?

664
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,600
I gathered our brothers

665
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,000
upon receiving your letter.

666
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:13,840
We've been training every day.

667
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,520
[Leng Ying from Red Plume Cavalry]
Our men are strong and ready to go.

668
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,520
We were just waiting for you.

669
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,560
How's the situation in Nanwu?

670
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm afraid they're raring to act.

671
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,600
Dear!

672
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,280
Something cropped up in the palace.

673
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,320
Your Highness.

674
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,840
Mr. Zhen Heng seeks an audience.

675
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,920
Mr. Zhen, you're visiting me
at this late hour.

676
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
What do you need?

677
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,800
Your Highness.

678
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,120
The Crown Prince

679
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,160
has already been killed
by the Princess Royal.

680
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,040
I was one step too late.

681
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,360
For this reason, today,

682
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,400
I implore Your Highness

683
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,160
to help rescue His Majesty.

684
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,400
His Majesty only said he was sick.

685
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,320
Why do we need to save him?

686
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,480
Is His Majesty gravely ill?

687
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,800
Your Highness,

688
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,880
you may drop the pretense now.

689
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,400
I believe

690
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,360
you don't intend

691
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,720
to join the Princess Royal's corruption.

692
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,240
Or

693
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,360
to ascend the throne.

694
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,440
How dare you speculate on my intentions?

695
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,280
Your Highness,
the realm can't exist without a ruler.

696
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,440
The Crown Prince is dead.

697
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,680
And Prince Qi

698
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,560
isn't entirely loyal or dependable.

699
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,520
Even if he has joined your side,

700
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,960
he still has a mother.

701
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,040
If you do help him ascend the throne,

702
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,240
it'll be difficult for you

703
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,080
to make him a figurehead

704
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,160
and pull the strings from behind.

705
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,600
Your Highness,

706
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,880
are you truly satisfied

707
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,240
with the power of a regent?

708
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,720
Please pardon me for being frank.

709
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,840
Your Highness, why don't you
claim the throne for yourself?

710
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,200
If this drags on,

711
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,240
if the court officials turn against us

712
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,960
and force you
to step down from the throne,

713
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,320
we'll be done for by then.

714
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,920
You're right.

715
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,560
I've already lost everything.

716
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,160
I can't just wait for my demise.

717
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,920
Why can't I

718
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,200
be a true ruler?

719
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,200
Rong Yang.

720
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,680
You said you did this

721
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,000
to avenge Mingyue.

722
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,840
Now, you just want

723
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,000
to steal my throne.

724
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,480
You can think whatever you like.

725
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,200
At this point,

726
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,400
you better sign this decree

727
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,880
and hand over the jade seal.

728
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,600
You do know

729
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,360
that my patience is limited.

730
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,760
I'll go to Mr. Cui later

731
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,880
and discuss the rescue plan
for His Majesty.

732
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,680
You should rest here.

733
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,240
When I entered the city gate,

734
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,880
I realized that the Red Plume Cavalry

735
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,040
were all on high alert.

736
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,360
Moreover, there are traces

737
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,080
of Nanwu fire projectiles in the city.

738
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,880
I think the Nanwu people

739
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,520
are ready

740
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,440
to launch an invasion.

741
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,640
Under such circumstances,

742
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,760
Mr. Cui would never

743
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,480
give up on the frontiers

744
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,760
just to rescue His Majesty with you.

745
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,440
Our only hope is for Nanwu

746
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,920
to withdraw their troops.

747
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,280
No matter how difficult it is,

748
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,200
I still have to give it a try.

749
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,600
Jiang!

750
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:34,720
Jiang!

751
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,640
Chuchu!

752
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,640
Zhan?

753
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,600
Chuchu.

754
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,560
Jiang Zhan.

755
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,120
Zhan, hurry.

756
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,160
Have some water.

757
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,040
What happened?

758
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,880
Si...

759
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,640
It's all my fault.

760
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,680
I failed to save them.

761
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,840
Zhan, what are you saying?

762
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,760
What do you mean?

763
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,480
Aman and Du'er...

764
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,000
They're dead.

765
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,360
Aman?

766
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,120
How could that be?

767
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,880
Why would Aman

768
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,920
be together with you all?

769
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,880
Didn't I tell her to leave first?

770
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,880
Aman lied to you.

771
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,000
Let's proceed with the original plan.

772
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,840
We'll split up and rendezvous
at the Southern Frontier.

773
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,760
Mr. Zhan!

774
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,400
Aman?

775
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,960
Didn't Si tell you to leave?

776
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,600
I'll leave with you.

777
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,360
Why are you wearing Si's outfit?

778
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,040
This is my idea.

779
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,320
This way,

780
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,240
Miss Si and the rest will be safe.

781
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,600
But Aman...

782
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,160
Mr. Zhan.

783
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,000
I've already made up my mind.

784
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,720
Mr. Zhan, what should we do?

785
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,440
Aman, don't fall behind.

786
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:10,760
Fire!

787
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,440
Watch out!

788
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,360
Run!

789
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:18,880
Run with him!

790
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,320
You'd better surrender!

791
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,560
Fire!

792
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,720
No!

793
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,200
Du'er!

794
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,120
Under Her Highness' order,

795
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,080
we are to capture the Saintess alive!

796
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,320
I would've starved to death
on the streets

797
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,600
if it hadn't been for Miss Si.

798
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,400
Today,

799
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
I can finally repay her kindness.

800
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,440
I won't let you all capture me!

801
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,240
Jiang Si, pull yourself together.

802
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,080
Don't forget.

803
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,000
Now, you're the Nanwu Saintess.

804
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,720
They risked their lives

805
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,640
for you to get here.

806
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,280
Nanwu is right ahead.

807
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,720
Are you going to give up now?
