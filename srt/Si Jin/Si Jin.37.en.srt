00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,670
No secret art of Nanwu was involved.

212
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,030
Si was able

213
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,080
to cure my eyes

214
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,630
after finding a folk prescription

215
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,270
in a folk remedy manual.

216
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,440
She fetched the herbs
from the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

217
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,080
Your Highness,

218
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,080
do not let the witch bewitch you.

219
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,750
No secret art of Nanwu was involved?

220
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,790
All these years,

221
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,000
the imperial physicians

222
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
and miracle healers
from all over the world

223
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,120
couldn't cure your condition.

224
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Isn't it too much of a coincidence?

225
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,080
Marquis of Changxing,
don't you understand the meaning

226
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
of a fortunate coincidence?

227
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,120
Or do the two offices conduct the trial

228
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,120
based on mere speculation?

229
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,790
Fuqing.

230
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,270
Today, the two officers in charge
of the trial are here.

231
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,150
I must say a fair word

232
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,360
in defense of Princess Consort Yan.

233
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,390
She's kind, warm-hearted,

234
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,960
and perceptive.

235
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,320
You can't just convict her

236
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,120
because of her identity.

237
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,080
Without evidence,

238
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,200
I'm afraid
the people will remain unconvinced.

239
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,720
Your Majesty, don't worry.

240
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,440
I'll bring the truth to light.

241
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,440
Excellent!

242
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,870
Mr. Zhen, well said.

243
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,960
Your Majesty, don't worry.

244
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,870
We've found evidence.

245
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,750
We won't let

246
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,080
any evildoers escape scot-free.

247
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,150
What evidence?

248
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,960
Conclusive evidence.

249
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,870
I'll present it to His Majesty later.

250
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,030
Your Majesty, you'll find out soon.

251
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,910
Mr. Zhen, don't you agree?

252
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,510
Sorry for bothering you, Your Majesty.

253
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,840
We're done with our inquiry.

254
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,030
I shall take my leave.

255
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,550
I shall take my leave.

256
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,120
Mr. Zhen, please wait.

257
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,750
Mr. Zhen,

258
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,630
I wish to have a word with you.

259
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,790
Imperial Concubine Xian.

260
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,360
What are you thinking?

261
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,910
It's your turn.

262
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,240
Your Majesty.

263
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,750
What are you doing?

264
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,360
If you're trying to make a plea
for Jin and his consort,

265
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,030
you can forget about it.

266
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,790
I'm not trying

267
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,030
to make a plea for them.

268
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,030
I'm launching an official complaint
against the Princess Royal.

269
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,600
Why?

270
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,030
Are you reporting her
just because she investigated

271
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,510
your son and daughter-in-law?

272
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,600
You've learned

273
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,080
to shift the blame onto others now, huh?

274
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,440
Back then, she tampered
with Jin's astronomical forecast

275
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,030
when he was born.

276
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,270
She slandered him
for being a bringer of misfortune.

277
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,270
Who told you so?

278
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,270
Where's the evidence?

279
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,120
I don't have evidence related to that.

280
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,390
But that isn't the only evil deed

281
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,910
she has committed.

282
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,670
Actually,

283
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,320
Mother and I want to save
my brother and his consort.

284
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,080
We were pretending

285
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,720
in front of the Marquis of Changxing.

286
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Could there be a hidden truth?

287
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,960
What if I tell you

288
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,510
that Si was well-versed
in the secret arts of Nanwu?

289
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,000
I became blind

290
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,960
because of the venomous bug

291
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,670
of Nanwu.

292
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,080
Not just that,

293
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,960
the one who put the venomous bug on me

294
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,600
was the Princess Royal.

295
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,600
This is the testimony of Nanny Xu,

296
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,360
the Princess Royal's wet nurse.

297
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,870
Your Majesty,
please practice wise judgment.

298
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,910
Do you truly think

299
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,870
Jin's consort will betray our realm?

300
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,320
In my opinion,

301
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,390
the Princess Royal

302
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,790
maligned her first

303
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,910
to prevent others

304
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,600
from finding out

305
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,240
that she colluded
with the woman of Nanwu before.

306
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,630
So what if Jiang Si has

307
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,480
the emblem?

308
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,240
She's a citizen of Zhou.

309
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,670
She got married to a prince of Zhou.

310
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,870
Do you think she's insane?

311
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,870
Why would she swear loyalty to Nanwu

312
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,480
when she hasn't even been there before?

313
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,440
It's easy to understand.

314
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,150
Your Majesty, I'm sure you understand.

315
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,790
I've handled many cases.

316
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,960
All crimes are motivated by motives.

317
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,870
But I don't understand

318
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,390
why she tried to harm you.

319
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,670
It was because I knew

320
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,720
that she murdered the late Empress.

321
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,440
Since you have this evidence,

322
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,670
why didn't you show it to me sooner?

323
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,080
The evidence is rigid,

324
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,600
but people are not.

325
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,750
I was worried

326
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,080
that Nanny Xu
might overturn her testimony

327
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,200
and turn on me.

328
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,200
No matter how foolish I am,

329
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,120
after being harmed so many times,

330
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,910
I've learned my lesson.

331
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,910
All right. You should get up.

332
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,720
You've always been domineering.

333
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,440
Who's bold enough to harm you?

334
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,670
You know who.

335
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,720
In the palace...

336
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,550
No.

337
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,600
You should know

338
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,440
who the most domineering woman

339
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,720
in Ling'an City is.

340
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,750
It's your sister, Rong Yang.

341
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,670
She thinks saving your life once
gives her the right

342
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,960
to do whatever she pleases.
She has no regard for human lives.

343
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,600
Such audacity!

344
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,240
If you say something like that again,

345
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,510
you'll be grounded

346
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,270
for a month.

347
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,840
Is one month enough?

348
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,640
Why don't you extend it?

349
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,030
Your Majesty, why don't you
trap me and my son here

350
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,310
forever?

351
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,310
You're being unreasonable!

352
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,589
Your Highness.

353
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,640
If this matter is exposed,

354
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,349
Changning Palace

355
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,310
will be in danger.

356
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,160
But now,

357
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,110
Si was imprisoned
because of the same matter.

358
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,750
Therefore,

359
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,030
I don't know

360
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,480
if I should keep hiding the truth.

361
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,030
In my opinion,

362
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,070
Before this, you hid the cause

363
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,960
of your blindness

364
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,480
to protect Her Majesty.

365
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,920
After that, you hid
the reason for your cure

366
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,920
to protect Prince Yan and his consort.

367
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,640
But what you're doing right now

368
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,960
is exactly
what the Princess Royal wanted.

369
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,550
If so, Mr. Zhen,

370
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,640
what do you think I should do?

371
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,480
Tell everyone the truth.

372
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,160
The truth is above all.

373
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,750
Tell His Majesty about it.

374
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,550
Will it work if I tell him?

375
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,640
There are certain things

376
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,270
you cannot keep in your heart.

377
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,790
They'll come to light eventually.

378
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,880
Your Highness, if you require

379
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,070
some courage,

380
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,720
I'm willing to join you on your journey.

381
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,510
Mr. Zhen,

382
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,640
there's one more thing

383
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,070
I want to ask you.

384
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,310
Your Highness, please ask away.

385
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,720
Why did you refuse

386
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,880
a marriage with me?

387
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,550
I...

388
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,720
Your Highness,

389
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,200
relieve your anger
with some lotus seed tea.

390
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,200
All these years, I was schemed

391
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,550
by a wretched woman who was married off.

392
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,960
I actually never won against her.

393
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,070
I thought

394
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,270
Jiang Si could achieve something.

395
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,880
In the end,

396
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,640
she overestimated herself.

397
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,960
Mother, didn't I remind you

398
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,680
not to hand the testimony
over to Father?

399
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,030
Not only

400
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,070
will you not be able to help Jin out,

401
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,240
but it'll also implicate us!

402
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,160
You fool!

403
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,790
How dare you still question me?

404
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,030
Do you think I have no idea?

405
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,680
The one who reported Jin
and his consort to His Majesty

406
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,550
was you!

407
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,680
Zhang,

408
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,790
how could you

409
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,070
join hands
with the wretched Princess Royal

410
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,590
to harm our family?

411
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,640
Jin was bewitched by the witch.

412
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,000
I was just trying to rid Zhou
of a great evil.

413
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,920
What's wrong with that?

414
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,790
He's your biological brother!

415
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,350
If anything happens

416
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,510
to Jin...

417
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,350
I'll cut ties with you,

418
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,960
you unfilial brat.

419
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,160
Now, Mother, you admit

420
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,440
that he's my biological brother, huh?

421
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,110
Do you intend to give up on me

422
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,070
for his sake?

423
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,480
People used to say

424
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,590
that Jin was a bringer of misfortune.

425
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,200
I had no choice either.

426
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,720
But now,

427
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,830
we can prove

428
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,960
his innocence.

429
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,110
Isn't it better for you
and your brother to stay united?

430
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,310
As long as

431
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,830
one of you

432
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,920
can achieve success,

433
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,240
we'll be able to lead

434
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,790
a great life.

435
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,790
Zhang,

436
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,110
do you understand what I'm saying?

437
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,030
I do.

438
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,510
Mother, it turns out

439
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,440
that you didn't care about
a particular son.

440
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,680
You only care about

441
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,550
who can help you ascend
the Empress Dowager's throne!

442
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,680
[Nanny Duo of Changle Palace]
The imperial palace

443
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,070
actually harbors dozens of Nanwu spies.

444
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,350
They include Nanny Duo,

445
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,400
who was the Empress' servant.

446
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,350
Your Majesty, please permit me

447
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,960
to arrest all of the spies

448
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,350
named in the list.

449
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,640
If we can confirm
that they belong to Nanwu,

450
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,750
we can confirm

451
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,200
that Princess Consort Yan
has betrayed the realm.

452
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,350
She and her clan
should be executed for that.

453
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,030
Go ahead.

454
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

455
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,000
Mr. Zhen, why didn't you
utter a single word?

456
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,030
Your Majesty.

457
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,240
I also

458
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,720
have something to show you.

459
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,750
This is a piece of the name list

460
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,590
you're holding.

461
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
I've already investigated it.

462
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,310
This paper

463
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,110
isn't any ordinary paper.

464
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,350
It's Chengxintang's paper,

465
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,270
which is rare.

466
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,070
It is extremely valuable.

467
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,880
Even I'm hesitant to use this.

468
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,310
Have you ever gifted such papers

469
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,750
to someone else?

470
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,880
Mr. Zhen,

471
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,440
we have conclusive evidence
of her crime.

472
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,680
His Majesty has ordered me
to capture them.

473
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,110
But you're still
beating around the bush.

474
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,110
What do you mean by this?

475
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,680
Continue.

476
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,750
In my opinion,

477
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,350
this name list is a slander attempt.

478
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,110
If the names in the list

479
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,720
are all Nanwu spies,

480
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,030
I'm afraid someone else

481
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,830
is colluding with Nanwu.

482
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,550
Everyone I've interrogated

483
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,830
sided with Jiang Si.

484
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,720
Even Mr. Zhen,

485
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,750
who's fair and just,

486
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,550
is siding with her.

487
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,680
That's enough to prove

488
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,960
that the witch
has bewitched all of them.

489
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,640
My Lord.

490
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,160
Do you

491
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,310
have any other evidence?

492
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,440
I...

493
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,350
Your Majesty.

494
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,590
When I heard

495
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,400
that Princess Consort Yan
was the Nanwu Saintess,

496
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,440
I was perplexed,

497
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,510
and I couldn't accept it.

498
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,200
But after that, I gave it some thought.

499
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,400
There's no law in Zhou

500
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,680
that convicts one of their crimes

501
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,590
based on their identity.

502
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,590
It's fine as long as people
conduct themselves with integrity.

503
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,350
Isn't that the reason

504
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,510
you establish the laws
in the first place?

505
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,960
Firstly, Jiang Si never broke the law.

506
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,750
Secondly, she didn't
collude with our enemies.

507
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,310
Although she's the Nanwu Saintess,

508
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,550
in my opinion,

509
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,110
she's not guilty.

510
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,070
If we rule her as innocent,

511
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,750
the officials of the imperial court

512
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,720
will never be convinced.

513
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,920
Are you only considering
Prince Yan's best interest

514
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,920
without considering His Majesty's?

515
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,830
The Saintess' identity
has been exposed.

516
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,310
Emperor Jingming has imprisoned her.

517
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
She might be executed at any time.

518
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:33,750
I should've taken her away

519
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,790
by force back then.

520
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,590
If so, it wouldn't end up like this.

521
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,270
Let's rescue the Saintess first.

522
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,590
Can we mobilize

523
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,590
the spies in the imperial court?

524
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,790
This is the important item

525
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:45,960
that I've retrieved from the palace.

526
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,830
Is this a map
of the palace's secret tunnels?

527
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,750
I've lurked in the palace
for many years.

528
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,400
Besides relaying intel
to the Grand Elder,

529
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,680
I also found a secret tunnel.

530
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,200
It was

531
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,880
built by Emperor Jingming

532
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
after Prince Xiang's rebellion.

533
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,240
It's as complex

534
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,070
as a maze.

535
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,030
If one doesn't focus,

536
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,550
they might be trapped to their deaths.

537
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,550
That old fox

538
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,000
is truly cunning.

539
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,400
Keep this properly.

540
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,720
Actually,

541
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,110
that's not enough to rescue her.

542
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,350
Prince Yan?

543
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:14,960
What are you doing here?

544
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,110
I tailed you.

545
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,590
The imperial prison is heavily guarded.

546
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,590
Even if you are lucky enough

547
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,240
to sneak into the palace
through the secret tunnel,

548
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,200
it's impossible for you
to access the imperial prison.

549
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,110
Just ignore him.

550
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,720
He's the prince of Zhou.

551
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,750
Even if his wife is the one
being imprisoned,

552
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,960
he would never help the Nanwu people.

553
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,030
That's precisely why

554
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,350
I'd like to join hands

555
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,550
with

556
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,000
you all.

557
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,380
[Princess Royal's Mansion]

558
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,110
Brother actually

559
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,070
wanted to heed Zhen Heng's advice

560
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,400
and rule them as innocent?

561
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,920
He hasn't decided yet.

562
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,960
But in my opinion,

563
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,880
His Majesty's heart has already wavered.

564
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,030
At the very least,

565
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,110
they're spared from execution.

566
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,680
Since Brother is soft-hearted,

567
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,400
I shall act on his behalf.

568
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,110
I have to rescue the Saintess
as soon as possible.

569
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,440
Shijiu.

570
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,680
Deliver my letter to Han Ran.

571
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,510
Tell him to open
the side palace gate in secret

572
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,480
at the hour of Mao tomorrow.

573
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,680
Marquis.

574
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,070
Your Highness.

575
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,480
Rid Zhou of this great evil.

576
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,350
Your Highness, you serve the realm
with all you have.

577
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,590
I shall serve you with my life.

578
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:48,720
Mr. Jiang.

579
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,750
Long Dan.

580
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,160
Have you received any updates

581
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,350
about Si?

582
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,000
Miss Jiang Si was imprisoned.

583
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,880
Was the Princess Royal the one

584
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,160
who reported her to His Majesty?

585
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,590
I knew it.

586
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,070
Si was right.

587
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,070
Even if we step back,

588
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,920
she'll never let us off.

589
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,310
Long Dan.

590
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,070
Can you take me with you?

591
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,880
Ancheng.

592
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,960
Where are you going?

593
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,680
I'm going to rescue my daughter.

594
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,510
I'm going

595
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,510
to submit a memorial

596
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,830
that I was supposed to do 20 years ago.

597
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,880
Mother.

598
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,550
At this point,

599
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,720
are you still trying to stop me?

600
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,980
[Zhuque Gate]

601
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:58,750
Stop right there!

602
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,400
What are you doing here?

603
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,310
I, Jiang Ancheng, a former official
of the Directorate of Astronomy,

604
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,920
Count of Dongping,
have a memorial to submit!

605
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,960
On the fifth day of the fifth month
in the third year of the Jingming era,

606
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,750
the Northern Star shines bright,

607
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,880
an omen of great fortune.

608
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:33,070
The Seventh Prince is born,

609
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,590
a joyous event of harmony.

610
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,960
May His Majesty be informed.

611
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,030
Heaven blesses Zhou.

612
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,680
Report this!

613
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,750
I, Jiang Ancheng, a former official
of the Directorate of Astronomy,

614
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:51,400
Count of Dongping,
have a memorial to submit!

615
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,240
This is an order from the higher-ups.

616
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,960
We will interrogate
the witch of Nanwu ourselves.

617
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,590
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

618
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,000
Move!

619
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,160
Jiang Si.

620
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,920
Why aren't you surprised

621
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,920
when you see me?

622
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,200
You merely rely on

623
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,680
underhanded means.

624
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,440
What's so surprising about that?

625
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,070
If so,

626
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,550
what about Jiang Ancheng?

627
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,110
Your father

628
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,680
truly loves you, huh?

629
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,350
He actually dared

630
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,110
to kneel outside of the palace gate

631
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,030
to report me.

632
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,200
What?

633
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,200
May His Majesty be informed.

634
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,200
Heaven blesses Zhou.

635
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,270
Do not let him meet His Majesty.

636
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,240
Do not let me

637
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,510
see him again.

638
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,200
Yes, Your Highness.

639
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,590
Don't harm my father.

640
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,790
Please don't.

641
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,440
You can do anything you want to me.

642
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,750
I'll agree to any of your conditions!

643
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,070
Just don't harm my father!

644
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,070
I beg you!

645
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,110
Please!

646
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,160
Don't harm my father.

647
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:35,480
The Northern Star shines bright,

648
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,160
an omen of great fortune.

649
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,880
I'll agree to any of your conditions!

650
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,110
Don't harm my father!

651
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,790
You wretch.

652
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,310
You have no right

653
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,880
to negotiate with me!

654
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,880
Father, what are you doing here?

655
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,110
Your Highness,

656
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,790
Si was imprisoned.

657
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,590
I can only rescue her

658
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,920
by toppling the Princess Royal.

659
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,880
I need to submit a memorial
to the throne

660
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,920
and notify His Majesty

661
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,310
that she tampered
with the astronomical forecast

662
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,880
and slandered you.

663
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,790
Let's plan this through, okay?

664
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,000
You should stop persuading me.

665
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,070
I never had much spine

666
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,030
to begin with.

667
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,510
Si has suffered a lot

668
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,240
because of my cowardice.

669
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,680
Since it has come to this,

670
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,880
how could I just sit idly by?

671
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,790
All right.

672
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:36,920
I'll take you to the palace.

673
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,680
[Tiande Hall]

674
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,310
Your Majesty,

675
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,880
back then, the Princess Royal tampered

676
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,720
with the astronomical forecast

677
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,830
and slandered the Seventh Prince
as a bringer of misfortune

678
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,830
in order to divert

679
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,920
the disgrace of Mr. Cui's defeat.

680
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,000
She also did it

681
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,720
[Memorial]
to prevent Imperial Concubine Xian

682
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,200
from being an imperial noble consort
after his birth.

683
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,680
She bribed the Directorate of Astronomy

684
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,720
to falsify the Seventh Prince's birth.

685
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,830
They made it an ill omen

686
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,480
and blamed him,

687
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,030
a newborn child,

688
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,400
for the frontier defeat.

689
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,550
She killed two birds with one stone.

690
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,720
Not only did it cause
Imperial Concubine Xian to not get promoted,

691
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,880
but it also helped Mr. Cui

692
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,790
escape the criticisms
of the imperial court and the people.

693
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,680
All of these are baseless accusations.

694
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,510
That's not true.

695
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,480
I've overheard

696
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,480
their conversation.

697
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,240
However,

698
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,550
in order to protect myself,

699
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,830
[A sign of great auspiciousness]
I never told the truth.

700
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,200
But I wasn't willing

701
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,270
to join their corrupt ranks.

702
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,240
Therefore, I chose to resign
and return to my home.

703
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,070
Jin.

704
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:32,920
Yes, Father.

705
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,790
Did you know about this?

706
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,880
I did.

707
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,400
I should put this branding metal

708
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,200
into your mouth

709
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,720
and burn your tongue.

710
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,640
That's the best move.

711
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,000
I beg of you.

712
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,750
Please.

713
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,510
Please spare my father.

714
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,400
What about Mingyue?

715
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,550
What about my daughter?

716
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,310
Father,

717
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,350
I did swallow grievances
because of this.

718
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,720
But I don't hate you for doing so.

719
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,440
It's because I know

720
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,200
that you were kept in the dark too.

721
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,160
All right. I understand.

722
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,960
All of you may leave.

723
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,830
But Your Majesty...

724
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,790
Yes, Father.

725
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,790
Is that all?

726
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,200
What exactly is His Majesty up to?

727
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,110
If we wish to topple the Princess Royal,

728
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,350
your testimony alone

729
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,270
isn't enough.

730
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:49,750
If so...

731
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,000
Your Highness, the palace
has sent someone here.

732
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,240
His Majesty is summoning you.

733
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,270
It's my dereliction of duty

734
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,000
Yu Jin protected Jiang Ancheng.

735
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,590
He even took Nanny Duo to the palace.

736
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,000
Go.

737
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,830
Notify Marquis of Changxing.

738
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,400
Yes, Your Highness.

739
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,200
Your Highness, thank you
for bringing me to the palace.

740
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,960
You know
that this is a perilous trip, right?

741
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,640
My death is worth it

742
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,030
as long as the Saintess is safe.

743
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'll leave her to you.

744
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:33,960
Don't worry.

745
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,270
Nanny Duo, come with me.

746
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,200
Summon Princess Fuqing.

747
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,840
Greetings, Father.

748
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,440
I've brought someone here.

749
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,760
I want you to see her.

750
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,110
Who is it?

751
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,920
Nanny Duo has important matters

752
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,030
to report to you.

753
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,360
Let her go.

754
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,280
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

755
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,110
What is it? Speak.

756
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,360
Your Majesty,

757
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,320
although Jiang Si is the Nanwu Saintess,

758
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,320
she was never involved

759
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,400
with Nanwu.

760
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,920
The true traitor is someone else.

761
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,800
She's your beloved sister,

762
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,360
Rong Yang.

763
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,400
Really?

764
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,960
I have evidence to present to you.

765
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,710
This is Eternal Slumber, a plant unique

766
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,440
to Nanwu.

767
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,760
If its pollen is mixed with water,

768
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,550
it doesn't have any taste or color.

769
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,760
However, it contains lethal poison.

770
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,760
The Princess Royal once ordered her men

771
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,630
to poison Su Ke,
the Countess of Dongping,

772
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,710
who was
Princess Consort Yan's birth mother.

773
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,590
After that, she ordered me

774
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,280
to blind Princess Fuqing's eyes.

775
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,840
She planted me
to serve Empress Di as her spy.

776
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,000
You're a spy of Nanwu.

777
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,840
Do you think

778
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,320
I'll believe your words?

779
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,360
Father,

780
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,590
Nanny Duo was speaking the truth.

781
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,550
Back then,

782
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,000
I was locked
inside a cabinet by accident.

783
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,190
I overheard

784
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,510
the plot hatched by Aunt and Nanny Duo

785
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,190
as they intended
to murder the late Empress.

786
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,760
After that,

787
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,630
I went blind.

788
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,510
Nanny Duo

789
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,190
started serving me after that.

790
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,280
So,

791
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,400
Rong Yang planted her as your maid

792
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,190
in order to keep you under surveillance.

793
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,190
That's right.

794
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,030
I blame myself for being too timid.

795
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,150
I dared not

796
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,760
tell the truth

797
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,800
in order to protect my mother and me.

798
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,030
But now,

799
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,480
my benefactor, Jiang Si,

800
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,590
was slandered by the Princess Royal,

801
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,510
causing her to be imprisoned.

802
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,030
Therefore, Father, I hope

803
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,280
that you can investigate her thoroughly

804
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,630
and uphold justice for Jiang Si!

805
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,510
Nanny Duo.

806
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,400
Did you know

807
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,110
that you have no way

808
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,360
to leave the palace

809
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,880
now that you've admitted

810
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,550
to being a spy of Nanwu?

811
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,110
Since I dared enter the palace,

812
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,230
of course I know about the consequences.

813
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,230
It doesn't matter if I die here,

814
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,230
as long as you, the Emperor of Zhou,

815
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,670
can tell right from wrong.

816
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,280
Saintess.

817
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,670
Brother, you summoned me urgently.

818
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,960
Is everything alright?

819
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,070
Rong Yang.

820
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,880
Let me ask you something.

821
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,760
Do you know

822
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,190
Nanny Duo's true identity?

823
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,030
She's a spy of Nanwu.

824
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,920
She came to me

825
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,150
to present
an official complaint against you.

826
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,110
Interesting.

827
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,480
Brother, tell me about it.

828
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,840
She said

829
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,190
you once ordered her

830
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,110
to murder the late Empress.

831
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,150
She joined hands with me

832
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,150
and promised to help me
gain entry to the palace.

833
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,590
But I had to murder

834
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,760
the Empress of Zhou on her behalf.

835
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,230
I murdered the late Empress?

836
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,230
Why would I collude
with the Nanwu people

837
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,630
to murder the late Empress?

838
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:43,880
She even said...

839
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,070
The Princess Royal once ordered her men

840
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,110
to poison Su Ke,
the Countess of Dongping,

841
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,150
who was
Princess Consort Yan's birth mother.

842
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,320
Are you saying

843
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,150
that I'm related
to Su Ke's death as well?

844
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,030
Didn't you always hate her?

845
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,630
Wasn't that the case?

846
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,960
Brother,

847
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,760
I have nothing to do with that.

848
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,070
If so, I suppose
Fuqing didn't turn blind

849
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,550
because of you.

850
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,360
This is the venomous Nanwu bug

851
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,000
used to rob Princess Fuqing

852
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,070
of her sight.

853
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,150
Of course.

854
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,110
Brother, you know me the best.

855
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,110
You mustn't trust

856
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,880
those crafty Nanwu people easily.

857
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,800
I'm sure Nanny Duo

858
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,840
was colluding with Jiang Si

859
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,400
in order to slander me.

860
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:34,670
If so,

861
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,400
the story about someone selling

862
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,320
Zhou's warhorses to Nanwu

863
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,510
is a lie too, huh?

864
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,630
In order

865
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,000
to gather more wealth,

866
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,150
she sold the warhorses of Zhou to Nanwu.

867
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,670
This ledger contains
the transaction records.

868
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
That's a lie!

869
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:49,670
All right.

870
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:51,800
I trust you.

871
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,030
I thought it was a lie too.

872
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,230
Baoping, serve us some tea.

873
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,280
Rong Yang,

874
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,960
you came all this way in this heat.

875
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,360
I'm sure you're thirsty.

876
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,920
I heard that this flower tea

877
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,030
is sweet and delicate.

878
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,190
Try it.

879
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,440
Why aren't you drinking it?

880
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,480
Brother.

881
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,400
What do you mean by this?

882
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,510
This flower

883
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,030
is Eternal Slumber,
a plant unique to Nanwu.

884
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,440
If its pollen is mixed with water,

885
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,230
it doesn't have any taste or color.

886
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,400
However, it contains lethal poison.

887
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,190
Your Majesty, the stalk you're holding

888
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,880
was retrieved from the Princess Royal's
rear courtyard.

889
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,440
So Brother,

890
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,030
this was your little trap?

891
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,550
Did you remember that I was your brother

892
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,630
when you colluded

893
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,840
with Nanwu?

894
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,400
You harmed

895
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,000
my only daughter too.

896
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,320
I never expected you

897
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,590
to commit such despicable

898
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,000
and unpardonable crimes.

899
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,550
What are your last words?

900
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,030
Brother,

901
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,880
times have changed.

902
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,670
Now, I can choose

903
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,000
not to take this poisoned tea.

904
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,320
Rong Yang.

905
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,400
I didn't expect

906
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,230
this defiance.

907
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,880
I'm not rebelling.

908
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,070
I'm just protecting myself.

909
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,000
You were the one

910
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,030
who cornered me

911
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,760
with every step you took.

912
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,110
All these years,

913
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,440
I've spoiled you to the extreme.

914
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,880
What exactly do you want?

915
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,190
What do I want?

916
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,280
I want my daughter

917
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,480
to be alive.

918
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,630
I want my husband to love me.

919
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,030
And, I want my brother

920
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,320
to never

921
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,670
abandon me.

922
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,070
Brother,

923
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,960
am I greedy?

924
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,150
Can you even fulfill one of my wishes?

925
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,280
I granted you a marriage with Cui Xu.

926
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,840
And, I've granted Mingyue
the marriage she wanted too.

927
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,150
Since when

928
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,480
have I let you down?

929
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,400
Since when have I
not satisfied your desires?

930
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:25,880
I made you

931
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,710
the noblest princess in Zhou.

932
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,230
But in the end,
you're blaming me for everything.

933
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,510
What exactly do you want me to do?

934
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,840
I wanted you to kill Jiang Si.

935
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,670
She's the Nanwu Saintess!

936
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,440
Not only did you not kill her,

937
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,670
but you also tried to poison me.

938
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,360
Why?

939
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,440
What gives?

940
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,480
Her execution is a state affair!

941
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,630
You're requesting me to do it
as a family member!

942
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,550
We have to separate
between state and family affairs, huh?

943
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,630
Brother.

944
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,480
Since you can't avenge Mingyue,

945
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,030
I shall

946
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,760
do it myself.

947
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,360
Both Jiang Si and Yu Jin

948
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,880
will suffer terrible deaths.

949
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,840
I'll let you experience

950
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,480
the feeling of being betrayed

951
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,550
and losing your child.

952
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,030
They have to die

953
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,880
for killing my daughter!

954
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,190
Are you still the person I know?

955
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,360
How come you ended up like this?

956
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,190
I don't even know who you are now!

957
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,960
I've stayed the same.

958
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,230
You're the one who's changed.

959
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:44,880
My brother

960
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,400
would never hit me,

961
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,230
let alone poison me.

962
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,030
I no longer

963
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,150
have a brother

964
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,000
ever since you handed that teacup to me.

965
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,840
I regret it so much.

966
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,710
What do you regret?

967
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,440
Helping you seize the throne!

968
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,950
