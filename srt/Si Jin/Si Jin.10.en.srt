00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,270
The fish are hungry.

194
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,600
Time to eat.

195
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,960
The moment I feed them,
they all come rushing.

196
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Such gluttons.

197
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,320
Eat up.

198
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,600
Grandmother.

199
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,360
Greetings, Grandmother.

200
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,840
Did you sleep well last night?

201
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,960
With so many troubles

202
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,550
in this household,

203
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,870
do you think

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,390
I could sleep soundly?

205
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,240
It's my poor judgment of people

206
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,480
that has caused you such distress.

207
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,000
Didn't I tell you before?

208
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,200
You've only just come back
after your divorce.

209
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,320
You needn't pay your respects every day.

210
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,240
Stay in your courtyard

211
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,790
and rest.

212
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,600
Is there a reason you came to see me

213
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,910
this early?

214
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,670
Nothing escapes your notice.

215
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,320
Is this about your mother?

216
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,630
My mother has managed this mansion

217
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,480
for so many years.

218
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,630
She kept the household in perfect order,

219
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,240
and she has never made
any grave mistakes.

220
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
Just because of one moment
of indiscretion,

221
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,840
she was stripped of her authority
over the household.

222
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,750
Isn't that somewhat unfair?

223
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,790
Sometimes,

224
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,000
when one holds power for too long,

225
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,910
they develop an illusion.

226
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,390
They are led to believe
that power belongs to them

227
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,510
and they can do whatever they wish

228
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,720
for their own gain.

229
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,750
Mother isn't that kind of person.

230
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,510
She always has the mansion's
best interests at heart.

231
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,750
Why would she act out of selfishness?

232
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,960
Oh, Qian.

233
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,510
After everything you've been through,

234
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,120
how have you still not learned

235
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,150
to see through others' true intentions?

236
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,620
[Count of Dongping's Mansion]

237
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,080
Yi.

238
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,120
Take good care of yourself.

239
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,390
Come visit with Yan when you have time.

240
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,150
I will.

241
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,030
Take care of yourselves

242
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,080
and look after Father.

243
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,960
Si, if you miss me,

244
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,240
come to Lingshui to visit me.

245
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,600
I will pay you a visit soon.

246
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,150
I miss Yan already.

247
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,320
She misses you too.

248
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,240
It's not easy to manage a household.

249
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,960
You must be cautious.

250
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,080
Don't let yourself be stepped on.

251
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,000
Zhan, take care of Si.

252
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,000
I will, Yi.

253
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,960
Zhan. Si.

254
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,120
Take care.

255
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,000
Ziyu.

256
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,270
Look after our sister.

257
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,550
Take care.

258
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,150
Ziyu.

259
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,870
Safe trip.

260
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,910
Take good care of our sister.

261
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,720
Have you

262
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,150
ever thought about

263
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,670
why Si suddenly disappeared?

264
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,080
Or why I stopped Mr. Zhen

265
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,670
from investigating?

266
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,480
One must not act on emotions.

267
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,550
Otherwise,

268
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,910
they may blind themselves to the truth.

269
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,600
Do you know

270
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,750
what's most important

271
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,600
to your mother?

272
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,440
It's…

273
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,510
It's not this mansion.

274
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,200
It's your branch's status.

275
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,790
For that,

276
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,120
she would do anything.

277
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,360
Then,

278
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,150
do you really trust Si that much?

279
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,030
I'm assigning her a key position.

280
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,000
Isn't it best for her to stay grounded,

281
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,910
take on proper duties in this household,

282
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,750
and live a stable life?

283
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,030
Some go their whole lives

284
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
without understanding

285
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,030
what truly matters to them.

286
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,840
They let their emotions
dictate their actions.

287
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,200
Such people can never
accomplish great things.

288
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,630
Qian.

289
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,030
I know

290
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,550
you're in pain, both physically

291
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,080
and emotionally.

292
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,630
But we mustn't lose hope

293
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,870
because of an unfortunate

294
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,030
and failed marriage.

295
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,750
If we plan well and do our best,

296
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,550
you can still

297
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,720
have a wonderful life.

298
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,080
When the day comes,

299
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:30,720
you will still be

300
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,360
the granddaughter

301
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,510
Old Madam is most proud of
in our family.

302
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,030
I have spent my entire life

303
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,270
following Mother's arrangements.

304
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,670
But what is it

305
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,480
that I truly want?

306
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,150
Miss Si wants

307
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,870
to manage the household.

308
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,030
But without Madam Xiao,

309
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,200
who can she even manage?

310
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,360
She should just worry about herself.

311
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,320
Oh, my neck.

312
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,550
I slept wrong
and now I have a stiff neck.

313
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,790
What's wrong?

314
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,120
It hurts terribly.

315
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,910
You're just too idle.

316
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,000
Take a break today.

317
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,200
I didn't do anything.

318
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,870
Eat.

319
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,000
Replenish yourself.

320
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,510
It hurts so much.

321
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,390
You're right.

322
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,670
It's infuriating.

323
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,200
Don't make that long face.

324
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,150
All of you!

325
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,360
Do you know what time it is now?

326
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,000
The rice hasn't been steamed,
and the dishes haven't been cooked.

327
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,960
Do you all not want
to work here anymore?

328
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:27,720
Here she comes.

329
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,550
Here comes trouble.

330
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,360
I know you all think

331
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,030
you can disobey Miss Si

332
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,960
because she is young.

333
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,670
But Miss Si said this.

334
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,840
Some people shouldn't dig

335
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,910
their own grave.

336
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,240
If the tasks aren't done properly

337
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,790
and Old Madam asks about it,

338
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,000
none of you will escape responsibility!

339
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,790
A little girl still wet behind the ears!

340
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,080
Who does she think she is

341
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,030
to be lecturing us?

342
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,080
Still,

343
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,960
she isn't entirely wrong.

344
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,070
We've served in this mansion for years.

345
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,720
We know

346
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,000
Old Madam's temperament.

347
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,720
Right.

348
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:02,880
I just wanted

349
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,310
to stand up for Madam Xiao.

350
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,829
There are plenty of ways

351
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,460
to do that.

352
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:12,060
[Haitang House]

353
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,550
My Lady,

354
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,880
you've been up early and working late
these past few days.

355
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,160
Why take on

356
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,240
such exhausting tasks?

357
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,550
Answer this.

358
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,310
Is there anyone in this mansion

359
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,750
who would dare harm Aunt Xiao?

360
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,000
No.

361
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,589
Then who instructed Jiang Pei

362
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,750
to drug me

363
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,880
during Grandmother's birthday banquet?

364
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,960
Who instructed her?

365
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,920
Wasn't it Madam Xiao?

366
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,200
At least you didn't serve me
all these years for nothing.

367
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,640
Now that you're managing

368
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,750
this mansion,

369
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,830
no one will dare mistreat you
or the main branch.

370
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,590
That's right.

371
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,480
Miss Si.

372
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,590
Do you have feelings for Mr. Zhen?

373
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,000
Why are you suddenly asking this?

374
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,720
Well, Mr. Zhen

375
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,920
clearly has feelings for you.

376
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,680
It's as clear as day.

377
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,160
Mr. Zhen is a good man.

378
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,400
He's brave and righteous,

379
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,750
especially in a court

380
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,310
full of flattery and scheming.

381
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,350
I admire such a person.

382
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,200
But

383
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,830
it is only admiration.

384
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,510
I also think

385
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,750
you shouldn't fall

386
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,750
for Mr. Zhen.

387
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,110
Why do you say that?

388
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,070
Commandant Yu is the better choice.

389
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,350
Whenever you're in trouble,

390
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,110
he always comes to your rescue.

391
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,590
And if you hadn't told me,

392
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,270
no one would even know
what he has done for you.

393
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,110
Isn't Commandant Yu just like the hero

394
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,880
from stories?

395
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,030
He does good deeds
without seeking recognition.

396
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,510
You can't always rely on others
to save you.

397
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,920
Don't read too many of those stories.

398
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,160
None of them are real.

399
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,240
But Commandant Yu is real.

400
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,830
Miss Si,

401
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,270
do you have feelings for Commandant Yu?

402
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,550
No.

403
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,000
I have no interest in anyone.

404
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
I only care about managing the mansion

405
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
and my shop.

406
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,350
Just be quiet.

407
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,510
Why do you have so many questions?

408
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,240
If you keep going,

409
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,400
when will I ever finish
balancing these accounts?

410
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,240
Go have your sweet soup.

411
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,310
Yes, Miss.

412
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,580

00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,790
The floor wasn't wiped dry,

485
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,000
and I slipped.

490
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,440
It's been a while

491
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,030
since I've had such a simple breakfast.

492
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,960
Back when I was in the mountains

493
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,880
for my retreat,

494
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,240
I ate these same things.

495
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,960
A light meal in the morning

496
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,510
is good.

498
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,680
Mother, let's eat.

499
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,240
Does this congee taste spoiled to you?

500
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,310
It does have a bit of a smell.

501
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,720
And this flatbread seems…

502
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,030
Nothing is going right

503
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,270
this morning!

504
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,350
Mother.

505
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,640
Si is still too young.

506
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,510
Yet, you entrusted the entire household

507
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,960
to her.

508
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,240
Who knows

509
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,270
how many more problems

510
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,200
will arise?

511
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,790
A household in disarray
does not foster prosperity.

00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,110
Anmou.

513
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,440
It's just a meal gone bad.

514
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,200
Why are you making it out
to be such a big deal?

515
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,310
Looks like your time

516
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,920
in the bureaucracy has made you

517
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,720
fond of handing out false accusations,

518
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,750
even in your own household.

519
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,640
Ancheng.

520
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,590
You've certainly got a way

521
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,200
with words now.

522
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,510
Who started this argument?

523
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,790
But the congee is spoiled!

524
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,830
So what if it is?

525
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,350
Enough!

526
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,920
You, sit down.

527
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,270
How disgraceful.

528
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,270
You two are both fathers now.

529
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,960
Bickering in front of the children.

530
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,440
How do you think that looks?

531
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,680
Si.

532
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,550
Has it been too difficult for you

533
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,640
to manage the household?

534
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,200
Grandmother. Uncle Anmou.

535
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,160
I promise that today's mistake

536
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,350
will never happen again.

537
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,510
Please give me three more days.

538
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,110
If I still fail,

539
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,000
I will hand over
the household keys myself.

540
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,000
Three days?

541
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,110
I doubt you'll even
make it through today.

542
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,550
I'm not eating anymore.

543
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,550
Suit yourself.

544
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,920
How long have you been stitching

545
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,640
that shoe sole?

546
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,350
Is it still not finished?

547
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,310
Just watching you makes me feel tired.

548
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,310
You should eat some walnuts.

549
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,070
Nannies, busy as always?

550
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,270
Miss Si.

551
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,200
Wake up. Miss Si is here.

552
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,030
Miss Si.

553
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,920
You must all be exhausted.

554
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,310
Not really.

555
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,030
We're just getting older.

556
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,160
I just dozed off for a moment.

557
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,550
You happened to catch me.

558
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,160
Well, pardon me

559
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,640
for disturbing your peaceful nap.

560
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,200
Might I make a suggestion?

561
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,920
Since you've all been working so hard,

562
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,240
pack up and take a few days off

563
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,510
to rest.

564
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,310
The kitchen won't need you.

565
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,830
Miss Si,

566
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,880
what do you mean?

567
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,400
Are you dismissing us?

568
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,440
We are senior servants of the mansion.

569
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,310
We've worked here for most of our lives.

570
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,110
Yes, Miss Si.

571
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,000
The prestigious families of Ling'an City

572
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,510
never dismiss their longtime servants.

573
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,000
What are you talking about?

574
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,310
It’s precisely
because I care for you all

575
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,880
that I'm giving you some time off.

576
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,750
Working in the kitchen all year round

577
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,030
can be so taxing on your bodies.

578
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,310
You can rest easy.

579
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,480
You'll still get paid as usual
while you're on break.

580
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,830
You can return

581
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,350
when you've had enough rest.

582
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,070
Really?

583
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,480
Can such a good thing be true?

584
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,640
Of course, it's true.

585
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,790
These two ladies

586
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,440
are from Guangju Parlor.

587
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,550
This will be a good chance

588
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,000
to change the menu for the family.

589
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,310
You all can rest easy
and take your break.

590
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:58,920
Aman.

591
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,640
Show them around
and help them settle in.

592
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,240
Yes, Miss.

593
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,110
Follow me.

594
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,160
What does Miss Si mean by this?

595
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,750
I… I don't know.

596
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,550
Miss Si.

597
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,750
I'm used to working hard.

598
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,400
I can't just sit around.

599
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,590
They're new and don't know

600
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,200
their way around the kitchen.

601
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,350
I'll lend a hand.

602
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,400
These shrimps are dead.

603
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,440
They can't be eaten.

604
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,200
Miss Si.

605
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,830
They were supposed to be thrown away.

606
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,790
We'll prepare fish for lunch.

607
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,480
The fish is fresh.

608
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,960
You two, don't just stand there.
Help out.

609
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:29,510
Let's go.

610
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,240
Si is more capable

611
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,720
than I expected.

612
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,920
We underestimated her.

613
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,720
We did.

614
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,920
For days, she's been dealing

615
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,790
with those who deliberately

616
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,030
caused trouble,

617
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,830
yet she never got flustered or angry.

618
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,400
She cheerily let them

619
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,680
take time off

620
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,070
while still paying their wages.

621
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,240
Meanwhile, she had already

622
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,400
hired young and strong workers

623
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,960
to replace them.

624
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,350
Some fools

625
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,830
were even happy

626
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,750
to take time off.

627
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,110
Their positions will be gone

628
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,310
by the time they return.

629
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,240
Exactly.

630
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,960
The smarter seasoned servants
quickly realized

631
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,510
Miss Si's tactics

632
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,270
and dared not stir up trouble again.

633
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,070
Let's see how long she can stay on top.

634
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,440
Qian.

635
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,070
Qian?

636
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,550
What's on your mind?

637
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,550
Nothing.

638
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,680
What were you saying, Mother?

639
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,160
Qian.

640
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,070
You must pull yourself together.

641
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,720
Did you take a look at the list

642
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,640
I gave you

643
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,400
from Matchmaker Wang

644
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,590
the other day?

645
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,240
Did anyone catch your eye?

646
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,400
I only recently returned
after my divorce.

647
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,550
Are you already

648
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,270
in such a hurry to marry me off again?

649
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,400
Do I really bother you so much?

650
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,830
That's not what I mean.

651
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,270
I'm doing this for your own good.

652
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,920
A woman's beauty fades quickly.

653
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,070
It's better to remarry
before it's too late.

654
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,350
I'm doing this for your own good.

655
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,030
Aunt Xiao

656
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,920
must have told you that

657
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,000
countless times already.

658
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,480
Don't try to sow discord

659
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,920
between my mother and me.

660
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,880
Mother is the only one

661
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,350
in this household
who truly cares for me.

662
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,480
I'm not trying to turn you against her.

663
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,550
In fact, I envy you.

664
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,680
You have a mother who loves you

665
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,240
and plans everything for you.

666
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,680
You know

667
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,110
that I lost my mother at a young age.

668
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,510
What exactly are you trying to say?

669
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,400
I want to say

670
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,240
that when parental love

671
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,640
is misplaced,

672
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,480
it harms both the child and the parent.

673
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,200
I heard

674
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,880
Aunt Xiao is arranging

675
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,440
another marriage for you.

676
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,480
Only because you provoked her.

677
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,880
You have a fine suitor like Mr. Zhen,

678
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,640
and you took away
her control of the household.

679
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,310
Of course, she's resentful.

680
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,110
With nothing better to do,

681
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,830
she's naturally fixated on me.

682
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,550
Blaming me

683
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,830
won't affect me

684
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,590
or change your predicament.

685
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,310
You took Aunt Xiao's advice
the first time

686
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,110
and married for the stature
of your husband's name.

687
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,550
How did that turn out?

688
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,240
This is the second time around.

689
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,790
Are you going
to follow her wishes again?

690
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,680
Flowers bloom in their own season.

691
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,680
Every person has their fate.

692
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,000
What choice

693
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,720
do I have now?

694
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,790
When we were little,

695
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,310
we studied together.

696
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,790
We learned

697
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,400
to not be emotionally affected

698
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,920
by external objects
and one's experiences.

699
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,440
Women's lives don't have

700
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,270
to revolve only around their maiden home

701
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,920
and marital home.

702
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:27,960
Once you step beyond,

703
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,350
you might see a wider world.

704
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,350
Why are you

705
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,920
looking at me like that?

706
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,350
Are you really doing this for me,

707
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,440
or for yourself?

708
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,000
Have you even looked

709
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,350
at Matchmaker Wang's list?

710
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,750
Prince Nan'an,

711
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,440
who's over 50 years old
yet still seeking a second wife.

712
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,110
The owner of Yuxi House,

713
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,310
who has a crippled leg, had three wives,

714
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,440
all of whom are now deceased.

715
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,160
These are the "suitors"

716
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,160
Matchmaker Wang found for me.

717
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,070
I know you feel wronged.

718
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,350
But…

719
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,310
We're in no position

720
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,720
to choose anymore.

721
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,400
Right.

722
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,350
So I can only be chosen.

723
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,960
Even in my own mother's eyes,

724
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,480
I am only fit

725
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,550
to marry these undesirables.

726
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,270
Qian.

727
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,310
How could you accuse me of that?

728
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,030
Forget it.

729
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,590
If you don't like them, so be it.

730
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,200
In a few days,

731
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,240
the Madam of the Lan's Mansion
is hosting a birthday banquet.

732
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,030
You should dress up

733
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,270
and go there with me.

734
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,550
It will be good for you

735
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,070
to show your face.

736
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,790
Show my face?

737
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,550
For what? Just to be mocked?

738
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,640
Cao Xingyu
has just been put on death row,

739
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,160
and you want me to parade around
like a peahen

740
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
looking for a mate?

741
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,070
What will people say about me?

742
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,110
You lost your authority

743
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,070
to Si,

744
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,750
so now you're forcing me

745
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,240
to find a marriage
that can outshine the main branch?

746
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,790
Am I your daughter,

747
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,350
or just a tool for your power struggle?

748
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:04,960
Enough!

749
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,440
What's gotten into you today?

750
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,960
Do you really want

751
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,550
to grow old

752
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,750
and die in this mansion?

753
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:14,880
Good.

754
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,790
You finally

755
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,350
spoke the truth.

756
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,920
So long as I stay here,

757
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,110
you feel ashamed.

758
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,550
In that case,

759
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,000
I'll leave.

760
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:29,790
Where will you go?

761
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,160
I wrote to my brother and sister-in-law.

762
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,480
Unlike you, they don't despise me.

763
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,880
Tomorrow, I'm leaving for Lingxi.

764
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,510
I won't stay here to displease you.

765
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,830
Qian!

766
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
Come back here!

767
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,480
I can't believe it.
This is infuriating.

768
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,960
I spoiled her too much.

769
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,790
I've done everything for her sake,

770
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,480
yet she has turned against me.

771
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,240
And now she wants to run to her brother?

772
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,880
The nerve of her!

773
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,110
- Madam Xiao.
- Unbelievable!

774
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,920
Don't be too upset.

775
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,720
Please sit down.

776
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,280
Miss Qian is just confused right now.

777
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,670
Perhaps her leaving Ling'an

778
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,710
might not be a bad thing.

779
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,710
How is it not bad?

780
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,920
Think about it.

781
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,590
Everyone in Ling'an

782
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,320
knows about

783
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,510
the Marquis of Changxing's case.

784
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,550
Rumors can ruin lives.

785
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,920
In Lingxi,

786
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,710
Miss Qian can clear her mind.

787
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,400
And Eldest Young Master

788
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,840
can help find her a suitable match.

789
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,400
You should look at this
from a broader perspective.

790
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,710
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

791
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,960
You have a point.

792
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,630
But

793
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,920
she's never traveled far before.

794
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,550
Why did she suddenly decide

795
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,230
to run to her brother?

796
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,510
Who put that idea in her head?

797
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,480
Madam Ruan.

798
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,400
Miss Si.

799
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,800
Why is there more allowance this month?

800
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,360
It's a small token of my appreciation.

801
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,510
Rest assured, Madam Ruan.

802
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,480
This came

803
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,360
from my personal funds.

804
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,110
Aunt Xiao doesn't know about it.

805
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,230
In that case,

806
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,190
thank you, Miss Si.

807
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,400
You're welcome, Madam Ruan.

808
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,190
By the way, Madam Ruan,

809
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,550
I heard

810
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,480
that ever since Qian

811
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,840
left for Lingxi,

812
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,960
Aunt Xiao

813
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:21,960
has been busy

814
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,280
arranging a marriage for Pei.

815
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,590
She's still under confinement,

816
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,190
yet as always,

817
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,070
her meddling knows no bounds.

818
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,150
Now that she can't count

819
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,070
on her own daughter,

820
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,670
she's set her sights

821
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,030
on someone else's.

822
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,880
But isn't this a good thing?

823
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,630
All Pei has ever wanted

824
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,320
is to marry into a good family.

825
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,840
Madam Xiao

826
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,000
was so picky back then.

827
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,400
She only wanted Miss Qian to marry up.

828
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,590
But in the end?

829
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,150
We all know how things turned out.

830
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,070
I'm just a woman,

831
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,510
but even I know

832
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,030
that when prestigious families

833
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,440
show interest in girls

834
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,710
from fallen families like ours,

835
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,440
there's usually
something wrong with them.

836
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,400
Otherwise, why wouldn't they

837
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,800
just marry someone of equal status?

838
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,070
I wasn't referring to you, of course.

839
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,670
I know.

840
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,880
I just didn't expect you

841
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,230
to be so clear-headed about it.

842
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,280
It's not that I'm clear-headed.

843
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,550
It's that my daughter was blinded

844
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,070
and led by the nose.

845
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,710
Pei.

846
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,360
Madam Xiao.

847
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,550
Pei.

848
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:38,960
Mother.

849
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,320
Madam Ruan.

850
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,550
I must speak with Pei.

851
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,630
We need some privacy.

852
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,150
You're always so exasperating.

853
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,320
Forget it.

854
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,320
The marriage is more important.

855
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,880
I won't argue with you.

856
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,960
Whose marriage?

857
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,360
You told your father you wanted to marry

858
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,800
a civil official, right?

859
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,760
Which civil official in Ling'an City

860
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,230
is the most prominent and influential?

861
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,030
It's Mr. Zhen.

862
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,230
Mr. Zhen?

863
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,840
Zhen Heng?

864
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,550
Yes.

865
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,480
I was going

866
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,190
to fix you up with a suitor.

867
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,030
But then...

868
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,880
Si got ahead of me

869
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,230
before I knew it.

870
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:30,760
Madam Ruan.

871
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,230
Let's not beat around the bush.

872
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,550
Actually,

873
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,920
I have a suitable match

874
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,190
for Pei.

875
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,710
He's someone

876
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,590
I asked Madam Zhen to introduce.

877
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,920
This man was Mr. Zhen's classmate.

878
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,510
He comes from a proper family.

879
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,920
Although he's just
a minor local official,

880
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,630
his character is exemplary.

881
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,030
And soon,

882
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,320
he'll be coming to Ling'an
to report for duty.

883
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,510
Is this true?

884
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,440
Yes.

885
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,480
But, as you know,

886
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,280
Pei and I

887
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,190
have never gotten along.

888
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,230
Also,

889
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,630
as an older cousin,

890
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,630
it's not my place
to play matchmaker for her.

891
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,880
That's not an issue, Miss Si.

892
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,440
I'll just tell Pei

893
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,000
that I found this match for her.

894
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:10,920
Of course,

895
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,840
they'll have to meet first.

896
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,070
They must like each other.

897
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,630
Leave that to me.

898
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,000
Thank you so much, Miss Si.

899
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,110
You're most welcome, Madam Ruan.

900
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,800
I just didn't expect you

901
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,960
to trust me so easily.

902
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,800
It's not really that.

903
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,070
But

904
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,670
I trust you more than I trust Xiao Shi.

905
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,960
I don't want Pei

906
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,110
to become her tool again.

907
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,550
You're quite straightforward.

908
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,590
Then I won't keep you, Madam Ruan.

909
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,800
Once he arrives in Ling'an,

910
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,070
I'll let you know.

911
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,440
I'll take my leave, then.

912
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:05,840
My Lady.

913
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,670
Why are we going through
all this trouble

914
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,320
to find Miss Pei a good match?

915
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,190
She's always
made things difficult for you.

916
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,190
I hate her.

917
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,230
Aunt Xiao has probably figured out

918
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,800
that Jiang Pei was the one
who let the matter

919
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
of the Eight Steps to Intoxication slip.

920
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,960
Once she's freed from her confinement,

921
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,480
she will make

922
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,440
Jiang Pei's life miserable.

923
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,190
I get it.

924
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,800
So we need to find her a safe way out

925
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,190
before that happens.

926
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,110
Clever girl.

927
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,320
You caught on fast.

928
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,460
Managing a household is like
cooking delicate dishes.

929
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,050
One must control the heat properly

930
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,860
and avoid impatience.

931
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,210
Excessive heat

932
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:52,860
burns the food and ruins its flavor,

933
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,340
just as mishandling family affairs

934
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,530
can lead to discord.

935
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,980
Low heat may be gentle, but if left
too long, the dish will spoil,

936
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,570
much like how delaying family issues

937
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,820
will cause trouble to accumulate.

938
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,260
Only those with wisdom and experience

939
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:10,130
can master the art of balance.

940
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,740
In tune with the changing seasons,

941
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,650
we should maintain a regular routine,
and eat in moderation.

942
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,530
A light breakfast can aid digestion,

943
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,050
while a hearty and balanced lunch
sustains the body.

944
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,940
When it comes to social engagements
and interactions,

945
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:32,920
careful planning

946
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,650
and thoughtful arrangements
are essential.

947
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,820
Managing farmland and estates
requires comprehensive oversight,

948
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,010
clear accounting,

949
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,050
prudent budgeting,
and meticulous attention to detail.

950
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,260
In the kitchen,
each person has their role,

951
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,380
with clearly defined duties.

952
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,940
From ingredient preparation
to various cooking methods

953
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,570
like pan-frying, stir-frying,
sauteing, and deep-frying,

954
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,260
and from main dishes to fruits,

955
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,900
everything is carefully balanced

956
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,490
to meet daily nutritional needs.

957
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,610
Over time,

958
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,380
even someone as picky as Uncle Anmou

959
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,650
will have no complaints.

960
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:08,860
Though Aunt Xiao resents me,

961
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,170
she has no choice
but to abide by the household rules.

962
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,130
All servants and attendants
in the household must have clear roles.

963
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,980
I will oversee them personally

964
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,380
to ensure they follow the family rules,
work diligently,

965
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,690
and fulfill their duties
to preserve family order

966
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,610
and harmony.

967
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:37,340
Greetings, Miss Si.

968
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,820
Only then will the family

969
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,170
remain prosperous

970
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,980
for generations to come.

971
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,550
The black market is full
of unsavory characters.

972
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,110
His accomplices
are probably lurking nearby.

973
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:10,960
Arrest them.

974
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,510
Yes, sir.

975
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,940
