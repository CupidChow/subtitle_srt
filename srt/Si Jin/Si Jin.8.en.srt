00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,970
[Adapted from Si Jin,
by Dong Tian De Liu Ye]

11
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,970
[Episode 8]

12
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,560
Back then, a fortune teller said

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,070
that I was ill-fated.

14
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,000
He said I would bring disaster
upon the family.

15
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,120
She feared that she might be implicated
and lose favor,

16
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,920
so she came up with a way

17
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:41,400
to make my father

18
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,950
send me to somewhere distant.

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,070
That's the gist of it.

20
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,640
In the past,

21
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,200
he wasn't willing
to talk about his background.

22
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,759
I only know
that he was shunned by his family,

23
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,950
and he was exiled to guard
the frontier.

24
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,920
I never expected him

25
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:52,870
to have

26
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,120
a similar fate as me.

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,150
From birth,

28
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,950
he was burdened
with the fate of being a jinx.

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,400
Could that fortune teller

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,479
be a fraud

31
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,080
who tried to seek wealth or fame

32
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,120
with that claim?

33
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,680
If even it's a fraud,

34
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,000
it's pointless

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
to pursue this now.

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,800
In the end,

37
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,520
it's the parents

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,560
who made the decision.

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,590
You say it's pointless,

40
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,750
but I believe

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,400
this is something you must do.

42
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,910
If the weak

43
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,960
are unjustly blamed

44
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,910
with baseless accusations

45
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,960
by others

46
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,430
yet refuse to seek the truth

47
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,430
or fight back,

48
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,910
they only validate

49
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,030
those wicked people's lies

50
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,750
and become their accomplices.

51
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,360
If you were in my shoes,

52
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,360
would you pursue it

53
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,630
after being framed?

54
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,710
If I were framed,

55
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,710
I'd make sure those responsible

56
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,310
pay the price.

57
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,560
Mr. Yu,

58
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,400
after all these years,

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,079
don't you wish to know the truth?

60
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,190
Those two
from the Capital Administration Office

61
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,870
are giving me a headache.

62
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,360
Who reported the Marquis' mansion

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,240
for burying bodies?

64
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,400
It was

65
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,190
the fourth young lady
of the Count of Dongping's Mansion,

66
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,280
Jiang Si.

67
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,960
Cao Xingyu

68
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,240
is her cousin's husband.

69
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,840
That day,

70
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,079
her cousin, Jiang Qian,

71
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,470
invited her sisters and cousins

72
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,520
to the Marquis of Changxing's Mansion.

73
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,000
Miss Si couldn't fall asleep,

74
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,430
so she went to the garden.

75
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,079
She stumbled upon the servants
burying the body.

76
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
So she reported it

77
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,710
to the Capital Administration Office.

78
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,750
But then,

79
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,660
Cao Xingyu twisted the truth and accused

80
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,190
his own wife

81
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,750
of ordering the servant
to commit murder.

82
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,590
Jiang Si

83
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
stepped forward as a witness.

84
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,360
The fourth young lady
of the Jiang family?

85
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,910
She's also no ordinary woman.

86
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,870
She dares to stand against
the Marquis of Changxing.

87
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,360
They sure are bold.

88
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,400
None of them are to be underestimated.

89
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,470
Thank...

90
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,430

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,080
once arrested Cao Xingyu

95
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,800
on charges of conspiring with Nanwu.

96
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,470
Fortunately,

97
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,190
His Majesty didn't mention it this time.

98
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,190
It seems

99
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,040
we've avoided the trouble for now.

100
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,800
My brother

101
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,510
is inscrutable.

102
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,720
Now that he keeps it to himself,

103
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,390
it may lead to real trouble.

104
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,600
Your Majesty.

105
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,160

109
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,630
Put them away.

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,750
Speak no more about this.

111
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,950
Despite knowing something is amiss,

112
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,870
you choose to set it aside.

113
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,270
Why, Your Majesty?

114
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,630

have infiltrated among us

115
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,000
shockingly

116
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,190
deep.

117
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,920
They might find any opportunity

118
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,630
to frame important officials around me.

119
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,950
We need to be vigilant.

120
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,240

00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,040
Please punish me, Father.

122
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,190

- Please punish me, Father.
- Please punish me, Father.

so late at night.

129
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,680
What have you done wrong?

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,390
Father,

131
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,830
[Yu Lang, the Crown Prince]
though I have met the heir apparent...

132
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,000
No, it's the criminal Cao Xingyu.

133
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,070
I've met him a few times,

134
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,240
but we're not exactly close.

135
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,680
I had no idea

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,390
of his crime at all.

137
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,510
Father, though the Marquis of Changxing

138
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,270
[Yu Zhang, the Prince Qi]
and I have been on bad terms,

139

there has not been such a heinous murder

140
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,240
in Ling'an

141
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,750
for many years.

142
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,720
The people of Ling'an praise you

143
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,430
for personally interrogating Cao Xingyu.

144
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,160
Your wisdom is unparalleled, Father.

145
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,680
- Your wisdom is unparalleled, Father.
- Your wisdom is unparalleled, Father.

146
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,310
I see.

147
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,800
You all came here for Cao Xingyu's case.

148
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
All right. Get up.

149
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,270
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you, Father.

150
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,040
Since you are all here,

151
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,630
I have a question for you.

152
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,510
Do you think

153
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,240
I have been too strict

154
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,680
with you?

155
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,560
Crown Prince, answer me.

156
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,240
Father,

157
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,680
you're strict with me

158
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,070
for my own good

159
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,560
and for the good of the nation.

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,270
So you do think I'm strict?

161
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,830
No.

162
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,190
No, you're not strict at all.

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,040
Look how frightened you are.

164
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,120
Prince Qi, your turn.

165
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,720
Father,

166
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,830
as princes,

167
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,750
we enjoy the people's offerings.

168
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,310
We must hold ourselves
to strict standards.

169
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,120
Enough. Stop.

170
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,480
You're not answering my question.

171
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
I have eight sons and six daughters,

172
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,950
yet my duty keeps me occupied.

173
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,310
I don't have much energy

174
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,560
to guide most of you.

175
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,480
Of course,

176
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,750
the Crown Prince is my heir.

177
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,120
Naturally, I'm strict with him.

178
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,360
If you have anything

179
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,560
on your mind,

180
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,480
speak freely tonight.

181
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,720
Don't bottle it up.

182
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,480
Holding things in for too long

183
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,560
can push a person over the edge,

184
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,240
leading them to seek solace

185
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,720
in inappropriate ways.

186
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,120
Do you understand?

187
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,430
- We shall obey your order, Father.
- We shall obey your order, Father.

188
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
Someone is missing here.

189
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,750
Your Majesty,

190

Father.

378
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,910
All I do is make merry.

379
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,120
Seems like

380
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,240
I inherited that from you.

381
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:32,960
Get out of here.

382
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,550
Didn't I tell you

383
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,200
I picked you up somewhere?

384
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,480
Oh, really?

385
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,390
No wonder you're so mean to me.

386
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,910
By the way, Si,

387
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,670
don't let your grandmother find out

388
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,720
about your plan.

389
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,960
Like most people in Ling'an,

390
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,960
she looks down

391
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,150
on merchants,

392
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,670
let alone allowing

393
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,670
the legitimate daughter of the count
to go into business.

394
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,550
Do you understand?

395
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,240
I understand, Father.

396
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,670
Father.

397
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,550
Rue

398
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,910
really works.

399
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,120
These books have been stored
for a whole year,

400
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,270
and there isn't a single bug bite

401
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,320
found on them.

402
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,120
They're intact.

403
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,240
My daughter is so clever.

404
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,080
Oh, right, Father,

405
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,480
I rarely hear you talk

406
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,750
about the Directorate of Astronomy

407
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,630
or see you catching up

408
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,080
with your former colleagues.

409
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,790
After your mother passed,

410
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,000
I lost my passion for the job,

411
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,120
so I resigned.

412
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,080
I've always thought

413
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,670
there was something mysterious

414
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,910
about observing the stars at night.

415
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,030
You can predict the weather

416
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,600
and foresee fortunes.

417
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,320
Studying the universe

418
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,080
is indeed fascinating.

419
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,790
But in the Directorate of Astronomy,

420
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,440
it's not just about the universe.

421
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,240
Instead, there are

422
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,550
more flatterers

423
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,310
and helpless situations.

424
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,200
Father.

425
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,030
Do you remember

426
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,720
you used to force me

427
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,270
to practice calligraphy?

428
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,200
Look,

429
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,400
I found a copybook.

430
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,640
I remember this copybook.

431
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,240
Back then,

432
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,829
every time I bought one,

433
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,440
it would disappear.

434
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,960
It was very strange.

435
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,680
I threw them all away.

436
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,960
I helped you throw out a few.

437
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,349
That explains why your handwriting

438
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,880
looks like a chicken scratch.

439
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,350
Don't sell this.

440
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,270
Take it back and keep practicing.

441
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,030
No.

442
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:31,960
I'll sell this one first.

443
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,270
Aji, quick!

444
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,790
Sell this copybook first!

445
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,830
Stop right there!

446
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,960
Don't sell that one.

447
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,920
If you do,

448
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,960
you'll be grounded for a whole month!

449
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,720
Don't sell it.

450
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,790
Stop right there!

451
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,590
My Lady,

452
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,880
[Lushengxiang Store]
we still can't find anyone

453
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,550
willing to work for our store.

454
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,920
The women of Ling'an City
refused outright

455
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,640
when they heard about doing business.

456
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,830
We're about to open the store,

457
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,350
but we're still short on manpower.

458
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,590
What should we do?

459
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,790
Miss Chuchu.

460
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,270
Chuchu.

461
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,550
I heard from Jiang Zhan

462
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,240
that you were looking for help.

463
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
I brought someone for you.

464
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,350
[Rou'er]
Nice to meet you, Miss Jiang.

465
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,030
Congratulations

466
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,000
on opening your new shop.

467
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,110
Nice to meet you, too, Miss Rou'er.

468
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,480
Chuchu,

469
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,480
you are

470
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
a godsend.

471
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,110
Rest assured.

472
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,440
Rou'er is reliable.

473
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,960
She's from my hometown.

474
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,680
She once

475
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,880
ran a rouge store.

476
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,270
Chief,

477
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,110
you cracked the case
of Marquis of Changxing's Mansion

478
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,240
and gained His Majesty's support.

479
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,030
Many officials

480
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,160
are trying to cozy up to us.

481
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,110
Mr. Zhao
from the Secretariat Rear Section

482
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,590
invites you...

483
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,240
I'm too busy to go.

484
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,200
Yes, Chief.

485
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,030
Yu.

486
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:32,830
Jiang.

487
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,480
What a coincidence.

488
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,480
- Looks like you've struck it rich.
- Keep walking.

489
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,510
You bought so many things.

490
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,510
Si is opening a fragrance store

491
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,310
the day after tomorrow.

492
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,270
So I bought her some gifts.

493
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,400
She's opening a fragrance store?

494
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,270
I'm glad I ran into you.

495
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,310
I was just about

496
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,510
to send you the invitation.

497
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,590
You must come by then.

498
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,110
I'm sorry.

499
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,640
Chief is busy on that day.

500
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,240
No, I'm not busy.

501
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,550
I can make time for it.

502
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,510
Of course, I'll be there.

503
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,350
Good to know.

504
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Lushengxiang.
[*Literally "Fragrant Dew"]

505
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,160
What a nice name.

506
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,400
Long Dan.

507
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,350
Long Dan.

508
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,880
What's wrong, Chief?

509
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,240
Where did you put it?

510
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,550
What?

511
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,030
The thing I asked you to bring.

512
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,880
Where did you put it?

513
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,590
You didn't ask me to bring anything.

514
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,240
What is it?

515
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,880
Where's my bronze mirror?

516
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,200
Where did you put it?

517
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,640
We don't have one.

518
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,550
Borrow one from our neighbor.

519
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,350
Now. Quickly.

520
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:28,880
I...

521
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,680
Chief.

522
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,750
Bronze mirror.

523
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,960
Here's a bronze mirror.

524
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:00,920
Slow down.

525
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,640
Here.

526
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,790
Chief, are you going to meet Miss Jiang

527
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
in this attire?

528
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,400
How do I look?

529
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,240
You're...

530
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,880
You're incredibly dashing.

531
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,030
You'll definitely amaze

532
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,110
Miss Jiang.

533
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,110
Haven't I always been so dashing?

534
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,590
Yes. Right.

535
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,790
Sound the gong at the auspicious hour

536
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,200
to mark the grand opening,

537
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,350
summoning luck and blessings.

538
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,480
Let the mirror reflect your heart,
and conduct business with devotion,

539
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,550
integrity, and discipline.

540
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,070
The mellow fragrance

541
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,550
spreads far and wide.

542
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,680
Place the gourd

543
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,880
to welcome fortune.

544
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,480
May this new business flourish.

545
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,030
Look at those gentlemen there.

546
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,110
They're so handsome.

547
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,310
Impressive, Yu.

548
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,920
You look dashing today.

549
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,750
Mr. Zhen, thank you for coming.

550
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,440
Thank you.

551
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,750
Mr. Zhen, didn't you say

552
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,920
that civil servants mustn't slack off

553
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,070
even on their off days?

554
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,720
I did.

555
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,510
But Miss Jiang

556
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,550
personally came

557
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,790
to deliver an invitation yesterday.

558
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,750
How could I say no

559
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,000
to such a wonderful occasion?

560
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,070
Thank you so much.

561
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,240
Really?

562
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,720
Why?

563
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,720
Did you not receive an invitation

564
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,790
from Miss Jiang, Commandant Yu?

565
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,440
Of course, I did.

566
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,750
That's why I'm here.

567
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,000
We happened to run into each other

00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,110
You mean Mr. Zhen's mother?

948
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,320
Oh, so it's her.

949
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,440
No wonder

950
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,480
she seems

951
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,030
to like Jiang Si a lot.

952
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,230
She didn't even glance at the fragrances

953
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,070
introduced by others,

954
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,440
but when Jiang Si spoke,

955
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,920
she was so focused.

956
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,400
I feel like she

957
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,590
didn't come here to buy fragrances,

958
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,670
but rather

959
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,800
to see Jiang Si.

960
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,110
Qi, do you think

961
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,400
she's looking for

962
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,190
a daughter-in-law?

963
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,190
Impossible.

964
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,440
Absolutely impossible.

965
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,440
Take care, Madam.

966
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,070
Please come again.

967
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,630
Mr. Yu.

968
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,670
You're here too, Miss Jiang.

969
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,400
What are you doing here, Mr. Yu?

970
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,510
Are you investigating a case?

971
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,510
No, I was just passing by

972
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,710
and brought some food for Chuchu.

973
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,000
But I...

974
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,960
Go on.

975
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,070
Wash it before you eat.

976
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,320
I washed it already.

977
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,320
Wash it properly.

978
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,280
I...

979
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,400
She has no sense of hygiene.

980
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,960
Mr. Yu,

981
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,710
do fighters

982
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,190
use Autumn Foliage too?

983
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,400
We fighters like autumn.

984
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,760
But now it's summer.

985
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,000
Mr. Yu, please give me a moment.

986

[Invitation]

987
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,480
I wanted to visit

988
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,880
your mansion today.

989
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,190
My grandmother's birthday banquet
is in two days.

990
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,630
On behalf
of the Count of Dongping's Mansion,

991
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,880
I'd like to invite you

992
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,360
to my grandmother's birthday banquet.

993
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,630
Thank you

994
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,960
for all your help before.

995
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,280
Sure. I'll be there.

996
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,030
Hold on.

997
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,510
Please sit, dear.

998
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,400
Thank you, dear.

999
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,280
What would you like to drink?

1000
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,070
Sir,

1001
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,070
the weather is hot.

1002
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:05,920
We'd like some herbal tea.

1003
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:06,630
All right.

1004
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,110
Wait.

1005
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,960
The tea is too cooling for her body.

1006
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,030
It'd be better if you had floral tea.

1007
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,630
My wife prefers that.

1008
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:13,710
Sure.

1009
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,340
[Zhu Ziyu, Jiang Yi's husband]

1010
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,030
You're sweating.

1011
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,550
You don't always have to indulge me.

1012
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,230
It's fine.

1013
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,360
The long journey

1014
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,550
must have been tiring for you.

1015
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,400
You rarely get to visit
your parents' house.

1016
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,230
It wasn't tiring at all.

1017
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,710
As long as you're safe and happy,

1018
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,320
that's all I wish for.

1019
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,960
Here's your tea.

1020
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,360
Thank you, sir.

1021
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:48,840
Please enjoy.

1022
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,150
By the way,

1023
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,190
tomorrow's your grandmother's birthday.

1024
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,150
Spend more time catching up with Yi

1025
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,590
when you see her.

1026
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,710
Ask her

1027
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,110
how she has been.

1028
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,230
All right, Father.

1029
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,630
I miss her too.

1030
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,920
I owe Yi

1031
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,150
too much.

1032
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,800
When she was born,

1033
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,230
I was young

1034
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,920
and only cared about your mother.

1035
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,230
I didn't give her

1036
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
enough attention.

1037
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,510
She's always been

1038
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,150
considerate and capable
since she was a kid.

1039
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,030
She never makes me worry.

1040
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,150
But fortunately,

1041
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,320
she married a good husband.

and treats her well.

1045
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,110
Don't worry, Father.

1046
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,880
Yi is such a nice person.

1047
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,670
She'll surely lead a happy life.

1048
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,800
All right. I should get going.

1049
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,280

1053

Why?

Heng, you have fine taste.

1062

about how you were doing.
