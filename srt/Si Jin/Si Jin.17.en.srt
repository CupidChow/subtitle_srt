13
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,960
Where are you going?

14
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,030
After Arong's death,

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,800
I have nowhere to return to.

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,110
To me,

17
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,310
it's better to find a temple

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,310
and seek solace within.

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,240
I'm bidding farewell

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,360
to you before leaving.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,640
Take care.

22
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,600
Miss Jiang,

23
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,750
the night is damp and cold.

24
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,080
Be careful not to catch a chill.

25
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,390
Zhen,

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,200
luckily, you came here in time.

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,110
If not, Magistrate Jia

28
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,110
would've swept this case

29
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,960
under the rug.

30
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,080
Why are you still
pulling a long face, then?

31
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,590
It's because I've heard

32
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,270
that many women

33
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,430
who once went to Shan'an Hall

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,670
are now being pushed

35
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,829
to the brink of suicide
by their in-laws.

36
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,270
So I was wondering

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,829
if I had done the wrong thing.

38
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,200
You're wrong.

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,550
You're wrong for feeling guilty

40
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,710
about the right deed you've done.

41
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,550
Chief,

42
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,640
since you wish

43
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,590
to win Miss Si's heart,

44
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,390
why did you

45
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,590
invite Mr. Zhen here?

46
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,829
And now,

47
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,800
though you were the one
who helped her all along,

48
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,920
Mr. Zhen is the one

49
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,520
taking all the credit.

50
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,960
I understand her wishes

51
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,990
and have helped fulfill them.

52
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,920
In the end, I did help her,

53
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,079
and the rest doesn't matter.

54
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,390
If that's the case,

55
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,150
why did you make me

56
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,480
travel ten li overnight

57
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,800
just to buy Miss Jiang

58
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,200
some candied cherries?

59
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,670
This...

60
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,040
Don't overthink it.

61
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,240
It wasn't your fault.

62
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,390
You were brave.

63
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,040
Sorry for the interruption.

64
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,110
Mr. Zhen, after such a long
and arduous journey,

65
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,080
you must be exhausted.

66
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,800
Do you want to give this a try?

67
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
I dislike sweet food.

68
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,800
Understood.

69

Miss Jiang.

70
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,480
Why don't you try some candied cherries?

71
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,670
Commandant Yu,
you're good at consoling people indeed.

72
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,920
Miss Jiang cheered up

73
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,430
the instant you showed up.

74
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,240
Yes.

75
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,150
How is it? Is it sweet?

76
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,240
Yes.

that I liked candied cherries?

79
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,800
I guessed

80
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,360
that you liked candied cherries.

81
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,040
I traveled ten li

83
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,829
Thank you.

84
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,760
Another bite?

85
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,480
Commandant Yu, maybe I should also...

86
00:03:59,079 --> 00:03:59,800
Mr. Zhen.

87
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,960
I almost forgot to tell you this.

88
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,670
You should go pack your belongings now.

89
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,360
We'll depart
for the Capital Administration Office tomorrow.

00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,710
Jiang has already entrusted me
with the duty

91
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,480
of escorting Miss Jiang back tomorrow.

92
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,710
Why the rush?

93
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,710
You have official duties to attend to.

94
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,960
Miss Jiang,
why don't you have another one?

95
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,960
You should let Mr. Zhen try one.

96
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,640
He said he disliked sweet food.

97
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,150

The Baiyun Temple atop Baiyun Mountain

100
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,760
has always been bustling
with worshippers.

101
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,120
The people of Lingshui

102
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,350
love to make wishes in the temple.

103
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,390
Is that so?

104
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,350
My sister visits the temple

105
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,760
to make wishes and return the favor

106
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,320
every year.

107
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,080
I'm sure she's here today.

108
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,200

She's merely offering incense
to Baiyun Temple.

What's with the kowtow

113
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,640
and the sutras?

114
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,120
If outsiders see this,

115
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,520
who knows how they'll gossip

116
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,680
about me as a mother-in-law?

117
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,000
Mother.

118
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,910
Yi has already gone on a three-day fast

119
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,230
for this praying ceremony.

120
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,200
She's putting in so much effort,

121
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,230
all because she wants to bear

122
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,030
a grandson for the Zhu family.

123
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,150
What's the point?

124
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,790
We've tried all kinds
of methods all these years.

125
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,560
She already took incense ash water.

126
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,520
We hung realgar around her as well.

127
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,200
None of the methods worked.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,390
Mother.

129
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,909
Enough already.
You're the only one defending her.

130
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,230
If it were any other family,

131
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,909
she'd have been cast out long ago
for bearing

132
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,350
only a daughter in seven years.

133
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,150
I, Jiang of the Zhu family,

134
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,320
pray for the blessings
of the Child-Bestowing Deity.

135
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,590
May I give birth to a son

136
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,470
to continue the family lineage.

137
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,200
I vow to practice asceticism for life.

138
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,350
I shall abstain from meat and alcohol,

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,120
extinguish my greed
and renounce my pleasures.

140
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,640

144
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,750
Mother, Yi has fainted.

145

Let's send her to a medical center.

146
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,630
What should we do now?

147
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,799
The nearest medical center
is quite far away.

148

She fainted due to the heat.

158
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,960
- Si.
- How are you feeling?

159
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,990
What are you doing here?

160
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,280
Dear, put me down.

161
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,510
Hurry and send Yi to the medical center.

162
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:04,870
Yes.

163
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,510
Si.

164
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,990
I'm fine.

165
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:07,990
Yi, how are you feeling?

166
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,920
I'm fine.

167
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,440
Mother-in-law.

168
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,630
It's all my fault.

169
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,200
I've made you worry.

170
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,160
It's frustrating to look at

171
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,160
your sickly complexion.

172
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,560
Go. Take another carriage.

173
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,040
Stop appearing in front of me.

174
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,080
Yes, Mother-in-law.

175
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,680
Yi, sorry to put you through this.

176
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,080
I'll join you in another carriage.

177
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:31,960
Ziyu,

178
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
you shall take my carriage.

179
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,960
I need to talk to you.

180
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,800
Mother, Yi and I
will take the same carriage.

181
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,280
Her sister is keeping her company.

182
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,870
You don't need to worry about her.

183
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,350
Let's go back.

184
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,590
Ziyu, hurry.

185
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,110
I'm fine.

186
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
You should leave with Mother-in-law.

187
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,800
Si is here with me.

188
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,470
I'll be fine.

189
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,750
Si, sorry for the trouble.

190
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,750
Yi, how do you feel?

191
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,920
Let me see.

192
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,470
It must have hurt.

193
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,080
Yi, it must have been really painful.

194
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:36,870
I'm all right.

195
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,280
Yi, I can't rest at ease

196
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,080
when you're in this state.

197
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Stop worrying about me.

198
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,870
You saw it just now.

199
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,630
Your brother-in-law treats me well.

200
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,750
If he did treat you well,

201
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,160
why would he let you...

202
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,990
By the way, where's Zhan?

203
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,040
Didn't you say

204
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,160
that you would pay respect
to our ancestors together?

205
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,800
We traveled together initially.

206
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,800
But something cropped up,
and his journey was delayed.

207
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,960
He needs to rush back

208
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,990
to report for duty
as an Imperial Insignia Guard.

209
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,320
So he has returned to Ling'an first.

210
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,080
I heard that something
happened to him before this.

211
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:12,960
I was worried sick.

212
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,800
After that, I knew from your letter

213
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,040
that he had returned safely.

214
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,400
I was only able to rest at ease by then.

215
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,510
But after the incident,

216
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,710
he was practically reborn.

217
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,320
I suppose it was a blessing in disguise.

218
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,110
What's wrong with the carriage?

219
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,160
What's wrong?

220
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,960
Yi, hold tight.

221
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,350
All right.

222
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,630
My Lady!

223
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,560
Catch up to them!

224
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,680
What was that sound?

225
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,800
Turn back and catch up to them.

226
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,470
Coachman!

227
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,830
Watch out!

228
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,590
Si, watch out!

229
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,830
Help!

230
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,110
Coachman!

231
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,180
[Xie Yinlou,
Commandant of Lingshui County]

232
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,590
How are you? Are you both all right?

233
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,350
We're fine.

234
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,040
Are you two hurt?

235
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,680
We're fine.

236
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,630
Come on, Yi.

237
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,800
Yi, are you all right?

238
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,590
I'm fine.

239
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,990
Thank you, mister.

240
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,080
Don't mention it.

241
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,590
My Lady!

242
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,510
Chief!

243
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,440
We're fine.

244
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,560
My Lady, are you all right?

245
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,200
I'm fine.

246
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,440
I'm fine.

247
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,800
Yinlou, it's you.

248
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,200
Miss Jiang Si.

249
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,590
What brings you to Lingshui?

250
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,200
I came here to visit my sister.

251
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,110
But you,

252
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,320
it's been years since we last met.

253
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,680
Why are you here as well?

254
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,830
You might not know this,

255
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,200
but I've been serving as a commandant

256
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,200
in Lingshui for a few years now.

257
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Thank you, Yinlou.

258
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,870
You saved us just now.

259
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:29,920
Don't mention it.

260
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,710
Yi, this is Yinlou.

261
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,630
He lived in our mansion

262
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,990
when we were little.

263
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,870
Don't you remember him?

264
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,710
Commandant Xie,
thank you for rescuing us.

265
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,510
Thank you, Mr. Xie and Mr. Yu.

266
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,680
I'm afraid Yi and Si

267
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,200
would've been in danger

268
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,680
had you two not rescued them.

269
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,200
Mr. Zhu, don't mention it.

270
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,680
Commandant Xie, you're
an excellent martial artist.

271
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,830
I'm truly impressed.

272
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,990
You flatter me.

273
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,920
Mr. Yu, you were the one
who turned the tide.

274
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,750
Not only were you skillful,
but you were gutsy too.

275
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,440
You risked your life to rescue them.

276
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,560
I'm truly impressed.

277
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,710
Let's stop flattering each other.

278
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,110
Both of us did great.

279
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,800
Ziyu, since everyone is fine,

280
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,280
we should return to the mansion.

281
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,280
Mr. Xie, I'll remember

282
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,560
your kindness.

283
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,080
I'll visit you another day
to thank you properly.

284
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,160
Farewell.

285
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:30,750
Yi,

286
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,040
you can return with Ziyu.

287
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,920
Aman and I

288
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,870
will go back with Mr. Yu.

289
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,510
All right. See you later.

290
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,590
Ziyu, look after Yi.

291
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,830
Don't worry about me.

292
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,830
I think the incident

293
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,510
was more than just an accident.

294
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,470
The horse was fine.

295
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,560
How did it suddenly get startled?

296
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,200
I think someone was deliberately

297
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,440
trying to harm my sister.

298
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,160
Harm her?

299
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,040
Yes.

300
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,920
Who do you think is the culprit?

301
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,040
I think it's Madam Zhu.

302
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,320
She was the one

303
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,750
who insisted on making
Yi take this carriage.

304
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,510
In the past, Yi always wrote to me

305
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,750
about the great life she was leading

306
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,830
in the Zhu family.

307
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,990
I had no idea how badly Madam Zhu

308
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,200
had been treating her

309
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,590
until I saw it with my own eyes today.

310
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,830
It breaks my heart
to see her treated this way.

311
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,710
Whoever the culprit is,

312
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,830
I'll stay and help you

313
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,920
uncover the truth before I leave.

314
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:35,830
All right.

315
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,240
[Jiang]

316
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,920
Mr. Zhan, the time is nearly up.

317
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,680
Zhan, are you practicing
martial arts again?

318
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,350
Come here.

319
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,110
Hurry and come here.

320
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,200
Zhan, you're working so hard.

321
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,640
I can't help but worry about you.

322
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,359
Sit down.

323
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,960
Look at

324
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,750
what I've brought you.

325
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,400
Sit down and take a break.

326
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,470
Have some tea.

327
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,359
Have a cup of tea first
to soothe your throat.

328
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,440
Thank you, Aunt Xiao.

329
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,359
Why are you so courteous?

330
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,990
We're a family. Don't stand on ceremony.

331
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
It's different now.

332
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,230
You're truly different now.

333
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,840
Ever since you became
an Imperial Insignia Guard,

334
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,400
you've changed completely.

335
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,640
You've made something of yourself.

336
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,920
This is great.

337
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,920
In the future,

338
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,360
when you join the officialdom,

339
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,440
you and your uncle

340
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,230
can look after each other.

341
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,230
Aunt Xiao.

342
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,710
Uncle Anmou

343
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,120
is a proper official.

344
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,880
I'm just a mere Imperial Insignia Guard.

345
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:58,840
I can't look after him.

346
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,600
My goodness.

347
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
What are you saying?

348
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,360
What do you mean

349
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,880
by a mere Imperial Insignia Guard?

350
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,160
You are now

351
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,750
serving by His Majesty's side.

352
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,710
If you serve His Majesty well,
there's a chance

353
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,880
you could become his personal guard.

354
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,960
Aunt Xiao, seems like
you know that better than me.

355
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,680
Zhan, I'm truly happy to see you

356
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,230
become an Imperial Insignia Guard.

357
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:24,990
I can tell.

358
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,680
You see, the two branches of the family

359
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,440
do compete with each other

360
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,790
from time to time.

361
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,750
But once we're outside the mansion,

362
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,990
we stand as one,

363
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,400
and our fates are intertwined.

364
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
After all, we're all part
of the Jiang family.

365
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,310
Yes

366
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,750
and no.

367
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,550
What do you mean by no?

368
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,990
As a family,

369
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,310
we should stand by each other,

370
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,470
not turn against one another
in times of trouble.

371
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,640
Now that you are
an Imperial Insignia Guard,

372
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,880
the way you speak has changed too.

373
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,840
I'm telling you
to follow your uncle's lead

374
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,310
not just for you to support him.

375
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,440

00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,510
Stop copying the sutras.

562
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,710
I'm fine.

563
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,990
Chief, after Mr. Chu

564
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,030
left the Directorate of Astronomy,

565
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,990
he came to Lingshui.

566
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,510
He's at the restaurant ahead.

567
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,510
What about Mr. Xiao?

568
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,230
He went insane.

569
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,160
He went insane?

570
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:10,750
Yes.

571
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,920
I heard that he went insane

572
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,550
after leaving his post.

573
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,440
They say he was traumatized

574
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,270
by his wife's passing,

575
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,120
and it's been years now.

576
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,070
All right. Let's meet

577
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,990
the legendary Mr. Chu.

578
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,160
Chief.

579
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
The one dozing off on the table

580
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,440
is Mr. Chu.

581
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,030
What are you doing?

582
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,070
Give it back.

583
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,200
Mr. Top Scholar,

584
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,960
how did you end up like this?

585
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:03,230
There's a universe within this cup.

586
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,030
Back then, you were doing well

587
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,400
in the Directorate of Astronomy.

588
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,120
Why did you transfer

589
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
to this small county voluntarily?

590
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,840
My mother was seriously ill.

591
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,030
So I came home
to fulfill my filial duties.

592
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,200
What has this got to do with you?

593
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,640
Let's talk about something
related to me, then.

594
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,680
The 5th day of the 5th month,
in the 3rd year of the Jingming era.

595
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:27,680
You two...

596
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,440
Who exactly are you?

597
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,160
I don't know anything.

598
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,360
Stop asking me.

599
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,310
Stop asking me.

600
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,790
The Seventh Prince
as the harbinger of misfortune,

601
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,880
were you the one who submitted
the memorial to the throne?

602
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,120
Didn't you say back then that the matter

603
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,310
with the Seventh Prince

604
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:39,920
was already settled?

605
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,230
You said you would stop cornering me.

606
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,920
Since we're already here,

607
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,120
you have to tell us the truth

608
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,360
by hook or by crook.

609
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,510
I only submitted the memorial.

610
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,840
The rest has nothing to do with me.

611
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,360
Are you trying to drive me to my death?

612
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
What more do you want from me?

613
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,400
I don't know anything!

614
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,600
Stop asking me!

615
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,550
Stop asking me!

616
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,120
Stop right there!

617
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,840
I don't know anything!

618
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,160
Chief.

619
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,200
Forget it.

620
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,120
Knowing that is enough.

621
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,640
[Zhu's Mansion]

622
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,840
Are you going to depart soon?

623
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,070
Yi and I are going to pay respect
to our ancestors today.

624
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,880
That's why I'm taking charge
of the carriage.

625
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,960
Commandant Yu, you shouldn't do so.

626
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:16,680
It's fine.

627
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,070
I'm free anyway.

628
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,070
Well then, thank you, Commandant Yu.

629
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:27,990
Si.

630
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,750
Yi.

631
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,160
Dear?

632
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,920
Didn't you invite

633
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,360
Scholar Wang and the rest
to a poetry gathering?

634
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,310
I still can't rest at ease

635
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,400
after giving it some thought.

636
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,990
You just had an accident.

637
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,790
How could I be in the mood

638
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,790
to attend a poetry gathering?

639
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,230
I'll man the carriage myself today.

640
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,710
Thank you, Dear.

641
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,120
So you don't need me anymore, right?

642
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,360
Follow us on horseback.

643
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,400
Si,

644
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,440
you and Commandant Yu...

645
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,360
Yi, what are you trying to say?

646
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,160
He looks after you all the time.

647
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
He always has
your best interests at heart.

648
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,470
Does he fancy you?

649
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,550
Yi, that's not the case.

650
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,070
Commandant Yu is just worried

651
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,750
that something might happen to us again.

652
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,360
I can tell that he's a good man

653
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,920
after yesterday's incident.

654
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,550
But even if you two do fancy each other,

655
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,230
you still have to obey
our parents' wishes.

656
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,200
Here's a piece of advice.

657
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,400
Romantic relationships

658
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,960
must be handled with proper boundaries.

659
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,440
Help!

660
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:29,880
Stop right there!

661
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,840
Help!

662
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,600
You wretch!

663
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,510
Stop right there!

664
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,920
Help!

665
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,160
Stop right there!

666
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,470
Help!

667
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,920
Stop right there, you wretch!

668
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,030
We just helped you

669
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:41,880
bury your father.

670
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,230
And now you are going back on your word?

671
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,680
I beg you. Please spare me.

672
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,200
You wretch.

673
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,070
You agreed to sell yourself
to bury your father.

674
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,400
The three of us

675
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,470
bought you with our money.

676
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,270
Now, you belong to us.

677
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,990
You must serve us

678
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,640
as our wives in turn.

679
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,200
Get her!

680
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,470
Don't come near me!

681
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,960
Come with us!

682
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,960
Long Dan!

683
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Let go of me!

684
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,510
Get up!

685
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,640
[Qing'er]

686
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,470
Miss.

687
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,360
You look like a kind person.

688
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,750
Please save me.

689
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,990
I'm willing to serve you

690
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,920
as repayment.

691
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,920
We bought her

692
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,440
with ten taels.

693
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,790
We still have her indenture with us.

694
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:21,600
You all...

695
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,120
You all are trying to abduct a girl!

696
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:23,990
No.

697
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,640
Miss.

698
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,680
I would rather die

699
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,360
than serve them.

700
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,640
Please do a kind deed and help me out.

701
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,680
You can make the call.

702
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,550
Since that's the case,

703
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:38,790
I...

704
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,310
Wait.

705
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,750
Miss,

706
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,920
did you promise them
you would sell yourself to them

707
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,030
in exchange for their burial service?

708
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:45,790
Have they

709
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,550
helped you

710
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
bury your father?

711
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,880
I... I did make them a promise.

712
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,990
But I can't serve

713
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,360
three husbands at once.

714
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,070
They're hooligans.

715
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,230
Miss, please help me.

716
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,880
Miss.

717
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,840
I'm begging you.

718
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,680
Aman.

719
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,710
I have 20 taels worth of banknotes here.

720
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,990
Give me

721
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,640
her indenture.

722
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,360
It...

723
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,600
What is it?

724
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,550
Aren't 20 taels enough?

725
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,710
Hurry

726
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,920
and give me an answer.

727
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,510
What's with

728
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,400
the glances?

729
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,920
Let's go.

730
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:41,140
[Xu Qing'er's Indenture]

731
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,120
Miss, here's your indenture.

732
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,840
Keep it safe.

733
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:46,880
You can leave.

734
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,710
Yi, let's go.

735
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,270
Miss,

736
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,310
I have no way to repay your kindness.

737
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,880
I'll work tirelessly

738
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:55,640
to serve you.

739
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,680
Miss, if you dismiss me,

740
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,600
I'll have nowhere to go.

741
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,920
If the three hooligans

742
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,550
try to pester me again,

743
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,440
I...

744
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:03,960
Miss,

745
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,510
we've redeemed

746
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,280
your indenture for you.

747
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,110
Even if you have nowhere to go,

748
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,320
why should we...?

749
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,880
Si, forget it.

750
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,840
She's merely frightened.

751
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,360
Miss, please take me in.

752
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,590
I can do everything.

753
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,440
I just hope that I have

754
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,150
a shelter

755
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:18,840
and some food to eat.

756
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,800
Miss?

757
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,239
How about this?

758
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,400
Come to the Zhu's Mansion tomorrow.

759
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,110
Thank you, Miss.

760
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:28,960
Thank you, Miss.

761
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:31,920
Go.

762
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,030
Investigate them.

763
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:33,840
Yes, sir.

764
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,920
Yi, we don't know about her background.

765
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,239
She's pitiful.

766
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,190
It's not like we can't feed
another mouth.

767
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,110
This is for the best.

768
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,360
Since you're soft-hearted,
it'll spare you from being put

769
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,920
in a difficult position.

770
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:07,630
Si.

771
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,720
Are you still angry at me

772
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,280
for taking the girl in?

773
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,920
Yi,

774
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,110
something's definitely off

775
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,920
about Qing'er.

776
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,400
What do you mean?

777
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,280
We haven't finished

778
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
investigating the coachman yet.

779
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,960
And now, Qing'er
appeared out of nowhere.

780
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,720
This is too much of a coincidence.

781
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,920
I only did a small favor

782
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,030
to provide her
with a chance to survive.

783
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,440
Since we've rescued her,

784
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,990
we should see it through.

785
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,990
Yi, how could you be sure

786
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,840
that Qing'er wasn't lying to you?

787
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,720
But she has no reason

788
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,840
to deceive me.

789
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,280
Right now, I have no evidence

790
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,720
to prove my speculations.

791
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,670
It'll only irritate you
if I tell you about it.

792
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,990
So I'll keep it to myself.

793
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,190
But Yi,

794
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,190
remember this.

795
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,440
We must always stay cautious.

796
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,400
I understand.

797
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,190
Don't worry.

798
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,110
Before this, I thought
Madam Zhu was the one

799
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:56,960
trying to harm Yi.

800
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,550
Now, it seems like

801
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,550
this Qing'er is also quite suspicious.

802
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,630
Since Yi is soft-hearted,

803
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,440
I shall protect her.

804
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,150
Hurry and pick them up.

805
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,030
Madam is still waiting for us.

806
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:16,670
Yes.

807
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,360
We investigated her background.

808
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,760
Qing'er did have a father.

809
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,360
He died seven days ago.

810
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,030
Everyone in the neighborhood knew
that she sold herself off

811
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,190
for the burial service.

812
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,670
As for the three men who bought her,

813
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,150
they were notorious ruffians
of the village.

814
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,760
They vanished

815
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,280
after that day.

816
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,760
But their neighbors also said

817
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,320
that these people

818
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,550
are often away from home

819
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,320
for quite some time.

820
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
Don't you think

821
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
these people...

822
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,920
Judging from your sister's personality,

823
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,630
it's likely that she'll fulfill her wish

824
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,400
and take her into the mansion.

825
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,840
This action

826
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,190
does seem a bit unnecessary.

827
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,630
I'm just worried
that she might not be content

828
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,800
with being a concubine.

829
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,320
She might be after more.

830
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,920
Yi,

831
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,990
I want to talk to you about something.

832
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,280
But please don't overthink it.

833
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,440
What is it? Just tell me.

834
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,240
How much longer

835
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,990
does your sister plan to stay here?

836
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,280
When will she depart for Ling'an?

837
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,630
Dear, do you not wish for my sister

838
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,510
to live with us?

839
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,880
I already told you not to overthink it.

840
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,550
She's frequently seen

841
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,720
with Commandant Yu,

842
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,880
which could lead to gossip.

843
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,470
Also,

844
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,150
Commandant Xie has feelings

845
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:08,880
for your sister, right?

846
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,590
The Xie family
is an esteemed family in Lingshui.

847
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,550
If they can form a marriage alliance
with your family,

848
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,190
and he becomes my brother-in-law,

849
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,280
that will be the best.

850
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,110
Lingshui is a small place.

851
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,440
If his family hears about

852
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,070
the gossip,

853
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:21,920
wouldn't it ruin

854
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,960
your sister's marriage?

855
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,760
Dear, you must be joking.

856
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,470
The Xie family would never form

857
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,760
a marriage alliance with my family.

858
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Commandant Xie has long passed

859
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,400
the age for marriage

860
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,360
but remains unmarried.

861
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,360
Rumor has it

862
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,320
that during his stay
at Count of Dongping's Mansion,

863
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,880
he fell for one of your family's girls.

864
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,880
Commander Xie remains unmarried

865
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,960
because he was delayed
by the three years

866
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,440
of mourning for his parents' passing.

867
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,470
What has this got to do
with my family's girls?

868
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,110
It's fine that other people
are gossiping about it.

869
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,990
But Dear, you mustn't say so.

870
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,880
My family has a strict upbringing
and the girls

871
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,360
have always upheld proper conduct.

872
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,440
All right. It's my bad.

873
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,670
I know that you care about
your family's reputation.

874
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,320
I shouldn't have spoken recklessly
about your sister.

875
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,630
Don't be angry.

876
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,280
Why would I be angry at you?

877
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,800
Si is just feeling anxious

878
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,150
after nearly falling off a cliff

879
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,280
last time,

880
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,440
which is why she's asked
Commandant Yu for help.

881
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,110
Besides,

882
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,880
I've married into Lingshui
for a long time.

883
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,320
This is her first time here.

884
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,720
How could I chase her away?

885
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,590
Yi, you're right.

886
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,590
I was inconsiderate.

887
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:39,880
In a few days,

888
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,840
it will be the Water Festival,
a special celebration

889
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,840
in Lingshui.

890
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,280
It will be the perfect time

891
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,110
to show Si around.

892
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,440
The Water Festival is a busy time,

893
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:48,920
and with Mother getting older,

894
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,880
I'll have to trouble you to help out.

895
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,880
Dear, what are you saying?

896
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,670
This is my duty after all.

897
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,340
[Feiniang, Leader of Caiyun Troupe]

898
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,190
So beautiful!

899
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,590
So beautiful!

900
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,510
Their dances are exquisite
and captivating.

901
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,320
Look.

902
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,400
The lead dancer

903
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,320
[Yunshui House, Lingshui]
is Feiniang, who runs the Caiyun Troupe.

904
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,400
This is just a warm-up.

905
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,030
Tonight's Majestic Water Dance

906
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,470
is her signature dance.

907
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,920
I heard that it's very difficult

908
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,720
to hire Caiyun Troupe.

909
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,670
They're very popular.

910
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,760
Yi, you're amazing.

911
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:51,720
That's right.

912
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,670
Usually, we need
to contact them at least six months

913
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,550
in advance.

914
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,070
Even so, they might not agree to it.

915
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,470
Initially, I didn't expect much.

916
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,800
But Feiniang said

917
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,190
she had an affinity with me.

918
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,550
She made an exception for me
by performing personally.

919
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,880
Yunshui House

920
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,110
is the best place
to enjoy their performance.

921
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,800
I've reserved a spot for you.

922
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,550
It's rare for you to visit Lingshui.

923
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,720
You should watch the performance.

924
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,320
Yi,

925
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,670
you didn't need to look after me.

926
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:11,920
You've been handling

927
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,400
the preparations

928
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,880
for the Water Festival all this time.

929
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,320
It must have been tough on you.

930
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,360
But Si,

931
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,510
luckily, you're here

932
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,550
to help me out.

933
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,400
Lingshui relies on water
for its livelihood,

934
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,920
and the Water Festival
is the biggest event

935
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,760
in Lingshui.

936
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,760
I just hope

937
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,110
nothing goes wrong tonight.

938
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:31,720
Madam.

939
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,190
Old Madam is summoning you.

940
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:33,990
She has urgent matters to discuss.

941
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,190
All right. I'm coming.

942
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,070
Yi, let me accompany you.

943
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,440
No need for that.

944
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,510
You've been

945
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,550
by my side this whole time,

946
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,030
and I know you're worried about me.

947
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,400
But look.

948
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,670
I'm doing just fine, aren't I?

949
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,320
Although my mother-in-law
isn't easygoing,

950
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,720
I'm handling

951
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,990
the Water Festival after all.

952
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,630
She won't put me on the spot today.

953
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,110
You must be careful, then.

954
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:05,150
Excellent!

955
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,510
What's the matter?

956
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,440
Qing'er

957
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,320
has been working diligently
without causing trouble.

958
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,630
As for Zhu Ziyu,

959
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,190
I didn't notice
anything unusual about him.

960
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,610
Could it be

961
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,670
that I suspected the wrong people?

962
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,720
I know you're worried about your sister.

963
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,550
But being too tense

964
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,760
will only backfire.

965
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,280
Maybe it's better for you
to just relax today.

966
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,590
I'll take care of the rest.

967
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,440
Phoenix Hairpin?

968
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:40,920
The opening performance tonight

969
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,630
is actually Phoenix Hairpin?

970
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,110
Do you intend

971
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,760
to tell the people of Lingshui

972
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,670
that I'm an evil mother-in-law

973
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,720
who tried to separate you and my son?

974
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,740
