374
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,400
But Your Highness,
you're bleeding too much.

375
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,069
Your body might not be able to take it.

376
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:20,920
It doesn't matter.

377
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,160
It's fine as long as
His Majesty is healthy.

378
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:24,920
Mingyue.

379
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,550
Uncle.

380
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,790
What are you doing here at this hour?

381
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,360
Come on. Show me your hand.

382
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,510
Imperial Physician Han,

383
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,960
didn't I tell you
to keep this from Uncle?

384
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,960
Your Highness,

385
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,600
I didn't mean to do it.

386
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:49,510
Your Majesty, Princess Mingyue came here

387
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,750
to brew your medicine every day.

388
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,880
She used her own blood

389
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,440
as the catalyst for your medicine.

390
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,470
Since your headaches
were getting better,

391
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,230
that means

392
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,200
this prescription was effective.

393
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,880
Have you read too many medical books

394
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,640
that you went insane?

395
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,230
How could you trust such a prescription?

396
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,710
Uncle, don't be angry.

397
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,960
I was the one
who found the prescription

398
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,990
and handed it to him.

399
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,120
I was afraid
that you were still angry at me.

400
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,270
That's why I did this in secret...

401
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,750
Mingyue?

402
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,550
What's wrong?

403
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,230
Your Majesty,
I'm afraid she has bled too much.

404
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,640
Her body couldn't take it.

405
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,160
Send her to her room. Hurry.

406
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

407
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:25,920
Baoping.

408
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,880
Notify Rong Yang.

409
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,790
Yes, Your Majesty.

410
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,960
Mingyue.

411
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,840
You do things
without considering the consequences.

412
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,710
You're your mother's precious daughter.

413
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,440
If she sees this,

414
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,120
she'll blame me for it.

415
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,200
Of course I hid this from Mother.

416
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,990
Uncle, I can do anything as long as
it can help treat your disease,

417
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,310
even if it means sacrificing

418
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:51,990
my own life.

419
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,440
I know you're filial.

420
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,270
Tell me. What reward do you want?

421
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,070
I want the Seventh Prince

422
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,360
to be my husband. Is that okay?

423
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,120
Mingyue, what nonsense is this?

424
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,790
Greetings, Your Majesty.

425
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,120
You don't need

426
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,550
to take Mingyue's words to heart.

427
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,470
So what if you had

428
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,640
fulfilled your filial duties?

429
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,680
Does that mean
you can act willfully now?

430
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,310
No one in the palace

431
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,990
is as filial as her.

432
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,160
From today onward,

433
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,440
I shall restore her princess title.

434
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,990
Mingyue, show your appreciation.

435
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,070
I am grateful, Your Majesty.

436
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,640
[Changle Hall]

437
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,550
You lived in Changle Hall

438
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,960
when you were young.

439
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,600
We used to play together nearby

440
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,640
all the time.

441
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,750
Indeed.

442
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,470
Brother,

443
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,790
do you still remember?

444
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,920
Back then, I saw the princesses

445
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,880
rearing rare birds,

446
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,640
while I had none.

447
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,750
You were worried that I might be upset.

448
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,270
You climbed onto this tree

449
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,270
and grabbed

450
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,160
a handful of baby sparrows for me.

451
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,360
You even told me

452
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,960
that no one in the palace
had reared sparrows before.

453
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,200
Therefore, my birds

454
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,510
were rarer than theirs.

455
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,200
I was

456
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,790
an unappreciated prince.

457
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,750
That's the only way

458
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,160
I could make you happy.

459
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,960
I'm sorry you had to go through that.

460
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,920
I'll get angry

461
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,160
if you keep saying that.

462
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,710
Although we aren't biological siblings,

463
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,510
we both felt the pain

464
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,510
of losing one's mother since young.

465
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,030
The Empress Dowager took us in

466
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,880
and raised us within her quarters.

467
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,440
To me,

468
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,270
the bond we share matters the most.

469
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,640
Yes.

470
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,550
In the blink of an eye,

471
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,750
we've kept each other company

472
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,640
for many years.

473
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,070
Mingyue is all grown up now.

474
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:57,680
Brother,

475
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,160
Mingyue

476
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,400
was just throwing a child's tantrum.

477
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,600
She did it on a whim.

478
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,310
That's why she said
she wanted to marry Yu Jin.

479
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,600
But don't worry.

480
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,400
Although I've spoiled her,

481
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,030
I won't let her do such a silly thing.

482
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,710
Mingyue used her own blood

483
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,640
as the catalyst of my medicine.

484
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,600
She's a filial child.

485
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,880
The imperial family may look different
from a commoner's family,

486
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,270
but you're worried about

487
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,550
the marriages

488
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,120
of your children,

489
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,840
just like me.

490
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,990
I've already instructed
Imperial Concubine Xian

491
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,960
to hold the Floral Banquet for Yu Jin.

492
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,360
If Mingyue does intend to marry him,

493
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,270
she can attend it

494
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,160
and give it a try.

495
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,680
We'll see if they have
an affinity for each other.

496
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,440
Brother, thank you.

497
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,840
You intruded upon a woman's quarters
at this hour.

498
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,120
Aren't you afraid
that people might see us?

499
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,750
I couldn't care less.

500
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,030
I missed you.

501
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,360
It's good for them to see us like this.

502
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,680
I want them to know

503
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,550
that you're the woman I love.

504
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,710
The imperial palace
will hold the Floral Banquet soon.

505
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,920
They're selecting consorts
for my sixth brother and I.

506
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,880
By then,

507
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,880
I'll come up with a way
to send you the invitation.

508
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,710
During the banquet,

509
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,360
I'll announce

510
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,310
to everyone

511
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,680
that you're the one I want to marry.

512
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,120
Do you expect me to attend the banquet

513
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,440
and compete with the noble ladies

514
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,230
for your love?

515
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,600
You're the only one I love.

516
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,270
Even if you don't do anything,

517
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,070
you'll be my only choice.

518
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,840
I dare not accept such flattery.

519
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,990
Now, you're Prince Yan.

520
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,270
I'm just an ordinary girl.

521
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,070
I can't afford

522
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,070
to live in the palace.

523
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,680
I'll leave the place

524
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,120
and lead the life I desire
sooner or later.

525
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,120
If you keep saying these out of spite,

526
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
I'll take them for real, you know?

527
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,550
Serving the emperor is a dangerous task.

528
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,550
You need to figure out
every word he utters

529
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,680
and predict every move he makes

530
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,360
so that you won't make the wrong move.

531
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:34,960
On most days,

532
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,990
it's fine if you throw a little tantrum

533
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:37,880
at him.

534
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,030
But if he shows any hints of displeasure

535
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,070
or unwillingness,

536
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,710
you mustn't push your luck.

537
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,710
His Majesty always appears good-natured

538
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,120
in front of others.

539
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,360
It'll give people a sense of illusion

540
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,550
that he's a benevolent

541
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,360
and simple-minded emperor.

542
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:01,790
They have no idea

543
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,550
how intelligent he is.

544
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,920
To be his favorite sister,

545
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,030
one must never
resort to demanding things from him

546
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,270
again and again.

547
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,230
If Uncle isn't willing
to grant me this marriage,

548
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,600
do I have to wait for Yu Jin

549
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,710
to marry me voluntarily, then?

550
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,710
He only has eyes for Jiang Si.

551
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,120
Why not?

552
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,960
My daughter

553
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,200
excels at all four arts.

554
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,750
And, her beauty

555
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
is unmatched.

556
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,750
Since His Majesty

557
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,230
is holding the Floral Banquet for Yu Jin

558
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,440
as part of the consort selection,

559
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,120
we just need

560
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,510
to make him choose you.

561
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,510
Mother, you have a point.

562
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,440
It's getting late.

563
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,550
Your Highness, please leave.

564
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,920
May you enjoy

565
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,550
the Floral Banquet

566
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,470
and find your beloved.

567
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,030
What do you mean?

568
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,550
Are you chasing me away?

569
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,790
That's right.

570
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,440
I need to rest now.

571
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,160
You're still here, huh?

572
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,510
I know that the path ahead
will be more difficult

573
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
now that I'm Prince Yan.

574
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,680
Perhaps I won't be able
to get you farmland,

575
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,400
a small house,
and provide you with a simple life.

576
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,230
But I have set my heart on you.

577
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,750
I'm yours for the rest of my life.

578
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,790
You won't be able to chase me away.

579
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,160
Unless your wish

580
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,920
involves

581
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,710
my departure.

582
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,270
By then, you just need to notify me.

583
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,120
I'll see you off

584
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,030
with a reluctant heart.

585
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,710
Prince Yan, I suppose

586
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,960
you can't live on farmland with me.

587
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,230
But I think Yu Qi

588
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
can do it.

589
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,840
Don't worry.

590
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,200
I'll win the Floral Banquet.

591
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,790
Your beloved

592
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,070
can only be me.

593
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,470
My love, you have a point.

594
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,640
I've carried

595
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,550
this jade pendant with me
since I was young.

596
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,030
It can keep you company

597
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,230
when I'm not around.

598
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,470
For Jin's Floral Banquet,
we should invite

599
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,440
gentle and subservient

600
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,440
noble ladies.

601
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,960
After that, we'll invite
some with excellent backgrounds.

602
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,230
Yuhu.

603
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,030
Yes, Your Highness.

604
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,960
Deliver this
to the Office of Ceremonies.

605
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:06,840
Yes, Your Highness.

606
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,120
I wonder about the kinds of ladies

607
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,440
Imperial Concubine Zhuang would invite.

608
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,200
Your Highness.

609
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,550
Prince Yan is here to greet you.

610
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,360
What is he doing here?

611
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,960
He's waiting outside.

612
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,270
Will you see him?

613
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,400
Of course.

614
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,550
I need to depend on him

615
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,680
to assist Zhang in the future.

616
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,360
Let him in.

617
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,710
Greetings, Mother.

618
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,440
I appreciate your filial piety.

619
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,270
Do you need anything?

620
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,600
I heard that the date
for the Floral Banquet

621
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,230
has been set.

622
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,120
It's on the 18th day of the month.

623
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,230
Jin, are you worried that I might do

624
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,550
an unsatisfactory job?

625
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,600
That's not it.

626
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,270
I was stationed at the Southern Frontier
most of the time.

627
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,120
I do not know much
about the noble ladies in the capital.

628
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,510
However, I long

629
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,070
for a peaceful and harmonious life.

630
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,750
Mother, it all falls on you

631
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,550
whether or not

632
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,550
I'll marry the consort of my wish.

633
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,310
Don't worry.

634
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,270
I'll select

635
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,230
the consort of your wish for you.

636
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,840
I shall take my leave, then.

637
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,230
Jin had a fight
with the Crown Prince before.

638
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,270
I thought he was reckless and unruly.

639
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,750
Now, it turns out

640
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,550
that a child like him

641
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,470
actually longs for marriage.

642
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,790
Your Highness,

643
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,070
in my opinion,

644
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,990
Prince Yan's thoughts are...

645
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,070
They're too pure.

646
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,270
But that's a good thing as well.

647
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,550
Choosing his desired consort

648
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,310
ensures his easy persuasion

649
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,550
by my words.

650
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,440
By then,

651
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,160
if I have a harmonious relationship
with his consort,

652
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,750
he'll help Zhang out under my influence.

653
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,840
Jiang Si, it all falls on you now.

654
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:31,010
[Lan Xingwen]

655
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,160
Director Sun.

656
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,920
This is the guest list
of Imperial Concubine Xian's

657
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,680
Floral Banquet.

658
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,040
[Jiang Si, the daughter
of the Count of Dongping]

659
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:56,240
[To Jiang Si, the daughter
of the Count of Dongping]

660
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,440
Si was quiet and reserved.

661
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,230
But look.

662
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,310
She received an invitation
from the palace.

663
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,510
My goodness!

664
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,030
This is unbelievable!

665
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,200
Grandmother.

666
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,470
Si,

667
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,400
come here.

668
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,030
Sit beside me.

669
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,750
Come on.

670
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,790
Si, take a look.

671
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,960
This is an invitation

672
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,920
from the imperial palace.

673
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,230
The imperial palace
will hold the Floral Banquet soon.

674
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,880
They're selecting consorts
for my sixth brother and I.

675
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,400
By then, I'll come up with a way

676
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,160
to send you the invitation.

677
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,510
Do you know

678
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,200
why

679
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,920
they sent you the invitation?

680
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,990
Grandmother, you must be joking.

681
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,550
I don't even know

682
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,200
that they're holding an event
called the Floral Banquet,

683
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,510
not to mention

684
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,070
receiving an invitation out of the blue.

685
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,960
You have no idea, huh?

686
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,230
But you didn't seem surprised at all.

687
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,030
Grandmother, you taught us

688
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,230
to remain unshaken
in the face of tumultuous events.

689
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,840
That's how a noble lady

690
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,880
should behave, right?

691
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,550
Mother!

692
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,710
Mother!

693
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,360
Si received an invitation
from the palace?

694
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,400
So, you found out about

695
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,550
the joyous occasion as well?

696
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,310
The Floral Banquet?

697
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,550
It's clear
that this is a consort selection.

698
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,600
Si,

699
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:19,960
you mustn't attend it.

700
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,960
Have you lost your mind?

701
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,120
This is an invitation
from the imperial family, you know?

702
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,400
Was it Yu Qi?

703
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,070
What has this got to do with Yu Qi?

704
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,990
Mother,

705
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,750
Yu Qi is the Seventh Prince.

706
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,070
Seriously?

707
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,790
That's why Si mustn't attend it.

708
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,920
In my opinion,

709
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,230
he's a good man.

710
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,120
If they truly get together,

711
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,070
it'll be a beautiful tale.

712
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,990
Besides,

713
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,990
it's not like

714
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,840
she'll definitely be selected.

715
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,270
The key is
that she has received this invitation.

716
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,270
Now, the Count of Dongping's Mansion

717
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,990
can finally hold our heads up high.

718
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,230
It'll be much easier for us

719
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,510
to find in-laws in the future.

720
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,030
Father,

721
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,640
it's not that easy to be selected.

722
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,790
Besides,

723
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,750
this is an invitation
from the imperial palace.

724
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,230
We can't just reject it

725
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,360
for no reason.

726
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,470
That's right.

727
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,960
Si.

728
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,920
Hurry and make your preparations.

729
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,640
Tell the housekeeper

730
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:23,990
if you lack anything.

731
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,960
I have two sets

732
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,230
of exquisite hair ornaments.

733
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,550
I'll instruct Afu
to deliver them to you later.

734
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,030
Thank you, Grandmother.

735
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:32,750
By the way,

736
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,270
you must remember my words.

737
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,160
There are rules
we have to obey in the palace.

738
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,710
Don't hear,

739
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,990
see,

740
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,640
or say what you shouldn't.

741
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,790
Follow the example of others.

742
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,840
Remember this:

743
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,750
Do not stand out and invite trouble.

744
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,120
Your Highness,

745
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,710
these are all crafted

746
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,230
from the finest Hetian jade.

747
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,990
The plates, bowls,

748
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,030
pots, and the pillow.

749
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,400
These are
the Four Treasures of the Study

750
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,920
from Longyan Treasure House.

751
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,239
These are landscape paintings

752
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,590
by the Four Great Talents of Zhou.

753
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,960
Aunt, what do you mean by this?

754
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,630
My daughter, Mingyue,

755
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,510
admires you.

756
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,630
If you select her as your consort

757
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,360
during the Floral Banquet,

758
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,800
I'll let bygones be bygones

759
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,510
and guarantee you a promising future.

760
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Aunt,

761
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,320
what do you mean by that?

762
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,670
What if I say

763
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,880
I can help you to be the Crown Prince?

764
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,110
Really?

765
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,960
The current Crown Prince
lacks virtue and talent.

766
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:39,960
How do you think

767
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,360
he's able to retain his position?

768
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,920
Of course it's because of you.

769
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,590
But unfortunately,

770
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,190
I have no interest

771
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,670
in this position whatsoever.

772
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,070
I have no lofty aspirations.

773
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,320
I just want to be a freeloader.

774
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,630
You're the bringer of misfortune.

775
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,360
His Majesty may not mind it,

776
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,470
but I haven't forgotten.

777
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,590
Nor have the officials.

778
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,070
In the past, His Majesty

779
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,550
had no choice but to send you
to the Southern Frontier

780
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,110
as all officials begged him to do so.

781
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,440
The same thing can happen again.

782
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,840
But I can convince the officials
to forget about your past.

783
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,840
Your Highness,

784
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,150
you truly think the world

785
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,360
revolves around you, huh?

786
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,550
Do you think

787
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,920
you can change my life

788
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,800
with just your words?

789
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,280
Indeed.

790
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,360
My patience is thin.

791
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,990
Obey or face the consequences.

792
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,070
Farewell, Your Highness.

793
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,150
Chief.

794
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,670
Do I need

795
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,400
to dispose of them for you?

796
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,670
Keep them here. These are good items.

797
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:09,760
What?

798
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,030
The palace is holding
the Floral Banquet?

799
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,280
That's right.

800
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,840
I heard that they'd
be selecting consorts for the princes.

801
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,590
Really?

802
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,240
Besides Miss Si,
did the rest of the ladies

803
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,360
receive the invitation?

804
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,070
Miss Si was the only one
who received it.

805
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,880
Everyone in the mansion is saying

806
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,320
that Miss Si

807
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,720
might be able
to become a princess consort.

808
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,760
If Miss Si

809
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,800
does become a princess consort,

810
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,240
their branch

811
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,280
will

812
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,550
be over the moon.

813
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,720
If so, our branch
will never stand a chance.

814
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,720
Madam, don't worry.

815
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,920
Miss Si, an unlucky bringer

816
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:51,920
of misfortune,

817
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,470
cannot become a princess consort.

818
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,360
She thinks

819
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,440
she's that lucky, huh?

820
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,320
In her dreams.

821
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,880
The imperial palace is gigantic.

822
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:15,720
Mr. Zhan!

823
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:16,840
Si!

824
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,030
Zhan.

825
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:19,880
Are you nervous?

826
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,400
Not at all.

827
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,070
Zhan, return to your position.

828
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,630
It's inappropriate if others see this.

829
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,470
It's fine.

830
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,240
What is this?

831
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,030
A rose sweet.

832
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,190
Sweet food brings fortune.

833
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,760
All right.

834
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:39,990
Is it nice?

835
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,360
Yes.

836
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,670
Zhan, don't worry.

837
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,920
Good fortune is coming my way.

838
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
Your Highness, your new outfit

839
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,440
looks great.

840
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,190
May I know where you bought it from?

841
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,240
It's a shame

842
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,440
that I can't join you
at the Imperial Garden.

843
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,150
You must tell me about it after this.

844
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,150
Okay.

845
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,510
I'll tell you everything

846
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,760
I see over there.

847
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,550
Why is Miss Jiang

848
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,190
wearing the same outfit

849
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,150
as Princess Mingyue?

850
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

851
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,110
Wretch.

852
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,990
Who gave you the right

853
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,070
to wear the same outfit as me?

854
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,240
Take it off.

855
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,280
Your Highness,

856
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,240
I ordered this custom outfit

857
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,440
at Tianxiu Pavilion

858
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,670
on Zhuque Street.

859
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,920
I drew the design

860
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,550
and selected the material myself.

861
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,110
Did your tailor steal the design

862
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,030
from Tianxiu Pavilion?

863
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,880
Or were you

864
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,400
trying to impersonate me on purpose?

865
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:43,880
Xiaohong.

866
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,720
Tear off her outfit.

867
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,670
What do you think

868
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,800
you are doing?

869
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,280
Aman!

870
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,110
Stop!

871
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,150
Mother.

872
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,280
Greetings, Your Highness.

873
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,760
Mingyue was rude today.

874
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,720
Miss Jiang,
if she has caused you any offense,

875
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,440
please forgive her.

876
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,280
Your Highness, please don't worry.

877
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,360
I won't hold it

878
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,630
against Her Highness.

879
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,400
Mother,

880
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,070
I merely wanted

881
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,150
to teach that wretch a lesson.

882
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,510
Why did you stop me?

883
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:27,880
Mingyue,

884
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,320
if you truly intend to end one's life,

885
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,470
you have to act the best you can
in front of others

886
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,400
and do the most ruthless deeds
behind their backs.

887
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,280
If everyone knows
that you're picking on her,

888
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,510
they'll surely blame you

889
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,150
if anything happens to her.

890
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,440
I understand.

891
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,720
There are plenty of other things
you need to learn.

892
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,640
[Imperial Garden]

893
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,320
Imperial Concubine Xian
and Imperial Concubine Zhuang

894
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:09,720
have arrived.

895
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,780
[Imperial Concubine Zhuang]

896
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,070
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

897
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,670
You all may rise.

898
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,030
Concubine Zhuang,
you should take your seat.

899
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,320
After you.

900
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,880
Prince Shu and Prince Yan have arrived.

901
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:47,510
Sixth Brother.

902
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,140
Jin.

903
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,280
[Prince Shu]

904
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,670
- Greetings, Your Highnesses.
- Greetings, Your Highnesses.

905
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,070
Sixth Brother, please.

906
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,760
Please.

907
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,150
Imperial Concubine Zhuang, please.

908
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,030
Let's begin.

909
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:24,840
Yes, Your Highness.

910
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:28,470
I'm Sun Congxin, the Director
of the Office of Ceremonies.

911
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,760
Today, I shall host

912
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,030
the Floral Banquet,

913
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,470
which you're here for.

914
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,110
It's the season
when peonies are in full bloom,

915
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,400
competing in beauty and splendor.

916
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,030
Using flowers as our theme,

917
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,720
three rounds of competition
shall be conducted.

918
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,920
The first round
is the drawing of flowers.

919
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,110
The second round
is the arrangement of flowers.

920
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,240
The third round
is the appreciation of flowers.

921
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,190
Ladies,

922
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,760
please showcase your talents

923
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,400
and display your brilliance.

924
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,110
For the first round,
the theme shall be peony.

925
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,110
The time limit is two hours.

926
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,510
The round begins now.

927
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,840
[Jiang Si]

928
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:35,240
That must be the daughter
of the Count of Dongping.

929
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,030
I thought

930
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,590
Imperial Concubine Zhuang
was a tasteful individual.

931
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,670
So, I was wrong.

932
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,510
