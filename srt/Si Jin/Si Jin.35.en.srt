181
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,910
I'll fight her until the very end.

182
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,870

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,590
Mother, I...

382
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,110
I'll

383
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,880
serve them in my next life

384
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,270
to atone for my sins.

385
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,960
Mother, you mustn't die!

386
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,400
Please don't leave me alone!

387
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
Don't!

388
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,830
Commandant Xie.

389
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,110
Please escort my Qian back

390
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,160
to Count of Dongping's Mansion safely.

391
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,400
Mother! Don't die!

392
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,160
Don't abandon me!

393
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,480
We've arrived at Ling'an.

394
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,000
You're safe now.

395
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,580
[Prince Yan's Mansion]

396
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,030
Qian?

397
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,200
Si.

398
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,310
Si!

399
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,350
Qian.

400
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,590
Where's Madam Xiao?

401
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,790
Mother has passed away.

402
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,110
They murdered her

403
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,960
in front of my eyes.

404
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,200
How could that be?

405
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,000
It was the Princess Royal's bodyguards.

406
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,590
I've let you down.

407
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,070
I was one step too late.

408
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,590
I only managed to rescue Miss Qian.

409
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,830
It's all my fault.

410
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,640
If only I realized it sooner.

411
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,480
It's not your fault.

412
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,830
Mother died because she tried

413
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,440
to save me.

414
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,310
I'll make Princess Royal

415
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,310
pay the price.

416
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,680
Aman,

417
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,550
take Qian to her room first.

418
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,070
Yes, My Lady.

419
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,550
Miss Qian, please.

420
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,830
By the way,

421
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,310
before Mother passed away,

422
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,590
she wanted me to tell you

423
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,000
that she regretted what she did.

424
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,310
She hoped that you could forgive her.

425
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,070
I was still one step too late.

426
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,070
My identity will be exposed
sooner or later.

427
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,750
I have to come up with a solution soon.

428
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,110
If not, the family

429
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,160
will be implicated because of me.

430
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,480
[Count of Dongping's Mansion]

431
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,590
Mother.

432
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,030
Mother, what...?

433
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,070
Greetings, Your Highness.

434
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,550
Mother,

435
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,070
you sent for me?

436
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,440
Was there something urgent?

437
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,750
I've found him for you.

438
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,240
Your Highness, were you looking for me?

439
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,960
Uncle Anmou,

440
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,720
I heard

441
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,160
that you've been telling everyone

442
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,920
that Prince Yan was your son-in-law.

443
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,110
What were you trying to do?

444
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
What's wrong with that?

445
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,550
He is practically my son-in-law,
being married to my niece.

446
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,000
Am I right, Ancheng?

447
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,030
How many times have I told you before?

448
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,960
Do not spout nonsense

449
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
using Prince Yan's name.

450
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,960
Word will get around at court.

451
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,270
It'll be bad for the children.

452
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:14,960
Mother,

453
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,680
didn't I tell you...?

454
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,310
Si and Ancheng are right.

455
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,640
Anmou,

456
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,350
you've been foolish.

457
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,590
Our family has established
a marital alliance with Prince Yan.

458
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
To outsiders,

459
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,000
everything you do

460
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,960
is related to Prince Yan somehow.

461
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,960
Apologize to Prince Yan.

462
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,030
Do not repeat the same mistake!

463
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,550
Yes, Mother.

464
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,830
Uncle Anmou.

465
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,960
What did you mean by this letter?

466
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,240
What letter?

467
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,070
Anmou.

468
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,310
This letter is...

469
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,720
Si,

470
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,590
are you showing no respect
to your elders

471
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,240
just because you've become
the princess consort?

472
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:03,880
Uncle Anmou,

473
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,640
do you think it's appropriate for you

474
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,440
to give me this letter?

475
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,550
What's wrong with that?

476
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,160
Enough!

477
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,830
Anmou,

478
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,310
how could you make Prince Yan
put in a good word for you?

479
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,310
You deserve this.

480
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,590
Si,

481
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,790
your uncle

482
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,030
isn't someone

483
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,350
who's after fame and fortune.

484
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,400
I think

485
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,030
he didn't do it on purpose.

486
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,750
I'm doing this
for the sake of our family.

487
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,920
Stop it.

488
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,270
Today,

489
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,550
you've told him off

490
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,000
in front of everyone.

491
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,830
Why don't you let him off

492
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,640
on account of me?

493
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,200
So, Grandmother,

494
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
you think this is no big deal, huh?

495
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,440
Could you be the one who has instructed

496
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,550
Uncle Anmou

497
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,160
to request a promotion from my husband?

498
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,350
That's not true!

499
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,830
If so, why did you send me that letter?

500
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,480
Si.

501
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,830
You should mind your words.

502
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,510
Don't you think
you're getting ahead of yourself?

503
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,110
We respect you as the princess consort

504
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,200
only because we treat you
as a part of the family,

505
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,510
not because
we're seeking favors from you

506
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,920
or we fear you.

507
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,550
But if you still appreciate

508
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,960
what our family has done for you,

509
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,000
even if your uncle

510
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,310
didn't request you to do this,

511
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,550
you should do your part

512
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,030
and mediate for him!

513
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,880
Why would I do that?

514
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,200
Uncle Anmou, ask yourself this.

515
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,920
What has your branch

516
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,790
done to us

517
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,830
all these years?

518
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,270
Your spouse, Xiao Shi,

519
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,350
murdered my mother.

520
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,510
Your daughter, Jiang Qian,

521
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,400
knew

522
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,590
that her husband was cruel and violent.

523
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,680
Even so, she insisted on
sending me to him.

524
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,680
And you?

525
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,350
Since when have you
shown my father any respect?

526
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,440
Since when were you concerned about

527
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,240
my siblings and me?

528
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,000
At this point,

529
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,200
you want to talk about family
just to cover things up?

530
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,310
It's too late!

531
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,640
Such audacity!

532
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,350
Mother!

533
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,720
Do you think you can do
whatever you like

534
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,550
just because
you're the princess consort?

535
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,440
No matter how terrible your uncle is,

536
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,110
he's still

537
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,200
your father's brother!

538
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,880
As his niece,

539
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,720
how could you tell him off

540
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,070
in front of everyone else?

541
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,160
I'm still here, you know?

542
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,480
Grandmother.

543
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,550
All these years,

544
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,310
I always thought that you were biased
toward Uncle Anmou

545
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,550
and his branch

546
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,640
because he was an official.

547
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,750
You were expecting him

548
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,880
to bring honor to the family.

549
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,070
But now, it seems like
that isn't the case.

550
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,920
You're just biased toward him

551
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,790
without any reason.

552
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,200
You just favor him

553
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,110
over my father.

554
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,480
You would rather speak up for him

555
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,350
at the expense of offending me,

556
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,960
who's a royal member now.

557
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,110
Xiao Shi was right.

558
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,880
You two

559
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,790
are partly responsible

560
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,830
for my mother's death.

561
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,960
You two are the most selfish
and cold-hearted

562
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,920
mother and son in the world.

563
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,510
You!

564
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,070
Fine.

565
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,720
May you two enjoy
your filial bond, then.

566
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,640
Oh, the heavens!

567
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,240
Mother!

568
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,030
How come the Jiang family

569
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,720
has a granddaughter like her?

570
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,480
Mother, get up already!

571
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,270
You mustn't kneel!

572
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,350
Mother, please get up!

573
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,440
Mother.

574
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,680
Oh, Ancheng.

575
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,110
Look at

576
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,640
the good daughter you've raised.

577
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,920
Si, that's enough!

578
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,030
Father.

579
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,200
If you're willing,

580
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,160
you can come with me
to the prince's mansion.

581
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,640
From today onward,

582
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,680
our branch shall separate
from the family.

583
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,720
From now on, we're unrelated

584
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,920
to this family.

585
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,680
How could you do this?

586
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,510
You're abandoning your family!

587
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,510
Ancheng,

588
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,550
you mustn't leave with her.

589
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,880
Jiang Ancheng,

590
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,640
are you sure you want
to abandon the family?

591
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,830
Do you intend to abandon your mother

592
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,790
and lead a luxurious life with her?

593
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,200
Mother, I'm not leaving.

594
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,720
Si,

595
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,350
you grew up here.

596
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,550
You would never be here

597
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,640
without your grandmother.

598
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,750
Why did you

599
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,350
need to go this far?

600
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
There's no need to resort to this!

601
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,310
I will never forget how you all

602
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,200
treated me in the past.

603
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,720
Now that I'm married,

604
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,000
I no longer wish

605
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,510
to be coerced by my so-called "family."

606
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,440
You're just

607
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,830
an arrogant

608
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,110
ingrate.

609
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,960
I don't have a granddaughter like you.

610
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,510
I never asked for

611
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,110
a grandmother like you anyway.

612
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,400
Since it has come to this,

613
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,200
you should retrieve the family seal.

614
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,000
Let's write a letter of separation.

615
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,920
Fine by me!

616
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,110
Retrieve the family seal!

617
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,400
You mustn't do so!

618
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,590
There's no need to resort to this!

619
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,880
Afu!

620
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,030
Grandmother, Father,

621
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,400
I am sorry.

622
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,350
This is the only way.

623
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,270
Stop right there!

624
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,790
[Changning Palace]
Under Her Majesty's order,

625
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,310
I went to offer incense
at Qingyin Temple

626
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,200
on the 15th day of every month.

627
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:20,920
You may go.

628
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,160
I've met the Saintess.

629
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,590
She wasn't willing
to return to Nanwu with me.

630
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,030
Now, she's Prince Yan's consort.

631
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,720
They share a deep bond.

632
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,270
How could she bear to part with him?

633
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,440
Prince Yan is the chief
of the Red Plume Cavalry.

634
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,720
If a war breaks out
at the frontier again,

635
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,680
he has no choice but to return there.

636
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,310
If so, his consort will follow him.

637
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,200
Once we're back in our territory,

638
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,440
it'll be much easier
to make the Saintess

639
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,960
return to Nanwu.

640
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,510
I'll inform Grand Elder of this.

641
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,750
This emblem looks strange.

642
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,720
Could there be a secret behind it?

643
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,750
Doesn't it resemble
Nanwu's Flame Emblem?

644
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,680
Could it be that Jiang Si is from Nanwu?

645
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,400
That's impossible.

646
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,590
Su Ke gave birth to her in Ling'an.

647
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,680
She grew up in Ling'an as well.

648
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,400
Go and ask our informants.

649
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,310
Ask them about the background

650
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,440
of this emblem.

651
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,400
Yes, Your Highness.

652
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Just now, you said

653
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,240
our men

654
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,790
discovered Nanny Duo

655
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,240
at Qingyin Temple, right?

656
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,790
Keep a close eye on her.

657
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,720
Capture her and bring her to me
as soon as possible.

658
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,200
Yes, Your Highness.

659
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,880
What are you people doing?

660
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,750
This carriage belongs
to the imperial family!

661
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
Nanny Duo,
Her Highness wants to see you.

662
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,550
Come with us.

663
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,880
After her!

664
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,400
Stop right there!

665
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,510
Stop!

666
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,400
Stay where you are!

667
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,590
Freeze!

668
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:47,960
What's wrong?

669
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,310
The city is right ahead.

670
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,480
We shouldn't be seen together.

671
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,790
Since the Princess Royal

672
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,830
has sent her bodyguards to capture you,

673
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,680
you'll be walking into a trap
if you return to the palace.

674
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:56,920
Why don't you forget about it?

675
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,030
If I return to Her Majesty's palace,

676
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,030
she would at least
think twice before she acts.

677
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,590
She's far bolder

678
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,880
outside the city.

679
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:04,790
I have left something very important

680
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,790
in Changning Palace.

681
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,480
I need to go and retrieve it.

682
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,510
Be careful, then.

683
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,200
How was it?

684
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,550
It was a close shave.

685
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,350
They couldn't catch up to Nanny Duo.

686
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,160
I'm glad to hear that.

687
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,750
Luckily, you told Long Dan

688
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
to follow her in advance.

689
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,550
I heard from Aman

690
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,480
that you returned to your mansion today.

691
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,480
Why were you upset?

692
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,400
Did Grandmother put you on the spot?

693
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,310
No, vice versa.

694
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,960
Why did you do this?

695
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,400
You care about your family the most.

696
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,880
The letter of separation

697
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,750
requires the seal

698
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,480
of the Capital Administration Office
for it to be valid.

699
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,240
I understand now.

700
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,480
You don't care about the mansion.

701
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,160
You care about the family members.

702
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,960
As long as those you love are safe,

703
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,880
the letter of separation doesn't matter.

704
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,280
[Prince Yan's Mansion]

705
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,750
Your Highnesses,

706
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,200
you two are finally back.

707
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,310
Miss Yi and Mr. Zhan are here.

708
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,310
Si.

709
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,750
Why did you sever your ties

710
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,720
with the family?

711
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,550
We've disliked Uncle

712
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,480
for a long time now.

713
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,680
Being that angry at him

714
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,480
isn't worth it.

715
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,350
If you wish to vent your anger,

716
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,750
I'll give him a beating, okay?

717
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,830
Don't sever your ties

718
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,720
with me.

719
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:42,960
Yu,

720
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,440
help me out here.

721
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,350
Zhan.

722
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,070
Si, what exactly is going on?

723
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,550
Tell me about it.

724
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,640
I've already made up my mind.

725
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,680
If you are willing,

726
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,200
you can still be my siblings.

727
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,590
As for the Count of Dongping's Mansion,

728
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,640
I'll never return to it.

729
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,310
From now on,

730
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,830
Prince Yan's Mansion is my only home.

731
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,070
What do you mean by this?

732
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,110
Si,

733
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,160
are you doing this
out of bitter reasons?

734
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,030
There's no one else here

735
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,110
except Zhan and I.

736
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,880
You can tell us about it.

737
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,030
She doesn't have any bitter reasons.

738
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,550
Before this, she could

739
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,440
only swallow
the grievances she had at home.

740
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,110
Now that she's married to me,

741
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,400
she won't suffer anymore.

742
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,440
But I promise you

743
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,160
that I'll look after her.

744
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,790
I grew up

745
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,000
together with Si.

746
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,270
No one knows about

747
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,110
the suffering

748
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,350
and grievances she's had

749
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,400
better than me!

750
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
Don't you think she has had enough

751
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,960
of the suffering at your house?

752
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,480
She's my sister.

753
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,720
I don't need you to tell me about her!

754
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,960
Jiang Zhan, this is my mansion!

755
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,030

we shall not bother you two.

Si,

761
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,880
I won't believe

762
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,070

You said you had no bitter reasons.

767
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,590
I think it's the opposite.

768
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,150
Perhaps the reason

769
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,000
is too much for us to bear.

770

But no matter what...

773
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,960
I won't force you to say it.

774

You just need to remember this.

00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,150
Even though you've written

00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,190

There were no signs of Nanny Duo.

788

I've truly underestimated her.

As long as the Empress

790
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,710

for what I've done,

I have something to report.

00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,070
I've sinned.

804
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,400
I was the one

805
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,840
who made Princess Fuqing blind.

806
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,440
I was also the one

807

who poisoned the late Empress to death.

808
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,070
Your Majesty, did you find out
about these long ago?

809
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,710
During
Princess Consort Yan's investigation,

810
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,920
we suspected you and Nanny Hua
of being the culprits.

811
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,190
Moreover,

812
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,710
she invited you

813
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,920
to help her with inventing a cure

814
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,630
for Fuqing's condition.

815
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,550
I confirmed

816
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,110
that you were the culprit.

817
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,480
If so,

818
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,840
why didn't you expose me?

819
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,030
I believe Princess Consort Yan

820
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,800
has her own reasons

821
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,550
for keeping you here.

822
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,920
Actually, ten years ago,

823
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,320
on the night you turned me blind,

824
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,030
I wasn't asleep.

825
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,670
I heard what you said.

826
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,030
You said, "Your Highness,

827
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,960
you can only stay alive

828
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,070
by turning blind."

829

So, Your Highness,

that you're at least sincere

She's trustworthy.

00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,590
I can instruct her

849

outside the palace.

00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,760

returns to the palace today,

853
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,030
can you arrange for her

854

to seek shelter
at the Crown Prince's Mansion?

of searching his mansion

that the Crown Prince was the one
who hid her away,

that the Princess Royal was the one
who murdered the late Empress.

He's treated a traitor as his mother

870
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,000
because he thinks
