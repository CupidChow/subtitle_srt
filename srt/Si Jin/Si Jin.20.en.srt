[Haitang House]

13
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,240
Yi, you came back after so long.

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,880
Are you still used to it?

15
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,240
Everything at home

16
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,550
is so familiar,

17
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,550
as if I've never left home.

18
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,720
But when I think about it,

19
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,000
I've been married
and living away for years.

20
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,470
Yi.

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,670
Since you're already back,

22
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
you shouldn't be upset

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,310
over your unfortunate relationship.

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,310
I just don't understand

25
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,830
how I was wrong about him.

26
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,390
He had always been

27
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,030
a modest gentleman
ever since our first encounter.

28
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,390
We spent so many years living together.

29
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,830
I only managed to see his true colors

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,270
at the end of our marriage.

31
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,800
That's not your fault.

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,550
He deceived everyone.

33
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080

what was going to come,

37
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,150
you wouldn't need

38
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,800
to go through such a trial.

39
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,240
However, I don't regret it.

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,590
Really?

41
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,200
But why?

42
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,270
It's because we were in love before.

43
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,040
Back then,

44
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,040
he was the man I held dear.

45
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,640
He had a gentle glow, like the moon.

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,040
Though things turned out this way,

47
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,480
and I see him

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,390
for who he is now,

49
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,390
I

50
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,670

For certain things,

56
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,270
we should focus on
more than their endings.

If so...

58
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,240

it's worth giving it a try

to part from their beloved?

61
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,200

is concerned about me?

You tried to bully the weak
and extort money from them.

Should I not interfere?

167
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,440
You've threatened the order of society
with your actions.

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,680
yet you didn't go home.

191
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,510
Don't tell me

192
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,320
you came here just to show off.

193
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,080
I...

194
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,510
I...

195
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,280
I'm very busy, you know?

196
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,590
I was just

197
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,870
passing by.

198
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,280
Mr. Zhan!

199
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,160
I saw someone causing trouble.

200
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,470
Mr. Zhan!

201
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,080
You walked too fast.

202
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,110
But our home

203
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,280
isn't in this direction.

204
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,710
It isn't?

205
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,040
Goodness. I can't find my way home

206
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,160
after assuming my position.

207
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,350
Where should we head?

208
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,630
Hey! Your sword!

209
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,870
Aji, take it!

210
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,960
Greetings, Grandmother.

211
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,080
Zhan.

212
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,680
Come closer. Let me take a look.

213
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,870
You look great.

214
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,350
In our mansion,

215
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,680
you have the lousiest grades,

216
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,110
and you're the most disobedient

217
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:53,990
and most mischievous

218
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,400
among all the kids.

219
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,080
You're inferior to your brother, Cang.

220
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,870
Mother, how is that a compliment?

221
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,830
But no one would've expected you

222
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,710
to bring the most honor

223
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,440
to the family.

224
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,750
Grandmother, I have something to say.

225
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,080
When we reported for duty,

226
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,350
we had plenty of members there.

227
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,280
But Mr. Cui, our commander,

228
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,350
chose me

229
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,800
to serve His Majesty
for the Mid-Autumn Hunt.

230
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,280
Which Mr. Cui?

231
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,400
Cui Xu?

232
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,160
That's right. Do you know him?

233
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,680
Zhan, you've finally
made a name for yourself.

234
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,750
Come on.

235
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,400
Let's have a drink.

236
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,080
Ancheng,

237
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,160
Zhan just assumed his position.

238
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,440
You should at least

239
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,230
wait until Mother finishes

240
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,280
her words.

241
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,680
Forget it. Just let them be.

242
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,560
Zhan,

243
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,320
listen up.

244
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,710
Now that you're
an Imperial Insignia Guard,

245
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,510
you must fulfill your duties.

246
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,510
You were designated by His Majesty.

247
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,830
You must perform your duties

248
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,040
better than anyone else

249
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,830
so that you won't let His Majesty down.

250
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,680
Yes, Grandmother!

251
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Mother, we shall make a move first.

252
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,510
Let's go.

253
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,960
Tell Yi and Si to join us.

254
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,200
Let's celebrate the occasion

255
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,160
as a family.

256
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,280
Sure.

257
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,440
I want to invite Yu as well.

258
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,110
Look at that smug attitude.

259
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,750
I wasn't just saying that

260
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,830
for Zhan to listen.

261
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,160
It was also meant to encourage you.

262
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,800
Ancheng didn't make a name for himself.

263
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,870
But now,

264
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,590
they're getting better and better.

265
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,160
The second branch

266
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,080
needs to put in more effort now.

267
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,470
Then our family

268
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,590
will flourish!

269
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,200
Yes, Mother.

270
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,160
Yes, Mother.

271
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,960
All right. You may leave.

272
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,320
Anmou.

273
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,560
Anmou, don't be dejected.

274
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,710
Jiang Zhan is nothing.

275
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,110
At best,

276
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,630
he's
just a low-ranking military official.

277
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,870
Unlike our eldest son, Cang.

278
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,630
He's a properly educated

279
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,800
individual.

280
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
He may be

281
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,590
a low-ranking magistrate now,

282
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,630
but he'll be transferred
back to Ling'an City

283
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,680
in two years.

284
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,280
He'll have a bright future ahead of him.

285
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,800
So what if he's
an Imperial Insignia Guard?

286
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,630
Enough!

287
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,280
No matter how lowly
Jiang Zhan's rank is,

288
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,350
he's still part of the Jiang family.

289
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,750
You're being petty

290
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,560
while trying to compare to them.

291
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,320
Haven't we

292
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
embarrassed ourselves enough?

293
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,230
Why are you venting it out on me?

294
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,590
Anmou,

295
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,280
did you just return
from Old Madam's place?

296
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,920
Zhan has become
an Imperial Insignia Guard.

297
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,870
I assume Old Madam

298
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,800
has criticized our branch.

299
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,040
Even if I'm unsatisfied,

300
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,920
what can I do?

301
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,960
That brother of mine

302
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,560
loaves around all day
instead of doing work.

303
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,990
I'm a civil official myself.

304
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:42,990
Don't you think...

305
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,710
Anmou.

306
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,200
It's great that Zhan

307
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,680
has assumed such a position.

308
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,350
It suits his personality.

309
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,040
What do you mean?

310
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,870
In my opinion,

311
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,320
the two branches of our family
may be competing all the time.

312
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,110
But

313
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,470
we're bound together,

314
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,510
for better or worse.

315
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,920
If Zhan makes a name for himself,

316
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,110
our family's reputation
will be improved.

317
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,110
If

318
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,960
Cang returns to Ling'an as well,

319
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,710
he could be a great help to him.

320
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,870
You have a point.

321
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,680
If Zhan

322
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,960
does make a name for himself,

323
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,590
I suppose that's good too.

324
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,630
Shu.

325
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,800
You do know me the best.

326
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,400
Anmou, you don't need to worry.

327
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:46,680
Yes.

328
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,990
I won't.

329
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,710
The son of the Transport Commissioner?

330
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,320
He does have

331
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,160
a brutish look about him.

332
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,230
[He Zhiyuan]
The son of Lingnan's commandant?

333
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,200
It's good that he has medical skills.

334
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,040
But he doesn't look dashing enough

335
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
for Jiang Qiao.

336
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,230
This candidate is great.

337
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,680
[Xiao Lang]
The son of Lingbei's governor.

338
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,560
He comes from a good background too.

339
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,440
He's 25.

340
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,230
Young, handsome, and distinguished.

341
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,040
In his early years on the battlefield,
he was left...

342
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
He was left with a chronic illness?

343
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,990
No wonder

344
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,320
he hasn't gotten married
at the age of 25.

345
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,200
What kind of name list

346
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,160
did the matchmaking agency send us?

347
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,590
This...

348
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,280
None of them is good enough.

349
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,990
I'll notify them
the matches are unsuitable.

350
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,110
Don't be impatient.

351
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,320
The governor, huh?

352
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,040
He commands his own territory

353
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,080
and wields considerable power.

354
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,870
He's a military official as well.

355
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,870
I suppose it's better

356
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,590
than the Imperial Insignia Guards.

357
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,200
Before this,

358
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,680
Qian had a brave and valiant husband.

359
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,710
Now, it doesn't count.

360
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,110
Pei

361
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,990
got married to a civil official.

362
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,400
We have to find someone

363
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,830
with considerable military strength

364
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,990
to bring honor to our branch.

365
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,320
Yes, he has some health concerns,

366
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,230
but his family is quite prominent.

367
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,990
The son of the governor, huh?

368
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,870
I suppose Jiang Qiao
is marrying into a higher status.

369
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,110
She should consider herself lucky.

370
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,630
By the way,

371
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,830
find

372
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,560
a portrait of Jiang Qiao

373
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,080
and send it to the matchmaking agency.

374
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,350
We need to show
the Xiao family her portrait.

375
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,160
Yes, Madam Xiao.

376
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,470
This is pretty good.

377
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,080
Aunt, where's Qiao?

378
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,110
Your mother summoned her.

379
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,200
She should return by now.

380
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,069
Qiao.

381
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:05,990
What happened?

382
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,310
Did something happen?

383
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Come on. Have a seat.

384
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,310
Hurry.

385
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
Did your mother put you on the spot?

386
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,790
Have some tea first.
You can tell us about it.

387
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:20,960
Here.

388
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,680
Mother is arranging a marriage for me.

389
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,510
Isn't that great?

390
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,750
What kind of family is it?

391
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,230
Do you not like him?

392
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,470
She never harbored any good intentions.

393
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,440
Look at

394
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
the kinds of husbands

395
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,750
she found for her daughters.

396
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,400
Qian has to move all the way to Lingxi,

397
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,840
let alone Qiao.

398
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,360
Aunt, help me out.

399
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,710
All right.

400
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,160
Tell me

401
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,470
the details.

402
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,510
Mother summoned me.

403
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,400
After that, she hired someone

404
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,750
to draw my portrait.

405
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,550
And then,
she'll deliver the portrait to...

406
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,160
No.

407
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,640
This won't do.

408
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,680
Why don't I send my men

409
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,400
to make an inquiry first?

410
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,600
No! I don't want to get married!

411
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,960
There's nothing to inquire about.

412
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,990
She just wants you

413
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,960
to marry into a higher status

414
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,680
so that she can compete
with Zhan's success and please Anmou.

415
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,310
Qiao,

416
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,400
I haven't asked you

417
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,120
about your ideal marriage yet.

418
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,310
What kind of husband

419
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,200
are you looking for?

420
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,640
I don't want

421
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,640
to be married to a stranger.

422
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,550
I want to be married to someone I love.

423
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,230
Qiao, I hope
that your wish will come true.

424
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,470
What exactly should I do?

425
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,640
Don't worry.

426
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,840
I'll come up with a solution for you.

427
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,070
- Excellent!
- Bravo!

428
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,510
The secret tunnel is very complex.

429
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,990
It's filled with traps and dangers.

430
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,600
One will perish

431
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,550
if they lose focus even for a second.

432
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,270
Li Qingyun relied on

433
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,200
his exceptional courage and wisdom

434
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,310
to conquer one trap after another.

435
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,030
Lastly, at the end of the secret tunnel,

436
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,510
he found a...

437
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Do you know what he found?

438
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,510
Zhan, your expression

439
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,200
is different now.

440
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,790
He's different after becoming
an Imperial Insignia Guard.

441
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,070
- Indeed.
- That's right.

442
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,400
Come on.

443
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,070
Let's congratulate my son

444
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,550
on becoming an Imperial Insignia Guard.

445
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,600
It's nothing worth mentioning.

446
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,070
I shall drink tea instead of liquor.

447
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,790
All right.

448
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,550
Congratulations, Zhan.

449
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,360
Congratulations.

450
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,270
- Congratulations, Zhan.
- Congratulations, Jiang.

451
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,920
Thank you.

452
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,230
Please take your seats.

453
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,120
I'll proceed first.

454
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,600
Jiang, here.

455
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,880
Yu?

456
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,120
It's engraved with a Ruyi design.

457
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,270
Jiang, may you stay safe.

458
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,230
Now, you're an Imperial Insignia Guard.

459
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,990
Although you don't need
to go to the battlefield,

460
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,470
you still have to be careful.

461
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,840
This way, your family won't need
to worry about you.

462
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:04,960
Yu,

463
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,310
I'm just a guard.

464
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,600
Yu,

465
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,880
you're thoughtful indeed.

466
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,880
Thank you, Yu.

467
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,030
Commandant Yu has a point.

468
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,360
I've made

469
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,160
a protective pouch

470
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,200
for Zhan.

471
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,750
Zhan, may you stay safe
and free from worries.

472
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,840
Yi, I'm a grown-up now.

473
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,790
You shouldn't have.

474
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,230
Zhan,

475
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,990
I've also made a scented pouch

476
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,680
for you.

477
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,960
I named it

478
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,880
Yangui.

479
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,640
No matter the distance

480
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,510
or the weather,

481
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,680
the wild geese will always return.

482
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,230
Zhan, may you always return safely

483
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,310
from your duties.

484
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,510
All right.

485
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,750
I can't keep up the pretense.

486
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,990
I like them so much.

487
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,840
Thank you all so much.

488
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,360
This is great.

489
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,440
Pei, welcome home.

490
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,790
Here.

491
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,120
Here. Try this.

492
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,640
Thank you, Father.

493
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,400
Qiao, why aren't you eating?

494
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,200
Perhaps she has no appetite.

495
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,840
Qiao, maybe just a few bites?

496
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,160
Qiao, if you're not enjoying the food,

497
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,120
we can try
a different restaurant next time.

498
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,270
Try it.

499
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,880
Why is she crying?

500
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
Qiao, what's wrong?

501
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,990
Anmou, I have a request.

502
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,200
What is it?

503
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,310
Madam Xiao wishes to arrange
a marriage for Qiao.

504
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,270
It's with the Xiao family,
the family of Lingbei's governor.

505
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,840
Lingbei's governor?

506
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,310
He

507
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,360
has a great reputation.

508
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,710
And, his ancestors had rendered
military merits in the past.

509
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,960
Wouldn't it be great

510
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,710
for my daughter
to marry into their family?

511
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,550
I asked someone to look into it.

512
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,750
It is supposed to be Xiao Lang,

513
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,710
the second son of the official wife.

514
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,600
He takes medicine and tonics every day.

515
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,270
He's a sickly man.

516
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,400
I've heard of that before.

517
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,710
The Xiao family has a son
who possesses powerful might.

518
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,920
It's a shame

519
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,960
that he was left
with a chronic condition.

520
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,550
He never went on the battlefield

521
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,440
since then.

522
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,230
Seems like we're referring

523
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,160
to that man.

524
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,510
Anmou.

525
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,400
All these years,

526
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:23,960
I've never made a plea

527
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,200
in front of you.

528
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,120
You brought me to your family,

529
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,550
kept me well-dressed and well-fed,

530
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,640
and provided me with a home.

531
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,470
But I only have two daughters.

532
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,030
I can't just let Qiao

533
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,270
be married to a sickly man.

534
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,840
You shouldn't say that.

535
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,750
Mr. Xiao served the country
to the best of his abilities.

536
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,310
He has established

537
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,880
a good reputation.

538
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,030
But Qiao

539
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,790
isn't enlisting in his ranks.

540
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,230
No woman in the world

541
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,750
is willing to be married
to a sickly man.

542
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,120
Qiao was pampered by Old Madam and you

543
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,550
from a young age.

544
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,030
How could she get used
to such a rough life?

545
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,120
If she does marry into the family,

546
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,200
she'll suffer.

547
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,120
Anmou!

548
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,310
Qiao, what do you think?

549
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,470
Father.

550
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,070
Can you please not chase me out?

551
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,550
I don't wish to get married yet.

552
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,360
All right.

553
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
Understood.

554
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,550
Today's a joyous day indeed.

555
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,400
Even the moon looks bigger tonight.

556
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,960
If only this moment

557
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,440
could last forever.

558
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,790
If only I could have a scented pouch

559
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:32,550
called Yangui.

560
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,790
Mr. Yu, we see each other

561
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,070
almost every day.

562
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,550
It's not like you're going anywhere.

563
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,200
I came from Yangui City.

564
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,030
It

565
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,200
might be a remote border town,

566
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,360
but it's busy in its own way,

567
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,840
and the people there
enjoy a peaceful life.

568
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,030
I love

569
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,310
living in a town like that.

570
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,030
Is that so?

571
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:52,920
That's right.

572
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,310
I've also thought about it before.

573
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,710
If someday,

574
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,750
I no longer wish
to live in Ling'an City,

575
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,600
I'll go

576
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,030
somewhere pretty,

577
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,710
get some farmland

578
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,400
and put up a small house.

579
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,470
I'll live there

580
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,030
and lead a simple yet free life.

581
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,030
By then,

582
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,510
I'll take Father,

583
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,710
Yi,

584
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,840
Zhan,

585
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,640
Chuchu,

586
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,120
Aman,

587
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,510
and Long Dan with me.

588
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,510
And...

589
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,960
And Erniu.

590
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,120
That's good.

591
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,310
And you.

592
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,230
Are you willing to join me, then?

593
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,920
Absolutely.

594
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,440
Is this

595
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,470
considered a promise between us?

596
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:41,790
Of course.

597
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,440
All right. I'll remember it.

598
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,550
Will you deceive me, then?

599
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,070
Impossible.

600
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,360
Actually, I...

601
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,750
What is it?

602
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,640
I just wanted to tell you

603
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,550
that the moon looks bigger now.

604
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,310
It's even prettier now.

605
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,360
My Lady, you're elated today.

606
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,400
Is it because of Commandant Yu?

607
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,840
Not entirely.

608
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,440
Now,

609
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,440
my family is reunited.

610
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,680
I have a place to return to.

611
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,160
It's rare

612
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,790
and blissful for me.

613
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,990
Aman.

614
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,710
If only

615
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,840
our days could be like this

616
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,640
for the rest

617
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,310
of our lives.

618
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,470
Wouldn't it be great?

619
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,440
Meat again? Seriously?

620
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,400
Didn't I tell you

621
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,200
Madam's on a vegetarian diet?

622
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,990
Forget it.

623
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:14,960
I'm alone.

624
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,840
I don't eat much anyway.

625
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,640
I'll skip my meal.

626
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,600
Miss Pei has returned.

627
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,360
The dweller of Xiaoxiang Garden
was in for a treat.

628
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,990
Mr. Anmou ordered a feast.

629
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,710
They had a meal in her room.

630
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,440
She's just a vixen
who entered through the backdoor.

631
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
She's just plain lucky.

632
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,070
I don't know why Anmou

633
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,200
fell for her.

634
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,600
He's not tired of her
even after so many years.

635
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,710
Mr. Anmou.

636
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,960
Anmou?

637
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,840
Anmou, why are you here?

638
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,070
Get us a pot of liquor. Hurry.

639
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,030
Anmou, you haven't eaten yet, right?

640
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,200
Great timing. Come on.

641
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,840
Let's have a meal together.

642
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,640
I came here to tell you something.

643
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,880
The food they serve outside

644
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,470
isn't as good as our home-cooked food.

645
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:07,840
Come on.

646
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,200
Anmou, let's have a drink.

647
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,200
I'll do it.

648
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,030
Dear.

649
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,160
You don't have to

650
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,360
worry about Qiao's marriage anymore.

651
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,840
They can

652
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:40,750
make the decision

653
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,030
themselves.

654
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,710
I was wondering

655
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,400
what brought you here.

656
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,680
So, you came here

657
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
because of Madam Ruan, huh?

658
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,230
The reason doesn't matter.

659
00:28:59,030 --> 00:28:59,750
Anyway,

660
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,920
stay out of this.

661
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,920
I'm getting involved anyway.

662
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,680
Why? Do my words mean nothing now?

663
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,070
Anmou,

664
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,400
I'm your official wife.

665
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,270
I'm also the female head

666
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,510
of the Count of Dongping's Mansion.

667
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,120
The marriages of our children

668
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,600
are my responsibility.

669
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,120
You've always been decisive
with your words.

670
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,510
But we shouldn't break the rules.

671
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,550
We can't afford to embarrass

672
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,470
the Count of Dongping's Mansion

673
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,120
for the sake of a concubine's daughter.

674
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,790
Why complicate things?

675
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,840
Is there nothing new

676
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,070
in Ling'an City?

677
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,640
Are all of them

678
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,200
keeping an eye on my daughters?

679
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,120
Besides,

680
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,550
Pei's mother

681
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,640
arranged the marriage for her too.

682
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:50,790
Look at

683
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,710
how well she's doing now.

684
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,600
If you want to blame someone,

685
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,710
you should blame yourself
for finding the wrong candidate.

686
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:58,510
For Pei,

687
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,360
I wanted to betroth her

688
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,510
to Mr. Zhen Heng
of the Capital Administration Office.

689
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,230
But they took advantage of the situation

690
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,200
and married her off

691
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,400
while I was sick.

692
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,470
Anmou,

693
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,070
you should listen

694
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,750
to both sides of the story.

695
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,920
Qiao is the third eldest girl

696
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,600
in the family.

697
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,440
She's no longer young.

698
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,030
Besides, she is

699
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,270
shy and quiet.

700
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,120
Bringing her out

701
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,960
is like bringing someone
who's always in her shell.

702
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,440
Arranging a marriage for her

703
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,550
is no easy feat.

704
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,230
In addition,

705
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,990
our family's reputation

706
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,600
has deteriorated over the years.

707
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,600
Jiang Si insisted on
annulling her marriage before this.

708
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,160
The entire Ling'an City

709
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,200
has heard about it.

710
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,120
Isn't it embarrassing enough?

711
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,600
Do you want the daughters of our branch

712
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,440
to imitate her?

713
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,200
Dear.

714
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,160
You're a mother yourself.

715
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,750
No matter how good Mr. Xiao is,

716
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,160
you should search your conscience.

717
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,990
Is he truly a good candidate

718
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,750
as a husband?

719
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,510
Mr. Xiao

720
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,160
just has a weak body.

721
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,160
That was also because
he battled on the front lines.

722
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,440
That's why he has a health condition.

723
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,310
To His Majesty,

724
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,920
he has rendered military merits.

725
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,920
Many have earned military merits.

726
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,200
And His Majesty favors

727
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,960
numerous others.

728
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,600
You can't expect Qiao
to marry a sickly man.

729
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:20,710
I know.

730
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,510
You held a grudge
against Madam Ruan all these years.

731
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,550
But even if you wish to vent your anger,

732
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,230
you shouldn't vent it

733
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,200
on my child.

734
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:29,960
Anmou.

735
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,710
Why would there

736
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,230
be a grudge between me and Madam Ruan?

737
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,960
Why would I vent my anger

738
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,510
on the children?

739
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,840
Anmou.

740
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,990
I'm doing this for your sake.

741
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,550
I'm trying to bring honor to our branch.

742
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,470
When Zhan left Mother's room

743
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,230
after he assumed his position,

744
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,400
other people might not know

745
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,510
what you were thinking,

746
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,070
but I knew what was on your mind.

747
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,160
Stop it!

748
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,360
I've never seen

749
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,160
a female head

750
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,990
like you

751
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,230
who stirs up trouble
and distorts the truth.

752
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,440
No matter how cowardly I am,

753
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,960
I'll never jeopardize
