I'll take a look around.

Go ahead.

to stay overnight here.

00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,590
But today's rain

196
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,870
is quite unusual.

197
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,710
If you were really caught in it,

198

Once the rain stops,

we'll leave immediately.

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,920
I was too anxious.

245
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,470
That's why we fell into their trap.

246
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,590
They replaced someone with Sang Qi.

247
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,080
Could Sang Qi be dead?

She has a weak constitution,

281

and she caught a cold.

282
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,990
That's why the fever came.

last night.

286
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,920
Could this old house

287
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,350
be haunted?

288
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,990
Could that be why Jiang Si...?

290
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,960
that's possible.

291
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,080
This old house

292
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,590
has been here for years.

293
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,800
But we have nowhere to go,

294
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,750
so we can only stay here.

295
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,200
I'll perform acupuncture for Miss Jiang

296
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,800
and brew a medicinal concoction.

297
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,400
That should help.

Men can't go inside.

305
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,870
Acupuncture will only suppress

306
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,830
the cold in her body temporarily.

307
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,750
She's deficient in both blood and qi.

308
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,280
Also, I'm out of herbs.

is to get ice

311
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,230
to lower her fever.

312
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,350
I'll go buy some. Where can I find it?

Yes.

look after Miss Jiang for me.

352

353
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,120

354

You're sick, Miss Jiang.

361
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,750
You should take...

362
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,680
I won't drink your medicine.

363
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,790

Why shouldn't I?

367
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,550
No wonder I kept feeling

368
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,550
someone touching my hand

369
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,470
while I was sleeping.

370
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,440
How could a girl

371
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,680
have such a habit?

372
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,400
Girl?

373
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,160
You think you're smart, don't you?

374
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
You're a man!

375
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,440
I was interested in you
from the moment I saw you.

376
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,230
Help, Zhan!

377
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,230
Let go of me.

378
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,400

386

she fell ill and then
was taken by bandits.

Do you admit your fault?

Sir,

424
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,270
some bandits stormed into Shan'an Hall

425
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,160
and abducted my sister.

426
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,680
Please send your men to search for her.

Well, then.

You're county magistrate.

how big of a loss it would be

My wife, Arong, went missing.

Your wife is gone too?

00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,680
Some time ago,
when I was in your residence,

for treatment.

And

490

It's Shan'an Hall again.

491
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,710

570
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,470
it wouldn't make a difference.

571
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,920
I've already

572
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,600
been assaulted

573
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,160
by that vile son.

574
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:56,790
I...

575
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,200
Arong,

576
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,510
we'll find a way

577
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,360
to get out of this place.

578
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,030
Think about your family.

579
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,400
We mustn't give up.

580
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,790
My husband.

581
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,400
It's been so long

582
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,070
since my husband
received a letter from me.

583
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,440
He must still be waiting for me.

584
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,120
Quiet.

585
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,880
Drink up.

586
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,840
What's taking Si so long

587
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,750
to deliver the food?

588
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,360
Go check on him.

589
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,510
You all keep drinking.

590
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,470
Come on.

591
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,550
Let's eat up.

592
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,710
Do the new chicks today

593
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,310
have a good market?

594
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,750
Is anyone taking them?

595
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,680
Oh, they're fine goods.

596
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,510
They're all fine.

597
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,470
Go.

598
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,120
Glad to hear that.

599
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,790
Keep drinking.

600
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,710
More.

601
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,030
We can't stop.

602
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,960
Come on. Drink up.

603
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,120
We can't stop.

604
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,470
That chick is such a fine lady.

605
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,070
Come on.

606
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:13,920
Who's there?

607
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,400
Run, I dare you.

608
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,030
Run.

609
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,030
I'll wait for you.

610
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:20,710
Arong!

611
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,120
Arong!

612
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,510
You two, go that way.

613
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,230
Yes. Let's go.

614
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,990
You, come with me.

615
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,400
Yes.

616
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:36,790
After her.

617
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:37,440
Quick.

618
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:39,550
Don't let her get away.

619
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,360
Stop right there.

620
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:41,840
Stop.

621
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,030
Stay where you are.

622
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:44,840
Stop.

623
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,680
She's over there.

624
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,990
You two, head that way.

625
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,600
Yes. Go.

626
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,360
We go that way.

627
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:54,790
Yes.

628
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,310
Where's she?

629
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,750
Hurry!

630
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,230
Nice running.

631
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,510
Are you still running?

632
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,960
Got her.

633
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,640
I'm bushed.

634
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,710
Where's Arong?

635
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,160
What Arong?

636
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,510
You mean

637
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,880
the woman who's carrying my child?

638
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,120
Mother. The one

639
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,960
who tried to run away with her.

640
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,680
What did you do to her?

641
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,680
When I caught her earlier,

642
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:41,990
I happened to check her pulse.

643
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,600
I never expected her to be pregnant
for months.

644
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,200
Before her belly starts showing,

645
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,880
sell her off to a pleasure house.

646
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,750
Bring her out.

647
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,230
Quick.

648
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,310
Arong.

649
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,510
Madam, she's here.

650
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,680
Arong.

651
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,270
Miss Jiang.

652
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,710
Arong!

653
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,960
Don't mind me.

654
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,200

Later,

00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,400

What a corruption.

687
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:28,920
No wonder.

688
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,920
This is just a token of my appreciation.

689

Let's go.

692
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,600
No.

693
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,270
Why?

694
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,880
We don't know
how many of them are inside.

695
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,120
If we act recklessly,

696
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:39,990
they might

697
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,230
harm Miss Jiang.

00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,360
What should we do then?

699
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:45,840
Long Dan.

700
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,360
Yes.

701
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,960
Bring Mr. Zhen here now.

702
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,710
Yes, Chief.

703
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,880
Be careful.

704
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:50,750
Here you are.

705
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,920
You all stay here.

706
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,960
I'll take a look inside.

707
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,510
Be careful, Qi.

708
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,550
Just stay here

709
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,790
quietly.

710
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,640
I'll get you beautiful clothes.

711
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:17,960
Let's go.

712
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:23,600
Jiang Si.

713
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,550
I didn't see you when I got back.

714
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,400
I was so worried
something bad might happen to you.

715
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,360
I was terrified.

716
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,360
You're finally here.

717
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,440
Don't be scared.

718
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,960
Come with me.

719
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,160
We can't leave yet.

720
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,750
If we go now,

721
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,840
Madam Shen and Shen Xin'er

722
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,160
will destroy all the evidence.

723
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,030
And

724
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,230
more women

725
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,270
will fall prey to them.

726
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,440
All right.

727
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,550
I'll stay outside and watch over you.

728
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,550
Put this on.

729
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,720
Why did you even try to escape?

730
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,469
Your face is dirty.

731
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,840
You're nothing like a man.

732
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,760
You still have to listen to your mother

733
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:22,440
even though you're a grown-up.

734
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:23,760
What did you say?

735
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,880
Was I wrong?

736
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,590
However, I think

737
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,880
you have

738
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,070
a soft heart for women.

739
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,360
It wasn't your choice

740
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,760
to harm

741
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,630
all those women.

742
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,960
Besides, you dress as a woman.

743
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,030
How could you possibly

744
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,440
find a woman who loves you?

745
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,110
If you're arrested one day,

746
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,760
you'll be doomed.

747
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,590
What are you getting at?

748
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,239
You people

749
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,440
have already ruined my reputation,

750
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
and I have nowhere to go.

751
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,110
If I say

752
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,880
I'm willing to be with you,

753
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,469
will you

754
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,880
abandon your mother

755
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,240
and take me away immediately?

756
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,440
Do you mean it?

757
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:03,920
Do you think

758
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,840
I have other choices?

759
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,320
A woman is in a desperate situation

760
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,550
once her reputation is tarnished.

761
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,840
All right.

762
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,800
If you'll have me,

763
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,630
I'll take you away today.

764
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,190
We have plenty of money now.

765
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,360
But...

766
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,800
my mother is no easy person.

767
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,880
That money isn't mine yet.

768
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,960
Is there anything

769
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,990
that's very important

770
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,150
to your mother

771
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,960
that she'd risk herself

772
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,240
to protect it?

773
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:41,630
If you can

774
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,510
find it

775
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,800
and keep it in your possession,

776
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,630
she'll give you

777
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:46,990
anything you want.

778
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,630
I got it.

779
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,920
Dear, wait for me.

780
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,630
Xin'er!

781
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,670
Where's she?

782
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,630
She ran away.

783
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,440
Si!

784
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:31,880
Miss Si!

785
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,630
Zhan.

786
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,240
I thought

787
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,150
I would never see you again.

788
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,110
- Si.
- Jiang Si.

789
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,550
- Si.
- Zhan.

790
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,880
Are you all right?

791
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,920
Did they do anything to you?

792
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,240
I'm fine. Don't worry.

793
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,470
Mr. Zhen,

794
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,510
we're arriving in Lingwu soon.

795
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,550
The journey is a bit bumpy.

796
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,880
Are you all right?

797
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,720
Long Dan, I'm good.

798
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,920
We must keep moving.

799
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,320
I'm fine.

800
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:58,920
Miss Si,

801
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,630
have you seen a woman

802
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,760
called Arong?

803
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,280
She's my wife.

804
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:05,800
Have you seen her?

805
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,070
Mr. Yu,

806
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,190
have you seen Arong?

807
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,030
Qin.

808
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:11,720
Arong...

809
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,880
Arong took her own life.

810
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,720
Really?

811
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,190
This is impossible.

812
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,990
No.

813
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,280
Arong!

814
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,070
Qin.

815
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,630
I'm going to kill these monsters.

816
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,510
Master Qin.

817
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,440
Master Qin.

818
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,550
Master Qin.

819
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,720
Hold this for me.

820
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,800
You're injured.

821
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,030
It's nothing. I'll help him.

822
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:41,590
Wait.

823
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,720
Master Qin.

824
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,960
Master Qin.

825
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:50,760
Calm down.

826
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,470
I'm going to kill them

827
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,590
to avenge Arong.

828
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,840
Master Qin, we have no idea

829
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,630
what's inside.

830
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,510
Going in now

831
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,630
is putting your life on the line.

832
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,760
Arong's died.

833
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,070
What does my life matter?

834
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,800
Who will avenge her if you die?

835
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,550
Nice brew.

836
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,920
I want more.

837
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,670
Sir, here's to you.

838
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,760
Let me pour you some more.

839
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,590
Cheers.

840
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Why are you here again?

841
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,630
Magistrate Jia, you're incompetent,

842
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,360
and we're worried.

843
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,590
So of course, we had to return

844
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,510
to demand justice.

845
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,470
Ridiculous.

846
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,280
I don't have time

847
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,470
to argue with you pointlessly.

848
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,880
You corrupt official.

849
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,920
Your people are suffering,

850
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,150
yet you indulge yourself

851
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,110
in seeking pleasure here.

852
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:51,510
How dare you!

853
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,110
Get out of this place right now.

854
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:53,920
Or else,

855
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,470
I'll have you arrested.

856
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,800
I'm Yu Qi, the commandant
of the Capital Administration Office.

857
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,800
This case is now mine.

858
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,400
Oh, it's Commandant Yu.

859
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,320
Please pardon me.

860
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,550
I was too foolish
to recognize your greatness.

861
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,360
Please forgive me.

862
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,150
May I ask

863
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,590
what case

864
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,240
brings you here?

865
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,150
I believe you're well aware

866
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,320
of the mother and her son
from Shan'an Hall.

867
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,510
The son disguised himself as a woman

868
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,320
to assault, abduct,
and sell women into prostitution.

869
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,550
Do you have no idea at all
about all these?

870
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,190
I see.

871
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,990
You're talking
about Shen Xin'er and her mother.

872
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,800
They're well-received in the county

873
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,440
for their healing skills.

874
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,240
Magistrate Jia,

875
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,800
I'm truly impressed

876
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,880
by how you lie right through your teeth.

877
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,990
You turn a man

878
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:45,880
into a woman with mere words.

879
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,670
This is a misunderstanding.

880
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,630
Madam Shen gave you

881
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,070
a bag of silver

882
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,550
in the shack in the mountain, did she?

883
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:53,990
Mr. Jia.

884
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,110
Mr. Zhen.

885
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,840
"Officials do not fear my strictness
but my integrity.

886
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,190
The people are not convinced
by my ability but by my justice."

887
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,360
How would you ignore the truth

888
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,240
and misjudge the case

889
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,360
for your own greed?

890
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,670
You sit high above the people,

891
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,630
yet I'm merely

892
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,880
a lowly magistrate.

893
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,150
How can you possibly understand

894
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,840
if you haven't experienced it yourself?

895
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,360
If those innocent women

896
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
were discovered

897
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,510
to have visited

898
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,360
Shan'an Hall,

899
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,630
how would they ever

900
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,630
carry on with their lives?

901
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,670
Regarding Shen Xin'er's case,

902
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,470
I've obtained

903
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,070
solid evidence.

904
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,960
Mr. Jia,

905
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,630
you shielded criminals, abused the law,

906
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,960
and accepted bribes.

907
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:31,320
Guards.

908
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,760
Arrest him.

909
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,070
Yes.

910
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,360
- Hurry.
- Move.

911
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:35,510
Stay close.

912
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,110
Quick.

913
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:37,990
Hurry.

914
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,190
Master Qin!

915
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,510
I'm going to kill you all.

916
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,150
Master Qin, don't be impulsive.

917
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,280
I want to kill them

918
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,360
to avenge Arong.

919
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,670
Master Qin, you can't do this.

920
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,760
They deserve to die,

921
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,440
but if you kill them,

922
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,320
you'll be breaking the law.

923
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,630
You'll ruin yourself.

924
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,670
Killing them now

925
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,800
would be too easy on them.

926
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,240
Do you know what the punishment is

927
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:00,880
for their crimes?

928
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,110
They'll be executed

929
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,280
and suffer a gruesome death.

930
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,550
Guards, take them away.

931
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,030
Please spare my son.

932
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:06,550
Move.

933
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,630
I'm begging you.

934
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,510
Qin,

935
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,630
where are you going?

936
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,630
After losing Arong,

937
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,400
I have nowhere to go.

938
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,800
I've thought of retreating to a temple,

939
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,760
where I may find solace.

940
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,150
I came to bid you farewell
before I leave.

941
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:30,990
Qin...

942
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,510
I've made up my mind.

943
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,760
Please don't try to stop me.

944
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,030
Master Qin,

945
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,960
let me see you off.

946
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,190
Si,

947
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,320
we've stayed in Lingwu County too long.

948
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,670
If I stick to our plan

949
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,550
and return to Lingshui
for the ancestral ceremony,

950
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,510
I'll miss the registration

951
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,320
for the Imperial Insignia Guards.

952
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,190
I've told Yu

953
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,590
and Mr. Zhen to protect you.

954
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,030
With them by your side,

955
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,320
I'll be more at ease.

956
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,030
In that case, you should get going.

957
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,240
Duty comes first.

958
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,920
When I reach Lingshui,

959
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,240
I'll explain everything to Yi.

960
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,920
Take care of yourself.

961
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,400
Don't worry.

962
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,440
Let's go, Master Qin.

963
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,630
Take care, Miss Si.

964
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:15,760
Miss Jiang,

965
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,880
it's cold at night.

966
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,110
Don't catch a cold.

967
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,240
Zhen,

968
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,110
thank you for showing up on time.

969
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,150
Otherwise, Magistrate Jia

970
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,240
would've covered up

971
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,960
the case.

972
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,150
But you still look troubled.

973
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,720
I heard

974
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,400
many women

975
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,470
who went to Shan'an Hall before

976
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,720
were so harshly blamed

977
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,880
by their husbands' families
that they wanted to kill themselves.

978
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,190
I'm wondering

979
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,880
if I did the wrong thing.

980
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:42,590
Yes.
