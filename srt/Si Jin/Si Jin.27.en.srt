00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,030

Why would I do that?

18

Background and personality
are far more important

She submitted nothing
because she could paint nothing.

191
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,830
Your Majesty.

192
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,560
This painting is indeed my work.

193
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,400
But it's not blank.

194
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,160
Are you implying

195
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,990
everyone else here is blind?

196
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,870
There is a scent on this paper.

197
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,750
It reeks of a type of grass.

198
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,350
I grew up studying plants.

199
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,920
I learned about the plant

200
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,200
Traceless Grass.

201
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,160
Mixing ink

202
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,080
with its juice

203
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,590
will make the ink vanish

204
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,960
in less than 15 minutes.

205
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,960
I suspect my ink

206
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,080
had been tampered with

207
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,830
beforehand.

208
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,710
Your Majesty.

209
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,470
Could I have a cup of water?

210
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,320
Yes.

211
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,830
Pour it over the painting.

212
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,830
How dare you, Jiang Si?

213
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,440
Black flowers are only used
for a national funeral!

214
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,870
You insulted us with this painting!

215
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,590
Someone!

216
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,400
Drag her out and flog her with a rod!

217
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,230
Wait.

218
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,400
Please hear me out.

219
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,630
The black peonies

220
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,990
are indeed my work.

221
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,350
But I painted the black peonies

222
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,710
for a reason.

223
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,960
Fine. Do tell.

224
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,830
I'd like to hear

225
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,960
your reason.

226
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,710
The black peonies I painted

227
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,800
are not

228
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,080
meant for the guests here.

229
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,750
They are meant

230
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,800
for the late Empress.

231
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,510
Empress Qingrong loved peonies.

232
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,870
Everyone knows that.

233
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,160
Your Majesty had the Imperial Garden

234
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,960
filled with peonies

235
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,830
to mourn her passing, am I right?

236
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,920
Empress Qingrong
was kind and compassionate.

237
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,400
She cared about the common people.

238
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,680
She advocated frugality

239
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,830
and practiced it.

240
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,440
She was my role model.

241
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,800
She provided education

242
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,560
for the poor.

243
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,400
She founded free dispensaries

244
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,830
to save countless lives from disease.

245
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,630
Empress Qingrong

246
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,440
was beloved by the people of Zhou.

247
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,230
She is the woman

248
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,590
I look up to the most.

249
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,750
Today, I name this painting

250
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,800
"Spring Breeze Rises"

251
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,470
because

252
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,870
the thought of her

253
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,510
feels like a spring breeze.

254
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,750
Having known greatness,

255
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,230
most will pale in comparison.

256
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,400
The Imperial Garden

257
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,080
is full of vibrant colors,

258
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
but the black peonies

259
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,110
are rare and precious.

260
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,830
Not unlike Empress Qingrong,

261
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,280
who is irreplaceable

262
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,440
in Your Majesty's eyes.

263
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,630
How thoughtful of you.

264
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,080
Father.

265
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,200
It's a great painting.

266
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,470
But due to the tempered ink,

267
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,230
such a thoughtful piece of artwork

268
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,680
could've been lost.

269
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,750
Sun Congxin.

270
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,960
How do you explain

271
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,160
Jiang Si's painting?

272
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,710
I had no idea the ink would vanish.

273
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,750
I am innocent, Your Majesty!

274
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,750
You were

275
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,710
behind this entire plot.

276
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,040
Why was Miss Jiang

277
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,710
the only one with tempered ink?

278
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,470
Who dares employ such trickery

279
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,830
right under my nose?

280
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,870
I'd like to examine the ink.

281
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:31,870
Yes.

282
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:41,960
Your Majesty.

283
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,630
The ink, brushes, and ink-stones

284
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,160
have all been cleaned.

285
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,630
There's nothing left.

286
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,470
Well done, Sun Congxin.

287
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,560
You did your job too well.

288
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,440
You made the painting vanish

289
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,200
and got rid of the evidence.

290
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,830
Displeased with the job

291
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,160
at the Office of Ceremonies?

292
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,350
I did no such thing!

293
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,110
This was done during a royal banquet.

294
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,750
He must have accomplices.

295
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,710
Your Majesty,

296
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,080
let me interrogate him.

297
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,680
Brother,

298
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,230
from what I know,

299
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,830
the Seventh Prince and Miss Jiang

300
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,510
share a relationship.

301
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,560
It's best he's not involved.

302
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,800
We should first detain

303
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,870
Sun Congxin

304
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,750
and try him later.

305
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,080
The noble ladies of Ling'an are here

306
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,440
for the banquet.

307
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,710
This matter concerns

308
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,040
the image of the royal family.

309
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,680
What do you think, Brother?

310
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,470
That's right, Rong Yang.

311
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,080
Get Sun Congxin out of my sight.

312
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,350
Your Majesty!

313
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,350
I've been framed!

314
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,400
I swear!

315
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,870
Your Majesty,

316
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,510
Your Majesty!

317
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,160
this matter was unsettling,

318
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,990
but it was also eye-opening.

319
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,470
We witnessed Miss Jiang's

320
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,160
black peonies with a special touch.

321
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,160
How about

322
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,960
we let her compete

323
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,830
in the second round?

324
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,230
I agree with your suggestion.

325
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,510
My gratitude.

326
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,800
Thank you, Your Majesty
and Concubine Zhuang.

327
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,200
What is your name?

328
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,470
Your Majesty,

329
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,110
I am the Deputy Director
of the Office of Ceremonies,

330
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,920
Lan Xingwen.

331
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,510
Very well.

332
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,590
Next,

333
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,680
you shall oversee the contest.

334
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,040
Thank you.

335
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,080
Who would use dried wood
and flower buds

336
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,040
for floral arrangements?

337
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Hilarious.

338
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,990
Time's up.

339
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,750
Your Majesty,

340
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,040
this is from Kou Lingbo
of the Grand Preceptor's Mansion.

341
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:38,870
Your Majesty,

342
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,680
the name of this artwork

343
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,920
is "Running Brook."

344
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Fresh and elegant.
You shall be rewarded.

345
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,200
Your Majesty,

346
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,110
this is from Princess Mingyue.

347
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,160
Mine is called "House Full of Radiance."

348
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,110
It does bring vibrancy to the garden.

349
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,110
There is a second side.

350
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,080
The design is the character "Zhou."

351
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,440
I'd like to use this design

352
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,040
to wish Your Majesty
a long life of prosperity.

353
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,320
May the realm thrive and flourish.

354
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,560
Wonderful.

355
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,400
Symbolic mastery of form and spirit.

356
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,510
Very well.

357
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,510
Many thanks, Uncle.

358
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,110
Mother taught me well.

359
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,320
I am

360
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,350
but an amateur.

361
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,560
Indeed.

362
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
Your mother is a master
of floral arrangement.

363
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,470
None of the contestants

364
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,830
can even compare.

365
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,080
Stop making fun of me, Brother.

366
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,350
They are the stars of this banquet.

367
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,680
Your Majesty,

368
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,440
this is from Jiang Si
of the Count of Dongping's Mansion.

369
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,440
Miss Jiang,

370
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,230
why do you use flower buds
instead of flowers?

371
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,110
You even decorate it with dried twigs.

372
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,510
Your Majesty,

373
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,350
I call this arrangement

374
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,710
"Spring's Rebirth."

375
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,710
It symbolizes how even after hardship,
life blossoms anew.

376
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,680
I only see a dead branch.

377
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,990
Where's the renewal?

378
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:07,990
Miss Jiang.

379
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,920
Is this a magic trick?

380
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,200
It's no magic trick.

381
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,710
The blossoming season

382
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,069
will soon pass

383
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,200
in this garden,

384
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,599
but only these two buds

385
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,599
are yet to bloom.

386
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,160
I thought I could

387
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,310
rush them a little

388
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,680
so they could catch up

389
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,839
and bloom.

390
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,470
If you manage

391
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,230
to make the buds bloom,

392
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,070
then it's no magic,

393
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,200
but a literal miracle and wonder.

394
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,230
I've never heard

395
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,550
of such a trick.

396
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,750
Jin, do you think
Miss Jiang can actually

397
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,230
make them bloom?

398
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,550
I'm quite curious.

399
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,160
Is this...

400
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,880
Is it the water temperature?

401
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,920
Is there something in the water?

402
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,960
Well done, Miss Jiang.

403
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,470
I'm flattered.

404
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,160
I present this
to the Imperial Concubines

405
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,310
as a gift

406
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,030
to wish them

407
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,470
everlasting youth.

408
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,400
This is the first time I've seen anyone

409
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,030
make the flower bloom.

410
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,510
I appreciate your consideration,
Miss Jiang.

411
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,200
Miss Jiang's gift

412
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,920
is definitely unique.

413
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,360
Witnessing such a marvel

414
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,230
is truly eye-opening.

415
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,750

to Jiang Si?

476
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,070
Jin.

477
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,230
I must say,

478
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,270
that was utter nonsense.

479
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,640
Ridiculous!

480
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,270
Is this a place for that?

481
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,680
This is a formal and serious event.

482
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,360
All the more reasons

483
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,310
to take it seriously.

484
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,920
Father, I wasn't fooling around.

485
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,510
All the ladies present today came from

486
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,120
esteemed families.

487
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,880
Giving all six flowers

488
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,070
to one person

489
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,070
seems rather unfair

490
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,840
to the other ladies.

491
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,680
Fairness?

492
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,440
Aunt.

493
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,680
There is no absolute fairness

494
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,880
in this world.

495
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,120
I only want Jiang Si

496
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,030
to have the flowers.

497
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,120
It wouldn't be fair

498
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,310
if I were forced to give them

499
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,360
to the other ladies.

500
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,840
I'd be lying to myself.

501
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,310
Aunt, that'd be ridiculous.

502
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,600
No, it's not!

503
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,920
This is not a banquet
to pick a concubine.

504
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,550
You were to pick a principal consort.

505
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,920
I am but one man.

506
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,640
I don't need six consorts.

507
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,310
Mother, calm down.

508
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,070
It baffles me.

509
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,510
Why did you give the flowers

510
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,990
to Jiang Si alone?

511
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,680
My reason is simple.

512
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,710
There is but one.

513
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,270
The moment I laid eyes on her,

514
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,030
I knew she was the one.

515
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,120
Well said.

516
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,990
Prince Yan, there are things
you are simply too young

517
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,550
to even understand.

518
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,640
Choosing the right one

519
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,120
takes more than just a whim

520
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,840
and the feeling of falling in love.

521
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,990
You will share a life.

522
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,120
There are a plethora of things
to consider.

523
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,840
But there are people

524
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,230
who I find annoying

525
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,200
at first glance.

526
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,680
How can I live with them?

527
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,510
Father.

528
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:46,920
You and Mother

529
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,790
made me a promise.

530
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,030
You promise I could choose the one

531
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,120
to my liking.

532
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,790
Jiang Si is the one

533
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,200
that fits my liking.

534
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,920
You had it planned

535
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,230
all along?

536
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
A flawless plan

537
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,310
that fooled me

538
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,360
and your mother.

539
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,710
I never did that.

540
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,790
You're not choosing a wife
to your liking.

541
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,400
You are doing whatever you please.

542
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,360
This is against the rule.

543
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,840
I will never agree!

544
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,550
Take them back

545
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,470
and give them to everyone

546
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,550
or

547
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,920
I will make the arrangements for you.

548
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,030
That was a gift from a prince.

549
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,230
I can't take it back.

550
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,030
Right, Father?

551
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,230
Your Majesty!

552
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,550
Prince Yan is...

553
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,710
Enough.

554
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,360
They were only flowers.

555
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,310
No need to make a fuss out of it.

556
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,400
The Floral Banquet is over.

557
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,510
Dismissed.

558
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,160
Yes.

559
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:42,750
Your Majesty!

560
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,710
I'll see you off.

561
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,120
Calm down.

562
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,600
Giving out flowers

563
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,310
was merely a tradition.

564
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,160
There are no written rules

565
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,200
about it.

566
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,120
Prince Yan doesn't get the final say

567
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,070
about which of them
will become his consort.

568
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,310
Well said, Princess Royal.

569
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,790
Why did you

570
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,120
get so upset earlier today?

571
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,680
The boy grew up
in the Southern Frontier.

572
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,030
I feel sorry for him too.

573
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,270
But he can't simply disregard

574
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,990
the rules of the royal family.

575
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,790
I think

576
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,600
Miss Jiang is a fine candidate.

577
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:39,990
Your Majesty!

578
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,200
I had it examined.

579
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,310
The name Miss Jiang hid in the flowers

580
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,160
was "Yu Jin."

581
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,200
It's clear they feel connected.

582
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,750
Why not give them your blessing?

583
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,750
Perhaps you're unaware.

584
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,840
Miss Jiang

585
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,510
once annulled an engagement
with the son

586
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,230
of the Duke of Anguo.

587
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,270
Is that so?

588
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,990
That is not a serious matter.

589
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,710
In the past, an empress

590
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,510
was even married

591
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,990
and had two kids

592
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,440
with her former husband.

593
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,550
In the end,

594
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,510
she and the emperor
brought prosperity to the realm.

595
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,550
And she was lauded for her deeds.

596
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,360
That is not the same.

597
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,070
Dear,

598
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,270
it's Jin's consort,

599
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,270
not the Crown Prince's.

600
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,230
As long as he is happy,

601
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,510
that's enough.

602
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,360
Look at the bright side.

603
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,510
Isn't it fun to have

604
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,270
a daughter-in-law
who knows magic tricks

605
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,790
to cheer you up?

606
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,920
I am mad

607
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,680
because he should've told me

608
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,470
before making these decisions.

609
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,470
He disregarded all of that.

610
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,600
Does he even

611
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,120
have any respect for his mother?

612
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,310
I have an idea.

613
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,920
I'll see what's Jin's take
on the matter.

614
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,400
Father. Mother.

615
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,640
Jin.

616
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,920
You said Miss Jiang was to your liking.

617
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,360
Do you intend to marry her?

618
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,550
Father,

619
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,840
you read my thoughts.

620
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,510
But she annulled an engagement.

621
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,200
You don't mind it now.

622
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,270
But what if

623
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,470
you regret it?

624
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,640
Will you blame me

625
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,160
for not upholding my promise?

626
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Convince me

627
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,750
as to why her past doesn't bother you.

628
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,790
A gem overlooked by the blind

629
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,990
can still be cherished by the one

630
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,120
who knows its worth.

631
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,470
Very well.

632
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,680
I'll grant you the wish.

633
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,640
You may make Miss Jiang
your principal consort.

634
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,440
Many thanks, Father.

635
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,790
Many thanks to you too, Mother.

636
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,990
This decision is your responsibility.

637
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,840
Whatever the future holds for you,

638
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,880
you must endure it.

639
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,960
Don't worry.

640
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,880
I will be happy.

641
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:58,960
Go now.

642
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,750
I'll take my leave now.

643
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,710
See how thrilled he is?

644
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,550
This boy is just too straightforward.

645
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,840
He can't contain his emotions.

646
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,710
I am concerned

647
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,070
about his best interests.

648
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,470
And that made me the villain?

649
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,440
You're overthinking.

650
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,400
I'll leave Jin's wedding

651
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,750
in your capable hands.

652
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,400
He will understand your effort

653
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,550
sooner or later.

654
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:31,440
But I...

655
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,400
You may stay.

656
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,640
That silly brat.

657
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
He is too blunt.

658
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,470
Even if he adores her,

659
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,550
he could express
his affection more subtly.

660
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,750
Prince Yan has a pure heart.

661
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,120
He is a young man
with confidence and enthusiasm.

662
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,510
It's hard not to express
his true feelings.

663
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,470
Very well.

664
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,070
All six flowers for one girl.

665
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,750
He did the exact same thing

666
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,230
I was too afraid to even try.

667
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,980
[Count of Dongping's Mansion]

668
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,840
Si.

669
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,160
You received six flowers

670
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,990
at the Floral Banquet last night?

671
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,710
You've made our family proud.

672
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,750
So, who were they from?

673
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,880
Prince Yan.

674
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,640
Anyone else?

675
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,200
Nothing more.

676
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,960
They were all from Prince Yan.

677
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,160
This bodes trouble.

678
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,880
How so, Grandmother?

679
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,160
"The nail that sticks out
gets hammered."

680
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,960
Don't you understand that?

681
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,680
You outshone the others.

682
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,070
That will garner jealousy.

683
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,680
Even our family

684
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,790
will be at the center of criticism.

685
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,550
Mother!

686
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:07,470
Mother!

687
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,600
What is it?

688
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,440
Mother.

689
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,750
Rumors are spreading.

690
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,230
They're targeting Miss Si.

691
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,550
She's being called
a bringer of ill fortune.

692
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,310
They say regardless of any favor shown,

693
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,400
the royal family
will never acknowledge her.

694
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,440
They say we're naive

695
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,270
to think our girls

696
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,440
can rise to prominence and become great.

697
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,680
Si, did you hear that?

698
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,360
Do you know

699
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,310
how people see you?

700
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,510
You are too young and naive.

701
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,270
You should've been more reserved.

702
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,990
Yield when necessary.

703
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,510
Don't you know that?

704
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,990
If no one is embarrassed,

705
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,160
then everyone can be on good terms
with each other.

706
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,270
Indeed.

707
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,470
I will obey you

708
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,120
if it's anything else,

709
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,840
but when it comes to my marriage,

710
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,440
I won't hold back.

711
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,790
Think it through.

712
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,230
If he marries you,

713
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,470
all is well.

714
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,600
But what if he doesn't?

715
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,920
You will bring

716
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,990
tremendous shame to this family!

717
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,120
Enough.

718
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,710
For the time being,

719
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,470
stay in

720
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,120
your room,

721
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,070
reflect on this

722
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,880
and tone down your temper.

723
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,120
I don't want people to think

724
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,550
that we are overstepping

725
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,750
boundaries.

726
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,710
Yes.

727
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,070
I'll take my leave.

728
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,790
Mother, calm down.

729
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:35,880
Take it easy.

730
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,270
I've been thinking.

731
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,120
If he marries the prince,

732
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,510
I should be happy.

733
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,680
I want the girls
to marry great husbands.

734
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,550
But...

735
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,920
Noble families
could be riddled with perils.

736
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,750
Mother, you are right.

737
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,030
Who knew

738
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,840
Commandant Yu was actually Prince Yan?

739
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,790
Ever since

740
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,400
she got close to Prince Yan,

741
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,600
she's been acting recklessly.

742
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,800
Mother, calm down.

743
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,110
I told you.

744
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,670
She shouldn't marry the prince.

745
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,840
You are endangering her!

746
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,510
Mingyue fell in love
with the Seventh Prince.

747
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,070
There is nothing I can do.

748
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,469
Very well.

749
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,469
The Seventh Prince gave all six flowers

750
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,719
to Jiang Si alone.

751
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,070
Mingyue saw it for herself.

752
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:24,989
She should give up.

753
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,760
The flowers meant nothing.

754
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,320
I put meticulous effort

755
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,320
into the Floral Banquet.

756
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,630
Yet, Jiang Si was unappreciative.

757
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,469
What a shame.

758
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,840
I almost got her punished.

759
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,630
As expected from Su Ke's daughter.

760
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,510
Just like her mother,

761
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,920
Jiang Si is trouble.

762
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:50,960
What?

763
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,760
Wasn't it enough

764
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,550
that you took Su Ke from me?

765
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:57,400
And now you want Mingyue

766
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,240
to steal the love of her daughter?

767
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,150
Is Mingyue your daughter,

768
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,720
or is it

769
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,360
that cursed Jiang Si?

770
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,590
Cut the nonsense!

771
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,590
Feeling guilty?

772
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,190
Did I touch a nerve?

773
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,990
No wonder there are rumors

774
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,510
that Su Ke and you have been so intimate

775
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,110
that she lost her purity long ago.

776
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,720
Perhaps the rumors are true.

777
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,320
Rong Yang.

778
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,920
That was out of line.

779
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,760
There was nothing between Su Ke and I.

780
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,280
She's been dead for years.

781
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,590
Must you tarnish her reputation?

782
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,400
How vile are you?

783
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:37,630
Silence!

784
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,030
You dare yell at me

785
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,030
over a dead woman?

786
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,030
Pretty.

787
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,070
So pretty.

788
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,800
This flower looks like you.

789
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:03,550
It's Her Highness.

790
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,990
- I'm sorry.
- Please forgive me, Your Highness.

791
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,030
Raise your head.

792
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,920
- Please have mercy!
- Please forgive me!

793
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,190
Please!

794
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,960
Bring me the torch!

795
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,190
Mother.

796
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,760
Mingyue.

797
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,110
When a man doesn't love you,

798
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,840
all of his finest qualities

799
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,400
are meaningless to you.

800
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,280
But I've seen

801
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,440
his finest qualities.

802
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,590
If I can't have him,

803
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:36,110
then I shall never have peace.

804
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,880
There are things

805
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,320
you can't have

806
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,630
if you seize it by force.

807
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,510
But Mother,

808
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,360
if I could do it again,

809
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,720
I would

810
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,880
make the same choice.

811
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,550
How can I swallow it

812
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,150
without first fighting for it?

813
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,190
Mother, please have faith in me.

814
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,150
I can change it.

815
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,670
You couldn't get what you yearned for.

816
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,150
Perhaps I could.

817
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:22,510
[Chengtian Hall]

818
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,110
Your Highness.

819
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,590
I must

820
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,320
thank you for saving me, General Cui.

821
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,920
It was my duty.

822
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,880
Greetings, Your Majesty.

823
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,150
Your Majesty,

824
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,670
Prince Xiang's rebellion
has been eradicated.

825
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,990
Seven forts reclaimed and 3000 captured.

826
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,880
Great work.

827
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,240
You should be rewarded

828
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,760
for your heroic deeds.

829
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,470
I shall betroth you

830
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,590
with my only sister,
Princess Royal Rong Yang.

831
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,400
What do you think?

832
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,320
Much obliged,

833
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,190
but I am engaged.

834
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,150
I must decline.

835
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:34,880
Very well.

836
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,190
I will help you win him over.

837
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,920
Old Madam,

838
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,320
why was a decree sent

839
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,670
to our doorstep?

840
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,880
I bet it's the Floral Banquet.

841
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:02,800
Si shouldn't have

842
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,190
drawn too much attention.

843
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,240
Especially from the Seventh Prince.

844
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,510
Who knows what trouble

845
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,030
awaits us this time?

846
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,510
The Old Madam is here.

847
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,800
A decree by His Majesty.

848
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,400
"Jiang Si, the daughter
of the Count of Dongping,

849
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,630
is kind and honest

850
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,070
and has outstanding qualities.

851
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,150
It was delightful
to learn of her virtues.

852
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,840
My seventh son, Jin,

853
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,320
has reached the age for marriage.

854
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,360
He must marry a virtuous wife.

855
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,760
I hereby

856
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,670
betroth her to the Seventh Prince.

857
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,630
A wedding shall be held
on an auspicious date.

858
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,800
The arrangement shall be executed."

859
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,440
I am grateful

860
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,840
for His Majesty's grace.

861
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,070
Miss Jiang Si,

862
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,070
please accept the decree.

863
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,400
Congratulations, Miss Jiang Si.

864
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,590
Many thanks.

865
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,800
Farewell, Your Excellency.

866
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:11,630
Grandmother.

867
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,190
Si.

868
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,960
Congratulations, Miss Si.

869
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,360
You deserve it, Miss Si!

870
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,630
Our sincerest congratulations, Miss Si.

871
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,240
Well deserved, Miss Si!

872
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,150
Aunt, are you going to be a consort?

873
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,190
[Jiang Si, Count of Dongping's Mansion]
Are you moving into the big palace?

874
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,440
I want to go with you!

875
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,240
Sure. You can

876
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,510
tag along.

877
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,630
Si,

878
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:32,840
congratulations.

879
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,590
Congratulations, My Lady!

880
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,030
Princess Consort Yan.

881
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,150
Your wish has come true at last.

882
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,550
Congratulations, Si.

883
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,070
Come on.

884
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,510
Keep it safe.

885
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,510
Si.

886
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,440
You know how powerful a prince is.

887
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,670
Our family will now have protection

888
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,630
with you as a member

889
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,590
of the royal family.

890
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,990
Things will get better

891
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,400
for the Jiang family

892
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,440
from now on.

893
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,320
You grew up

894
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,400
in this very courtyard.

895
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,670
I knew

896
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,920
you were a blessed person.

897
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,360
Prince Yan is a man of noble character.

898
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,670
You two are in love with each other.

899
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,030
I wish you

900
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,630
an everlasting marriage!

901
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,110
Much appreciated.

902
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,760
I owe it to my upbringing here.

903
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,400
You will need a hefty dowry

904
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,400
because you're marrying a prince.

905
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,550
I have

906
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,590
some bridal head ornaments
and accessories.

907
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,110
Come on, we shall pick together.

908
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:32,630
Come on.

909
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,960
- Let's go, Yan.
- Let's pick.

910
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,720
I'll pick for you, Aunt!

911
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,030
Sure.

912
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,360
They are gone.

913
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,630
What did the eunuch

914
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,840
call her?

915
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,470
Princess Consort Yan.

916
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,590
She is moving up

917
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,030
in the world.

918
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,760
My daughter was virtuous,

919
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,440
yet she ended up

920
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,590
with that cursed Cao Xingyu.

921
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,360
How is Si so fortunate?

922
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,150
She ends up becoming

923
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,800
Prince Yan's consort!
