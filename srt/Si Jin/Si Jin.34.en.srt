13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,880
Princess,

14
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,310
you should apologize

15
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,390
to the Princess Royal.

16
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,960
Mother! I'm sorry.

17
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,910
I shouldn't have kept you in the dark.

18
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,910
But I did burn the letter!

19
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,670
What's the point of arguing now?

20
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,640
Guards!

21
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,080
Take her to the detached residence.

22
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,190
No!

23
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,670
Mother!

24
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,080
I don't want to marry him!

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,600
Why don't you just kill him now?

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,240
I'm your only daughter!

27
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,030
You can't possibly make me

28
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,270
marry that useless scum!

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,110
You could have pleaded

30
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,760
with Uncle,

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,240

He has never ever

37
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,920
doubted me like that.

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,150

39
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,079

42
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,240

47
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,079

48
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,640
Now I understand.

49

What you truly care about

50
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,870
is your brother

51
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,710
and your power.

I am!

92
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,080
She gave birth to me and raised me.

93
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,880
You never cared for me when I was young.

94
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,000
So don't bother now.

95

Who are you calling your wife?

100
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,680
We were just wed.

101
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,120
It was even decreed by His Majesty.

102
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,790
And who do you think you are?

103
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,350
To be so arrogant?

104
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,680
You're right.

105
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,910
If not for His Majesty's decree,

106
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,880
you'd already be dead by my hands.

107
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,680
But don't worry.

108
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,590
I have plenty of ways

109
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,080
to make your life
more miserable than death.

110
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,470
Then you'll realize

111
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,880
you would have been better off

112
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,030
dying with your family
on the road to exile.

113
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,200
I already promised

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,560
not to expose this matter.

115
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,560
Why must you still be so ruthless?

116
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,760
Blame yourself.

117
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,080
They all died because of you.

118
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes.

119
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,470
It's all my fault.

120
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,150
If not for me,

121
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,680
they wouldn't have died.

122
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,520
Yi wouldn't have left me.

123
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,080
And I

124
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,150
would still see my Yan around.

125
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,880
You are pathetically laughable.

126
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,520
But worry not.

127
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,200
Your beloved Jiang Yi

128
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,390
and your daughter,

129
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,390
I will make sure

130
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,230
they suffer the worst pain
in this world.

131
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,470
I'll make you understand

132
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,470
that opposing me

133
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,230
comes at a terrible price.

134
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,270

135

Get out!

136
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,560
Don't disgust me

137
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,200
with the sight of you!

138
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,680
Be gone.

139
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,830
The wedding candles have gone out.

140
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,110
That is a terrible omen.

141
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,710

142
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,560
so fast?

147
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,990
From now on, I will grant her

148

whatever she wants.

149

00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,920
Find her!

379
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,990
Your Highness.

380
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,790
I know you're just trying

381
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,400
to scare me.

382
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,230
You're playing a prank on me.

383
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,600
This isn't real.

384
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,840
It can't be happening.

385
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,880
Your Highness.

386
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,600
I...

387
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,550
I was wrong.

388
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,510
Bring her back to me.

389
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,270
I… I was wrong.

390
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,230
Your Highness!

391
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,410
[Prince Yan's Mansion]

392
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,840
Dear.

393
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,270
From today onward,

394
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,750
I am no longer a member
of the Jiang family.

395
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,360
No one

396
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,640
will call me Jiang Si anymore.

397
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,920
Everyone will address me
as Princess Consort Yan.

398
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,600
I believe a good husband

399
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,400
should let his wife

400
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,640
always be herself.

401
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,510
You will always be Jiang Si.

402
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,270
Not a woman

403
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,200
whose identity is dictated by me.

404
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,990
If my wife ever feels

405
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,070
even the slightest bit of sorrow,

406
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,880
then I will make everyone call me

407
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,030
the son-in-law of the Jiang family.

408
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,440
All right.

409
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,510
I was overthinking it.

410
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,070
Dear, I want to visit
the Count of Dongping's Mansion

411
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,230
to see my sister and the others.

412
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,030
We should also move everything

413
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,750
from the Count of Dongping's Mansion

414
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,400
to Prince Yan's Mansion.

415
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,310
Of course.

416
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Isn't it almost time?

417
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,270
We should get ready to go to the palace

418
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,920
and pay our respects

419
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,200
to His Majesty and Her Majesty.

420
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,550
I won't go see Emperor Jingming.

421
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,640
Come on.

422
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,400
No matter what,

423
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,510
His Majesty

424
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,510
still granted us his blessing.

425
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,710
I think,

426
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,230
deep down, he is on your side.

427
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,310
Dear,

428
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,510
let's just think of it

429
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,070
as completing a necessary task.

430
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,510
If we don't go,

431
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,230
they will say we lack proper etiquette.

432
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,120
That will only cause more trouble.

433
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,270
My wife is absolutely right.

434
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,180
[Eternal Joy and Serenity]

435
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,030
I present dried meat
with ginger and cassia to Mother.

436
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,510
- Thank you, Mother.
- Thank you, Mother.

437
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,470
Seeing you two

438
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,920
marry

439
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,200
fills me with great joy.

440
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,070
Rise.

441
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,200
Take a seat.

442
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,470
May you both have a harmonious marriage

443
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,510
and many children.

444
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,470
Thank you, Fuqing.

445
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,840
You probably haven't heard of this yet.

446
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,400
Princess Mingyue is dead.

447
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,310
She was killed by Zhu Ziyu.

448
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,510
He then set himself on fire
and died as well.

449
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,640
No wonder we didn't see His Majesty

450
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,990
when we went to pay our respects

451
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,920
this morning.

452
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,880
We only heard

453
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,440
that he had gone
to the Princess Royal's Mansion.

454
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,990
Zhu Ziyu acted just as I expected.

455
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,600
But I didn't think

456
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,230
he would sacrifice his own life

457
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,960
to resolve this stalemate.

458
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,920
For someone like Zhu Ziyu

459
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,750
to do something so fearless

460
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,790
before his death.

461
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,230
Perhaps, for him,

462
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,360
it was a kind of redemption.

463
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,440
Although Zhu Ziyu killed
Princess Mingyue,

464
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,470
I know Princess Royal's nature.

465
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,510
She will surely

466
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,960
direct this hatred

467
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,920
toward the two of you.

468
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,990
She is ruthless.

469
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,600
There's no telling
what methods she might use

470
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,920
against you both.

471
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,680
Yu Jin, find an excuse

472
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,230
to take Jiang Si back
to the Southern Frontier.

473
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,310
The Red Plume Cavalry is there.

474
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,440
They can protect you both.

475
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,030
Fortune and disaster cannot be avoided.

476
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,840
We must face it.

477
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,230
Princess Royal has always

478
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,640
had it out for us.

479
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,550
We can adapt as needed.

480
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,990
We only fear bringing trouble to you.

481
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,270
You should distance yourself

482
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,270
from us

483
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,440
in public.

484
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,070
We will also

485
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,640
reduce our visits to Changning Palace.

486
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,160
Please forgive us.

487
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,790
I told you Jin and Si were not ones

488
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,360
to retreat in the face of danger.

489
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,160
Mother and I had already discussed it

490
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,710
before you arrived.

491
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,550
If you wished to leave,

492
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,840
we would find a way

493
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,070
to ensure your safe departure.

494
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,200
If you wished to stay,

495
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:27,990
Mother and I

496
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,310
would no longer stand aside
and protect only ourselves

497
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,230
as we did before.

498
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,440
This time,

499
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:32,960
we stand together.

500
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,510
[Ningxiang Hall]

501
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,160
I have

502
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,510
no biological son of my own.

503
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,550
Yu Jin, if you are willing,

504
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
I can request a decree from His Majesty

505
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,880
to adopt you as my son.

506
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,680
Empress Di,

507
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,510
shouldn't you first

508
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,470
ask Yu Jin's mother

509
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,070
if she agrees?

510
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,710
Greetings, Mother.

511
00:27:58,990 --> 00:27:59,470
Your Highness.

512
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,440
Imperial Concubine Xian.

513
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,230
How dare you enter Changning Palace

514
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:03,960
without an announcement?

515
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,990
By the time you announce me,

516
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,310
my son might have already been

517
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,790
taken away by someone else!

518
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,600
Imperial Concubine Xian.

519
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,120
It has been a while
since your last visit.

520
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,070
Be seated.

521
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,070
My daughter-in-law and son
just got married.

522
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,880
I waited in Jinhua Hall for ages,

523
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,790
but they never showed up.

524
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,510
It seems I won't get to drink

525
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,510
my new daughter-in-law's tea after all.

526
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,160
Mother.

527
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,230
His Highness and I were just preparing

528
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,470
to go to Jinhua Hall

529
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,360
to greet you.

530
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,360
Is that so?

531
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,600
But I just heard

532
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,310
that you were about to recognize

533
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,310
someone else as your mother.

534
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,120
Do I still have the right

535
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,510
to receive your greetings?

536
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,790
Your Highness,

537
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,440
are you referring

538
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,750
to my mother?

539
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,680
Though I am younger,

540
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,920
I understand

541
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
that my mother
is the head of the six palaces.

542
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:58,030
She is the official mother
of all the princes and princesses.

543
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,310
If she wishes to adopt Jin as her son

544
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,710
and raise him under her name,

545
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,960
what is inappropriate about that?

546
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,920
Look at that.

547
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,840
I'm deeply impressed

548
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,710
by how strong

549
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,200
their mother-daughter bond is.

550
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,990
I merely made a few complaints,

551
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,030
and she instantly rushed to her defense.

552
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,070
But if someone with ill intentions

553
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,160
wanted to take her away

554
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,920
from you,

555
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,840
how would you react, Your Majesty?

556
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,550
Princess Fuqing was born
and raised by Her Majesty.

557
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,030
Of course, their bond is strong.

558
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,790
Unlike you, who gave birth
but never raised your child.

559
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:31,230
Yet now, you speak of blood ties.

560
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
You are just afraid
that if I become an official son,

561
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,920
it will affect Prince Qi's status.

562
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,550
Nonsense!

563
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,160
Both of you are equally
my flesh and blood.

564
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,600
Though I did not raise you,

565
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,120
I have worried about you

566
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,790
just as much as I have for Prince Qi.

567
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,750
You ungrateful child!

568
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,960
Mind your words,
Imperial Concubine Xian.

569
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,510
Prince Yan is intelligent
and benevolent.

570
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,270
Since returning to Ling'an,

571
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,840
he has accomplished
many tasks successfully.

572
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,070
Even His Majesty holds him
in high regard.

573
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,600
Since you think so little of him

574
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,840
and have Prince Qi
to cherish at your side,

575
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:02,880
I have no reason

576
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,510
to hesitate.

577
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,470
Yu Jin.

578
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,440
In front of Imperial Concubine Xian,

579
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,710
I ask you,

580
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,030
are you willing to be recorded
under my name

581
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,750
and become my son?

582
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,070
I am willing to.

583
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,790
What did you say?

584
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:23,550
Mother.

585
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,070
What Princess Fuqing said makes sense.

586
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,790
You are the official mother
of all the princes.

587
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,840
Even if Prince Yan is not officially

588
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,200
registered under your name,

589
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,640
you are still our official mother.

590
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,600
Regardless,

591
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,990
we will do our best

592
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,070
to serve you.

593
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,600
There is no need to trouble you

594
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,880
with the formal adoption ceremony.

595
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,230
At least she knows what's what.

596
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,640
Are you upset that I stopped you?

597
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,030
I do want

598
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,200
to have Her Majesty as my mother.

599
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,360
But you must have your reason

600
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,400
for stopping me.

601
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,600
Tell me about it.

602
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,120
I was thinking

603
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,640
about Her Majesty and Princess Fuqing.

604
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,470
We treat each other with sincerity.

605
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,600
Even without the official title
of mother and son,

606
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,840
we would still do everything

607
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,710
to protect each other.

608
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,070
But once you formally
take on this title,

609
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,360
it would be a public declaration

610
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,310
that you belong to Empress Di's faction

611
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,880
and that you are ambitious.

612
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,030
We would become

613
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:29,960
everyone's target.

614
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,790
You're right.

615
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,680
I was only thinking
about angering Imperial Concubine Xian.

616
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,120
I didn't consider
the broader consequences.

617
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,120
I understand.

618
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,920
She is your birth mother.

619
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,070
Anyone would struggle
to let go of what she did.

620
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,360
Here's what we'll do.

621
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,920
Try to see her as little as possible.

622
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,640
If you must meet her,

623
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:50,750
I will go in your place.

624
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,600
You shouldn't go either.

625
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,920
Did you forget
how she treated you the last time

626
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,960
we went to pay respects?

627
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,230
Then let's both stop seeing her,

628
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,120
all right?

629
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,470
But Mother…

630
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,790
Mother is a wise woman.

631
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,230
I trust that she will understand
our intentions.

632
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,640
The real issue now

633
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,710
is how we get through
our current situation.

634
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,510
With Cui Mingyue dead,

635
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,310
Princess Royal will undoubtedly
seek revenge against us.

636
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,840
The Annals of Fortune and Misfortune
contains Father's name.

637
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,310
We cannot present it to him.

638
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,920
Mother would not want the truth

639
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,470
to be exposed to the public.

640
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,640
Doing so

641
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,840
would only provoke
Princess Royal's wrath.

642
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,270
This is what we'll do.

643
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,440
We should strike first.

644
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,440
We will report to Father
about Princess Royal's collusion

645
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,070
with Nanwu

646
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,200
and how she plotted against you

647
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,470
and your mother.

648
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,310
All right.

649
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,880
Let's summon Xiao Shi back

650
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,960
as a witness.

651
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,510
Greetings, Mother.

652
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,680
Why are you here?

653
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,030
Mother.

654
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,310
You summoned me, remember?

655
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,960
You said that Princess Consort Yan
is visiting the palace today

656
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,310
and wanted me to select
a few capable maids

657
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,710
for her to take back.

658
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,990
I've already brought them.

659
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,270
They are waiting outside.

660
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,160
They won't be needed.

661
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,120
They've already left.

662
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,710
Why not send them
to Prince Yan's Mansion

663
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,200
under your name?

664
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,710
Princess Consort Yan is young.

665
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,600
She will need help
managing their household.

666
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,470
This can also be a token
of your goodwill.

667
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,310
I said there's no need.

668
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,270
Take your people and leave.

669
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,470
Yes, Mother.

670
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,070
Wait.

671
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,200
I have a question for you.

672
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,640
If Empress Di

673
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,160
wanted to adopt Zhang
as her official son

674
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,360
and register him under her name

675
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,270
so he could rightfully compete

676
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,440
with the Crown Prince,

677
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,400
what would you do?

678
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,600
I bet you would surely be delighted.

679
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,680
You'd prefer a more noble

680
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,600
and nicer mother-in-law, wouldn't you?

681
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,510
But what if Zhang was unwilling?

682
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,550
Would you whisper sweet nothings
in his ear until he agreed?

683
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,360
Mother, why do you ask such a thing?

684
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,030
Did Her Majesty say something again?

685
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,470
I… I could never be

686
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,840
so heartless.

687
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,110
There you go, shedding tears again.

688
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,510
Zhang isn't here.

689
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,110
Drop your pretense.

690
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:12,840
Mother,

691
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,110
it's really not what you think.

692
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,590
I didn't.

693
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,360
Enough.

694
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:18,719
Leave now.

695
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,360
Mother.

696
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,239
I said leave!

697
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,400
If it had been her
in Jiang Si's place today,

698
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,590
my son would have surely

699
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,150
been taken away.

700
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,800
What could Princess Consort Yan

701
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,469
be up to?

702
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,190
Such a great opportunity, but...

703
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,960
You also think
this was a good opportunity?

704
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,400
I misspoke.

705
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,760
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

706
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,070
No matter what,

707
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,990
Jiang Si rejected Empress Di.

708
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,550
That means she's acknowledged me
as her mother-in-law.

709
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,070
If Princess Royal insists

710
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,590
on blaming Jiang Si

711
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,240
for her daughter's death,

712
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,280
I will

713
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
protect her.

714
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,810
[Princess Royal's Mansion]

715
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,190
Your Majesty.

716
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,070
Her Highness is suffering
from extreme distress

717
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,150
and grief.

718
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,400
She will need time to recover.

719
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,110
I take my leave.

720
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,240
Rong Yang.

721
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,070
Brother.

722
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,840
I have nothing left.

723
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,110
What has happened has happened.

724
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,880
You must take care of yourself.

725
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,240
Mingyue was a good child.

726
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,550
I will grant her a higher royal title

727
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,280
and have her buried
in the imperial mausoleum.

728
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,720
Thank you for Your Majesty's grace.

729
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,550
Rong Yang.

730
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,590
The dead cannot return.

731
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,990
Do not grieve too much.

732
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,240
Get some rest.

733
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,880
I will visit you another day.

734
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,440
I understand.

735
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,240
Did you hear that?

736
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,150
A higher royal title

737
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,590
and a burial in the imperial mausoleum.

738
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,280
When Mingyue was alive,

739
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,440
they denied her

740
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,400
everything she wanted.

741
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,470
Now that she is dead,

742
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,960
His Majesty wants
to grant her a higher royal title.

743
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,190
Your Highness.

744
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,470
Your Highness.

745
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,070
Your Highness.

746
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,800
Your Highness.

747
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,670
None of this pain compares

748
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,630
to what I feel inside.

749
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,320
If His Majesty genuinely cared
about Mingyue,

750
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,280
he wouldn't have forced her

751
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,630
to marry Zhu Ziyu.

752
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,760
I fought for him

753
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,920
with my life back then.

754
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,150
But he never valued

755
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,150
my loyalty.

756
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,550
Your Highness, you did not see Father?

757
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,440
I had planned
to have a conversation with him.

758
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,630
But due to

759
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,760
Princess Mingyue's death,

760
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,720
Father went to Princess Royal's Mansion.

761
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,190
We missed each other.

762
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,920
This is a major incident,

763
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,550
and Father must be in a bad mood.

764
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,070
It might be better to wait
for another day to seek an audience.

765
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,240
Your Highness is diligent and capable.

766
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,920
Father will surely see

767
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,990
that you are far superior
to the Crown Prince.

768
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,880
No matter how incompetent
the Crown Prince is,

769
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,190
he is still
the late Empress's official son.

770
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,190
In Father's heart,

771
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,280
he will always carry more weight.

772
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,030
Speaking of this,

773
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,110
there is something else.

774
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,550
Today,

775
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,280
after Mother returned
from Empress Di's palace,

776
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,070
she lectured me the moment she saw me.

777
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,070
I later found out that today,

778
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,150
Prince Yan and his consort

779
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,470
went to pay respects to Empress Di.

780
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,360
Empress Di wanted to adopt Yu Jin

781
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,720
as her official son.

782
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,670
Even Jin,
who returned from the frontier,

783
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,760
is about to surpass me.

784
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,640
If he has ambitions for the throne,

785
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,720
I now have yet another competitor.

786
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,880
Fortunately,
Princess Consort Yan had concerns

787
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,280
and stopped Prince Yan

788
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,590
from agreeing.

789
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,720
They refused this time.

790
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,590
But what about the next?

791
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,590
Perhaps Jin deliberately

792
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,990
let this news spread

793
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,590
to test Father's reaction.

794
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,070
If Father does not oppose it,

795
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,070
Jin could rise in status overnight

796
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,280
and become

797
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,320
Empress Di's only official son.

798
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,470
What should we do, then?

799
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:05,710
[Princess Royal's Mansion]

800
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,070
Don't touch her.

801
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,920
Mingyue is gone.

802
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,280
There's no need for you

803
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
to put on an act in front of me.

804
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,670
We've argued for half our lives.

805
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,110
If not for our daughter,

806
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,240
you and I would have had

807
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,360
nothing left to say to each other.

808
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,590
Don't worry.

809
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,590
We will never

810
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,440
argue again.

811
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,550
Mingyue.

812
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,960
I will avenge you.

813
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,670
One by one, I will send them all

814
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,360
to accompany you in death.

815
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,840
What are you planning?

816
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,550
It's none of your concern.

817
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,550
You never cared for Mingyue
while she lived.

818
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,920
Don't bother now she's gone.
