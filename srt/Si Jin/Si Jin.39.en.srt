00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,550
I came back

190
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,910
because there's a crucial matter

191
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,510
I have to discuss with you.

192
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,270
Once the decree is carried out,

193
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,840
blood will be shed
at the Southern Frontier.

194
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,440
Even so, are you still not willing

195
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,510
to rescue His Majesty?

196
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,910
Disobeying the imperial decree
is a capital offense.

197
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,670
In a crisis, a field commander
may disregard the ruler's orders!

198
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,320
Yu Jin.

199
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,000
Has Rong Yang truly started a rebellion?

200
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,240
I know Nanwu has stationed

201
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,510
their troops at the border area

202
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,630
because I was imprisoned.

203
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,790
Well,

204
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,320
since I've returned,

205
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,150
there's no reason to launch an attack.

206
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,870
Grand Elder, please issue an order

207
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,150
and withdraw your troops.

208
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,510
You're speaking up for Zhou

209
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,840
upon your return.

210
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,200
If I withdraw my troops now

211
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,240
and Zhou invades us,

212
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,510
Nanwu

213
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,870
will be done for.

214
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,790
Grand Elder,

215
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,750
I'm not trying to speak up
for either side.

216
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,150
I swear upon my reputation
as the Saintess.

217
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,790
If Nanwu withdraws their troops,

218
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,150
the army of Zhou

219
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,480
will withdraw their troops
within half a day as well.

220
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,440
Report!

221
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,240
Reporting in!

222
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,120
Mr. Cui,

223
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,840
for some reason,
Nanwu has withdrawn their troops.

224
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,750
For real?

225
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,240
Yes, Mr. Cui.

226
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:12,960
Long Dan.

227
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,720
Send a letter to Mr. Zhen.

228
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,510
Tell him that we'll depart immediately!

229
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes, sir!

230
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:19,910
Relay my order!

231
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,720
We shall depart immediately
to rescue His Majesty in Ling'an!

232
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,200
Yes, sir!

233
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,550
Yes, Your Highness!

234
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,910
We received a report
from the front lines.

235
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:34,960
Zhou

236
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,550
has withdrawn their troops.

237
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,320
Excellent.

238
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,150
The Saintess can predict the future.

239
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,480
She'll surely lead Nanwu

240
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,670
to the right path.

241
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,960
You'll lead us

242
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,270
to annihilate Zhou.

243
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,670
Now, Zhou's borders are unguarded.

244
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,630
It's a good opportunity
to launch an attack.

245
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,240
Saintess, I'm sure

246
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,630
you'll remain in Nanwu forever

247
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,240
and lead us to annihilate Zhou.

248
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,750
Grand Elder,

249
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,080
but war

250
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,510
will not restore Nanwu
to its former glory.

251
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,750
I once saw the ending

252
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,120
brought about by the war.

253
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,440
In that ending,

254
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,000
Nanwu used war and violence

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,790
to resolve their issues.

256
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,870
And, our people successfully
assassinated the Emperor of Zhou

257
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,670
during the Mid-Autumn Hunt.

258
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,120
Are you talking about

259
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,320
the events that happened
after the Mid-Autumn Hunt?

260
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,550
That's right.

261
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,320
You always thought

262
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,870
that our issues would be resolved

263
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,910
after the death of Emperor Jingming.

264
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,000
But Zhou appointed a new emperor.

265
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,080
He was incompetent.

266
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,200
The Princess Royal held absolute power.

267
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,670
She ordered

268
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,390
Nanwu's annihilation.

269
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,080
You had to send the Nightingale Sect

270
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,670
to assassinate her in Ling'an.

271
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,480
Our gain is Zhou's loss and vice versa.

272
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,790
Nanwu

273
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,720
has limited resources after all.

274
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,720
We compete with each other

275
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,480
to develop ourselves

276
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,550
and keep our enemy under control.

277
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,390
Grand Elder,

278
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,440
I have a way

279
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,320
to stop this meaningless cycle.

280
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,120
Please gather all our people tomorrow.

281
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,240
I shall announce

282
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,000
the true way

283
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,080
to restore Nanwu to its former glory.

284
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Mr. Zhen, is that you?

285
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,790
It's me.

286
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,360
Lately, the palace has been preparing

287
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,080
grand ceremonies
to worship Heaven and Earth,

288
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,030
and to offer prayers
at the ancestral temple.

289
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,870
But I don't think

290
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,390
it's as simple as it seems.

291
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,670
Worship Heaven and Earth?

292
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,960
Offer prayers at the ancestral temple?

293
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,270
This is bad!

294
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,080
Those are compulsory ceremonies

295
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,480
for the ascension ceremony.

296
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,000
Seems like the Princess Royal

297
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,150
does intend to usurp the throne.

298
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,750
If that's the case,

299
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,790
those who go against her

300
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,360
shall be eliminated.

301
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,870
What should we do, then?

302
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,240
Have Jin and the rest returned?

303
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,510
I'm afraid they can't make it in time.

304
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:47,870
Your Highness,

305
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,270
I've already taken care of

306
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,720
the stubborn officials
who weren't willing

307
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,200
to join your side.

308
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,720
But there's one official left.

309
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:55,960
Who?

310
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,080
He was the official

311
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,440
who rallied others to oppose your rule.

312
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,360
Zhen Heng.

313
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,550
I didn't expect

314
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,150
a stubborn fool like him

315
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,000
would still be around.

316
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,490
[Eternal Joy and Serenity]

317
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,960
Now, the palace is full of danger.

318
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,510
I've already found a way

319
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,390
to send you out of the palace.

320
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,080
I've already packed your belongings.

321
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,080
You'll leave by tonight.

322
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,360
Mother, I'm not leaving!

323
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,960
Fuqing,

324
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,910
this isn't the time for you
to be willful.

325
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,030
You always said

326
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,320
you wanted to leave the palace, right?

327
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,600
This is the chance.

328
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,360
Why are you...?

329
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,030
Mother, I'm not being willful here.

330
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,720
I've already grown up.

331
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,030
I'm no longer the little girl

332
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,320
who could only hide and cry

333
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,150
in the cabinet.

334
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,360
I have to remain in the palace.

335
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,440
Only then will I be able

336
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,550
to relay information to Mr. Zhen

337
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,150
and protect you.

338
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,080
Mother, no matter what,

339
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,750
I will never escape by myself.

340
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,150
- Stop right there!
- Stop.

341
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,080
There are so many of you.

342
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,870
What are you up to?

343
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:02,840
Sir,

344
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,630
we are a trading caravan from the North.

345
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,360
Please let us pass.

346
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,600
From the North, huh?

347
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,390
Judging from your accent,

348
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,480
I think you're from the South.

349
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,360
Sir, I dare not joke about it.

350
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,480
Here.

351
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,030
Judging from these blisters,

352
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,360
I suppose you were in the military.

353
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,720
As for those behind you,

354
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,720
they don't look like
cargo haulers at all.

355
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,750
Someone! Inspect them!

356
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,910
[Ling'an]

357
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:43,750
Stop!

358
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,360
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

359
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,360
What's going on?

360
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:58,640
Your Highness,

361
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,550
this trading caravan

362
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,590
seems suspicious.

363
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,680
We've already arrested them.

364
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,240
We'll hand them to Her Highness.

365
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,310
Just leave it to me.

366
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:05,920
Take them away!

367
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,680
Move!

368
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,240
Wait!

369
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,920
Your Highness, I...

370
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,920
Wasn't I the one who arrested them?

371
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,750
Yes, Your Highness.

372
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,240
Yes, Your Highness.

373
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:26,750
Let them pass.

374
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,920
We humbly invite the Saintess

375
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,880
to consult the heavens and to guide
all beings in glimpsing the future.

376
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,750
Heaven shelters, Earth sustains,
and all creation is in place,

377
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,240
yet none is more precious than humanity.

378
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,000
With the war's end, Nanwu rises,
and harmony returns to the world.

379
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,680
Saintess,

380
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,790
throughout the history of Nanwu,

381
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,000
there's only war, no reconciliation.

382
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:58,640
That's right.

383
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,240
We

384
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,270
are born to fight.

385
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,590
Although our land is small

386
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,270
and our population scarce
compared to Zhou,

387
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,830
all of our warriors excel at battle.

388
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,110
We fight and steal

389
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,750
the things we need.

390
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,920
It's that simple.

391
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,030
Mr. Bai,

392
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,070
no one is born to fight.

393
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,110
All humans

394
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,400
are born to live better.

395
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,400
Who would be willing
to fight on the battlefield

396
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,510
if everyone

397
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,830
was content with their lives?

398
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:20,880
I know.

399
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,640
Nanwu prioritized war

400
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,270
for the past century.

401
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,440
This habit

402
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,790
cannot be changed in no time.

403
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,960
However, since Nanwu has chosen me

404
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,400
to be the Saintess

405
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,070
and granted me the ability
to see the future,

406
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,960
I'm willing to turn
the best future I've seen

407
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,240
into reality

408
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,310
together

409
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,680
with you all.

410
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,750
What should we do, then?

411
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,110
Grand Elder,

412
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,880
let's set a time limit of one year.

413
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,160
During this period of time,

414
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,240
I'll remain in Nanwu.

415
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,030
I'll make Nanwu prosper
like never seen before

416
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,960
without

417
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,200
needing to wage a war.

418
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
What if you fail?

419
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,160
If after one year has passed,

420
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,920
you still think

421
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,680
that war is the best solution,

422
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,310
then I shall lead by example.

423
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,680
Saintess, we shall obey your will.

424
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,440
- Saintess, we shall obey your will.
- Saintess, we shall obey your will.

425
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,680
What a shame, Mr. Zhen.

426
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,350
Your righteousness

427
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,750
won't be your saving grace.

428
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,400
It'll only harm you.

429
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,550
You and the other ministers

430
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,880
have done your best to impeach me.

431
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,960
But in the end,
your efforts are all in vain.

432
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,920
I'm daring enough
to take the Crown Prince's life,

433
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,750
let alone the lives
of officials like you all.

434
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,350
To me,

435
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,270
you're nothing

436
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,440
but insignificant pests.

437
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,030
Death is but a swift blow.

438
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,070
I've seen plenty of people like you

439
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,110
in the Capital Administration Office.

440
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,310
You've let His Majesty's trust down.

441
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,110
You're not fit

442
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,000
to be Zhou's Princess Royal.

443
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,400
Zhen Heng,

444
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,270
you're too bold for your own good.

445
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,240
No wonder I couldn't find
the Count of Dongping

446
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,640
and his family.

447
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,440
So, you were hiding them.

448
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,160
Excellent.

449
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,920
I've changed my mind.

450
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,830
I only wanted

451
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,480
to get rid of
the Count of Dongping and his family.

452
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,480
Now, it seems like

453
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,160
I must get rid of your family as well.

454
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,960
Rong Yang, how dare you!

455
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,960
Evil deeds never go unpunished!

456
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,640
Zhen Heng's insolent words

457
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,640
have offended the ruler.

458
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,000

the Count of Dongping and his family
were discovered.

came to me

516
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,920
after receiving
the letter related to your return.

517
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,240
How dare you speculate on my intentions?

518
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,640
Your Highness,

519
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
I know

520
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,110
that you're not a heartless individual.

521
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,960
You're doing all of this

522
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,680
to win

523
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,920
His Majesty's trust

524
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,510
and exhibit your talent

525
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,000
for the fortune of Zhou.

526
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,510
I understand

527
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,000
why you did so.

528
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,720
In my opinion,

529
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,510
this moment

530
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,030
is a good opportunity

531
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,070
to realize your aspirations.

532
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,590
Don't repeat the same mistake
with the princess.

533
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,590
Instead, you need
to reassure her on our behalf.

534
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,960
I know

535
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,440
that she would never let me off.

536
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,240
Therefore,

537
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,880
Your Highness,

538
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,880
please ensure your safety.

539
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,720
In the future,

540
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,110
should I be powerless,

541
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,240
Your Highness,

542
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,640
please lend the Seventh Prince a hand.

543
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,510
Why are you so sure

544
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,270
that I won't tell her

545
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,680
about our encounter?

546
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,310
That day, both you and I

547
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,160
were in the hall together.

548
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,240
Since I was daring enough to come here,

549
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,510
I believe

550
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,030
that you have already made up your mind.

551
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,350
Thank you, Zhang.

552
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,000
Our time is limited.

553
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,440
Tomorrow's the ascension ceremony.

554
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:06,790
We have

555
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,640
to stop the Princess Royal

556
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,640
and rescue Father before that.

557
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,880
I've already looked into it.

558
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,590
The palace
is filled with the Gale Guards.

559
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,270
The Marquis of Changxing's troops
are outside the palace.

560
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,750
Therefore, right now,

561
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,240
our priority

562
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,440
is to find a way

563
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,480
to win against overwhelming odds.

564
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,480
What if we turn our men

565
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,200
into the Gale Guards?

566
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,240
Are you saying

567
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,350
that we should assemble
a group of Red Plume Cavalry members

568
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,510
matching the Gale Guards in number

569
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,200
and replace them?

570
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:28,640
That's right.

571
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,440
Great idea.

572
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,070
The number of palace guards is fixed.

573
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,510
If both teams focus on our attack,

574
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,160
we'll make it.

575
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,440
Once we obtain the higher ground,

576
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,440
the ground route will be open.

577
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,960
That's far from enough.

578
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,790
We need someone
to keep the Marquis in check

579
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,000
and prevent retaliation.

580
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,880
I'm willing to serve.

581
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
You all shall enter
from the secret tunnel.

582
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,440
We shall divide our forces
into three groups.

583
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,310
The tunnel is very complex.

584
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,920
So do act cautiously.

585
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,160
Commandant Xie, Leng Ying,

586
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,070
you two will be in charge

587
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,640
of the outer palace gate
and its watchtower.

588
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,070
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

589
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,550
Jiang and Long Dan,

590
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,440
you two will be in charge

591
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,720
of the inner gate and its watchtower.

592
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,310
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

593
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,590
For the last step,

594
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,640
you all must cooperate

595
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,510
and replace all of the Gale Guards.

596
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,550
Drag their bodies away!

597
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,350
Get rid of the bodies!

598
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,400
Go!

599
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:12,590
Move!

600
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,200
Brother, here you are.

601
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,310
I merely requested a decree from you.

602
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,030
Why is it so difficult
for you to comply?

603
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,960
You see, even if you don't issue it,

604
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,400
I can still sit on your throne.

605
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:53,960
Someone.

606
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,070
Grant him a seat.

607
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,160
What's wrong?
You don't want to sit down?

608
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,350
Bring them here.

609
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,110
Father!

610
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,270
Your Majesty!

611
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,000
Your Majesty!

612
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,030
- Father!
- Your Majesty!

613
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,830
Rong Yang, what are you up to?

614
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,400
Look. Everyone is here.

615
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,350
I have no choice
but to bring your family here

616
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,350
to convince you.

617
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,270
I'm sure

618
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,960
you're not willing to let them die

619
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,270
in front of you

620
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,590
just because you refuse
to issue this decree.

621
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:37,960
Rong Yang.

622
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,750
I never expected you

623
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,920
to be this despicable.

624
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,680
It's not too late for you to know that.

625
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,440
Someone!

626
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,750
Burn the incense.

627
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,640
One at a time.

628
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,790
When the incense ends,

629
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,270
so does a life.

630
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:02,200
If you haven't decided then,

631
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,920
I'll help you with it.

632
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,480
Time to change shifts.

633
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,270
Zhang.

634
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,200
Take me to the inner hall

635
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,510
to meet Aunt.

636
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,240
Do we have a reason

637
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
that can ensure that the princess

638
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,680
will summon me?

639
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,880
This is the imperial jade seal.

640
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,510
His Majesty ordered me to hand it to you

641
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,440
when he was in danger.

642
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,750
Your Highness, please keep it safe.

643
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,240
Brother,

644
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,200
time's up.

645
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,680
Have you not made up your mind?

646
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,790
If so,

647
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,680
I shall do it for you.

648
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,200
Father!

649
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,720
Your Highness!

650
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,640
Your Highness!

651
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,000
Your Highness!

652
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,880
Brother.

653
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,200
The next incense is lit.

654
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,160
Let them pass!

655
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,590
Brother, aren't you going
to make up your mind?

656
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,920
In this lifetime,

657
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,510
I'm the only one

658
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,670
who dared risk my life to save you.

659
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,070
Are you expecting Yu Jin
to come to your rescue?

660
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,760
Yu Jin is caught in a dilemma himself.

661
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,230
Even if he comes,

662
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,070
he'll be dead for sure.

663
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,960
Moreover,

664
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,480
he hates you

665
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,710
more than me.

666
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:44,800
What's wrong?

667
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,550
My Lord,

668
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,480
someone has replaced

669
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,440
our men in the watchtower.

670
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,960
The enemies have invaded the palace.

671
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,550
What?

672
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,920
You good-for-nothings!

673
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,630
The four of you, remain here.

674
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,480
The rest of you, obey my command.

675
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,480
We shall rescue Her Highness!

676
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,110
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

677
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,030
You all shall escort me

678
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,110
out of the palace.

679
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:08,800
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

680
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,000
So it's you, huh?

681
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,760
Marquis of Changxing,

682
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,670
I'm sure the Princess Royal

683
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,630
will be disappointed

684
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,000
if she finds out
that you're abandoning her

685
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,480
just because the situation is dire.

686
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,590
You little crook.

687
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,590
You dare to touch me?

688
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,030
Do you wish to die?

689
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
You're the one with a death wish here.

690
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,150
Deceiving the ruler
is a capital offense.

691
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,000
Guards.

692
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,360
Take him down!

693
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,590
Hand over the tiger tally,

694
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,550
or meet your demise!

695
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,590
Relay my message to Her Highness.

696
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,550
Tell her that I seek an audience.

697
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,280
Brother, you're used

698
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,670
to being the Emperor indeed.

699
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,920
You remain unfazed
even though the situation is dire.

700
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,150
Regarding that,

701
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,440
I should learn from you.

702
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,590
Shijiu.

703
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,030
Come at me!

704
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,550
You come from the same root!

705
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,150
Why are you so eager to slay your kin?

706
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,960
Give me a chance
to demonstrate my loyalty!

707
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,070
Your Majesty!

708
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,670
I shall serve you again in my next life!

709
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,230
Who do you think you are? You lackey.

710
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,550
You think you're worthy?

711
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,280
Prince Qi has arrived!

712
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,190
Shijiu.

713
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,150
I'm exhausted.

714
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,760
Tell him

715
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,150
that we can talk tomorrow.

716
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:17,590
Aunt,

717
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,280
I've found the imperial jade seal.

718
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,670
Invite him in.

719
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,190
Greetings, Your Highness.

720
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,630
Everyone is here tonight.

721
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,400
Present the seal to me.

722
00:37:59,550 --> 00:37:59,960
Yes, Your Highness.

723
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,360
Your Majesty!

724
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,440
Yu Jin,

725
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,630
do you think

726
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,920
you can turn the tides now?

727
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,190
What a joke!

728
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,030
Everyone inside and outside the palace

729
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,440
is under my command.

730
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,190
None of you shall
leave this place alive.

731
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,150
Guards!

732
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:23,760
Look.

733
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,070
All of them are my men!

734
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,280
Yu Jin, you're done for!

735
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,110
Is that so?

736
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,440
Aunt,

737
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,920
open your eyes and see.

738
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,630
I was late to your rescue.
I deserve punishment!

739
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,440
Minister Cui, please rise.

740
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:06,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

741
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,360
Let her go.

742
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,590
Father, you mustn't.

743
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:12,960
Let her go.

744
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,150
Rong Yang.

745
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,590
On account of our bond,

746
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,150
I shall give you one last chance.

747
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,230
If you confess your crime and repent,

748
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,360
it's not too late.

749
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,400
I can spare you from death.

750
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,320
Brother, you're right.

751
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,070
It's not too late.

752
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,590
It's not the end yet.

753
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,360
The Marquis of Changxing

754
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,480
will come to my rescue!

755
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,880
Your Majesty,

756
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,670
the Marquis of Changxing
and his men have been arrested.

757
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:57,710
The tiger tally is here!

758
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,590
I've put every scheme and trick to use.

759
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,320
In the end, I still lost to you.

760
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,550
I do not

761
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,150
beg for mercy.

762
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,960
Alas, in this world,

763
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,070
no one has ever truly understood me.

764
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,800
Not even loved me.

765
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,150
But I have not lost.

766
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,630
None of you

767
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,960
will ever forget me!

768
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,000
Father!
