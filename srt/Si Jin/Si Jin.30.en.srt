[In Memory of Su Ke,
the Countess of Dongping]

14
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,880
Today,

15
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,080
I want all three of you

16
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,310
to take a vow

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,520
in front of your mother's tablet,

18
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,960
that you will abandon
any thoughts of vengeance

19
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,310
and never, under any circumstances,
provoke the Princess Royal.

20
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,470
Is that clear?

21
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,470
I refuse.

22
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,110
Si has found out

23
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,160
that the Princess Royal
ordered Madam Xiao

24
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,190
to kill Mother.

25
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,110
I'd fail as a son

26
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,080
unless I avenge her.

27
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,760
Insolence!

29

Who do you think you are?

30
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,760
How are you supposed to avenge her?

31
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,110
Father.

32
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,430
I know you want us to be safe.

33
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,110
The Princess Royal's power is unrivaled.

34
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,110
You are worried

35
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,390
we could lose our lives fighting her.

36
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,480
Am I right?

37
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,800
Yi.

38
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,480
As the eldest sister,

39
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,870
and now a mother yourself,

40
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,670
you understand my worries

41
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,870
as no one else could.

42
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,640
Today,

43
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,110
if Yan was the one

44
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,200
in grave peril,

45
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,920
wouldn't you risk everything

46
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,430
to keep her safe?

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,520
I only ask

48
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,110
that the three of you

49
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,550
can live out
the rest of your life in peace.

50
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,240
I failed

51
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,990
to protect your mother.

52
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,150
And now,

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,360
I must do everything I can

54
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,110
to stop you
from throwing your lives away.

55
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,640
You'll be the first to take the vow.

56
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,590
Very well.

57
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,829
I promise.

58
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,200
Yi!

59
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,079
Since you were a child,

60
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,640
you were the most obedient.

61
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,990
You never made me worried.

62
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,990

63
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,150
As for you...

64
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,920
If you are stubborn enough

65
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,960
to risk your life for revenge,

66
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,990
I shall banish you from this house!

67
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,270
Your name will be deleted

68
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,079

69
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,320

70

I

71
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,480
might as well pretend
you were never my son.

72
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,590
Father!

73
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,150
If you still see me as your father,

74
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,520
then take the vow now!

75
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,710
Very well.

76
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,390
I won't take revenge.

77
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,640
I won't cause any trouble.

78
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
Are you happy now?

79
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,520
Is this what you wanted?

81
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,320
Your brother and sister took the vow.

82
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,080
What about you?

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,590
Father.

84
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,960
Do you really think silence

85
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,150
can earn you peace?

86
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,760
My mother endured it all

87
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,560
to have peace,

88
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,640
but the Princess Royal
spared no mercy for her!

89
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,560
Now that we know

90
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,960
who the culprit is,

91
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,230
why can't we take revenge?

92
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,350
Why should we let her

93
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,470
get away with the crime?

94
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,150
I will never

95
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,030
take that vow.

96
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,680
Delete my name

97
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,830
from the family genealogy

98
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,790
or banish me from this family
all you like.

99
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,520
My mother's murder is unforgivable!

100
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,760
The Princess Royal shall pay

101
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,640
with her life!

102
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,960
Stop it!

103
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,230
Si!

104
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,390
Father!

105
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,350
You are still young.

106
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
The idea

107
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,590
of her overwhelming dominance
eludes you.

108
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,960
His Majesty favors her
more than any living soul.

109
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,320
Her power is second
only to the Emperor's.

110
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,960
How are we supposed
to stand against her?

111
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,390
Even the smallest effort
can challenge the mightiest force.

112
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,640
We never tried.

113
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,030
How can you be certain we'll fail?

114
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,960
What will you do?

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,470
What can you possibly do?

116
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,230
Tell His Majesty?

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,590
Before you even strike

118
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,680
the petition drum,

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,030
the Princess Royal can level

120
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,120
a thousand charges against you

121
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,470
with just a flick of her finger.

122
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,150
Or are you

123
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,440
going to poison her

124
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,760
or assassinate her?

125
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,640
You are

126
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,230
a helpless girl
who can barely hold a weapon.

127
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,830
What do you expect to do?

128
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,560
Oh, Si!

129
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,880
What must I tell you

130
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,000
to talk you out of it?

131
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,710
Father...

132
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,200
Father...

133
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,230
I have already

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,470
lost your mother.

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,909
I can't lose you too.

136
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:43,880
I can't!

137
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,200
Father.

138
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,120
Come on, Jin.

139
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,440
Let's have a match.

140
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,390
Sure.

141
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:27,760
Jin.

142
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,000
Supervisor Yang
from the Directorate of Astronomy

143
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,270
sent a letter yesterday.

144
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,390
He insists

145
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,320
that if you marry a woman

146
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,520
with a fate of desolation,

147
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,470
it will bring harm

148
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,760
to the family and the realm.

149
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,470
There will be chaos.

150
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,560
Do you believe him?

151
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,320
The officials do.

152
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,030
An idea can rise or bring down anyone.

153
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,440
I may be the ruler,

154
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,960
but I have

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,910
no power over what people say.

156
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,880
Jin.

157
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,120
If there is a calamity,

158
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,200
I don't want you

159
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,640
to be the scapegoat.

160
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,710
The woman with a fate of desolation

161
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,200
that Supervisor Yang mentioned

162
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,030
was Jiang Si.

163
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,560
Correct.

164
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,390
But you gave me the permission
to marry her.

165
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,320
A promise is a promise.

166
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,150
He also predicted

167
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,760
that Cui Mingyue's birth date

168
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,830
complements Jiang Si's.

169
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,080
If you marry both of them,

170
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,830
the ill fate can be neutralized.

171
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,110
I inquired about the Princess Royal.

172
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,559
She prioritizes the big picture.

173
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,159
She is willing to let Mingyue
share a husband with Jiang Si.

174
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,679
But I am not willing.

175
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,590
Mingyue is a Princess.

176
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,960
Her background

177
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,200
matches yours better than Jiang Si's.

178
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,230
Father, I've made up my mind.

179
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,920
Why would I want the trouble?

180
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,960
Jiang Si is my first

181
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,510
and only love.

182
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,630
Jin, think it through

183
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,320
before deciding.

184
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,560
That won't be necessary.

185
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,830
I've given you the answer.

186
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,990
If there's nothing else,

187
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,510
I'll take my leave.

188
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,320
If the other princes

189
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,320
had my permission

190
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,710
to marry two consorts at the same time,

191
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,750
they'd be thrilled.

192
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,160
He is as stubborn as a rock.

193
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,990
I admit my mistake.

194
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,560
I never ate or drank.

195
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,750
I've been kneeling for one whole day.

196
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,800
Your Highness,

197
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,110
please have mercy on me.

198
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,080
When you were little,

199
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,830
you had night terrors.

200
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,280
I had to hold you in my arms every night

201
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,870
to calm you down.

202
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,040
I never had a good night's sleep

203
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,800
until you were three.

204
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,990
From then on, I got a habit

205
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,560
of oversleeping.

206
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,990
I am advanced in my years.

207
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,710
They sounded the gongs and drums

208
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,080
to keep me from sleeping.

209
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,920
I couldn't take it anymore.

210
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,680
I slipped up.

211
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,590
How have I treated you over the years?

212
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,040
So many in this palace know

213
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,080
you abuse my gratitude
to gain influence.

214
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,590
Yet, I turned a blind eye to it.

215
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,960
But now, you betrayed me.

216
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,320
I'm sorry, Your Highness!

217
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,510
I only mentioned

218
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,350
that Su Ke

219
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,990
was a woman of questionable morals

220
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,160
who enticed men.

221
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,510
A death by poison

222
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,080
was what she deserved

223
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,400
in the end.

224
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,560
What about Nanwu?

225
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,590
I never

226
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,110
said a word about Nanwu.

227
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,080
Your Highness. I have a report.

228
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,280
Come in.

229
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,400
Your Highness.

230
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,230
Prince Yan turned down
His Majesty's proposal

231
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,280
to marry Princess Mingyue.

232
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,870
I admire those devoted to their love.

233
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,990
I shan't let them get what they want.

234
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,470
Since Jiang Si

235
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,110
refused to go down

236
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,680
like her mother Su Ke,

237
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,870
then I shall employ another method.

238
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,440
Yes, Your Highness.

239
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,400
Prince Yan left yesterday

240
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,680
to meet the two officials

241
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,870
of the Directorate of Astronomy.

242
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,800
But we dealt with those loose ends

243
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,960
beforehand.

244
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,800
Very wise indeed.

245
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,560
Did you mention something?

246
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,400
Otherwise,

247
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,110
why would he go out at night
to seek answers?

248
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,320
I was careless

249
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,800
and mentioned to his guard

250
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,400
about the incident 20 years ago.

251
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,510
I was careless!

252
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,510
You fool!

253
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,400
Your Highness, I deserve punishment!

254
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,630
My sin is unforgivable!

255
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,040
Your Highness.

256
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,080
There are no witnesses left.

257
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,110
When I told them,

258
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,680
I was very vague.

259
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,800
Prince Yan won't find any evidence.

260
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,280
They would never tell His Majesty

261
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,400
what you did.

262
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,280
Seriously?

263
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,110
My brother has many children.

264
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,800
A prince who never lived in the palace

265
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,990
has no power here.

266
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,750
He wouldn't dare snitch on me.

267
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,750
As for the witnesses...

268
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,590
You reminded me of something.

269
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,110
Bring it here.

270
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,200
What now?

271
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,510
Why wouldn't you drink

272
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,960
the tea I prepared?

273
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,750
Your Highness.

274
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,590
Your arm was once injured, and I worry

275
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,110
our servants might be too clumsy
to care for it properly.

276
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,870
If you find their care lacking,

277
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,750
and you think of this old servant,

278
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,320
then I'd feel my efforts
were worthwhile.

279
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,750
Nanny, what do you mean by that?

280
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,800
You were my wet nurse.

281
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,630
I am giving you a second chance.

282
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,870
Had you assumed

283
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,440
that I would take your life yesterday

284
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,960
and not come back,

285
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
then I really would've

286
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,560
wiped your very existence
off this earth.

287
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,470
This cup of tea is a reward
and a punishment.

288
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,510
If you make one more mistake,

289
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,040
no amount of mercy

290
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,590
can keep you alive.

291
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,510
I am eternally grateful
for Your Highness' mercy!

292
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,680
Nanny Xu

293
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,440
slipped up

294
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,230
when we were alone.

295
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,470
Her Highness targeted you

296
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,200
twenty years ago.

297
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,160
Really? XXX二十年前

298
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,870
The Directorate of Astronomy predicted

299
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,080
I'd have an ill fate

300
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,680
due to her involvement?

301
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,750
Chief,

302
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,870
we received a letter

303
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,110
from Mr. Xiao of Lingshui.

304
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,590
"Observatory Director
Jiang Ancheng knows."

305
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,640
[Jiang]

306
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,320
Father.

307
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,870
Do you really think silence

308
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,870
can earn you peace?

309
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,510
My mother endured it all

310
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,320
to have peace,

311
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,350
but the Princess Royal
spared no mercy for her!

312
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,630
Now that we know

313
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,990
who the culprit is,

314
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,280
why can't we take revenge?

315
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
Why should we let her

316
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,680
get away with the crime?

317
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:49,960
- Your Highness.
- Mr. Jiang.

318
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,750
You asked to meet at night.

319
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,830
What is this about?

320
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,590
Take a seat.

321
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,960
Are you aware

322
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,200
I am against your marriage

323
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,800
with Si?

324
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,710
I know.

325
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,200
I wanted her to have

326
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,710
a safe and peaceful life.

327
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,960
I'd rather her

328
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,960
have a normal life

329
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,960
than let her...

330
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,990
I know you want to keep Si out of

331
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,200
this power struggle.

332
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,750
I want the same thing.

333
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,280
There's more.

334
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,160
I've kept this secret with me
for so many years.

335
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,470
I've never mentioned it to anyone.

336
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
The matter

337
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,960
greatly concerns Your Highness.

338
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,710
Twenty years ago,

339
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,350
I once served
at the Directorate of Astronomy.

340
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,110
I know.

341
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,160
I met Mr. Chu

342
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,960
and Mr. Xiao.

343
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,200
I was wondering

344
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,350
how I should break it to you.

345
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,800
To my surprise,

346
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,750
you're willing to come forth.

347
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,960
In that case,

348
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,750
then I shall tell you everything.

349
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,960
You are not a man of ill fate.

350
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,599
It's the opposite.

351
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,030
That night,

352
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,710
I observed the heavenly sign.

353
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,200
It was auspicious.

354
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,599
On the fifth day of the fifth month,

355
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,790
in the third year of the Jingming era.

356
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,359
Mr. Jiang!

357
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,840
[Directorate of Astronomy]
Any anomaly in the sky.

358
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,960
Supervisor Yang ordered us
to take the shift for you.

359
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,070
Come down.

360
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,200
Gentlemen,

361
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,270
this is a full record of my observation.

362
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,840
It's an auspicious sign tonight.

363
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,160
It's not time yet.

364
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,990
You did your job well, Mr. Jiang.

365
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,340
Go home and get some rest.

366
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:44,810
Well.

367
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,360
Then, I shall take my leave now.

368
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,120
Mr. Xiao.

369
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,550
Why would the Princess Royal

370
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,470
frame

371
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,270
a newborn prince?

372
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,200
Do you know about

373
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,400
the Southern Frontier?

374
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,470
[An auspicious sign]
Nanwu attacked the border.

375
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,360
The border army had

376
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,510
the most devastating defeat ever.

377
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,510
But how does the newborn prince

378
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,510
fit into this?

379
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,640
Cui Xu is the general
of the border army.

380
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,640

Imperial Concubine Xian will soon

382
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,680
be promoted
to Imperial Noble Consort Xian.

383
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,550
The Princess Royal would never

384
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,750
allow that to happen.

385
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,230
The Seventh Prince's ill fate

386
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,990
can take down Imperial Concubine Xian

387
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,200
and salvage Cui Xu's reputation.

388
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,310
Two birds with one stone.

389
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
I never thought the Princess Royal

390
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,960
would take my fate so lightly
and change it

391
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,470
just to salvage Cui Xu's career

392
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,880
and take down

393
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,600
Imperial Concubine Xian.

394
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,710
I have failed you.

395
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,790
I was too scared

396
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,440
to make the Princess Royal my enemy.

397
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,030
I kept this a secret.

398
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,680
I was too much of a coward

399
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,200
to stand up for you.

400
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,160
But now, I am cornered.

401
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,440
They took my wife's life.

402
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,640
And now, they are after Si's life.

403
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,360
Mr. Jiang.

404
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,230
Si wouldn't want you to get caught up

405
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,270
in this conflict.

406
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,640
I will gather evidence

407
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,270
of the Princess Royal's crimes.

408
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,160
Your Highness,

409
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,710
the Annals of Fortune and Misfortune

410
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,360
can be concrete evidence.

411
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,990
I wanted to save my own skin.

412
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,200
However, I never wished

413
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,510
to bury the truth forever.

414
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,120
This must be why Father

415
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,470
is against my relationship

416
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,510
with Yu Qi.

417
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,750
The Princess Royal planted her spies

418
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,880
in the Imperial Palace.

419
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,200
She is wary.

420
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,790
You must be extra cautious.

421
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,360
Stay safe while collecting intel.

422
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,440
You too.

423
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,880
The Directorate of Astronomy

424
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,200
is not exactly our ally.

425
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,270
We can find the truth

426
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,070
about the heavenly sign

427
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,750
of your birth.

428
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,310
Do not be impatient

429
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,070
or risk your life.

430
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,120
Very well.

431
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,380
[Tiande Hall]

432
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Ever since His Majesty

433
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,160
betrothed Si to Jin,

434
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,310
Jin has become the laughingstock

435
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,840
of the Imperial Palace.

436
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,510
They say he is a savage

437
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,200
who grew up in the Southern Frontier,

438
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
that he is naive,

439
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,990
short-sighted, and unintelligent.

440
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,360
This is outrageous.

441
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,750
Calm down, Mother.

442
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,230
Mother, there's something I'm not sure

443
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,230
if I should bring up.

444
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,270
Just spill it.

445
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,790
Don't beat around the bush.

446
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,070
I think Miss Jiang is indeed

447
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,550
somewhat capable.

448
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,440
She caught everyone's attention
at the Floral Banquet.

449
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,680
She outshone even Princess Mingyue.

450
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,680
She even left

451
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,070
quite an impression on Father.

452
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,030
If she ever goes against you,

453
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,710
and if Prince Yan takes her side...

454
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,960
Do you think she is
too big of a threat to me?

455
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,710
Go to the Count of Dongping's Mansion

456
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,680
and summon Jiang Si to Jinhua Hall

457
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,400
for her etiquette lesson.

458
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,400
Yes.

459
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,400
Your Highness,

460
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,990
Miss Jiang has arrived
at the Jinhua Hall.

461
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,640
She is here to greet you.

462
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,550
Perfect timing.

463
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,680
Send her in.

464
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,510
Yes.

465
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,030
I came by as Commandant

466
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,470
of the Capital Administration Office

467
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,600
to inspect the documents

468
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,030
of the Directorate of Astronomy.

469
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,640
I hope you can do me a favor, Mr. Yang.

470
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,480
[Directorate of Astronomy]

471
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,310
Your Highness,

472
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,400
our documents have always

473
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,680
been kept safely in the archives.

474
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,550
If you want to go through them,

475
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,030
we need to see

476
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,750
the permit

477
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,920
with His Majesty's seal.

478
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,160
Of course.

479
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,400
If my memory serves

480
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,790
this is the very permit

481
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,550
you and Mr. Zhen presented

482
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,790
during the investigation

483
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,310
of the hunting assassination.

484
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
There are missing dots.

485
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,990
We must further investigate.

486
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,680
Is there a problem?

487
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,990
His Majesty is impartial.

488
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,360
The Directorate has

489
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,270
weeded out the corrupt officers.

490
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,640
What more is there

491
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,230
to investigate?

492
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,470
Is there an expiration date
on the permit?

493
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,070
No.

494
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,960
Is the case closed?

495
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,440
No.

496
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,120
Your attempt to stop us

497
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,230
raises some suspicion.

498
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,200
It seems I must

499
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,120
inform His Majesty of this.

500
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:10,840
Please.

501
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,310
Thanks.

502
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,470
Chief.

503
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,200
I have a stomach ache.

504
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,960
Please help him out, Mr. Yang.

505
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:17,920
Straight down that way.

506
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,270
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

507
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,750
I am Jiang Si,
from the Count of Dongping's Mansion.

508
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,600
Greetings, Your Grace.

509
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,960
Wishing you happiness and well-being.

510
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,550
Miss Jiang,

511
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,360
this is your first audience
with Her Grace.

512
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,270
You should perform

513
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,610
[Nanny Lin]
the full prostration ceremony.

514
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,470
Has no one in your family
taught you proper manners?

515
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,750
It's my mistake.

516
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,070
Greetings, Imperial Concubine Xian.

517
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,270
May you live long and prosper.

518
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,880
Your bow

519
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,200
seems proper enough.

520
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,270
Thank you.

521
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,790
Her Grace didn't say
you could stand back up.

522
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,600
You should kneel and await your order.

523
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,400
Yes.

524
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,440
From what I heard,

525
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,510
your mother was the daughter
of a merchant.

526
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,640
The Count of Dongping's Mansion
is somewhat low in rank.

527
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,840
But your ancestors
had their glorious days.

528
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,200
They had honorific titles.

529
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,600
Why was your mother allowed
into the family?

530
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,960
Or perhaps

531
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,790
you learned how to move up in the world

532
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,840
from your mother?

533
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,200
I beg to differ, Your Grace.

534
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,200
My mother passed away

535
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,750
as soon as I was born.

536
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,790
I wasn't fortunate enough

537
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,880
to be in the company of my mother.

538
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,400
But from what I learned
from the others,

539
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,440
my mother was a person of great virtues.

540
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,960
She had self-respect.

541
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,790
She was my role model.

542
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,990
She was a better mother

543
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,400
than those who lived

544
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,230
but failed to give their children

545
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,920
a proper upbringing.

546
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:23,960
How dare you?

547
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,030
You insulted me by implying it was me!

548
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,960
Seize her and slap her!

549
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,880
Don't just stand there!

550
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,440
Let go of me!

551
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,990
Mother.

552
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,680
This is Jiang Si's first visit
to the palace.

553
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,070
Could you

554
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,440
bear with her this time?

555
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,070
If she is hurt,

556
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,360
the Seventh Prince will be upset.

557
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,360
That is bad for your relationship
with His Highness.

558
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Slap her!

559
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,680
If I swallowed it,

560
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,990
I wouldn't live to see the day

561
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,510
of me and Jin getting along.

562
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,200
Nanny Lin.

563
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,230
Yes.

564
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,550
Jiang Si

565
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,200
was engaged to the Duke of Anguo's son.

566
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,440
Then, she was earning the favor
of the Zhen family.

567
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,200
You may

568
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,200
investigate it.

569
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,920
Make sure

570
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,270
whether Jiang Si

571
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,030
has remained untouched.

572
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,310
Your Grace!

573
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,680
How could you do this to me?

574
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,680
Your Highness!

575
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,790
Let go of me!

576
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,270
- Let go of me!
- Calm down.

577
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,440
Mother.

578
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,840
Don't be mad.

579
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,200
Why didn't you tell me

580
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,600
her mother had passed away?

581
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,160
Were you giving Jiang Si a chance

582
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,120
to mock me?

583
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,750
It's my fault for not finding out.

584
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,270
Let go of me!

585
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,030
Shut her mouth!

586
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,840
If you hurt me,

587
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,960
Prince Yan won't forgive you.

588
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,990
Are you worried

589
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,270
we might find out

590
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,360
you've known intimacy?

591
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,640
Is that why you threaten us?

592
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,070
Seize her!

593
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:34,920
Back off!

594
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,510
Send them out.

595
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,470
Get them out of here.

596
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,510
Leave.

597
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,710
Nanny Lin, you can examine me later.

598
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,880
Feel the cut on your palm.

599
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,840
Does it hurt?

600
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,160
Is it

601
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,600
starting to itch?

602
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,120
What did you do?

603
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,990
You must have heard by now.

604
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,990
I knew
there was Traceless Grass in my ink

605
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,030
during the Floral Banquet.

606
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,880
I even made the buds bloom.

607
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,710
Putting poison

608
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,990
on this broken vase...

609
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,840
shouldn't be hard.

610
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,200
You are lying.

611
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,120
Calling me a liar?

612
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,750
Suit yourself.

613
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,310
When the sun sets,

614
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,640
and you don't get the antidote,

615
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,400
you will die

616
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,920
from excessive bleeding
from your orifices.

617
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,960
It is going to be

618
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
a horrendous death.

619
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:50,920
Miss Jiang.

620
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,070
Even if I obeyed you

621
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,030
and covered it up,

622
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,400
your secret will be known

623
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,840
on the night of consummation.

624
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:58,880
That is

625
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,120
not your concern.

626
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,790
Yes.

627
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,310
I know

628
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:04,990
what to tell Her Grace.

629
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,750
Please give me the antidote.

630
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,710
Please.

631
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,470
The antidote can wait.

632
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,200
Nanny Lin.

633
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,470
You've served in the palace for decades.

634
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,440
I have a question for you.

635
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,070
Ask away.

636
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,510
I will tell you anything.

637
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,440
Which consort

638
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,920
is the closest

639
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,070
to the Princess Royal?

640
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,230
Imperial Concubine Zhuang

641
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,030
and Empress Di.

642
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,310
Empress Di?

643
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,750
Indeed.

644
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,230
After Empress Qingrong's passing,

645
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,030
the Princess Royal

646
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,310
recommended her for the position.

647
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,960
Are there any nannies

648
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,160
that have served them

649
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,440
for more than 20 years?

650
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,070
How can I know for sure

651
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,640
how long they've served?

652
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,230
But the nannies serving them

653
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,920
are experienced.

654
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,880
But why do you ask?

655
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,990
Give me the antidote, miss.

656
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,960
Please!

657
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:02,600
Have patience.

658
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,230
When I leave Jinhua Hall,

659
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,400
you will get it.

660
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,780
[Prince Yan's Mansion]

661
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,310
Mother.

662
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,790
Qian.

663
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,120
Mother!

664
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,750
Qian!

665
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,920
Qian.

666
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,550
I thought I'd never

667
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,310
see you again.

668
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,710
You've lost so much weight.

669
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,200
You look frail.

670
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:34,920
Qian.

671
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,200
How did you find me?

672
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:44,600
Mother.

673
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,470
How could you be so foolish?

674
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,710
How could you poison her?

675
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,640
I did it out of pride.

676
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,840
I was always overshadowed

677
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,270
by Madam Su.

678
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,920
Your grandmother allowed us

679
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,030
to fight over everything.

680
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,790
I had no choice.

681
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,510
Now, Jiang Si has been

682
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,920
chosen by Prince Yan.

683
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,920
She will be a consort soon.

684
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,200
When she marries the prince,

685
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,270
our branch

686
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,920
is as good as doomed.

687
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,990
So I had to...

688
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,470
That was foolish.

689
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,880
Why can't we live

690
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,230
our peaceful life

691
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,030
in this family?

692
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,030
Why make things difficult for yourself

693
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,920
and others?

694
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,230
Back then...

695
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,510
Well,

696
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,030
did something happen then?

697
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,600
Drop it.

698
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,920
It's all in the past now.

699
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,920
Forget it.

700
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,310
I've pondered long and hard lately.

701
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,070
I've made so many mistakes

702
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,440
and done Ancheng's family wrong.

703
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
I have a debt to pay.

704
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,200
Talk to your father.

705
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,440
Let me go home.

706
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,840
I'm willing to do anything...

707
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:01,960
Mother.

708
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,960
I'm afraid that is impossible.

709
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,920
Father might be planning
to make Madam Ruan

710
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,200
the official wife.

711
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,880
After what you did,

712
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,510
your life and death

713
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,640
are no longer his concern.

714
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,600
Mother!

715
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,990
But...

716
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,880
But I have nowhere else to go

717
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,400
except

718
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,400
our home.

719
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,680
Mother, I'm here.

720
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,840
I can provide you with shelter.

721
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,270
You don't need others.

722
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,710
We can have our own home.

723
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,270
But Miss Si...

724
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,400
Don't worry.

725
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,270
It was Si who asked me

726
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,030
to get you out.

727
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,750
Very well.

728
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,030
There are rumors circling in the palace,

729
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,640
saying you seduced men of power.

730
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
I didn't anticipate

731
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,120
you'd preserved your honor.

732
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,600
I didn't think

733
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,880
you'd fall for those false rumors.

734
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,230
Judging by the attitude,

735
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,160
you are still defiant.

736
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,880
You lectured me

737
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,270
and examined my body.

738
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,960
Can I leave now?

739
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,510
What do you

740
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,400
take the palace for?

741
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,990
You can't come and go as you please.

742
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,400
Someone,

743
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,920
bring her the Admonitions for Women.

744
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,270
She must copy it
until she learns her lessons.

745
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,120
Has anyone in the family

746
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,230
treated me with respect before?

747
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,470
Who am I?

748
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,680
Do I even have my own name?

749
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,600
I'm just a pawn to you all!

750
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,160
I can only depend on myself!

751
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,160
I alone must strive

752
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,550
to secure my place

753
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,920
in the family!

754
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,640
I didn't mean to kill her!

755
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:28,400
I was deceived as well!

756
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,710
Even the tides of fate turn.

757
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,710
Years fade like dewdrops at dawn.

758
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,360
I never thought the girl

759
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,310
who hated me the most

760
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,880
would give me a second chance

761
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,960
and

762
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,200
a home for my daughter and me.

763
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,070
Mother.

764
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,920
We should always remember her kindness.

765
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,960
If Si ever

766
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,440
needs our help with anything,

767
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,310
we should assist her.

768
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,200
Miss Jiang.

769
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
After all the fuss,

770
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,990
you still have to kneel
and copy the book.

771
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,510
It must be difficult.

772
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,590
Quick,

773
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,190
serve Miss Jiang the tea.

774
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,670
Thank you, Your Highness.

775
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,760
I assume you're not used to

776
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,630
copying the book.

777
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,320
Every beginning is hard.

778
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,840
I can show you the rope.

779
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:20,719
Never mind.

780
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,840
When I first met Mother,

781
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,320
I went through this too.

782
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
Before marrying,

783
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,400
I was my parents' precious child.

784
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,510
They always spoiled me

785
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,440
and tolerated me.

786
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,320
I had never been mistreated.

787
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,800
I cried for three days straight at home.

788
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,360
Now, I've endured long enough

789
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,590
to make it all worthwhile.

790
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:51,670
Si,

791
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,070
you did far better than me back then.

792
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,030
We should be allies.

793
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,800
It's better than enduring it alone.

794
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,960
Your Highness,

795
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,030
my mother died young.

796
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,590
My family

797
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,470
was managed by my aunt.

798
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,240
My aunt

799
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,720
was an interesting person.

800
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,590
She was stingy,

801
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,920
but she wanted people
to see her as generous.

802
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,630
When she gave us some fabric

803
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,550
and coals,

804
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,150
she'd tell the world about it.

805
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,070
She might as well have told

806
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:22,880
the whole city.

807
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,440
What do you mean?

808
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,320
Do you blame me for not helping you?

809
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,320
Helping is kindness.

810
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,510
Not helping is the right thing to do.

811
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,190
I appreciate

812
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,070
the tea you bring me.

813
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,470
I thank you

814
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,110
for defending me

815
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,030
in front of Imperial Concubine Xian.

816
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,110
But I've spent years in my family

817
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,960
dealing with

818
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,920
my two-faced aunt.

819
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,920
I've learned

820
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,920
what false kindness looks like.

821
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,670
Imperial Concubine Xian
openly humiliated me.

822
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:51,880
But Your Highness

823
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,760
might also look down on me.

824
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,590
You invited me to a banquet

825
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,440
and put me in the last seat of the hall.

826
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,960
You defended me

827
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,880
only to put up an act.

828
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,110
The kindness

829
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,960
you've made so obvious

830
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,360
is no different from the fabric

831
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,320
and coals

832
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,960
my aunt gave us.

833
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,630
If you intend to earn my trust

834
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,510
with those,

835
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,030
it will be ridiculous.

836
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,760
Si, you misunderstood.

837
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,510
You said so yourself.

838
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,070
There are two daughters-in-law now.

839
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,440
From now on,

840
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,990
we shouldn't shoulder the misery alone.

841
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,590
Given the situation,

842
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,070
your wish came true.

843
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,550
I didn't expect Mother

844
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,150
- to be so upset...
- You need not explain.

845
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,670
As long as you don't plot against me,

846
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,190
I won't cause you trouble.

847
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,590
Please leave.

848
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,070
Take your time.

849
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,510
Did Jiang Si say that?

850
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,320
Yes.

851
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,800
I overheard every word of it

852
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,320
by the door.

853
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,150
Does Jiang Si

854
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,440
know nothing about holding back?

855
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,760
She's only known Zhang's wife for days.

856
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,400
Yet, she spilled

857
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,280
all the thoughts I had about

858
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,280
my daughter-in-law

859
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,440
without any hesitation.

860
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,760
Zhang's wife is such a phony.

861
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,510
Back then, she stood right there.

862
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,110
She wouldn't look at me
when I lectured her.

863
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:26,360
I mistook her for an obedient one.

864
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,030
But as soon as she left,

865
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,880
she told the Grand Preceptor

866
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,670
to snitch on me to His Majesty.

867
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,240
From that day onward, I've been known

868
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,190
for being a cruel mother-in-law.

869
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,320
If that's what she sees,

870
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,360
I'll be as she wishes.

871
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,240
Greetings.

872
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,670
Prince Yan.

873
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,400
Are you here for Miss Jiang?

874
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,110
She went through a lot

875
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,800
today.

876
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,590
What happened?

877
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,070
Princess Consort Qi seems soft,

878
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,030
but she is scheming.

879
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,470
From what I've seen,

880
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,880
Miss Jiang may be a bit willful,

881
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,070
but she is candid,

882
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,590
not the trouble-making type.

883
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,190
Your Highness
has kept her here for so long.

884
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,670
Prince Yan might come

885
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,840
looking for her.

886
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:22,990
Should I

887
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,070
send her back now?

888
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,190
Why should I be afraid of my own son?

889
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,240
Of course you're not.

890
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,800
She must learn her lesson the hard way.

891
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,630
I am a mother-in-law.

892
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,720
I don't care if they are

893
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,150
acting or stubborn.

894
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,320
They must obey me.

895
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,670
Keep her here.

896
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,760
Your Highness, Prince Yan is here.

897
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,190
So soon?

898
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,630
Let him wait outside.

899
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,360
Your Highness, where is Jiang Si?

900
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,630
Jin, are you hungry?

901
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,590
Which filthy hand
did you touch her with?

902
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,280
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

903
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,150
I...

904
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:18,880
I don't hit women.

905
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,320
Do it yourself.

906
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,030
Enough.

907
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,320
Nanny Lin

908
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,670
was acting on my order.

909
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,670
Are you going to hit me?

910
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,150
A mother-in-law
should lecture the daughter-in-law.

911
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,280
I was taught

912
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,440
the same way by the Empress Dowager.

913
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,440
I taught Zhang's wife

914
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,070
the same way.

915
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,670
If Jiang Si wants to marry you,

916
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,110
she must endure this.

917
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,070
I did this

918
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,240
for

919
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,190
your own good.

920
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,320
Cut the nonsense!

921
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,760
Did you abandon me for my own good?

922
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,720
Where is Jiang Si?

923
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,110
Talk!

924
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,550
Please come with me.

925
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,110
No mother

926
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,880
would be willing

927
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,320
to abandon her child.

928
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:45,760
Leave.

929
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,030
Long Dan.

930
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,400
You too.

931
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,320
It pains me to see you like this.

932
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,920
Why are you here so soon?

933
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:07,920
How was the investigation?

934
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,510
We should never

935
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,720
come to this accursed place.

936
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,760
As you say. We'll never come here again.

937
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,320
Your mother...

938
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:16,550
Imperial Concubine Xian.

939
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,030
Imperial Concubine Xian.

940
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
We've met her today.

941
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,440
Let's meet the Empress tomorrow.

942
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,070
No one will suspect us again.

943
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:25,760
Right?

944
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:27,760
Oh, right.

945
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,720
I heard

946
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,590
the Princess Royal is very close

947
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,550
with Her Majesty.

948
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,280
She became the Empress

949
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,630
with the Princess Royal's
recommendation.

950
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,320
Does it mean

951
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,240
the two of them

952
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,670
were working together?

953
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,800
If that's the case,

954
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,440
it would make perfect sense
for the Princess Royal

957
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,360
Oh, right.

958
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,720
Did you find anything
at the Directorate?

959
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,630
Did you find

960
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,110
my father's record?

961
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,070
I got so mad that I almost forgot that.

[Jiang Ancheng]
On the fifth day of the fifth month,

[Observatory Director]
in the third year of the Jingming era.

[of the Directorate of Astronomy]
The Northern Star shines bright,

965
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,670
an omen of great fortune.

966
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,400
The Seventh Prince is born,

967
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,470
a joyous event of harmony.

968
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,360
May His Majesty be informed.

[Jiang Ancheng]
Heaven blesses Zhou.

970
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,990
So this was the true heavenly sign

971
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:21,840
at your birth.

972
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,440
My father told me

973
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,470
the record

974
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,320
was made of material

975
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,070
that made it impossible

976
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,470
to erase the writings.

977
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,400
This is credible evidence.

978

No.

980
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,030
If we did that,

981
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,880
your father would be

982
