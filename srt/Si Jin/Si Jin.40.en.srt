to Zhou

190
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,800
in exchange for what they need,

191
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,920
then,

192
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,040
even without farming,

193
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,080
they will

194
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,600
live better lives.

195
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,880
Who would still want

196
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,400
to go to war?

197
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,680
You mean

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,080
selling these

199
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,880
to Zhou

200
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,360
and exchanging them for food, ironware,

201
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,920
and other goods?

202
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,840
Both realms would get what they need.

203
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,360
The people on both sides

204
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,160
would have better lives.

205
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,120
The century-old conflict

206
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,440
might finally come

207
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,640
to a true resolution.

208
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,280
This might indeed be a better path.

209
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,640
Very well.
Let's implement it as you suggested.

210
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,920

243
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,680
you've been busy with Nanwu's affairs

244
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,720
for a while now.

245
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,400

247
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,800
I called you here today

248
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,000
to tell you something.

00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,600
I need you to make a trip
back to Zhou first.

250
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,640
Does that mean I can return to Ling'an?

251
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,960
What about you?

252
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,160
Aren't you going back?

253
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,000
I can't just yet.

254
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,960
Once you go back,

255
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,120
inform my sister and the others

256
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
about the situation here.

257
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,440
I need their help.

258
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,080
Also,

259
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,520
take note

260
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,320
of the types of fragrances

261
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,720
that the nobles in Ling'an City prefer,

262
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,800
and send word to me promptly.

263
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:23,640
Got it.

264
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,560
When the day comes

265
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,040
that Zhou and Nanwu establish trade,

266
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,240
remember to give me credit for it.

267
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,960
Of course!

268
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,320
Here, take a look.

269
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,160
These are some of the rarest fragrances

270
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,040
I've gathered from Nanwu recently.

271
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,960
Dear Yu Jin,

272
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,960
I have successfully negotiated

273
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,360
with the Nanwu people
for a one-year period,

274
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,800
ensuring that during this year,

275
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,880
I will stay in Nanwu.

276
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,720
Nanwu can now achieve

277
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,800
unprecedented prosperity

278
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,080
without the need for war.

279
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,560
I am confident
that I can make this happen.

280
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,760
Not even a single word about me?

281
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,440
Your Majesty.

282
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,320
Chancellor Zhen requests an audience.

283
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,520
Let him in.

284
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,880
Princess Royal Fuqing
requests an audience as well.

285
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,319
- Zhen Heng
- Fuqing

286
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,800
- greets Your Majesty.
- greets Your Majesty.

287
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,720
You came together.

288
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,080
What is the matter?

289
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,760
I, Zhen Heng,

290
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,360
sincerely seek
to marry Princess Royal Fuqing

291
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,240
and vow to share a lifelong bond.

292
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,120
People say that I am rigid, dull,

293
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,640
and as temperamental as a rock.

294
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
I don't deny it.

295
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,160
But only Fuqing never minded

296
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,800
my stubbornness

297
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
and treated me with sincerity.

298
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,760
Your Majesty,

299
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,040
after the recent turmoil

300
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
caused by the Marquis of Changxing,

301
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,760
I have come to realize

302
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,560
that the most important thing in life

303
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,160
is to cherish the person before me.

304
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,040
Therefore,
I am willing to dedicate my life

305
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,680
to protecting Princess Royal Fuqing,

306
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,560
respecting her, and loving her.

307
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,400
I humbly ask
for Your Majesty's approval.

308
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,400
And does this person

309
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,960
share the same sentiment?

310
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,160
That is also my wish.

311
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,120
Chancellor Zhen.

312
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,000
I have never seen you like this before.

313
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,120
Your Majesty, please don't tease me.

314
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,120
Get up.

315
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

316
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,560
You two look like
a pair of star-crossed lovers.

317
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,880
If word gets out,

318
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,080
they'll say
I have no sense of compassion.

319
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,720
Chancellor Zhen.

320
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,560
Fuqing.

321
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,200
I shall be present

322
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,800
at your wedding.

323
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,800
And I will bestow this,

324
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,440
this, and this as gifts.

325
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,320
This inkstone, green as jade,

326
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,040
is a true treasure among treasures.

327
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
They were carefully selected

328
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,040
for Your Highness.

329
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,600
Oh, right.

330
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,240
And this, too.

331
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,200
A gold jewel-encrusted little turtle.

332
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,120
Your Majesty, those gifts look

333
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,520
incredibly familiar to me.

334
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,960
But I believe

335
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,120
the greatest gift you can give us

336
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,360
is your approval.

337
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,000
Should I grant it?

338
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,080
Granted!

339
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

340
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,120
Grand Elder, look.

341
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
These are

342
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,400
the goods and fragrances

343
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,160
being transported to Zhou.

344
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:16,960
Your Majesty.

345
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,280
There is a letter for you.

346
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,240
A compendium of Nanwu medicinal herbs
is appended to this letter.

347
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,240
It contains

348
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,520
remedies

349
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,240
for various ailments

350
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,320
and will benefit the people of Zhou.

351
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,770
[Addressed to Yu Jin]

352
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,080
Nanwu's transformation is not easy,

353
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,400
but progress is being made.

354
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,560
I require

355
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,040
skilled water management experts
from Zhou

356
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,320
to help build water defenses

357
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,440
to protect the farmland here.

358
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,800
Also, I miss you.

359
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,320
And Erniu too.

360
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,800
So this letter is just to ask me

361
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,360
to send people to build water defenses

362
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,400
for Nanwu?

363
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,560
If someday,

364
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,640
I no longer wish
to live in Ling'an City,

365
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,320
I'll go

366
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,760
somewhere pretty,

367
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,720
get some farmland

368
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,640
and put up a small house.

369
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,360
I'll live there

370
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,760
and lead a simple yet free life.

371
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,960
By then,

372
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,400
I'll take Father,

373
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,560
Yi, Zhan,

374
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,720
Chuchu, Aman,

375
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,120
and Long Dan with me.

376
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,160
And...

377
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,640
And Erniu.

378
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,520
That's good.

379
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,920
And you.

380
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,240
Are you willing to join me, then?

381
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,400
Send Erniu to her.

382
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,600
She misses it.

383
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:54,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

384
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
Poor carrier pigeon.

385
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,080
Flying for days
just to deliver two words.

386
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,680
Missing you.

387
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,880
You're the Emperor now.

388
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,240
Couldn't you bring more people with you

389
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,240
when you go out?

390
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,160
This isn't enough.

391
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,040
Not enough?

392
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,520
These would take years
for my sister to finish

393
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,680
even if she did nothing else.

394
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,640
I bought everything

395
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,880
I could find.

396
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,240
Look.

397
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,080
Is it enough?

398
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,040
This amount looks about right.

399
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,440
Right?

400
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,440
Let's check out a few more places.

401
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,160

send them to her.

Yes, Your Majesty.

407
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,660
[Addressed to Jiang Si]

408
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,160
You're leaving early tomorrow morning?

409
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,840
My belongings are already packed.

410
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,680
I came today

411
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,200
to bid farewell to you, Mother.

412
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,160
The northern border
is vastly different from Ling'an

413
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,240
in terms of customs and way of life.

414
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,040
Although it is your ancestral homeland,

415
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,480
you have never been there before.

416
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,280
Now you are suddenly being sent

417
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,720
to the northern border
as the Protectorate General.

418
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
I wonder

419
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,880
if you'll be able to adapt.

420
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,640
Rest assured, Mother.

421
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,240
The northern border is vast

422
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,280
but has remained underdeveloped.

423
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,960
Jin entrusted the northern border to me

424
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,080
and told me

425
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,040
I could manage it

426
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,840
however I saw fit.

427
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,800
That assurance is enough for me.

428
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,400
You used to be overshadowed
by the Crown Prince

429
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,480
and never had the chance
to showcase your talents.

430
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,160
Now, you finally have the opportunity

431
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,600
to realize your ambitions.

432
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,520
But who knows how many years will pass

433
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,800
before I return?

434
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,240
I will no longer be able
to stay by your side

435
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,400
as before.

436
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,400
And Jin still has misgivings about you.

437
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,200
That is

438
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,480
what worries me the most.

439
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,560
Jin?

440
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,320
Jin has been visiting me
more frequently lately.

441
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,160
Really?

442
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,040
He doesn't say much each time

443
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,600
and leaves after the formalities,

444
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,800
but

445
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,160
he is at least willing to visit me now.

446
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,400
That's good.

447
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,200
At least it's a start.

448
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,440
I think so too.

449
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,400
Zhang.

450
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,800
Accompany me

451
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,040
for a little longer.

452
00:25:59,320 --> 00:25:59,840
Of course, Mother.

453
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,000
I'll go for a walk with your father

454
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,120
in a couple of days.

Zhan.

457
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,600
Maybe you should take

458
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,680
a few maids with you.

459
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,240
They can take care

460
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,560
of your daily needs.

461
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,440
Father.

462
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,160
I'm going to Yangui as the envoy

463
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,480

464
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,040
to ensure the security of trade

465
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,200
between both regions.

466
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,920
I will not be there for pleasure.

467
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,040
Besides,

468
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,320
I am fully capable

469
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,200
of taking care of myself.

470
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,120
It's you I'm worried about.

471
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,360
Si and I won't be by your side.

472
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,720
You have to take good care of yourself.

473
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,280
Be more mature,

474
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,040
all right?

475
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,800
You'll be

476
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,000
traveling alone.

477
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,960
I can't help

478
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,320
but worry.

479
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,160
Who said I'd be alone?

480
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840
Who else is going with you?

481
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,360
Who else could it be?

482
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,480
Miss Chuchu is going with you?

483
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,480
I suppose so.

484
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,800
Good for you, little brat!

485
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,160
That young lady is willing

486
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,200
to follow you

487
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,000
across great distances.

488
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,160
You'd better settle

489
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,360
this marriage quickly!

490
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,520
You need to learn

491
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,480
from me

492
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,600
when it comes to taking responsibility.

493
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
Stop nagging.

494
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,000
We have our own plans.

495

497

could you possibly have?

498

to meet?

503
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:03,480
Probably.

504

515

516
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,880

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,760

00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,480
What?

540
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,240
I love you!

541
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,760

a batch of paste instead.
