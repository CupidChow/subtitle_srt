to teach Jiang Zhan archery and riding,

into staying away,

who could it be?

190
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,380
I'll ask Miss Si.

191
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,060
Wait here.

192
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,430
Miss, come inside
and look at our fragrance dew.

193
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,910
Miss Si and Mr. Zhan.

194
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,750
What do we do?

195
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,310
No one is willing
to step foot inside our store.

196
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,550
Everyone, stay calm.

197
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,750
Commandant Yu is already

198
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,550
investigating the matter.

199
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,030
As they say,

200
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,230
good things are worth waiting for.

201
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,350
I refuse to believe

202
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,510
that anyone has the power

203
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,350
to stop every single patron

204
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,350
from coming to us.

205
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,310
Si is right.

206
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,390
I know some friends.

207
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,950
I'll treat them to a few drinks

208
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,670
and ask them

209
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,510
to introduce some customers to us.

210
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,190
No.

211
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,510
Why not?

212
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,190
What use do you think

213

your drinking buddies are?

214
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,550
Are you just looking for an excuse

215
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,910
to go out and make merry again?

216
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,270
Do you seriously think

217
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,070
I'd be in the mood

218
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,030
to fool around right now?

219
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,750
How could you think that of me?

220
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,070
All right.

221
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,710
The bottom line is

222
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,870
that you are not going to them.

223
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,470
Fine.

225
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,650
Oh, you give me such a good laugh.

226
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,500
All right. That's enough.

227
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,020
Don't let the fun get you down.

228
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,100
This is the first time I've ever heard

229
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,940
of a younger sister

230
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,420
keeping her older brother at home,

231
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,740
not allowing him to step out at all.

232
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,620
What do you know?

233
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,700
My sister is doing it for my own good.

234
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,700
[Zhang Sheng]
She wants me to fool around less

235
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,380
and work harder to improve myself.

236
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,260
All right.

237
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,220
I'll be on my way now.

238
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,180
Wouldn't want to interrupt
your self-improvement.

Wait, no! Don't go!

240

Come back!

241
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,420
You have no idea

242
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,580
how boring it is to drink alone.

243
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,460

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,860
so obedient to his sister.

if word gets out?

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,380
So what?

247
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,180
My sister is

248
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,220
way smarter than me.

249
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,140
Can't go wrong with her judgment.

250
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,140
The more obedient you are,

251
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,660
the less she'll respect you.

252
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,540
My sister would never look down on me.

253

I suppose?

254
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,340
She's your sister.

255
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,980
Would she tell you that to your face?

to go out and make merry again?

260
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,260
If I pass

262
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,420
she will change her opinion of me.

Not at all.

I don't get what they're thinking.

274

What's so great about being
an Imperial Insignia Guard anyway?

she's not some courtesan, is she?

What does it matter who she is?

302
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,780
What matters is that she's rich.

00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,740

about business for an entire year.

308

Promise me

309
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,940
you won't get on a boat

310
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,300
or go near the river!

311
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,820
It's just a boat ride!

312
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,100
Maybe I should just forget it.

313
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,220
If my sister finds out

314
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,340
I came to a place like this,

00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,340
she'll never let me live it down.

316
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,420
You're always talking about your sister.

317
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,980
Can you even live without her?

318
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,820
What do you mean by that?

319
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,380
Of course, I can live

320
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:05,940

321

Come on. Let's go.

Come on.

I'm not drinking.

328
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,500
Drink.

Leave us.

I had no idea
that Your Highness was here

334

with the company.

335
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:12,970
My friend

336
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:13,850
took a wrong turn.

We've disturbed your gathering.

338
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,130
Apologies.

339
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,340
Wait.

340
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,100
It was us who told your friend

341
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,380
to bring you here.

342
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,340
Your Highness, what do you mean?

343
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,460
Weren't you curious
about who's been disrupting

344
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,220
Lushengxiang Store's business?

345
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,730
I shall answer you.

346
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,530
It was me.

347
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,210
Impossible!

348
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,570
Everyone knows
that Your Highness is kind and virtuous!

349
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,050
You would never do such a thing!

350
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,450
This… This must be my fault.

351
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,090
I've always had a bad habit

352
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,650
of running my mouth.

353
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,330
Everyone here knows that.

354
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,450
I must have offended

355
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,410
Your Highness somewhere.

356
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,890
I humbly ask you to enlighten me.

357
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,840
You're quite the clever one.

358
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,540
Very well.

359
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:08,380
I'm in a good mood today.

360
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,510
I'll be gracious

361
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,069
and let this slide.

362
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,150
Thank you, Your Highness.

363
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,430
I didn't say you could leave.

364
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,010
There are no seats left.

365
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,140
Princess Mingyue's private banquets

366
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,339
aren't something

367
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,380

368
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,750
Jiang, since you're here,

369
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,260
you must have a few drinks.

370
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,510
Someone, bring Jiang some liquor.

371
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,430
I…

372
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,710
Your Highness…

373
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,750
Finish these three jars,

374
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,430
and I will leave
Lushengxiang Store alone.

375
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,510
What do you say?

376
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:52,640
It...

377
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,950
Your Highness.

378
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,550
Do you mean it?

379
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,550
Of course.

380
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,670
I thank Your Highness
for your generosity.

381
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,470
I forgot to mention.

382
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,670
This is Scorching Spirit,

383
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,110
brought all the way
from the Western Regions.

384
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,590
A few drops will have you intoxicated.

385
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,830
My hands slipped.

386
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,710
What's your problem?

387
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,950
Her Highness has granted you

388
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,350
such precious liquor,

389
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,950
yet you still hesitate to drink it?

390
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,830
I will drink it.

391
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:40,990
I will.

392
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,830
I didn't think much of it
when Zhang Sheng came over

393
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,430
a few days ago.

394
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,230
Who knew that after dinner today,

395
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,310
Zhan would be nowhere to be found?

396
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,350
Don't panic just yet.

397
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,510
Maybe he just sneaked out drinking

398
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,830
like last time.

399
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,190
You're spilling.

400
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,670
Give him a hand.

401
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,030
What are you doing to me?

402
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,430
You two search along this road.

403
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,310
We'll check the other side of the river.

404
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,470
Jiang Zhan, looks like today's your day.

405
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,710
Come on, run!

406
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,310
Cui Yi, this is the imperial capital!

407
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,590
You can't do this to me!

408
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,630
I'll fight you!

409
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,070
With what?

410
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,470
[Yang Shengcai]
I'll admit, in just a few months,

411
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,670
you have improved somewhat.

412
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,910
You want to practice?

413
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,030
We'll give you some.

414
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,110
Get him!

415
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,310
Enough.

416
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,350
Hold him down.

417
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,430
You spilled earlier.

418
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,110
Take it easy this time.

419
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,270
There's no hurry.

420
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,550
Jiang Zhan!

421
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,070
Mr. Jiang!

422
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,750
Jiang Zhan!

423
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:37,510
How was that?

424
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,710
Speak!

425
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:42,790
What?

426
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,030
Kill me.

427
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,310
Kill you?

428
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,070
He wants us to put him
out of his misery.

429
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,710
That's a first

430
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,190
for me!

431
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,230
Drink up. Take your time.

432
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,350
Breathe!

433
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,190
Don't play dead.

434
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,710
Ji.

435
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,310
Is he…?

436
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:25,910
Jiang Zhan.

437
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,270
Jiang Zhan?

438
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:34,950
Zhan!

439
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,070
Zhan!

440
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,950
What are you doing?

441
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,670
I'm not your brother.

442
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,710
Excuse me.

443
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,950
Zhan!

444
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,440
Oh, no.

445
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,110
He… He has stopped breathing!

446
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,230
He's too weak.

447
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,190
He's dead! What…?

448
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,630
What do we do, Your Highness?

449
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,310
Strip him.

450
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,190
Sorry.

451
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,610
Zhan.

452
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,340
Are you all right?

453
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,260
Your Highness.

454
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,590
He's really dead.

455
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,230
Boring.

456
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,590
What do we do?

457
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,020
What's the big deal?
It's just a worthless life.

458
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,110
Even if he's useless,

459
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,210
he's still an heir to the count.

460
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,610
Then let's just throw him into the river

461
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,450
and be done with it.

462
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,290
Someone.

463
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:13,570
Throw him in the river.

464
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,410
Jiang Zhan!

465
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,050
Not bad.

466
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,770
Look! Someone fell into the water!

467
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:30,930
What happened?

468
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,170
Probably drank too much.

469
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,310
Wake up, Zhan!

470
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,110
He fell into the water!

471
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,940
Someone fell into the water!

472
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,670
Mingyue!

473
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,950
What are we going to do

474
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,270
if Uncle learns about this?

475
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,410
Then have them get rid

476
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,730
of these servants.

477
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,570
By tomorrow,

478
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,450
I don't want to see them in Ling'an City

479
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,530
ever again.

480
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,110
- No!
- No!

481
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,290
Your Highness! Mercy!

482
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:21,850
Move it.

483
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,290
Move!

484
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:24,910
Hurry up!

485
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,940
For what happened
with Jiang Zhan tonight,

486
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,180
everyone present shall be

487
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,260
richly rewarded!

488
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,780
- Thank you, Your Highness!
- I appreciate it, Your Highness!

489
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:49,690
Zhang Sheng.

490
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,090
You are today's biggest contributor.

491
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,050
You brought Jiang Zhan here.

492
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:54,610
A big buyer

493
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,380
of fragrance dew, huh?

494
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,540
The fact

495
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,060
that he actually believed it
is hilarious!

496
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,910
I'm flattered.

497
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,820
It was Ji's idea.

498
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,980
Ji gets the credit.

499
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,100
- Ji.
- Yes.

500
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,590

501
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,340
Oh, stop it!

502
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,020
You can handle it.

503
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,460
We're just here for a bit of fun,

504
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,060
right?

505
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,980
Jiang Zhan

506
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,420
didn't even flinch.

507
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,460
I just draped a cloth over him

508
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,740
and poured some liquor on him.

509
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,940
Before I even got to enjoy myself,
he stopped breathing.

510
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,540
Good thing Her Highness
had him stripped.

511
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,140
Yes.

512
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,580
Your Highness,
did you enjoy yourself tonight?

513
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,340
No.

514
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,060
Tell me. What's the difference
between a person

515
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,220
and an ant?

516
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,300
None.

517
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,940
They both belong to Your Highness.

518
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,650

521
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,540
I'll make you

522
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,510

Run!

528
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,650
Those animals.

530
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,530
They tortured my brother

531
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,090
to death

532
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:57,970
and then threw him

533
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,770
into this river!

Remember.

536
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,970
You were with me the entire night.

537
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,170
You were nowhere else.

538
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,090
Chief!

539
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,330
There's an extremely steep cliff

540
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,010
downstream.

541
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,650
If Jiang Zhan really got swept away
by the current,

542
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,090
I'm afraid his chances
of survival are slim.

543
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,210
Keep searching!

544
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,210
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,410
Princess Mingyue
must apply medicine daily

to prevent scarring.

Be gentle, Mother.

Look at what you've done!

that she's your daughter.

Can't you see

559
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,920
how badly she's hurt?

560
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,690
So what if she got injured?

561
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,440
At least she's still alive!

562
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,400
But Cui Yi? He's dead!

563
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,320
He was barely in his twenties!

564
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,400
He was my brother's only son!

How am I supposed
to explain this to him?

566

00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,630
Did she start the fire?

569
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,350
Did she kill him?

570
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:07,950
You…

571
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,690
Everyone in this mansion knows

572
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,850
she's always ordered him around

573
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,610
like a servant!

574
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,170
She's never shown an ounce of respect
for her own cousin.

575
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:20,650
And

576
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,050
she's an unmarried lady,

577
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,730
sneaking out at night

578
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,890
with a group of men!

579
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,530
And now look. A burned-down tavern,

580
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,380
two dead, one crippled,

581
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,890
and another missing!

582
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,440
She's committed

583
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,320
a terrible catastrophe,

584
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,370
yet you, as her mother,
still defend her?

585
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,420
I'll tell you this.

586
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,610
If you keep spoiling her,

587
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,170
one day,

588
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,930
she will lose her life because of it!

589
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,970
Never curse

590
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,210
my daughter!

591
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:54,890
Mother.

592
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,010
What exactly happened last night?

593
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,570
Tell me everything,

594
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,370
down to the last word!

595
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:05,810
[Duke of Anguo's Mansion]

596
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,490
Easy.

597
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,410
Bear with it, Chongyi.

598
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:19,770
Physician,

599
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,190
how is

600
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,550
my son's leg?

601
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,270
Madam.

602
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,580
His injury is far too severe.

603
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,860
I'm afraid

604
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,420
he may never walk normally again.

605
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,530
My son is still young!

606
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,850
He can't be crippled!

607
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,010
We'll pay whatever it takes

608
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,400
to cure him!

609
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,660
Madam,
you should seek another physician.

610
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,620
Physician, please!

611
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,220
You…

612
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,820
Save my leg, Physician!

613
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,900
Mother!

614
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,180
Physician, please, think of something!

615
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,340
Physician!

616
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,260
Mother, save my leg!

617
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,540
Physician!

618
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,260
Ji Chongyi.

619
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,460
If you hurt the baby in my womb,

620
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,660
I will never forgive you.

621
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,180
I'm severely injured,

622
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,260
and you won't even spare me a glance!

623
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,540
How can you be so heartless?

624
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,100
You speak to me of love?

625
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,180
Ji Chongyi,

626
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,780
you are nothing more than a tool for me

627
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,260
to marry into this mansion.

628
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,640
I couldn't care less

629
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,920
whether you live or die.

630
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,120
You… You vile woman!

631
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,240
I told you

632
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,280
Princess Mingyue was arrogant
and a tyrant.

633
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,120
People in Ling'an City fear her
at the mere mention of her name.

634
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,920
Yet you insisted
on getting close to her.

635
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,600
Look at the fate

636
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,600
you brought upon yourself now.

637
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,280
You're a merchant. What do you know?

638
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,720
Everything I've done is

639
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,760
for the future of this family!

640
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,560
The Princess Royal holds immense power
over the imperial court.

641
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,720
Do you think I can afford to offend her?

642
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,540
The court is treacherous
and unpredictable.

643
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,730
Even your father couldn't
outmaneuver her.

644
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,530
What makes you think

645
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,450
you can?

646
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,170
You're just digging your own grave.

647
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:57,890
If it wasn't

648
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,130
for the child I'm expecting,

649
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,370
I wouldn't even bother
explaining all this to you.

650
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,130
Chongyi!

651
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,740
You're saved!

652
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,860
The Princess Royal has sent a carriage
to fetch you.

653
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,660
The imperial physicians at her mansion

654
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,340
who can surely heal your leg.

655
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,820
That's wonderful, Mother!

656
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,380
Let's go!

657
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,440
What are you doing over there?

658
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,010
Hurry up and help!

659
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:17,060
He cannot go.
Hurry up and help!

660
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,810
He cannot go.

661
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,370
What did you just say?

662
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,330
Are you hoping my son never recovers?

663
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,290
Mother.

664
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,290
I have married into this mansion.

665
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:29,170
I am already in the same boat

666
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,410
as all of you.

667
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,090
Please think carefully.

668
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,730
Last night's fire killed two people.

669
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,490
One was the son of the Chief Censor.

670
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,530
The other was the nephew of General Cui.

671
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,090
The missing one is the grandson

672
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,810
of Director Sun.

673
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,810
Every one of them is someone
we cannot afford to offend.

674
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,730
Yet why is it that only he

675
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,050
and Princess Mingyue survived?

676
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,790
What are you implying?

677
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,560
My son is also an heir apparent.

678
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,160
His status is no less than any of them.

679
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,860
Stop deceiving yourself.

680
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,340
The Duke of Anguo's Mansion
is in decline.

681
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,380
If we get involved in this mess,

682
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,340
he could lose his noble title

683
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,460
altogether.

684
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,700
The Censorate. The Office of Ceremonies.

685
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,020
Neither are to be trifled with.

686
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,100
They would not let their own kin

687
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,179
be sacrificed in vain.

688
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,020
Lives have been lost.

689
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,860
If there has to be a scapegoat,

690
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,260
tell me,

691
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,300
who do you think

692
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,659
the Princess will choose?

693
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,860
That's right. She must not harbor

694
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,179
kind intentions.

695
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,860
Then,

696
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,260
what do you suggest we do now?

697
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:32,340
He must not go

698
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:34,860
to the Princess Royal's Mansion
at all costs.

699
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:37,860
Here's what we do.

700
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,780
Inform the Princess Royal

701
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,699
that Chongyi's leg is too injured

702
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,500
to be moved.

703
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,060
All right.

704
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,900
I'll go right away.

705
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,739
I didn't expect you to have

706
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,860
even a sliver of conscience.

707
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,620
I'm not doing this for you.

708
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,860
I'm doing this for my unborn child.

709
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,220
What was the true cause

710
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,540
of last night's fire?

711
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,700
Even if it's for the sake

712
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,980
of this mansion,

713
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,020
you should tell me the truth.

714
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,460
There weren't

715
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,580
just five of us last night.

716
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,460
There was someone else.

717
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,300
Are they searching for bodies?

718
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,520
I heard many people died.

719
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,050
It's too dangerous!

720
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,170
Well? Did you find anything?

721
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:56,940
No.

722
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,140
Long Dan.

723
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,260
Take some men and search over there.

724
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,980
Yes. Follow me.

725
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:02,340
Yes.

726
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,460
A reward of 1000 liang

727
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,860
to whoever finds my grandson!

728
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,050
A thousand liang!

729
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:09,730
A thousand liang!

730
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,260
Come on! Let's help find him!

731
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,180
Hurry！

732
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,610
Over there!

733
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,610
A thousand liang!

734
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,510
A thousand liang!

735
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,190
This is the Jinshui River.

736
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,070
It's not some small creek.

737
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,310
Even the most skilled swimmers

738
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,150
can lose their lives here.

739
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,430
Please withdraw your reward.

740
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,510
The Capital Administration Office
has failed to find my grandson.

741
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,590
Why shouldn't I conduct my own search?

742
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,910
The more people searching,

743
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,270
the higher the chances

744
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,470
of finding my grandson!

745
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,830
Over there!

746
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,270
Search over there!

747
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,150
Quickly!

748
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,830
Your Grace! Miss Si!

749
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,510
Anything?

750
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,350
Your Grace! Miss Si!

751
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,270
No sign of him there either.

752
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,870
No news is good news.

753
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,070
He will be fine.

754
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,030
We will find your brother.

755
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,630
He's always been a troublemaker.

756
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,630
Troublemakers live long.

757
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,350
Someone's in the water!

758
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,840
Sir! Over here!

759
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,310
They found him!

760
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,430
They found him! Hurry!

761
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,940
Let's go!

762
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,540
- Come on!
- Master!

763
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,380
Move! Out of the way!

764
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,300
- Over there!
- Over there!

765
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,260
Hurry! Over here!

766
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,860
Save him! Pull them up!

767
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,780
Over there!

768
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,060
Master!

769
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,460
Hurry! Pull him up!

770
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,380
A purple robe.

771
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,300
Sheng loved wearing purple robes.

772
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,940
Sheng.

773
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,060
How cruel you are

774
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,980
to let a grandfather bury his grandson!

775
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,520
Chief!

776
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,200
Miss Si!

777
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:49,800
Si!

778
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:50,960
Miss Si!

779
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,360
Quickly! Bring her home.

780
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,000
Yes.

781
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,520
Miss Si.

782
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,560
You haven't eaten anything all day.

783
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,840
At least have some soup.

784
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:16,800
Aman.

785
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,380
Any news of Zhan?

786
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,920
It's all my fault.

787
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,120
I'm to blame.

788
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,050
Mr. Jiang.

789
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,730
You need to take some rest.

790
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:09,970
I'll stay here and keep watch.

791
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:16,050
Why is the Jinshui River so deep

792
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,410
and so long?

793
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,820
You mustn't overexert yourself.

794
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,040
If you wear yourself out,
how can you search for him?

795
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,140
If he's found,

796
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,060
will he still be alive?

797
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,700
Yes.

798
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,620
Surely, he will be.

799
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,700
I am unfit

800
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,060
to be a father.

801
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,580
I never really

802
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,980
cared for him as a child.

803
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,660
Once he grew up,

804
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,980
all I did

805
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,740
was criticize him.

806
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,540
I never truly cared about him.

807
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,700
He was mischievous,

808
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,260
but good at heart.

809
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:34,660
I've wronged him.

810
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,460
Rest assured, Mr. Jiang.

811
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,380
I will find him.

812
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,860
We will.

813
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,540
Yes.

814
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,420
We will.

815
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,620
Your Highness.

816
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,140
You must seek justice for me!

817
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:11,940
Your Highness.

818
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,980
My son's face was burnt so horribly

819
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,300
that he's barely recognizable!

820
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,420
It's an absolute tragedy, Your Highness!

821
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,020
Please accept my condolences, Mr. Zhang.

822
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,420
But I don't understand.

823
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,660
Why did your son

824
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,300
end up

825
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,540
with Princess Mingyue?

826
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,140
Your Highness, please be discerning.

827
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,940
You have shown me a great favor,

828
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,780
and I have

829
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,020
remained ever loyal to you.

830
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,060
Zhang Sheng

831
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,300
is the son of my concubine.

832
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,380
He has always been unmotivated

833
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,660
and unambitious.

834
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,580
He has failed the examinations
time and again.

835
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,260
I neglected to discipline him.

836
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,940
I cannot fathom how this wretch

837
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,900
became entangled

838
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,500
with Princess Mingyue.

839
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,460
Even though he was of a lower status,

840
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,420
he was still your own flesh and blood.

841
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,660
To have him burned to death

842
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,540
in such a senseless manner

843
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,340
is heart-wrenching.

844
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,300
Your Highness.

845
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,580
It's all the fault
of the Princess Royal's lax discipline.

846
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,140
Princess Mingyue
never showed any propriety.

847
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,660
Her debauchery and licentious behavior

848
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,500
have brought disaster upon herself

849
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,020
and taken away the lives of so many!

850
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,420
Your Highness.

851
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,180
I will report this matter
to His Majesty.

852
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,740
Princess Mingyue
must be punished for her deeds!
