00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:55,860
Well...

193
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,460
If you wish to meet Miss Liu,

194
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,340
please come with me.

195
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,140
Hold on.

196
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,300
You enjoy this kind of pastime as well?

197
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,420
Aren't you the same, Mr. Jiang?

198
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,780
As I thought, Yu Qi

199
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,220
was using the Nightingale Seal
to test me.

200
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,900
Let them come in with me.

201
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:15,860
Mister,

202
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,860
we have a rule here.

203
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,370
Miss Liu

204
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,900
only meets one guest at a time.

205
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,460
You may enter alone,

206
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,300
but you can't bring others with you.

207
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,940
Do me this favor.

208
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,740
Oh.

209
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,060
Well...

210
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,220
Please come this way.

211
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,300
Over here.

212
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,740
Miss Liu,

213
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,020
the three of them...

214
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,500
Miss Liu, you're well known
for your incense-making skills.

215
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,620
I have a formula

216
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,340
for which I wish to seek your guidance.

217
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,300
Three qian of clove,
half a liang of gurjan,

218
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,620
one qian of sandalwood,
and a small amount of storax.

219
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,700
What do you think, Miss?

220
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,620
Chunniang, give us the room.

221
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,220
All right.

222
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,420
Mister, the formula you just mentioned

223
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,260
is my exclusive recipe.

224
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,260
I dare not reveal your secret.

225
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,660
However, there's one key ingredient

226
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,420
I can't figure out.

227
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,260
Could you enlighten me?

228
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,220
It's rare to find a kindred spirit.

229
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,020
Mister,

230
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,900
please step forward
to the incense table.

231
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,540
Yu, let's have a drink.

232
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,500
I don't drink.

233
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,220
Have some apricots then.

234
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,620
I'll drink alone.

235
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,340
Mister, why not try this incense?

236
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,460
It helps calm the mind.

237
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,130
[Liu Yan'er,
a spy of the Nightingale Sect]

238
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,540
Jiang Si,

239
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,500
this is your third martial sister,
Liu Yan'er.

240
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,300
She just returned from Ling'an.

241
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,980
She'll be teaching you
incense-making skills from now on.

242
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,460
Greetings, Liu.

243
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,020
Be careful.

244
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:19,980
Are you all right?

245
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,860
I'm fine.

246
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,500
Come with me.

247
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,460
This formula is correct.

248
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:36,980
That's correct too.

249
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,380
Si, smell this.

250
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,100
This smells nice.

251
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,340
All right.

252
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,060
They're asleep now.

253
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,420
I don't recognize you, Miss.

254
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,940
Why have you suddenly come to me?

255
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,620
I'm Zhao Yu,

256
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,460
an envoy of the Northern Border Division
of the Nightingale Sect.

257
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,460
I'm in trouble,

258
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,860
and I had no choice but to seek you out.

259
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,220
Trouble?

260
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,500
While carrying out my mission,

261
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,020
I discovered a woman

262
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,940
bearing the Saintess Emblem.

263
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,740
However, after investigation,

264
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,190
I found

265
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,540
that she had never left Zhou,

266
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,980
nor did she have a connection
with Nanwu.

267
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,660
Why didn't you report

268
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,500
to your direct leader?

269
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,700
Everyone in the sect knows

270
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,660
that whoever finds the Saintess
will be handsomely rewarded.

271
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,099
The Northern Border Division is strict,

272
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,140
and our leader

273
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,380
cannot tolerate any mistakes.

274
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,260
If I bring this woman back

275
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,620
without verification,

276
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,460
all will be well if she's the Saintess.

277
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,460
But if she's not,

278
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,380
I'll face severe punishment.

279
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,500
It's known

280
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,940
that in Ling'an,

281
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,940
you're the most experienced member.

282
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,940
So I'm more than happy
to share the reward

283
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,340
with you.

284
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,060
I can't make a judgment

285
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,580
without seeing the person.

286
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,500
I wanted to bring her to you,

287
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,860
but you know

288
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,980
how heavily guarded the city is.

289
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,180
Miss, if I may ask,

290
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,380
aside from the Saintess Emblem,

291
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,980
what other traits

292
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,060
identify her?

293
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,740
Prophecy.

294
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,220
Word has it that the Saintess
can foresee the future

295
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,980
and lead Nanwu to prosperity.

296
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,500
As I am now,

297
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,780
of course, I know
what will happen in the future.

298
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,540
So I,

299
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,460
for the very wrong reasons,
have become the Saintess.

300
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,340
[Tianxiang Pleasure House]

301
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,860
I didn't drink.

302
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,820
But why did I pass out?

303
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,260
Normally,

304
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,900
I hold my liquor quite well.

305
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,140
This is unbecoming.

306
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,620
Are you all right, Si?

307
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,540
I'm good.

308
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,380
Oh, right, Zhan,

309
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,180
there's this Qingbao Hall nearby.

310
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,500
They sell

311
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,180
delicious iced yogurts.

312
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,860
That should help clear your head.

313
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,180
I've always wanted to try it.

314
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,540
Iced yogurts?

315
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,500
But it's a bit far.

316
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,580
Let's hurry.

317
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,020
Let's go.

318
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,260
No...

319
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,860
We'll make it in time.

320
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,060
I know that shop. I'll go.

321
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,940
You're too slow

322
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,100
to get there before the shop closes.

323
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,180
Thank you, Commandant Yu.

324
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,620
You're so kind, Yu.

325
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:58,900
We'll wait for you

326
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,900
on this street.

327
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,380
All right.

328
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:00,940
Let's go.

329
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,260
Zhan, you're dizzy.

330
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,140
Let's walk slowly.

331
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,260
I think I've only had one drink.

332
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,620
Dear!

333
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,020
Is that how you ride a horse?

334
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,140
Get out of my way!

335
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,460
Move aside!

336
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:23,820
Stop right there!

337
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,860
Do you have a death wish?

338
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,980
Get out of my way!

339
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:27,980
Riding recklessly in broad daylight?

340
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,940
Do you have no respect for the law?

341
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,020
Apologize to the lady.

342
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,020
To think

343
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,900
I'd run into her again.

344
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,060
Si, don't worry.

345
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,020
I'm here.

346
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,140
No one can drive you

347
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,100
out of here.

348
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,660
I'll protect you.

349
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,500
Get out of my way!

350
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:45,780
Stop right there!

351
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,900
Do you have a death wish?

352
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,060
Get out of my way!

353
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,020
Riding recklessly in broad daylight?

354
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,100
Do you have no respect for the law?

355
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,260
Apologize to the lady.

356
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,420
Apologize?

357
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,020
I, the princess, am the law.

358
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,060
I don't care who you are.

359
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,260
Your horse knocked someone over.

360
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:58,980
You must apologize.

361
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,180
You do have a death wish.

362
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:00,980
Say that again.

363
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,020
You have a death wish!

364
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,820
I'll kill you!

365
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,100
Wake up, Zhan!

366
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,140
This time,

367
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,460
I must stop Zhan

368
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,620
before he clashes with Cui Mingyue.

369
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,060
Your horse knocked someone over,
and you owe her an apology.

370
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,220
You can't leave until you apologize.

371
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,020
You're courting death!

372
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,780
It's my brother's fault.

373
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,740
I apologize on his behalf.

374
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,140
Please forgive us, Your Highness.

375
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,300
Please calm down.

376
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,340
What are you talking about?

377
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:46,780
Zhan, no.

378
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,500
Who are you?

379
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,100
It doesn't matter who I am.

380
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,220
Pay no mind to me,

381
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,260
Your Highness.

382
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,300
I've long heard that Princess Mingyue

383
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,300
possesses unparalleled elegance
and beauty in all of Ling'an.

384
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,340
After meeting you today,

385
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,620
I can see that your reputation
is well deserved.

386
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,460
What a sweet tongue you have.

387
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,860
But he offended me just now.

388
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,260
If you truly want to apologize
on his behalf,

389
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,300
kneel

390
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,780
and kowtow to me.

391
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,380
Then, I'll spare you.

392
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,220
What do you think?

393
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,780
Don't push your luck!

394
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:12,740
That's right.

395
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,100
This is bullying.

396
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:14,700
Si.

397
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,540
Your Highness,

398
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,980
we have overstepped.

399
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,740
Please forgive us.

400
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,660
Very well. At least you know your place.

401
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,420
I'll let it slide.

402
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:28,820
Walk on.

403
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,860
Are you all right, Si?

404
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,740
I'm fine, Zhan.

405
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:42,700
Why

406
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,180
did you apologize to her?

407
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,140
They are both women,

408
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,340
yet they're so different.

409
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,620
One is arrogant and ridiculous,

410
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,820
while the other is courteous,

411
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,300
composed, and beautiful.

412
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,700
I believe

413
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,700
this young lady

414
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,780
only humbled herself

415
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,340
to keep her brother safe.

416
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,220
She's truly admirable.

417
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,460
Are you saying

418
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,300
I'm inferior to her?

419
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,740
I...

420
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,060
Stop right there!

421
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,220
Stop right there!

422
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:21,980
How dare you!

423
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,660
As the princess of Zhou,

424
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,140
you recklessly rode through the city

425
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,020
and caused injuries.

426
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,660
You should be punished with caning.

427
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,460
Who are you to arrest me?

428
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,660
Let go.

429
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,340
I'm the Commandant
of the Capital Administration Office.

430
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,340
I'll take her back first.

431
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,220
Remember to eat this.

432
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,500
Let go!

433
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,700
Great!

434
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,740
Great!

435
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,740
Great!

436
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,020
[Main Hall]
My daughter was ignorant.

437
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,340
[Capital Administration Office]
Thank you, Commandant Yu.

438
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,500
I'll discipline her properly.

439
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,740
I won't impose further.

440
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,620
I shall take my leave.

441
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,420
That man is unbelievable.

442
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,940
How dare he arrest me.

443
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,220
He'll have to pay for this.

444
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,300
Father,

445
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,380
you're the Great General of Bulwark.

446
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,700
Does he deserve your apology?

447
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,260
Mingyue.

448
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,820
If you make mischief again,

449
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,580
I'll hand you over

450
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,940
to your mother.

451
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,260
Can't you behave?

452
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,860
I'm sorry.

453
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,420
Father, don't be angry.

454
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,460
Come here.

455
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,420
Your Highness.

456
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,700
Who were those two

457
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,740
who confronted me

458
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,580
earlier?

459
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,500
Your Highness,

460
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,820
they are the young master and young lady

461
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,740
of the Count of Dongping's Mansion.

462
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,700
Count of Dongping's Mansion?

463
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,650
[Count of Dongping's Mansion]

464
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,420
Aman, listen.

465
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,780
From today on,

466
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,140
I'll examine

467
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,900
every meal for Zhan

468
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,820
before you serve them.

469
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,260
Aside from you and me,

470
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,020
no one else should touch them.

471
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,660
Understood?

472
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,180
Understood.

473
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,180
Good. They're safe.

474
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,140
Take them to him.

475
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,380
Chief, did you follow Jiang Si

476
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,300
to Tianxiang Pleasure House?

477
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,020
What did you find?

478
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,820
Is she the Saintess?

479
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,100
Do we need to take action?

480
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,580
She is neither the Saintess

481
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,980
nor a member of the Nightingale Sect.

482
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,380
As for the emblem on her,

483
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,500
she has no idea how she got it.

484
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,460
Could she be conspiring with someone

485
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,100
to deceive us?

486
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,220
I trust her.

487
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,540
Go to Tianxiang Pleasure House
and keep an eye on Liu Yan'er.

488
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,900
She's a member of the Nightingale Sect.

489
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:52,980
Miss.

490
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,580
Remove my nameplate.

491
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,220
I'm not receiving guests for now.

492
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,340
Yes.

493
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,300
Miss,

494
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,380
what would you like to drink?

495
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:14,860
Sir,

496
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,620
a cup of tea, please.

497
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,100
All right.

498
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,060
A cup of tea.

499
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,620
A cup of light tea.

500
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,420
Here's your tea.

501
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,060
Thank you.

502
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,620
Miss, would you like some tea?

503
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:28,940
Yes.

504
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,780
Wontons and noodles for sale!

505
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,180
Fresh wontons and noodles.

506
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:58,720
Wontons. Generous filling
wrapped in thin skin.

507
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,060
Please have a look.

508
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,420
Miss, have a look.

509
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,420
Have a look at this wind chime.

510
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,460
Where did she go?

511
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,460
Freshly made iced glutinous rice balls!

512
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,380
Please have a look.

513
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,980
Freshly made iced glutinous rice balls!

514
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,540
Please have a look.

515
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,020
Freshly made iced glutinous rice balls!

516
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,710
Sir.

517
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,020
What would you like, Miss?

518
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,300
I'll have a bowl
of iced glutinous rice balls.

519
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,700
All right, please wait a moment.

520
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,460
It'll be served soon.

521
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,780
Here you are. Iced glutinous rice balls.

522
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,620
Thank you.

523
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,620
Please enjoy, Miss.

524
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,580
Sir,

525
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,180
do you know
the Count of Dongping's Mansion

526
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,940
on this street?

527
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,180
I do.

528
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,060
I've been doing business here

529
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,100
for years.

530
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,060
Why do you ask?

531
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,860
Nothing. Just curious.

532
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,100
Have they

533
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,740
always lived here,

534
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,300
or did they move from the south?

535
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,220
They've been here

536
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,300
for generations.

537
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,780
They aren't newcomers here.

538
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,500
Do you know Miss Si from the mansion?

539
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,980
That's very kind of you, Miss.

540
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,380
You don't have to do this.

541
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,700
You mean Jiang Si, right?

542
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,900
She often comes here with her brother

543
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,860
to buy drinks.

544
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,220
Was she born and raised

545
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,180
in the Count of Dongping's Mansion?

546
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:31,860
Yes.

547
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,260
She was born and raised here.

548
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,540
You know what?

549
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,460
She has a mind of her own.

550
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,620
The most popular fragrance store

551
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,340
in Ling'an

552
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,620
belongs to her.

553
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,580
What's the name of the store?

554
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,020
Lushengxiang.

555
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,950
[Lushengxiang Store]

556
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,220
[Lushengxiang Store]

557
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,340
I didn't expect Zhao Yu's skills

558
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,780
to be very well my equal.

559
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,740
Some of the scents

560
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,340
are actually my formulas.

561
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,820
But how did she know about them?

562
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,060
She asked me about the Saintess.

563
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,100
Could it be

564
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,340
that she is the Saintess herself?

565
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,220
Which explains why she knows everything.

566
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,300
If she is the Saintess,

567
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,540
why is she concealing her identity

568
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,980
from the Nightingale Sect?

569
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,420
The northern border is far away.

570
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,620
It'll be a long trip

571
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,100
if I want to verify her identity.

572
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,500
I must find a way to figure it out

573
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,460
as quickly as possible.

574
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,940
[Princess Royal's Mansion]

575
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,780
Yu Qi
from the Capital Administration Office

576
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,620
is the Seventh Prince?

577
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,060
Yes.

578
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,420
His Majesty isn't aware

579
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,020
that he has returned to Ling'an, is he?

580
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:13,660
No.

581
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,940
If Yu Qi claims his status

582
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,180
as a prince,

583
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,140
it'll be troublesome.

584
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,460
We need to plan ahead.

585
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,900
Yu Qi is a prince?

586
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,580
We can make good use

587
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,330
of the fact that he defied
the imperial decree

588
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,380
to return here.

589
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,380
Mr. Cui.

590
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,500
Dear.

591
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,300
Is this how you discipline
your daughter?

592
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,500
She must stop behaving

593
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,900
so arrogantly.

594
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,460
What happened?

595
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,410
What happened, you ask?

596
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,180
Mingyue almost injured someone

597
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,460
while riding earlier today.

598
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,900
Not only did she refuse
to admit her fault,

599
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,860
but she even whipped
the innocent people.

600
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,420
The Capital Administration Office
caught her in the act.

601
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,820
If I hadn't intervened,

602
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,980
she would've been caned by now.

603
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,090
Mingyue is my precious daughter.

604
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,740
How could they
have the nerve to hurt her?

605
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,740
Look at yourself.

606
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,380
Look at yourself.

607
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,740
It is exactly this attitude of yours

608
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,260
that has spoiled her.

609
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,740
What rights do you have

610
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,660
to lecture me?

611
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,660
You claim I've spoiled Mingyue?

612
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,060
Have you ever truly cared about us

613
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,980
all these years?

614
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,660
Aren't you still

615
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,180
hanging up

616
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,180
on the wretched woman
from the Count of Dongping's Mansion?

617
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,740
Rong Yang, after all these years,

618
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,500
why are you still dwelling on

619
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,780
the Count of Dongping's Mansion?

620
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,500
Isn't it true?

621
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,900
You scared me.

622
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,540
Your Highness.

623
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,780
Keep it down.

624
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,660
Your Highness,

625
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,660
how could you eavesdrop?

626
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,820
[Nanny Xu]
You'll be in trouble

627
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,900
if Her Highness finds out.

628
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,940
Stop nagging.

629
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,620
Tell me.

630
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,940
Is the wretched woman

631
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,660
who drives my parents apart

632
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,580
from the Count of Dongping's Mansion?

633
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,420
I... I don't know.

634
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,500
Spare me the lies.

635
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,700
You're my mother's wet nurse.

636
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,860
You know everything about her.

637
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,580
Tell me.

638
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,660
I won't tell Mother.

639
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,770
Your Highness, she is

640
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,740
a pain in the neck of Her Highness.

641
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:29,860
She...

642
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,660
Please stop asking.

643
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,140
If you don't tell me,

644
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,860
I'll find out myself.

645
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,260
Oh, Your Highness.

646
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,500
That wretched woman has long been dead.

647
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,860
She's dead?

648
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,300
Zhan.

649
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,660
How's your progress
with the military book?

650
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,540
I've already mastered it.

651
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,860
Here, Zhan.

652
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,700
Si,

653
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,300
I don't need medicine.

654
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,460
If you truly care about me,

655
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,380
can you let me get some sleep?

656
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,340
This isn't medicine. It's a tonic.

657
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,620
You must take it before breakfast.

658
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,020
Your breakfast will be served soon.

659
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,860
Tonic?

660
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,540
No.

661
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,940
You've been acting strangely

662
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,340
these days.

663
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,820
I'm perfectly fine.

664
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,740
But why did you

665
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,660
bring in a physician for me?

666
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,900
Besides, the physician has said

667
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,180
I'm in excellent health

668
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,860
and can easily live up
to be 88 years old.

669
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,700
This tonic is also from the physician.

670
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,860
It's not for illness.

671
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,300
It helps strengthen your body.

672
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,260
Zhan, I woke up before dawn

673
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,260
to prepare the tonic for you.

674
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,900
No wonder you have dark circles
under your eyes.

675
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,580
Fine, I'll have it.

676
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,620
Have it while it's warm.

677
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,500
It may taste bitter.

678
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,700
Here's some candied fruit.

679
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,060
Here, take one.

680
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,780
Come on. Take one more sip.

681
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,460
More?

682
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,100
One more sip.

683
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,540
By the way, Zhan,

684
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,860
please stay at the mansion

685
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,260
for this month.

686
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,220
A whole month?

687
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,740
If you have nothing else to do,

688
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,300
it's best

689
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,500
if you stay in your own abode.

690
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,300
Wait.

691
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,130
You don't have a fever,

692
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,820
but why are you talking nonsense?

693
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,820
You want me to stay here
for a whole month?

694
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,140
You might as well kill me.

695
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,100
That would be easier.

696
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,020
What are you talking about?

697
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,740
Enough with

698
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,860
your ominous talk.

699
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,820
Touch wood. That doesn't count.

700
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,380
Si,

701
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,780
why are you angry?

702
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,100
I'm not angry.

703
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:54,940
Zhan,

704
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,540
since we were kids,

705
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,300
I've never really asked anything of you,

706
00:33:59,340 --> 00:33:59,740
right?

707
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,940
I beg you this time.

708
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,060
Just one month.

709
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,380
Stay home and practice

710
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,500
martial arts with Master Qin

711
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,940
or study military books

712
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,060
for one month.

713
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:08,980
After that,

714
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,659
you can go

715
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:10,340
wherever you want.

716
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,620
I won't stop you.

717
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,620
But I've already worked very hard.

718
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,219
Staying home for the entire month

719
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,820
is a tall order.

720
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,179
Zhan, you see,

721
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,540
in one month's time,

722
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,179
it'll be
the Imperial Insignia Guards selection.

723
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,739
If you make it in,

724
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:30,179
I'll be able

725
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,620
to marry anyone I want to

726
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,420
without compromise.

727
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,699
Zhan, please do me this favor

728
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,139
for the sake of my marriage

729
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,580
and lifelong happiness.

730
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,139
All right?

731
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,860
Just one month.

732
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:46,940
All right.

733
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:49,940
You're the best, Zhan.

734
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,100
My Lady, breakfast is ready.

735
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,820
Zhan, you can eat now.

736
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,139
I was just starting
to feel a bit hungry.

737
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:55,980
By the way, Zhan,

738
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,820
I've already informed Grandmother

739
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,740
that you'll be having your meals

740
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,460
in your own room from now on.

741
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,940
You don't have to dine
with everyone else.

742
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,900
Why not?

743
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,700
Zhan, here.

744
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,500
Eat some eggs.

745
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,260
Wait.

746
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,140
I...

747
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,020
Aman.

748
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,500
Why?

749
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,740
Aman, lock the door.

750
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,700
Lock the door?

751
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,170
Wait, Si.

752
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,700
You can't do this to me.

753
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,460
You can't lock the door!

754
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,820
Si!

755
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,220
[Chief Secretary Lin,
Zhen Heng's fellow scholar]

756
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:18,860
Yan.

757
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,220
Mister, please have some tea.

758
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,180
These two

759
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,620
are such a perfect match.

760
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,460
Finally, I'm out.

761
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,020
It's been so boring these days.

762
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,460
Master Qin Feng!

763
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,380
What brings you here?

764
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,860
I've missed you so much, Master Qin.

765
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,540
Master Qin.

766
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,620
[Master Qin]
It's been a while, Zhan.

767
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,620
You've grown so much.

768
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,780
I nearly didn't recognize you.

769
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,020
Of course.

770
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,900
I'm handsome

771
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,060
and charming now.

772
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,100
Aji,

773
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,060
hurry and prepare some dishes.

774
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:18,740
I must have a good drink

775
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,500
with Master Qin.

776
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,220
Got it.

777
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,500
Why did you come here, Master Qin?

778
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,820
I just returned to Ling'an,

779
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,580
and Miss Si came to me

780
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,460
and asked me to train you every day.

781
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,500
So, starting today,

782
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,700
you'll wake up at the hour of Yin

783
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:33,940
to practice martial arts with me.

784
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,220
It helps strengthen your body.

785
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,180
What time again?

786
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,380
At the hour of Yin every day.

787
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,740
Let me count it.

788
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,020
The sequence goes as Zi, Chou, Yin...

789
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,580
Since Miss Si has entrusted you to me,

790
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,780
I can't let her down.

791
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,540
Master Qin, you may not know this...

792
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,420
You're home, Si.

793
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,140
Master Qin.

794
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,860
This brat.

795
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,260
Do you think

796
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,300
you can run away from this?

797
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:06,940
Thank you so much

798
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,300
for today.

799
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,020
Don't mention it.

800
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,100
We'll take our leave.

801
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:18,740
Sure.

802
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:39,410
[Wang's Matchmaking Agency]

803
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,580
Thank you, Madam Zhen.

804
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,020
Please sit, Miss Si.

805
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:18,820
Sure.

806
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,660
I'm doing this

807
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,340
because of you.

808
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,620
Otherwise,

809
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,580
with her temperament,

810
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,740
I wouldn't have bothered.

811
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,780
Thank you, Madam Zhen.

812
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,700
Thank you, Mr. Zhen.

813
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,540
Actually, Pei

814
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,980
was influenced by others.

815
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,380
She's kind by nature.

816
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,940
She was merely led astray
because of bad influences.

817
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,380
If she can really

818
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,860
marry Chief Secretary Lin,

819
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,940
I believe she'll change.

820
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,860
Chief Secretary Lin

821
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,140
is quite particular

822
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,460
when choosing a wife.

823
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,500
I never expected

824
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,660
he would like your cousin

825
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,260
at the first meeting.

826
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,540
Guess fate really

827
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,860
brings people together.

828
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,140
Miss, the tea is ready.

829
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,380
Both of you

830
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,380
are of age

831
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,820
but remain single,

832
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,300
yet you're busy

833
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,780
matchmaking for others.

834
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,180
Why don't you consider

835
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,460
your own future?

836
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,540
Mother.

837
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,500
Please have some tea, Madam.

838
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:22,860
Madam,

839
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,580
allow me

840
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,740
to treat you to this tea.

841
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,100
Why?

842
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,900
Are you trying to brush me off

843
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,940
with this tea?

844
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,460
It's not that easy.

845
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:38,860
Excuse me.

846
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,260
Coming.

847
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,900
I heard there are fresh tea leaves
drying in the backyard.

848
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,780
Take me there.

849
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,020
This way, please.

850
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,380
Miss Jiang,

851
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,300
do you

852
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,380
want more?

853
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,620
I'll do it myself, Mr. Zhen.

854
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,980
It's fine. Let me.

855
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,420
Thank you.

856
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,580
What do you think?

857
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,540
The man I introduced is decent, right?

858
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,260
He has an elegant look.

859
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,700
However,

860
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,060
he's only a sixth-rank official.

861
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,740
Our family

862
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,860
is of noble rank, after all.

863
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,740
It's just titular, though.

864
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,180
You know the current status

865
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,100
of our family very well.

866
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,740
We may not be able to keep this honor.

867
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,460
A sixth-rank official may be minor,

868
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,060
but he holds real power.

869
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,780
If you find the right husband,

870
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,980
you won't be hopeless

871
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,020
for the rest of your life.

872
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,060
I thought you'd have expected more,
Madam Ruan.

873
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,900
Your mother did.

874
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,380
She was so ambitious

875
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:53,980
that she married Qian

876
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,100
into a prominent family.

877
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,740
But look how that turned out.

878
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,460
You see that yourself.

879
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,380
One can't be greedy

880
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,620
and demand more than they deserve.

881
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,660
You must stop

882
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,140
expecting more.

883
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,660
Pei,

884
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,740
listen to me.

885
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,910
If you miss this man,

886
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,950
you may not get another.

887
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:16,660
Chief.

888
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,220
I lost track of Liu Yan'er last night.

889
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,500
She removed her nameplate

890
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,540
and disguised herself before going out.

891
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,900
She only went
to some ordinary marketplaces.

892
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,140
Nothing unusual.

893
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,340
But she is rather cautious.

894
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,220
She doesn't act like a mere courtesan.

895
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,780
Don't follow too closely.

896
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,100
Otherwise, our efforts will turn futile.

897
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,420
Yes, sir.

898
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,020
It's Miss Jiang.

899

Miss Jiang,

900
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,740
don't call me Mr. Zhen

outside the office.

902
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,660
It makes us sound like strangers.

903
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,240

00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,010
