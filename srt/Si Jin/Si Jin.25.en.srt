136
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,480
Perhaps we should savor it
while it's hot?

137
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,960
I was just about to say,

138
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,070
this soup contains pepper.

139

Its color looks mild and soothing,

140

so I'm honored to have a taste today.

145
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,310
But I didn't expect

That may not be appropriate.

154
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,360
Why not?

There's no need to hurry.

160
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,720
I harbor no such intentions.

161
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,960
I do, then.

162
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,990

163

Remove the screen.

164
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,310
That's not proper.

165
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,160
The dance of candlelight
has always flattered true beauty.

166
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,190
A hint of mystery
amplifies the attraction.

167
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,110
The screen conceals not her looks

168
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,400
but her charm.

169
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,990
I must see her appearance for myself!

170
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,110
Remove it!

Tall, graceful, and poised.

174
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,670
No wonder your name is well-known.

175
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,190
Reward her.

176
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,720
Serve her a plate of houttuynia relish.

177
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,720
The houttuynia is white.

178
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,230
The sauce is red.

179
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,600
The garnish is green.

180
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,630
The colors are vibrant and appetizing.

181
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,160
But the taste…

182
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,040
Since I have received
Your Highness' reward,

183
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,800
it is only proper

184
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,720
that I return the favor.

The Crown Prince,
as the heir to the throne,

186
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,190
has first failed to show care
for his brothers

187
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,550
and then failed
to show kindness to a lady.

188
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,110
Thus, I present Your Highness

189
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,110
with a plate of assorted sweets,

190
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,600
to help Your Highness

191
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,600
grow some wits.

192
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,360
Jiang Si!

193
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,310
And another.

194
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,400
I also offer Your Highness
a cup of clear liquor.

195
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,240
So Your Highness may use the liquid

196
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,920
as a mirror to reflect upon yourself.

197
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,120
How dare you, Jiang Si!

198
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,549
You are in no position to reprimand me!

199
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,590
Yu Jin!

200
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,070
Well, well.

201
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Right in front of all the noble ladies,

202
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,520
you've put on quite the show.

203
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
The princes are at an age

204
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,670
full of youthful vigor.

205
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
A moment's impulse

206
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
should not be enough

207
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,190
to break the harmony between brothers.

208
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,000
Very well. Let me hear

209
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,830
who acted on impulse first,

210
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,640
and for what reason.

211
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,590
It wasn't me.

212
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,710
I even tried to break up the fight.

213
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,760
I didn't get involved.

214
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,040
Zhang.

215
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,550
Yes, Father.

216
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,000
This is all your fault.

217
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,710
Is this the kind of banquet you planned?

218
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,000
I will accept my punishment.

219
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,040
Zhang has always been proper
and well-mannered.

220
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,470
He arranged this banquet
to welcome Yu Jin

221
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,590
with good intentions.

222
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,800
He never expected things

223
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,920
to turn out like this.

224
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
He is innocent.

225
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,160
I ask Your Majesty to reconsider.

226
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,880
Crown Prince,

227
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,430
is this the example you set

228
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,190
for the world?

229
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,760
It was Yu Jin who defied his superior

230
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,190
and openly attacked me.

231
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,190
He removed the screen

232
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,950
and made inappropriate comments
about a young lady.

233
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,350
He was the one
who disrespected at first.

234
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,830
Jiang Si
from Count of Dongping's Mansion

235
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,350
insulted me…

236
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,280
You were the one who provoked her.

237
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,760
Enough!

238
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,000
Do you know

239
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,160
what the imperial family
is most wary of?

240
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,430
Brothers turning against each other.

241
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,160
History is full

242
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,070
of tragic lessons.

243
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,590
Beyond being brothers,
you are also subject and ruler.

244
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,430
You are not behaving as brothers should.

245
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,470
Will you one day

246
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,800
disregard your roles
as subject and ruler as well?

247
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,550
- I dare not.
- I admit my mistake.

248
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,550
You must be severely punished

249
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,710
to ensure you never forget this lesson.

250
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,040
Refer to the palace rules.

251
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,950
Find the harshest punishment for them.

252
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,240
Your Majesty.

253
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,040
The other princes can be punished

254
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,310
according to the law.

255
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,430
But the Seventh Prince…

256
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,240
What about Jin?

257
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,000
The Seventh Prince
holds no official rank.

258
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,950
What of it?

259
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,000
The laws of the palace

260
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,710
apply to all members
of the imperial family.

261
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,240
The Seventh Prince is not listed
in the jade records,

262
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,520
nor has he been granted a title.

263
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,280
So

264
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,520
he is not officially part
of the imperial family.

265
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,190
How dare you!

266
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,000
Are you saying

267
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,240
I cannot punish my own son?

268
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,640
It is not within the law, Your Majesty.

269
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,550
Fine.

270
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,830
Tell me,

271
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,950
which title has yet to be used?

272
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,040
Yan.

273
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,920
Then I shall confer him
the title of Prince Yan.

274
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,670
Now, I can punish him!

275
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,400
I obey Your Majesty's decree.

276
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,350
Your Majesty,

277
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,070
this is a serious matter...

278
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Your sons have made mistakes.

279
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,240
As their mother,
you, too, bear responsibility.

280
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,240
All of you must reflect on this.

281
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,880
That is all. Everyone may leave.

282
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,950
- I'll take my leave.
-I'll take my leave.

283
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,400
You promised me

284
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,280
I could continue to be Yu Qi.

285
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,830
But you went back on your word.

286
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,400
I just made you Prince Yan,

287
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,470
and you're still not happy?

288
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,640
"A longing for quiet,
amidst relentless chaos."

289
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,280
You wish to stay in Ling'an

290
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,120
while avoiding conflict.

291
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,950
I'm afraid you can't have both.

292
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,670
You've seen it for yourself.

293
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,470
The palace is full of people

294
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,040
who flatter the high
and trample the low.

295
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,120
Lacking the weight of a title,

296
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
how would you shield yourself

297
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,950
and those you hold dear?

298
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
I do not care about these things.

299
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,040
But I do.

300
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,880
All right. You may go.

301
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,160
Carry yourself with caution from now on.

302
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,710
After all, you are now Prince Yan.

303
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,470
Thank you, Father.

304
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,920
I respectfully bid farewell
to Your Highness.

305
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,760
This incident came at the perfect time.

306
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,710
Your Majesty is wise.

307
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,760
Your Majesty.

308
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,310
It's raining!

309
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,800
The dry spell has lasted so long.

310
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,920
The rain couldn't have come
at a better time.

311
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,430
Jin has been

312
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,040
a burden to me
since the day he was born.

313
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,070
I never thought
he'd still bring trouble as an adult.

314
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:11,880
May your anger be appeased,

315
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,640
Mother.

316
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,190
Don't let this affect your health.

317
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,240
Please sit down.

318
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,430
No matter what,

319
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,670
Yu Jin is my younger brother

320
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,800
and your son.

321
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,670
He is accursed!

322
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,550
It was written in his fate from birth.

323
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,070
But it seems Father no longer cares

324
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,120
about this matter.

325
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,590
Otherwise, why would he use

326
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,520
our punishment

327
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,950
as an excuse to confer him

328
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,310
the title of Prince Yan instead?

329
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,310
When Jin returned
to the capital without permission,

330
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,310
Father barely punished him

331
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
and never mentioned it again.

332
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,800
His Majesty's mind is unpredictable.

333
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,190
Today, he raised Jin's status.

334
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,120
Tomorrow,

335
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,240
he could just as easily

336
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,800
place all the blame on him.

337
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,670
Zhang.

338
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,550
Do you understand?

339
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,190
I will simply distance myself
from Yu Jin.

340
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:10,800
No.

341
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,670
With his new title,

342
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,710
we must proceed with utmost propriety.

343
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,240
We cannot afford to give anyone cause

344
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,070
to accuse us of impropriety.

345
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,070
I will do as you advise.

346
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,670
It is pouring.

347
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,710
Maybe we should come back another day?

348
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,430
Is this the place?

349
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,590
I think so.

350
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,590
Knock on the door.

351
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,240
No… No one answered.

352
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,640
Could you not use more force?

353
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,350
Move aside!

354
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,280
Well, this is unfortunate.

355
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,520
He's not home?

356
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,800
Father,
why don't we come back another day?

357
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:12,920
You're right.

358
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,880
I was too rash.

359
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,800
Thinking about it carefully,

360
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,950
we should gather more information

361
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,310
about Yu's background first.

362
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,190
Yes.

363
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,120
Father, he is close with Mr. Zhen

364
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,350
from the Capital Administration Office.

365
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,000
Perhaps

366
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
we should ask around there?

367
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,160
Good idea.

368
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,800
Let's go now!

369
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,240
Now?

370
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,920
Father!

371
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,430
This downpour is quite severe.

372
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
Is this really necessary?

373
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,640
Please have some tea, Your Lordship.

374
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,800
Thank you.

375
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,950
Mr. Zhen.

376
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,040
I came here today

377
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,470
to ask you about something.

378
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,040
By all means, ask away.

379
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,640
All right.

380
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,120
You and he both serve
at the Capital Administration Office.

381
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,070
You must be familiar

382
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,640
with Commandant Yu's family background.

383
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,040
Are you not aware

384
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,190
of his true identity?

385
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,590
I haven't looked into it in detail.

386
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,160
I've only heard

387
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,310
that he is from a prestigious clan.

388
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,310
But there are

389
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,160
many descendants in his family,

390
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,120
and he isn't highly regarded.

391
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,520
So he had to rely on himself
to make a living.

392
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,000
Is that what you've heard?

393
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,710
Mr. Zhen,

394
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,280
is there something
you're not telling us?

395
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,000
Mr. Zhan, please have a seat.

396
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,590
Mr. Zhen, you are honest

397
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,880
and trustworthy.

398
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,470
This matter is very important to me.

399
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,280
Please do not hide anything from us.

400
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,040
The tea has gone cold.

401
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,670
Let me pour you some hot tea.

402
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,480
Please, Your Lordship.

403
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,800
Thank you.

404
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:19,390
Mr. Zhan.

405
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm good.

406
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,760
Mr. Zhen, why don't you just tell us?

407
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,910
Yes.

408
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,240
His identity

409
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,630
might be a little different

410
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,720
from what you imagined.

411
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,200
Different?

412
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,200
Is he

413
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,150
not actually

414
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,280
from a prestigious clan?

415
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,590
No.

416
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,070
Or is he

417
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,960
an orphan with no parents?

418
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,000
Mr. Zhen.

419
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,720
Why such a big reaction?

420
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,480
Even if we guessed correctly,

421
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,910
it's not a big deal.

422
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,480
Yes.

423
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,720
As long as he has a good character,

424
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,070
his roots matter little.

425
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,150
Your Lordship.

426
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,000
Mr. Zhen.

427
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,240
Even if Yu were left with nothing

428
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
but his own company,

429
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,680
he would still be

430
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,720
my good friend.

431
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,680
Mr. Zhen.

432
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,720
Please enlighten us

433
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,830
on Commandant Yu's background.

434
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,520
Fret not.

435
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,150
We can handle the truth.

436
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:26,830
Yes, we can.

437
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,350
Are you certain, Your Lordship?

438
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,240
Of course.

439
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,280
Yes.

440
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,150
We can.

441
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,630
Commandant Yu

442
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,280
is...

443
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,800
His Majesty's seventh son.

444
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,200
Prince Yan.

445
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,390
He is Prince Yan.

446
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:07,800
Father?

447
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,110
Give me a moment.

448
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,240
Your Lordship, are you

449
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,830
all right?

450
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,110
Mr. Zhen,

451
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,350
you must be joking

452
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,440
with us.

453
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,440
Yes.

454
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,440
Your Lordship. Mr. Zhan.

455
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,680
This isn't a joke

456
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,240
I can afford to make.

457
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,800
Yu, that liar!

458
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:41,960
What's wrong, Your Lordship?

459
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,630
That liar!

460
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,040
Your Lordship!

461
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,310
Father!

462
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,720
Father!

463
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,200
Wait for me!

464
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:52,760
Good heavens!

465
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,590
That was close!

466
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,200
Did you just say that a prince

467
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,830
was left with nothing

468
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,870
but his own company?

469
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,870
You were the one
who said he was an orphan!

470
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,960
Father!

471
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,070
Well,

472
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,000
now there's no need to worry

473
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,000
about Si marrying
into a high-ranking family.

474
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,520
No matter how high they are,

475
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,000
they won't be higher than Yu.

476
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,350
That's true.

477
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,720
But if she marries
into an ordinary family

478
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,720
and things go wrong,

479
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,960
she can at least get a separation
and leave.

480
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,350
If she marries into the imperial family,

481
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,680
she will be at their mercy!

482
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:36,910
What should we do, then?

483
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,960
We can't let Si

484
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,200
fall into this misery!

485
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,590
Let's hurry home and think of a plan!

486
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,440
Let's go!

487
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,800
No one's answering the door.

488
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,480
And there's no doorman.

489
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,390
We'll just have to wait.

490
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,080
[Haitang House]

491
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,200
My Lady, why don't you sit

492
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,070
and have some water?

493
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,350
He assaulted the Crown Prince
because of me.

494
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,040
I wonder how His Majesty
will punish him.

495
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,480
Are you waiting for news about Yu…

496
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,870
about His Highness?

497
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,630
Who said I was waiting for his news?

498
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,520
It's just that this matter started

499
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,520
because of me.

500
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,590
He assaulted the Crown Prince.

501
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,200
If His Majesty punishes him,

502
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,830
and something really happens to him,

503
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,350
then I'll owe him.

504
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,590
Aman, leave us.

505
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,280
Then you should owe me more.

506
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,150
That way,
you won't be able to ignore me.

507
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,960
It appears you're fine, after all.

508
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,680
Indeed.

509
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,150
His Majesty cares
about Your Highness very much.

510
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,200
Wait.

511
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,680
His Majesty made me Prince Yan.

512
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,720
I see.

513
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,960
My congratulations to you,
Your Highness.

514
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,520
Hiding my identity from you
was never my intention.

515
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,720
I never saw it as something important.

516
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,870
Being a prince and receiving a title,

517
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,960
I didn't think
it would affect you and me.

518
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,310
But I did overlook

519
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,480
your feelings.

520
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,440
I know

521
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,830
you only want to protect your family

522
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,870
and live an ordinary life.

523
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,590
I want the same.

524
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,870
But I can only protect you

525
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,000
if I first secure my own position.

526
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:24,760
From now on,

527
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,720
you will be the first

528
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,240
to know everything from me,

529
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,390
without delay.

530
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,310
Who wants to know everything about you?

531
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,550
I have better things to do.

532
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,200
But there is one thing

533
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,590
you must know.

534
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,440
What is it?

535
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:42,870
I have feelings for you.

536
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,200
My heart yearns

537
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,760
for Miss Jiang Si

538
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:47,870

I may have been granted a title,

but I am still

That's not what I meant.

553

you only wish to be Yu Qi,

your princely identity

00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,150
remains beyond your grasp.

Well,

The fabrics they bought

646

weren't to my liking.

647

and scolded them a little.

649

What can I do about it?

656
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,630
Even so, you shouldn't have encouraged

657

the Crown Prince
to visit Prince Qi's Mansion.

658
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,390
Although it was unfair to Lang,

Yu Jin benefited from it

660
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,390
and was granted a title.

Doesn't that make him
a perfect match for me?

662
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,310
He carries an ill-fated destiny.

663

just your own feelings

680
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,240
can win a man's heart?

Your Highness.

757
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,760
Your Highness, Zhen Heng
of the Capital Administration Office,

758
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,240
greets you.

759

Mr. Zhen.

760
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,800
What brings you here?

761
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,640
I heard

762
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,160
that Your Highness was moving
into your new residence today.

763
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,560
I came to offer my congratulations.

Are you

765
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,080
out of your mind?

766
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,800
My mind is fine,

767
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,030
but I am rather anxious.

768
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,600
Your Highness has shown me
great kindness.

769
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,680
I will meet

771
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,080
I am willing to serve you

with unwavering loyalty.

773

Bring them in.

774

is made
of the finest Tao River green stone.

Please look here.

781
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,310
This round musk ink,

782
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:02,080
glossy as lacquer,
its fragrance penetrates to the bone,

783
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,640
a true treasure among treasures.

784
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,830
Now, look at this.

785
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,910
This azure glazed ewer

and gold-inlaid lotus box

787

788

for Your Highness.

789
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,240
What's gotten into Mr. Zhen?

790
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,200
He has lost his mind.

791
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:15,990
Oh, right.

792
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,510
I have one more gift.

793
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,870
A gold jewel-encrusted

794
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,640
little turtle.

795
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,310
These are

796
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,600
my humble offerings.

797
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,430
May Your Highness accept them.

798
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,560
I appreciate your devotion.

799
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,200
It would be a shame

800
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,910
not to accept such generous gifts.

801
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,510
It is my greatest honor.

802
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,390
All right.

803
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,030
Enough with the flattery.

804
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,350
I was once so imprudent

805
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,160
as to jest with you.

806
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,640
But now,

807
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,800
I wouldn't dare.

808
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,680
[Count of Dongping's Mansion]

809
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,470
Commandant Xie,
why have you come to Ling'an?

810
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,080
I resigned from my post in Lingshui.

811
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,990
I plan to settle in Ling'an.

812
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:28,910
Why?

813
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,560
Miss Jiang,

814
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,720
do you genuinely not know?

815
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,720
You are outstanding and heroic.

816
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,950
Whether in Lingshui or Ling'an,

817
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,160
noble ladies surround you.

818
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,830
You shouldn't waste your time on…

819
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,720
I let go once before.

820
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,910
I refuse to lose it again.

821
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,680
She is the only woman I wish to marry.

822
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,720
You know that.

823
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,200
I have already decided.

824
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,640
I will not marry again.

825
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,510
Since coming home,

826
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:19,990
I've found solace
in my family's presence.

827
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,030
Watching Yan grow day by day,

828
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,950
my life is simple and peaceful.

829
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,870
I don't have to please anyone.

830
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,240
I am content

831
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,150
with my life.

832
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,420
[Jiang]

833
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,830
I wish to continue like this.

834
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,160
I'm sorry, Commandant Xie.

835
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,870
I was too abrupt.

836
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,350
I only thought of expressing my feelings

837
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,430
without first asking

838
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,600
how you felt.

839
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,430
You are living well now.

840
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,470
I am happy for you.

841
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,030
I waited in Lingshui for seven years.

842
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,240
I don't mind waiting another seven.

843
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,510
If you change your mind,

844
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,510
I will always be here.

845
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,120
Princess Fuqing.

846
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,990
Your Highness, please keep this well.

847
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,430
It's you.

848
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,240
Yes.

849
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,680
I'm honored
that Your Highness remembered.

850
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,760

851
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,760

Eunuch Liu.

853
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,080
Mr. Zhen?

854
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:07,560
Thank you.

855
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,200
You need not thank me, Your Highness.

856
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,280
Your Highness,

857
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,200
please stop playing
with that bamboo bird.

858
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,800
How would I explain it to His Majesty

859
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,760
if you accidentally hurt yourself?

860
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,760
I wanted to fly kites,

861
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,120
but unfortunately,
I couldn't see anything.

862
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,430
Your Highness.

863
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,470
I know of a kind of kite

864
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,680
that can speak.

865
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,120
Even if you can't see it,

866
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,310
you can still hear

867
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,910
where it flies.

868
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,240
A kite that can talk?

869
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,200
Does a kite like that really exist?

870
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,200
Yes.

871
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,640
Next time I enter the palace,

872
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:42,720
I will bring one for you.

873
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,760
Then I shall trouble you, Mr. Zhen.

874
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,120
Many thanks, Mr. Zhen.

875
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,160
It is my honor.

876
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,760
You're treating me to a meal
out of the blue.

877
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,160
Do you need something?

878
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,160
No.

879
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,640
I simply wanted

880
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,760
to treat you to a bowl of noodles.

881
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,910
Speaking of noodles,

882
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,870
I don't know why,

883
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,600
but it reminds me of my sister.

884
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,640
You may not know this,

885
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,470
but my sister actually has

886
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,760
quite a few flaws.

887
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:18,760
For example,

888
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,310
sometimes she takes things
too seriously.

889
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,310
That makes those

890
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,080
who don't take things seriously

891
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,910
feel ashamed.

892
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,990
Also,

893
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,160
she's incredibly stubborn.

894
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,640
When she sets her mind on something,

895
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,640
nothing can change it.

896
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,470
And

897
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,120
when she gets angry,

898
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,200
even I, her own brother,

899
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:31,870
am afraid of her.

900
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,240
Why are you telling me all this?

901
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,310
I want you to talk to His Highness…

902
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,280
Talk to Qi about this.

903
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,350
Try to persuade him.

904
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,950
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

905
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,950
I've heard of asking others
to speak well of them on their behalf.

906
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,280
This is my first time getting a request

907
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,240
to speak ill of someone.

908
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,800
He finally found someone

909
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,390
he loves.

910
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,720
I can't bring myself to say that.

911
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,600
I already can't win against him
in a fight.

912
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,910
Now, he's a prince with a title.

913
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,720
If he bullies my sister in the future,

914
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:09,990
who will be able to stand up for her?
