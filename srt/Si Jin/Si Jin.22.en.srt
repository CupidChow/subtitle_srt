00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,960
Let me think.

195
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,840
Right!

196
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,880
There's a young palace maid

197
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,720
from the Imperial Food Service.

198
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,240
Her name is…

199
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,510
Aling!

200
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,760
Right. It's Aling.

201
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,840
Her brother

202
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,310
also lost money at the gambling den.

203
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,390
I saw her pay off his debt

204
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,080
to redeem him with my own eyes.

205
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,670
If she's part of the escort team
during the hunt,

206
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,000
then I suspect

207
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,240
she'll tamper

208
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,080
with His Majesty's food.

209
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,430
Do you know how to assist

210
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:08,910
with a portrait?

211
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,390
Yes!

212
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,790
Good.

213
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,510
Long Dan.

214
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,390
Mr. Zhou.

215
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,200
Be careful.

216
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,200
I've made amends for my mistakes, right?

217
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,760
Please…

218
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:23,840
I'll go help with the portrait.

219
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,670
Hurry up!

220
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,880
Mind the blade…

221
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,840
This matter is of utmost importance.

222
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,960
I must report this immediately

223
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,960
to His Majesty.

224
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,000
- No.
- No.

225
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,480
We still don't know

226
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,760
how many spies the Nightingale Sect

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,510
has planted within the palace

228
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,550
using this gambling den.

229
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,430
If this report is discovered,

230
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,630
it might force them

231
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,630
to change their plans.

232
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,480
If that happens,

233
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,880
it will be even harder
to guard against them.

234
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,510
That's right.

235
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,910
The enemy is in the open,
while we are in the shadows.

236
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,630
Instead of luring them out,

237
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,760
we should lie in wait
for our chance to strike.

238
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,910
[Jiang]

239
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,120
Is that enough, Miss Qiao?

240
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,430
Just touching this water
is already so cold.

241
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,760
How can you bathe in it?

242
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,240
You did well.

243
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,670
Here. Take this.

244
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,030
Don't tell anyone.

245
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,000
Now go.

246
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,000
Thank you, Miss Qiao.

247
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,910
How is she?

248
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
Miss Qiao has fallen ill
with a fever from the cold.

249
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,910
Have her take the prescribed medicine
and keep her warm.

250
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,720
She will recover in a few days.

251
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,720
Thank you, sir.

252
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,240
Not at all.

253
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,390
How did she get so sick?

254
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,600
This isn't even

255
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,880
the kind of weather to catch a cold.

256
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,910
I need to ask you something.

257
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,270
Of all times,

258
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,150
she had to fall ill now?

259
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,960
That son from the Xiao family
is a walking medicine jar,

260
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,270
and ours is a sickly girl now too.

261
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,880
How can we possibly arrange
a marriage like this?

262
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,550
It must be Xiaoxiang Garden's plot.

263
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,200
She's running a fever at this moment.

264
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,390
Who knows

265
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,790
if it's Madam Ruan

266
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,120
who has done something?

267
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,430
She's certainly willing to go all out.

268
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,120
Should we use some strong medicine

269
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,670
to make her recover faster?

270
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,480
No need.

271
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,000
Pick out a dress

272
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,630
and some jewelry.

273
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,670
Pick the finest ones.

274
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,760
As long as she's alive,

275
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,480
she must present

276
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,080
her best self at the matchmaking event.

277
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,030
There's no way...

278
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,430
Understood.

279
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,000
I can't sort her out.

280
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,880
You couldn't have thought

281
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,200
of a better way
than to make yourself sick?

282
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,670
Madam Ruan.

283
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,080
You know what I did?

284
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,630
If the Xiao family sees

285
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,030
that I am gravely ill tomorrow,

286
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,080
they will surely be displeased.

287
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,080
If I had known

288
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,120
this was your plan,

289
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,510
I would never have let you
act recklessly.

290
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,960
I don't want to cause trouble

291
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,270
and make Grandmother and Father

292
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,670
blame you again.

293
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:29,960
It seems

294
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,630
this meeting is inevitable.

295
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,120
Since things have come to this,

296
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,240
no matter what kind of man

297
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,360
the Xiao family's young master is,

298
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,720
I refuse to be entangled with him.

299
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,150
This is the only way I can resist.

300
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,720
My poor Qiao…

301
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,480
I have failed you.

302
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,270
Madam Ruan,

303
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,600
don't say that.

304
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,790
These were prepared by Madam Xiao

305
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,120
for Miss Qiao's matchmaking tomorrow.

306
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,000
Everything is of the highest quality.

307
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,630
Qiao is already so sick.

308
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,550
Why are you

309
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,790
still only thinking about matchmaking?

310
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,240
You can't say it like that.

311
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,310
The Xiao family
is a prestigious household.

312
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,360
It is only

313
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,550
in our mansion's best interest

314
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,510
that Miss Qiao presents
the best of herself.

315
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,150
It's just a fever.

316
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,510
With proper rest tonight,

317
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,390
she'll surely recover

318
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,960
quite a bit.

319
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,360
What nonsense are you saying?

320
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,080
Madam Ruan.

321
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,120
Thank you.

322
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,240
It's a shame Pei left so soon.

323
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,630
She should have seen

324
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,670
Mother's kindness.

325
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,000
We'd see if she'd still be willing

326
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,120
to help you.

327
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,390
Help?

328
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,510
Mother.

329
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,430
Things forced never turn out well.

330
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,150
Since Qiao is unwilling,

331
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,240
please, Mother, have mercy

332
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,510
and do not force her.

333
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,430
If you ask me,

334
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,120
Miss Pei appeared
to be much more capable

335
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,600
when she returned this time.

336
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,790
I'll take my leave now.

337
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,310
I misjudged Pei.

338
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,310
I wronged her,

339
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,910
and I said so many things

340
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,030
that must have hurt her deeply.

341
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,840
She must have been heartbroken.

342
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,910
Me too.

343
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,080
I didn't even try to make her stay.

344
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,240
I thought

345
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,790
she was just misguided.

346
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,390
Looking back on it now,

347
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,390
she must have felt
so bitterly disappointed.

348
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,840
They haven't arrived.

349
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,600
What is this?

350
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,760
Miss Qiao, please rest assured.

351
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,000
The Xiao family will not be coming.

352
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,110
[A letter from Xiao Shi
to the Xiao family]

353
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,630
This is…

354
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,680
How can the Xiao family

355
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,510
fail to show up?

356
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,270
We waited an entire day,

357
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,310
and there wasn't even
a single word from them!

358
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,720
Forget it.

359
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,589
We have already done our part
with full sincerity.

360
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,440
Are we calling
the arrangement off, then?

361
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,589
Of course.

362
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,069
How could we possibly form
a marriage alliance

363
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,790
with a family that acts so conceitedly

364
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,760
even on the first meeting?

365
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,640
It's all that Xiao Shi's fault.

366
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:22,869
What kind of family did she even choose?

367
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,829
Father.

368
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,160
Please don't be angry.

369
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,920
Qiao, you've been through a lot
these past few days.

370
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,310
You are still sick.

371
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,920
Get some rest now.

372
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,270
I'm leaving.

373
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:36,720
All right.

374
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,960
Good grief.

375
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,790
This is wonderful, Madam Ruan.

376
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,870
That reminds me. Who sent this letter?

377
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,680
Please wait here.

378
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,510
I'll bring her in.

379
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,960
It's finally over.

380
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,030
It's for the best

381
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,350
that this didn't work out.

382
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,400
Madam Ruan. Qiao.

383
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,510
Pei.

384
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,550
Pei.

385
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,550
It was you?

386
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,350
Let's sit down and talk.

387
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,240
So, you didn't return
to your husband's family?

388
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,640
I stayed at an inn for a few days.

389
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,680
How could I come back to see you

390
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,030
before settling this matter?

391
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,110
Then what exactly did you do?

392
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,240
I wrote to my husband.

393
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,550
His family reached out

394
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,110
to some connections in the Xiao family

395
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,160
and learned when the letter
would be delivered.

396
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,640
They told the messenger
they would deliver it instead.

397
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,070
But in truth,

398
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,400
I had

399
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,640
the letter intercepted in secret.

400
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,870
Since the Xiao family
never received a reply,

401
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,070
they assumed that our family

402
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,200
was not interested,

403
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,510
so they never came.

404
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
I owe it all to you.

405
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,720
I can't believe I misjudged you before.

406
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,960
I'm sorry, Pei.

407
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,440
I was so blind.

408
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,870
I've been reflecting on myself

409
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,760
these past few days.

410
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I really was willful

411
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,590
and reckless.

412
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,830
I constantly caused trouble.

413
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,400
Yet you still treated me

414
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
as family.

415
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,000
So naturally,

416
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,110
I won't bear

417
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,160
a grudge this time.

418
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,240
I was also wrong.

419
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,440
Look at you two.

420
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,590
My daughters are both so good.

421
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
I didn't see things clearly
in this situation.

422
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,720
Our Pei has grown up.

423
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,790
You've gotten smarter, Pei.

424
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,870
I was never foolish to begin with.

425
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,160
I must be leaving now.

426
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,960
I came back

427
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,550
to the mansion in secret to see you two.

428
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,680
Let's just say that day,

429
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,830
I returned
to my husband's family in anger.

430
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,270
Even if one day,

431
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
the intercepted letter is discovered,

432
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,920
it will be difficult
to trace it back to me.

433
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,550
And everyone will be safe.

434
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,680
All right. We'll follow your plan.

435
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,440
You must be careful.

436
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,070
Come back whenever you can.

437
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,070
Write to us.

438
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,830
So long as our hearts remain connected,

439
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,550
we will never be apart.

440
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,200
Here. Have a fruit.

441
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,030
Is this the Nanwu language?

442
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,680
Know yourself and know the enemy,

443
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,310
and you can win every battle you fight.

444
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,480
I believe that knowing yourself

445
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,510
and your enemy is the way

446
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,960
to win without a fight.

447
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:36,920
Why?

448
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,720
There is always a winner and a loser

449
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,400
on the battlefield.

450
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,240
If Zhou and Nanwu

451
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,240
had more people like you,

452
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,350
who are willing

453
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,030
to understand both sides,

454
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,680
then perhaps old grudges
could be resolved,

455
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,640
and we could coexist peacefully.

456
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,030
Wouldn't that be a victory

457
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,920
without a battle for both sides?

458
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,240
You have great insight.

459
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,550
I've learned from you.

460
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,590
How's the fruit?

461
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:00,760
Try it.

462
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,590
You're doing well in learning to write

463
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,030
our Nanwu characters.

464
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,870
Thank you, Grand Elder.

465
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,200
Yu Qi only started
learning the Nanwu language

466
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,790
after I arrived
at the Southern Frontier.

467
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,240
How is he proficient in it already?

468
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,270
Forget it.

469
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,200
Perhaps many things

470
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,400
have already changed.

471
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,550
Tomorrow is the day

472
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,350
His Majesty participates in the hunt.

473
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,830
If Yu Qi succeeds in his plans

474
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,310
at the hunting grounds,

475
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,870
then the next step

476
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,350
will be to capture
the Nightingale Sect with full force.

477
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,000
What can I do

478
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,870
to protect Qi and the others?

479
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,440
Miss Jiang.

480
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,920
Are you about to depart?

481
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,200
Yes.

482
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,480
Take care.

483
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,720
I will.

486
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,720

State your purpose.

00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,110
Commandant Yu has ordered this lady

530

to come and question Sang Qi.

on the day Zhou Yi was interrogated.

537
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,440
So I am well aware

538

of Commandant Yu's plan.

539
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,960
I am here to interrogate Sang Qi

540

- Hey, pretty!
- Hey, pretty!

568
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,310
Please.

569
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,310
Save your efforts.

570
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,240
I won't say a single word.

571
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,350
The hard way didn't work,
so you're trying the soft way?

572
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,440
Food's ready!

573
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,830
Time to eat!

574
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,720
Si, come.

575
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,640
Let's eat.

576
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,350
Si.

577
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,510
Come on. Come here.

578
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,480
Come sit down.

579
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,480
Take a look.

580
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,110
Look what I brought you.

581
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,960
These are all delicacies
from my hometown.

582
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,830
That's right.

583
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,160
I bet you've been craving them.

584
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,240
Dig in. Eat while the food is still hot.

585
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,790
Thank you, Qi.

586
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,680
Si, I noticed

587
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,680
you've been feeling down lately.

588
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,640
You must be missing home.

589
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,000
I figured some food from your hometown

590
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,160
might soothe your homesickness.

591
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,720
Thank you, Qi.

592
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,480
But

593
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,440
where did you get

594
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,070
all this food from?

595
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,760
Oh, these?

596
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,790
I "borrowed" a few Zhou chefs

597
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,920
to cook for us.

598
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,920
"Borrowed"?

599
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:29,960
Don't worry.

600
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,350
I'll make sure

601
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,870
they return unharmed,

602
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,510
all right?

603
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:35,350
All right.

604
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,310
Qi, eat with me.

605
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:37,960
Sure.

606
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,920
Here you go, Si.

607
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,590
There's a young palace maid

608
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,440
from the Imperial Food Service.

609
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,200
Aling!

610
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,710
[Aling]

611
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,110
Listen up.

612
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,350
Torture won't work.

613
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,590
And neither

614
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,590
will seduction.

615
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,720
Answer me, Sang Qi.

616
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,310
What plans do you have

617
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,110
for His Majesty's Mid-Autumn Hunt?

618
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,550
Plans?

619
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:27,160
We plan to send that old man Jingming
to the afterlife.

620
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,550
If you tell me

621
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,440
the details of your plan,

622
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,000
maybe Commandant Yu
will spare your life.

623
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,200
Never!

624
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,000
Zhou's lapdog!

625
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,270
I will never cooperate with you!

626
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,480
Do you really not want to live?

627
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,870
I came here ready to die!

628
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,200
But have you thought about your people?

629
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,400
Your seniors?

630
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,760
That's none of your concern!

631
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,440
Insolence!

632
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:52,720
You…

633
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,640
Sang Qi, listen to me.

634
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,310
I can get you out of here.

635
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,680
The gambling den
at Tianxiang Pleasure House

636
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,720
has already been raided
by the Capital Administration Office.

637
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,720
Your stronghold has been wiped out.

638
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,510
And the Nightingale Sect.

639
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,760
Your comrades.

640
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,110
Some are dead, and some have fled.

641
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,830
Only you're still here,
refusing to talk.

642
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,400
You can't deceive me.

643
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,310
Tell me

644
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,240
where your black scorpion is.

645
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,550
Fine.

646
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,030
Keep your lips sealed.

647
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,510
But know this.

648
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,640
Sooner or later, someone else will talk.

649
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,030
Your plan is doomed

650
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,760
to fail.

651
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,790
Officers. Let's go.

652
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,760
Qi,

653
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,070
I want to choose

654
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,830
a different path this time.

655
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
If you escape,

656
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,590
let's never be enemies again.

657
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,030
Miss.

658
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,870
Is this handkerchief yours?

659
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:37,870
Sir.

660
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,510
It is not mine.

661
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,830
You must be mistaken.

662
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,030
How could I be mistaken?

663
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,310
I just saw you drop it.

664
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,870
Or did you drop it on purpose?

665
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,110
Look.

666
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,680
My handkerchief is right here.

667
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,680
I haven't lost it.

668
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,920
I clearly saw

669
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,070
that this handkerchief was yours.

670
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,350
With so many people watching,

671
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,760
I don't want them to think
I'm harassing you.

672
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,160
No, it's not…

673
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,790
Commandant Yu.

674
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,270
Mr. Zhen.

675
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,920
This palace maid says

676
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,240
this handkerchief isn't hers.

677
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,870
Why are you still pestering her?

678
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,510
How am I pestering her?

679
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,510
I saw her drop the handkerchief.

680
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,030
I simply picked it up to return it.

681
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,790
Think about it.

682
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,110
If others see this,

683
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,350
how will she ever work
in the palace again?

684
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,070
What about me then?

685
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,790
What's going on?

686
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,400
What are you doing?

687
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,680
Wasting time here?

688
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,350
Madam.

689
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,400
This official picked up a handkerchief,

690
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,000
and he insists that it's mine.

691
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,160
This is a small matter.

692
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,640
We can sort it out later.

693
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,110
This is not a small matter.

694
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,960
It concerns my honor.

695
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,400
Commandant Yu is right.

696
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,680
Miss, if this handkerchief

697
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,550
really isn't yours,

698
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,070
and he's using it
as an excuse to harass you,

699
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,310
then I will not let him off.

700
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:45,870
According to Zhou's laws…

701
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,350
Aling.

702
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,510
Is this handkerchief yours or not?

703
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,680
Explain clearly.

704
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,590
Don't delay

705
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,720
everyone's work.

706
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,720
The banquet is about to start.

707
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,760
We must hurry over.

708
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,830
It's mine.

709
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,200
She admitted it.

710
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,680
I'll ask you again.

711
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,760
Is this really your handkerchief?

712
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,870
It is mine.

713
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,720
I was in a hurry to deliver refreshments

714
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,720
and didn't notice.

715
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,270
Madam.

716
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,110
She admitted it herself.

717
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,960
The issue is that this handkerchief

718
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,510
is laced with poison.

719
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,030
I…

720
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,550
This isn't mine.

721
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,830
My handkerchief isn't poisoned.

722
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,200
Just now, you said it was yours.

723
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,590
And now you say it isn't?

724
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,310
Are you hiding something?

725
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,000
Someone.

726
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:34,920
Search her.

727
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,200
What is this?

728
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,400
Sir, it wasn't me.

729
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,200
They forced me to poison His Majesty.

730
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,070
Sir.

731
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,110
Sir, I had no idea about this.

732
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,070
Madam.

733
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,200
You know what to do.

734
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,110
Yes, sir.

735
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,960
Bind her. Take her away.

736
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,240
Sir, have mercy!

737
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,720
They forced me, sir!

738
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,960
Please have mercy, sir!

739
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,110
Sir! It wasn't me! Sir!

740
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:14,720
I have broken

741
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,830
my principles today.

742
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,440
It's the first time I've ruled on a case
without solid evidence.

743
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,350
But I believe you did the right thing.

744
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,830
His Majesty has arrived.

745
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,790
Bow.

746
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,920
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

747
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,960
Bow again.

748
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,440
- May Your Majesty enjoy great health.
- May Your Majesty enjoy great health.

749
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,080
All rise.

750
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,469
The winds howl fiercely.

751
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,679
Now is the time to display your valor

752
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:17,080
and show the gallantry of Zhou.

753
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,350
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

754
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,140
[Capital Administration Office]

755
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,240
Why is the wind picking up?

756
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,240
Why is the wind picking up?

757
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,600
Why is it raining all of a sudden?

758
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,640
My spices!

759
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,560
My spices!

760
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,080
Aman,

761
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,640
this isn't rain.

762
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,760
It's a solar eclipse.

763
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,200
A solar eclipse?

764
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,910
Aman, what time is it now?

765
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:45,720
Just past the hour of the Horse.

766
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,950
Just past the hour of the Horse?

767
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,040
Shouldn't it be a quarter before midday?

768
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,200
Did I misinterpret it?

769
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,160
Is there a different meaning

770
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,350
to those words?

771
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,350
We miscalculated.

772
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,240
Yu Qi.

773
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,790
Please be safe.

774
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,520
Protect His Majesty!

775
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,680
Quickly! Protect His Majesty!

776
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,080
Protect His Majesty!

777
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,310
Hurry! Protect His Majesty!

778
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,160
Protect His Majesty!

779
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:23,790
Your Majesty, watch out!

780
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,080
Assassin! Seize him!

781
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,470
Your Majesty!

782
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,270
It's the solar eclipse!
Light the torches!

783
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,680
Commandant Yu!

784
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,160
Your Majesty!

785
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,560
Hurry!

786
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,790
Halt.

787
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,720
Who are you?

788
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,760
Yu Qi, Commandant
of the Capital Administration Office.

789
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,080
Summon the imperial physician.

790
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,240
Summon the imperial physician!

791
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:23,600
Thank you.

792
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:31,760
How is his injury?

793
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,200
Your Majesty.

794
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,200
Though Commandant Yu
was protected by soft armor,

795
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,680
his body is already burdened
with old wounds.

796
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,200
This attack has aggravated
his past injuries.

797
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,760
His internal injuries are serious

798
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,120
and must be carefully tended to.

799
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,270
Otherwise,

800
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,120
they will never fully heal.

801
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,200
I'll take my leave.

802
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:04,990
Your Majesty.

803
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,910
Why do you still call me that?

804
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,350
Spare the formalities.

805
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,720
I shall take my leave.

806
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:13,990
Do you really think

807
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,080
I wouldn't even recognize

808
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,830
my own son?

809
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,160
Seventh Prince?

810
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,080
Yu Jin.

811
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,120
Every year, I have them

812
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,870
send back your latest portrait

813
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,600
from the army to the palace.

814
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,120
Just so I can see you more often.

815
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:41,990
Jin.

816
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,470
All these years,

817
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,780
[Yu Jin, Seventh Prince of Zhou]

818
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,120
I've been worried about you.

819
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,640
How is your injury?

820
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,390
Let me see.

821
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,270
His Majesty has arrived.

822
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,160
- We deserve death for our failure.
- We deserve death for our failure.

823
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,270
- We await Your Majesty's punishment.
- We await Your Majesty's punishment.

824
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,160
The Imperial Insignia Guards
failed in their duty,

825
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,040
allowing an assassin
to infiltrate the hunting grounds.

826
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,600
I am guilty beyond excuse.

827
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,520
The Gale Guards were late
in protecting Your Majesty.

828
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,600
I, too, deserve death.

829
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:27,560
Your Majesty.

830
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,600
Commandant Yu fought

831
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,830
the assassin earlier.

832
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,680
Perhaps he noted observations.

833
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,640
I believe the assassin

834
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,830
is still here.

835
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:38,950
Your Majesty.

836
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,680
The Imperial Insignia Guards
have already completely

837
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,470
sealed off the hunting grounds.

838
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,080
We will capture that assassin.

839
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:45,470
Your Majesty.

840
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,160
All court officials are forbidden

841
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,040
from carrying personal weapons

842
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,120
into the hunting grounds.

843
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,870
All hunting weapons

844
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,270
must be distributed on-site.

845
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,720
All of them underwent

846
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,350
a thorough inspection

847
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,640
to ensure they carried no weapons

848
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,830
before being allowed in.

849
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,430
The Imperial Insignia Guards
and Gale Guards were the only exceptions.

850
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,470
I doubt the culprit will be found

851
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,160
if I leave it to either of you.

852
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,350
Commandant Yu, you protected me.

853
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,120
I entrust the investigation to you.

854
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,310
Your Majesty,
please permit Mr. Zhen to assist me.

855
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,520
Permission granted.

856
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,950
Please pour all the water
from the buckets

857
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:25,830
in front of you

858
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,910
onto yourselves.

859
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,120
Why?

860
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:33,950
Imperial Insignia Guards,

861
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:35,390
pour.

862
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,790
Gale Guards, pour.

863
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,470
When I fought

864
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,640
the assassin,

865
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,350
I crushed a fragrance pill in my hand

866
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,040
and struck him on the chest.

867
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,790
That mark becomes visible
upon contact with water.

868
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,640
Everyone, check each other.

869
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,160
It...

870
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:07,640
There's nothing.

871
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,470
Nothing on me either.

872
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,950
There's nothing.

873
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,200
What is that on your chest?

874
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,610
[Wang Heng]

875
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,790
It's just a stain

876
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,310
I accidentally got on myself.

877
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,200
