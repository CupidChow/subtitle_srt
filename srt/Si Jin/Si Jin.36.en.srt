you surpass
the Crown Prince far too much.

No matter what,

172
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,640
I should give you a chance.

Aunt, you flatter me.

174
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,159
This is the Saintess Emblem.

175
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,360
We found this

176
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,240
on Princess Consort Yan.

177
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,080
Is she the Nanwu Saintess?

178
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,760
You know,

179
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,880
His Majesty hates Nanwu to the core.

180
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,720
Colluding with Nanwu
is a capital offense.

181
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Moreover, she's actually

182
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,320
the Nanwu Saintess.

183
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,480
If you can report her to His Majesty,

184
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,680
you'll be ridding the world
of a great evil.

185
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,040
It'll be a huge contribution to Zhou.

186

It's also

00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,600
If I expose his consort,

191
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,920
Yu Jin

192
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,000
will be implicated.

193
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,880
Even Mother and I will...

194
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,640
Forget it.

195
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,680
It turns out that your lofty aspirations

196
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,320
were just for show.

197
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,080
For the sake of your sister-in-law,

198
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,400
Jiang Si,

199
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,080
you're disregarding
the safety of the realm.

200
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,680
No wonder His Majesty

201
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,160
always told me

202
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,680
you preferred empty talks.

203
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,800
You're unfit
for important duties indeed.

204
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,120
[Prince Yan's Mansion]

205
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,000
Apply this on it

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,160
and the emblem will vanish.

207
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,440
I've tried it before.

208
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,240
But it'll only vanish temporarily.

209
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,080
It'll reappear in no time.

210
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,880
That day, when we came back
from the streets,

211
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,760
Aman found out that the fragrance
had lost its effectiveness

212
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,400
when she helped me to get changed.

213
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
But it can conceal it

214
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,400
for the time being.

215
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,520
If so, we should do this every day

216
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,640
so that it won't appear again.

217
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,760
Every day?

218
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,320
Isn't it troublesome?

219
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,400
How could this be?

220
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,640
Husbands are meant

221
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,240
for troublesome chores, you know?

222
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
If you don't bother me,

223
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,160
that'll be my biggest problem.

224
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,360
Therefore,

225
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,680
please keep bothering me.

226
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,160
What are you talking about?

227
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,360
It makes my head hurt.

228
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,680
It's gone.

229
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,760
Really?

230
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,040
Let's try more.

231
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,600
Is it gone?

232
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,280
This is so magical.

233
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,920
It's gone.

234
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,880
Mother.

235
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,600
Why the rush? Is something wrong?

236
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,600
You're finally here.

237
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,600
Look at this.

238
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
Yesterday, Jin's consort

239
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,560
suddenly instructed her maid

240
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,280
to deliver this to me.

241
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,240
I never expected

242
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,200
Jin's reputation
as a bringer of misfortune

243
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,400
was actually caused

244
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,640
by the Princess Royal.

245
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,920
She came up

246
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:07,960
with such a cruel way

247
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,360
to separate me and my child

248
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,120
merely because she was jealous of me.

249
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,280
Aunt was too bold for her own good.

250
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,760
Everything is stated

251
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,360
in Nanny Xu's testimony.

252
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,240
Back then, she harmed Yu Jin first.

253
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,800
After that, she tried to harm Jiang Si.

254
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,800
The girl was lucky.

255
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,160
If not, she would've died from poison,

256
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,960
just like her mother.

257
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,480
It also states

258
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,880
that the Princess Royal
was colluding with Nanwu.

259
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,520
With this testimony,

260
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,680
I don't believe

261
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,800
that His Majesty can still defend her.

262
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,320
If they could use this testimony

263
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,960
to topple her,

264
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,040
why didn't they hand it to Father?

265
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,600
Why give it to you instead?

266
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,040
You see,

267
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,400
one of them grew up
in the Southern Frontier

268
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,080
while the other came from
a fallen noble family.

269
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,840
They don't have any roots in Ling'an

270
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,920
or any support in the imperial court.

271
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,560
Since they've handed

272
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,800
such conclusive evidence

273
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
to me instead of the Empress,

274
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,240
that means they trust me.

275
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,520
Jin

276
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,880
is my son after all.

277
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,680
The testimony may be rigid,
but people aren't.

278
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,720
The officials in charge

279
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,600
of these affairs

280
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,640
might be dead by now.

281
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,720
Once Aunt forces Nanny Xu

282
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,880
to change her testimony,

283
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,320
our case will turn into slander instead.

284
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,360
You're hesitating so much.

285
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,640
You're timid

286
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,880
and hesitant.

287
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,440
Who exactly did you take after?

288
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,880
Do you think I can live until the day

289
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,240
you topple that wretch?

290
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,840
You're really inferior to Jin.

291
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
He was daring enough
to hit the Crown Prince.

292
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,560
He was bold enough
to go against that wretch

293
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,560
and refuse to marry her daughter.

294
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,080
Look at yourself.

295
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,000
Mother.

296
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,560
The fight for the throne is perilous.

297
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,120
If anything happens,

298
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,160
all of us

299
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,880
will be done for.

300
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,600
I'm considering my options carefully

301
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,680
and being meticulous here.

302
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,240
Am I wrong?

303
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,880
The opportunity
is right in front of you.

304
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,400
But you're timid and hesitant

305
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,720
to do anything.

306
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,840
I can't put my hopes on you anymore.

307
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,520
Your Highness.

308
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,240
Your Highness, what happened?

309
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,960
Am I truly inferior to Jin?

310
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,880
We found this

311
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,720
on Princess Consort Yan.

312
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,920
If you can report her to His Majesty,

313
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,280
it'll be a huge contribution to Zhou.

314
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,680
It's also

315
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,880
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

316
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,040
Regarding what happened to Yu,

317
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,880
I always felt guilty about it.

318
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,960
I'm not your enemy.

319
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,840
It's just
that I couldn't lend you a hand

320
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,600
when that happened.

321
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,560
If you see me as an opponent,

322
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,360
you'll be making yourself another enemy

323
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,000
instead of an ally.

324
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,000
After the tragedy that befell my family,

325
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,760
Your Highness stayed away

326
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,360
from me and my family.

327
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,800
Now, you're inviting me here
for a drink.

328
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,280
What's your goal?
You may cut to the chase.

329
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,640
Your biggest foe isn't me.

330
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,760
It's Jiang Si.

331
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,720
The one who exposed Yu was Jiang Si.

332
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,920
She was also the one
who convinced Jiang Qian

333
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,240
to divorce your son.

334
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,200
The one who suggested His Majesty
conduct a trial

335
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,480
and sentence your son to death
was her as well.

336
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,560
She's

337
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,240
your sworn enemy.

338
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,320
Don't you hate her?

339
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,280
Of course I do!

340
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,600
If only

341
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,400
I could tear them apart

342
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,520
and rip them to shreds!

343
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,560
Now, there's an opportunity

344
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,360
for you to avenge your son

345
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,680
with justice.

346
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,840
Princess Mingyue died because of her.

347
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,360
Your Highness, do you not hate her?

348
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,200
I understand now.

349
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,160
You want me

350
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,760
to do the deed for you, huh?

351
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,960
Why don't you listen
to what I have to say before deciding?

352
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,720
See if this task

353
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,120
is worthy enough for you to fulfill.

354
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:44,880
Your Highness.

355
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,480
Prince Qi is here to see you.

356
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,400
Let him wait.

357
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,360
Yes, Your Highness.

358
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,880
[Princess Royal's Mansion]

359
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,840
Mingyue,

360
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,720
today's the day

361
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll avenge you.

362
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,440
I will

363
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,240
put on my finest attire.

364
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,400
Just like the day

365
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,440
I sent you off to be married.

366
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,760
Mingyue,

367
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,040
I won't spare anyone

368
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,280
who has contributed

369
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,000
to your death.

370
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,800
Your Majesty,

371
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,160
Her Highness seeks an audience.

372
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,160
Let her in.

373
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,320
Summon Her Highness.

374
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,480
It's been some days since we met.

375
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,240
Brother, I came to greet you.

376
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,240
Rong Yang,

377
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,160
you look much better today.

378
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,440
I can finally rest at ease now.

379
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,160
You were busy with state affairs.

380
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,920
Even so, you're still worried

381
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,120
about me.

382
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,360
I've let you down.

383
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,480
What are you saying?

384
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,280
You're my sister.

385
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,640
At times like these,
I should keep you company

386
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,880
and overcome this hardship
together with you.

387
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,440
Thank you, Brother.

388
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,760
It is

389
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,200
stuffy and hot.

390
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,040
I prepared

391
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,560
our favorite drink when we were young,

392
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,480
the chilled perilla drink.

393
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
I've added some ice to it.

394
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,600
This way, it's more refreshing.

395
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,480
Thank you, Rong Yang.

396
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,120
Prince Qi seeks an audience.

397
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,200
Summon him.

398
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,480
I shall take my leave.

399
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,840
We're family.

400
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,160
There's no need to excuse yourself.

401
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,640
Greetings, Father.

402
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,280
Greetings, Your Highness.

403
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,640
Who did you learn this from?

404
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,040
I was thinking
of teaching you a thing or two

405
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,920
at the last moment.

406
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Now, I don't see the need for that.

407
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,720
It's because

408
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,040
I had a great master in the past.

409
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,720
There are two things I can confirm.

410
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,120
His abilities are no less

411
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,480
than mine.

412
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,520
And,

413
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,400
it seems like

414
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,480
someone cannot forget about him.

415
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,960
The name of my master

416
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,200
is Yu Qi.

417
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,360
I know him very well.

418
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,120
That's the one in your dream.

419
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,400
This is unfair.

420
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,360
He has done all the things

421
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,960
I wanted to do together with you.

422
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,960
You're jealous of him?

423
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,680
Of course.

424
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,720
But you're the very same person.

425
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,720
How could that be the same?

426
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,440
Chief!

427
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,640
Chief, Your Highness,

428
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,360
the Princess Royal entered the palace
early in the morning.

429
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,480
Prince Qi went there shortly after.

430
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,200
Is that so?

431
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:30,800
That's right.

432
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,400
There's no way to avoid the inevitable.

433
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,640
Zhang.

434
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,480
Yes, Father.

435
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,720
I've read

436
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,920
the memorial on taxes and labor duties

437
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,600
you submitted.

438
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,520
The wording is elegant,
and the antithesis is excellent.

439
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,160
However, the content is empty.

440
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,800
It's purely empty talk.

441
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,880
What do you mean by this?

442
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,600
I have a secret report to submit.

443
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,720
If the Princess Royal
headed into the palace

444
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,280
because of the case
with the Nanwu Saintess,

445
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,880
Father will

446
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,960
summon us very soon.

447
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,680
How about this?

448
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,320
You can exit through the back door
and leave the palace

449
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,080
under the pretense
of paying respect to your ancestors.

450
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,520
Lingshui and Nanwu

451
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
are in the same direction.

452
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,400
No one will suspect you.

453
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,280
And.

454
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,920
Take the jade pendant I gave you

455
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,560
and go to the Red Plume Cavalry.

456
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,760
If I leave now,

457
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,000
that means I'm fleeing
to escape punishment.

458
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,240
And, you'll be convicted of
colluding with the enemy.

459
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,400
All these years,

460
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,640
you've rendered

461
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,920
countless merits on the battlefield.

462
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,040
Now, you've finally

463
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,360
cleared the stigma

464
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,040
of being a bringer of misfortune.

465
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,720
Do you want to ruin it just like this?

466
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,480
I don't care about any of that.

467
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,920
I just want you to be safe.

468
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,400
Listen to me. Just go.

469
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,200
Hurry.

470
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:06,920
Leave.

471
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,280
Long Dan,

472
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,800
take Princess Consort Yan
and leave the city.

473
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:12,920
Yes, Chief.

474
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

475
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,680
Show him the letter.

476
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,760
I once heard

477
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,600
that you investigated Nanwu thoroughly

478
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,480
after losing your son.

479
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,960
I wonder if you've seen

480
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,000
this emblem before.

481
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,040
Marquis of Changxing,

482
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,840
you have to tell us the truth

483
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,560
if you know anything.

484
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,760
Yes, Your Highness.

485
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,440
Your Majesty.

486
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,480
This is the emblem
of the Nanwu Saintess!

487
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,280
This emblem is a top secret
within Nanwu itself.

488
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,960
I've searched countless scrolls

489
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,800
and documents,

490
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,240
and I've only seen it once
in a secret scroll.

491
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,040
Your Majesty, why is this here?

492
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
I found this report

493
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,000
on a Nanwu spy

494
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,800
I captured some days ago.

495
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,360
Will this emblem

496
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,960
only appear
on the Nanwu Saintess' body?

497
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,960
According to the scroll,

498
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,240
the Saintess is born with this emblem.

499
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,440
It's given to her by fate.

500
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,000
No one else can possess the same one.

501
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,160
Seems like the Nanwu spy
was speaking the truth.

502
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,720
If so, we have to wait
for Princess Consort Yan's arrival.

503
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,520
We will know once we test her.

504
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,800
Your Highness, are you done?

505
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,760
We're running out of time!

506
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,520
Your Highness, please hurry!

507
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:46,960
Your Highness?

508
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,680
Your Highness?

509
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,480
Where is she?

510
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,520
Oh no!

511
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,280
Your Highness.

512
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,440
His Majesty has issued a decree.

513
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,520
Your Highness, please head to the palace
with your consort.

514
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,640
Prince Yan has arrived.

515
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,160
Greetings, Father.

516
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,640
Yu Jin,

517
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,520
I'll only ask you this one time.

518
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,800
You have to be honest with me.

519
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,000
Father, please ask away.

520
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,480
Is Jiang Si

521
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,800
the Nanwu Saintess?

522
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,920
Father, what makes you say so?

523
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,720
Answer me.

524
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,560
It's nonsense.

525
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,760
Since that's the case,

526
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,520
His Majesty summoned you

527
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,920
and your consort.

528
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,320
Why are you the only one here?

529
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,920
She went back to Lingshui
to pay respect to her ancestors.

530
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,520
Isn't this too much of a coincidence?

531
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,720
Zhang, what do you mean by that?

532
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,280
Your Majesty, Princess Consort Yan
seeks an audience.

533
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,680
Summon her.

534
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,320
Greetings, Father.

535
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,040
Pardon me for being late.

536
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,400
Jiang Si.

537
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,000
I received a secret report.

538
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,440
It states
that you're the Nanwu Saintess.

539
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,440
How do you explain yourself?

540
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,720
Father,

541
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,360
I was born in Ling'an.

542
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,040
Lingshui is the furthest place
I've been to.

543
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,720
How am I the Nanwu Saintess?

544
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,240
That's nonsense.

545
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,920
Father, please practice wise judgment.

546
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,480
Both of your statements
are aligned perfectly.

547
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,040
Seems like you two came prepared.

548
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,000
Aunt,

549
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,080
why are you putting us on the spot here?

550
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,480
Father.

551
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,640
The Nanwu Saintess

552
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,000
is just a candidate
recognized by the people of Nanwu

553
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,080
who has the potential
to be the Saintess.

554
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,720
But she doesn't need to be from Nanwu.

555
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,400
And she doesn't need
to visit Nanwu herself.

556
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,720
How should
we determine its validity, then?

557
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
In my opinion,

558
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,800
the emblem doesn't lie.

559
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,640
Father, please check

560
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,160
the area
behind Princess Consort Yan's neck

561
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,080
to see if the emblem exists.

562
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,600
No.

563
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,480
The princess consort is a noble figure.

564
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,400
Do you think you can inspect her body

565
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,320
just because of a slander?

566
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,600
You want to clear yourself
of suspicion, right?

567
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,040
This is the best opportunity.

568
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,360
Father, if you insist on doing so,

569
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,480
I will accept the inspection.

570
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,240
However, if no emblem is discovered,

571
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,560
Father, please punish those

572
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,160
who had maligned me.

573
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,080
All right.

574
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,200
Take Princess Consort Yan
to the study for an inspection.

575
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,720
Your Majesty,

576
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,600
we didn't find any emblem on her body.

577
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,200
Since there's no emblem,

578
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,320
she's not the Nanwu Saintess.

579
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,920
Your Majesty,

580
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,080
please punish those
who maligned her severely.

581
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,520
Father, I...

582
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,160
Brother.

583
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,000
I've heard of a rumor before.

584
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,200
The Saintess Emblem

585
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,560
will become more obvious
when exposed to fire.

586
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,280
I don't know if the rumor

587
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,000
is accurate or not.

588
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,760
Father,

589
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,160
since we're already inspecting her,

590
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,240
why don't we proceed with it

591
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,520
to prevent future trouble?

592
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,760
There's no emblem.
How will there be future trouble?

593
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,920
Rong Yang, inspect her yourself.

594
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,760
Yes, Brother.

595
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,280
Remove her outfit.

596
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,120
Jiang Si,

597
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,760
you're the Nanwu Saintess indeed.

598
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,480
Jiang Si is the Nanwu Saintess!

599
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,440
Princess Fuqing, you mustn't enter.

600
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,240
But why?

601
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,240
Jin, you're something else.

602
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,520
You did get yourself

603
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,280
a great wife, huh?

604
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,920
How dare you betray our realm

605
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,000
and collude with Nanwu?

606
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,560
Father, it's impossible for her
to collude with our enemy.

607
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,120
Your Majesty, Mr. Zhen has arrived.

608
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,320
Summon him.

609
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

610
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,800
Zhen Heng, great timing.

611
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,760
Conduct this trial together with me.

612
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:37,920
Jiang Si.

613
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,640
Prince Yan

614
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,080
took the risk
of being branded a traitor

615
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,320
to make a plea for you.

616
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
What do you have to say for yourself?

617
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,880
Your Majesty,
please practice wise judgment.

618
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,880
Your Majesty,

619
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,920
please think about it.

620
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,520
Before this, the Marquis of Changxing

621
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,200
was very close to Nanwu.

622
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,800
His son

623
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,160
was found

624
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,320
to possess Divine Bliss,
a secret drug of Nanwu.

625
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,680
Even so, he didn't know
about the secret

626
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,200
of uncovering the Saintess Emblem.

627
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560
How did the Princess Royal

628
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,800
get hold of such information easily?

629
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,880
And, she even pretended
that it was a rumor.

630
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,360
I'm sure no one

631
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,560
will be convinced

632
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,360
if we say she

633
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,320
has nothing to do with Nanwu.

634
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,800
I was born

635
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,640
and raised in Zhou.

636
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,600
I'd never do anything

637
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,080
that would harm Zhou.

638
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,360
Your Majesty!

639
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,320
My son's case was closed long ago!

640
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,400
I've spent half of my life following you

641
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,840
on the battlefield!

642
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,360
Your Majesty, in my heart,

643
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,200
I only care about you and Zhou!

644
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,400
Your Majesty,
please practice wise judgment!

645
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,480
Marquis of Changxing, get up.

646
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,120
Brother.

647
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,560
I want you to meet someone.

648
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,200
Who is it?

649
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,480
A dead person.

650
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,160
Bring him here.

651
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,360
Sang Qi?

652
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,360
Weren't you dead?

653
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,680
That's right.

654
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,080
Wasn't he supposed to be dead?

655
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,000
Jiang Si,

656
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
you should know him very well.

657
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,600
Zhen Heng, who is this?

658
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
This is a member
of Nanwu's Nightingale Sect.

659
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,600
His name is Sang Qi.

660
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,960
He was captured by Prince Yan then.

661
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:22,920
After that,

662
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,480
he was accidentally poisoned to death.

663
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,600
Since he's dead, why is he here, then?

664
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,680
I don't understand either.

665
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,160
Back then, Prince Yan and I

666
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,760
examined his corpse together

667
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,440
at the Capital Administration Office.

668
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,320
We confirmed that he was dead.

669
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,360
Your Majesty, after our investigation,

670
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,120
we confirmed that Jiang Si

671
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,840
was the last person he met

672
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,800
before dying.

673
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,560
And, she was using Commandant Yu's token

674
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,840
[Capital Administration Office]
back then.

675
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,440
The Gale Guards

676
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,840
captured this man again
when we were investigating

677
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,200
the spies of Nanwu.

678
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,840
From the start until the end,

679
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,520
Yu Jin and Jiang Si,

680
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,240
it seems like you two were involved.

681
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,000
Your Majesty,

682
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
I can prove

683
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,240
that Commandant Yu,

684
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,040
which is Prince Yan,

685
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,840
had no idea about it.

686
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,680
Moreover, Prince Yan

687
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,240
captured Sang Qi himself.

688
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,080
Why would he help him escape?

689
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,560
I'm sure there's a misunderstanding.

690
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,240
Judging from what you said,

691
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,280
it seems like Princess Consort Yan is...

692
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,080
No.

693
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,720
It was the doing of Jiang Si,

694
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,320
the Nanwu Saintess.

695
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,400
I once doubted Jiang Si as well.

696
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,960
I approached her

697
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,040
in order to find out about her identity.

698
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,000
But

699
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,360
I didn't find any evidence
of her colluding with our enemy.

700
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,600
Instead, I found out

701
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,640
that she upheld justice
for the people of Zhou.

702
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,400
She harbored no other ambitions.

703
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,320
She merely wanted to protect her family.

704
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,200
Thanks to her reminder,

705
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,400
I found out

706
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,760
that the solar eclipse would occur
during the Mid-Autumn Hunt.

707
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,480
That's how I was able to protect you.

708
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,760
If so,

709
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,360
you found out about
her identity long ago.

710
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,880
Brother, look.

711
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,080
Prince Yan

712
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,480
was an excellent general
who conquered the battlefield.

713
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,640
But he was bewitched by this wretch,

714
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,720
causing him to forget about
his realm and home.

715
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,120
The power of the Nanwu Saintess

716
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,800
is incredible indeed.

717
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,560
The Nanwu Saintess has the ability
to predict the future.

718
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,800
She can help restore Nanwu
to its former glory

719
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,200
and annihilate Zhou.

720
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,280
She's truly a great threat!

721
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,200
Nanwu and Zhou
have engaged in a conflict

722
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,640
for several decades.

723
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,720
The people have suffered,

724
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,720
never enjoying a moment of peace.

725
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,840
Jin,

726
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,320
we only managed

727
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,520
to obtain moments of peace

728
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,280
after the efforts
of you and the Red Plume Cavalry.

729
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,920
But now, you're letting

730
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,360
a woman of Nanwu bewitch you
just like that.

731
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,560
Have you forgotten about

732
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,360
their sacrifices?

733
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,280
It's a shame that Prince Yan

734
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,880
has been bewitched to such an extent.

735
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,840
I've long heard of

736
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,640
the bewitching power
of the Nanwu Saintess.

737
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,840
Your Majesty,

738
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,800
please execute her immediately

739
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,960
to prevent future trouble.

740
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,680
You're the one bewitching us here!

741
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,680
Drag Jiang Si out

742
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,160
and execute her immediately.

743
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,200
Yes, Your Majesty!

744
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,880
Nobody touches the Saintess!

745
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,040
The Saintess brings glory to Nanwu.

746
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,820
[Eternal Joy and Serenity]

747
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,160
Mother!

748
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,880
Mother, this is bad!

749
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,720
Be careful.

750
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,000
They said Si

751
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,280
is actually the Nanwu Saintess.

752
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,560
Who did you hear that from?

753
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,560
I heard it myself
when I went to find Father

754
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,640
at Tiande Hall.

755
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,280
It's no wonder she could recognize

756
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,640
the rare Blind Bug.

757
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,320
She even treated your eyes.

758
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,000
Si is an upright person.

759
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,080
I don't believe

760
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,160
that she's a traitor.

761
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,240
She risked her life to rescue me.

762
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,640
We can't let them

763
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,640
malign her like this.

764
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,920
Father,

765
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,920
twenty years ago,

766
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,880
you banished me

767
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,160
over a so-called "omen"
from the heavens.

768
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,400
Now, you're trying to execute my beloved

769
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,680
all because of a rumor.

770
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,600
If you wish to deal
with the threat of Nanwu,

771
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,440
I can go on an expedition
with my troops.

772
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,080
But now, you intend to execute a lady

773
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,800
in exchange for Zhou's peace?

774
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,760
It is ridiculous.

775
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,120
Yu Jin.

776
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,280
I assume you knew her identity

777
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,040
long ago.

778
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,600
Even so, you defended her.

779
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,000
Did you come to Ling'an
without permission

780
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,560
for another ulterior motive?

781
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,480
Father, since you can't
tell right from wrong,

782
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,440
it's pointless for me to say anything.

783
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,640
Since it has come to this,

784
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,720
I have nothing to hide.

785
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,800
That's right. I'm the Nanwu Saintess.

786
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,200
Prince Yan,

787
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,080
don't be so naive.

788
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,040
I approached you

789
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,160
merely because I knew

790
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,440
you had a special identity.

791
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,040
I was thinking

792
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,360
that I could use you someday.

793
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
But I never expected you

794
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
to be bent on

795
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,160
eliminating threats for Zhou

796
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,320
and securing the borders.

797
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,000
I shouldn't have expected you

798
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,760
to help me out.

799
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,240
Do you know what you're saying?

800
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,880
Of course I do.

801
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,480
You approached me

802
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,280
because you doubted

803
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,320
my identity, didn't you?

804
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,160
I suppose the identity
of Princess Consort Yan

805
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,880
is worth it as it helped conceal

806
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,040
my identity.

807
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,280
If not,

808
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,240
why did you think
I would be married to you?

809
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,199
After all...

810
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,760
we're not connected at all.

811
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,360
Report!

812
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,960
This is an urgent border report.

813
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,239
Nanwu has already stationed troops
at the border,

814
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,719
demanding Zhou to hand over
the Nanwu Saintess.

815
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,920
If not, they shall

816
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,080
attack us with their full force

817
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,080
and massacre Zhou!

818
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,440
Relay my order to Cui Xu.
Tell him to act immediately.

819
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,719
He is to engage our enemies
at the borders.

820
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

821
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,239
Your Majesty,

822
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,000
the Nanwu Saintess
is the faith of the Nanwu people.

823
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
They believe

824
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,280
that the Nanwu Saintess can lead them

825
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,440
to conquer Zhou.

826
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,679
If we execute her,

827
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,920
it'll reduce their morale

828
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,040
and scatter them.

829
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:42,760
This way,

830
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,239
the troops of Zhou

831
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,880
will surely sweep through them

832
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,040
and crush them completely!

833
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,760
Marquis of Changxing,

834
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,239
an invasion is imminent.

835
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,000
Even so, you don't care

836
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,199
about the safety of our people.

837
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,679
Are you so eager
to make the war happen?

838
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,440
Your Majesty,

839
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,560
according to the rumor,

840
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,480
the Saintess

841
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,080
is the spiritual leader
of the Nanwu people.

842
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,480
If you kill me,

843
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,880
you'll be eradicating

844
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,600
their faith.

845
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,520
By then,

846
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,360
Nanwu will surely attack us
with their full force.

847
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,960
Whether it's Nanwu or Zhou,

848
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,320
countless lives will suffer.

849
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,280
Is that

850
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,560
what you want to see?

851
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,520
Throw her into the imperial prison.

852
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,160
The trial will be held another day.

853
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

854
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,040
Your Majesty,

855
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,960
since the truth has been revealed,

856
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,280
why is there a need for a trial?

857
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,960
The Capital Administration Office
excels at conducting investigations.

858
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,720
And Zhen Heng is impartial.

859
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,440
Zhen Heng shall conduct the trial.

860
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

861
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,880
Brother, this is a huge case.

862
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,440
A joint trial by both offices
would be the fairest.

863
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,520
The Privy Office handles all things
related to the military.

864
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,720
It's appropriate for them
to conduct the trial.

865
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,400
If so, Zhen Heng
and Marquis of Changxing

866
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,680
will conduct a joint trial.

867
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,960
All of you may leave.

868
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,440
Jin, remain here.

869
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,040
Farewell, Your Majesty.

870
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,760
Let me ask you something.

871
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,760
What's our relationship?

872
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,960
Ruler and subject, father and son.

873
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,920
Seems like you're not muddle-headed yet.

874
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,560
You know how to prioritize
our ties as ruler and subject.

875
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,320
I just want you to understand

876
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,720
the difference between state affairs
and family affairs.

877
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,200
Since the Nanwu people

878
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,480
have already acknowledged
Jiang Si as the Saintess,

879
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,040
there are only

880
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,760
two possible endings for her.

881
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,800
It's either I execute her

882
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,000
or I imprison her until death

883
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,240
as the hostage of Nanwu.

884
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,000
No matter what happens,

885
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,200
she won't be able
to be Princess Consort Yan again.

886
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,320
Therefore,

887
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,480
you should stop having feelings for her.

I dare not.

Your Highness, I know

916
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,680
that you have your own limitations.

917
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,120

What are you all trying to do?

936
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,640
My Lord, what is this for?

937
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,640
Princess Consort Yan is suspected
of colluding with our enemies.

938
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,560
The Privy Office is here to conduct
an investigation under imperial order.

939
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,000
Capture everyone here
for an interrogation.

940
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:30,880
I'm sure they have news

941
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,000
of the Nanwu Saintess

942
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,040
that they haven't revealed.

943
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,000
If Prince Yan returns now,

944
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,080
you'll bite off more than you can chew!

945
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,880
Capture all of them!

946
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,360
I dare you!

947
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:36,960
Stop right there!

948
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,440
My Lord, are you sure

949
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,560
you're conducting the case impartially?

950
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,280
Mr. Zhen, you're everywhere.

951
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,760
This case shall be conducted
by both offices.

952
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,800
Just like you,

953
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,120
I'm here to investigate the case.

954
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,320
According to the law of Zhou,

955
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,840
if the suspect hasn't been
convicted of their crime,

956
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,120
we have no authority to detain anyone

957
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,120
outside of their immediate family.

958
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,760
These servants

959
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,280
all serve Prince Yan.

960
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,320
We can capture them
according to the law.

961
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,480
They're citizens employed by Prince Yan.

962
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,920
They didn't sell themselves to him.

963
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,880
If so, we cannot capture them.

964
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,600
If so, proceed with the search!

965
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,520
The Capital Administration Office

966
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,280
will join you in the search.

967
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,400
Who do you think you are?

968
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,520
You're the one I'm going to capture!

969
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,040
Wait.

970
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,560
Search the area thoroughly!

971
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,560
Since His Majesty wanted both offices
to conduct the trial together,

972
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,480
it's all to ensure fairness,

973
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,760
with mutual oversight.

974
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,960
Am I right?

975
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,040
Search the area.

976
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,240
I found it.

977
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:15,760
Let's go.

978
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:23,960
My Lord,

979
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,360
we found a secret letter.

980
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,560
Mr. Zhen,

981
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,960
we found the name list

982
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,720
of the Nanwu spies

983
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,680
in this very mansion.

984
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,400
Nonsense!

985
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,800
You all are trying to frame us!

986
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,960
The evidence is here.

987
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,360
Mr. Zhen, please take a look.

988
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,800
Who found this letter?

989
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,560
Me.

990
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,720
Let me ask you this.

991
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,240
Where did you

992
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,280
find the letter?
