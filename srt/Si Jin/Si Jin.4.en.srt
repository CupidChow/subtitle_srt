(West Market)
Candied hawthorn!

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,200
Would you like one?

13
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,720
Young Master, you don't want it?

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,840
What a joke.

15
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,950
What man eats candied hawthorn?

16
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,590
Thank you.

00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,540
(Qiaoxiang Shop)
It's closed.

18
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,150
Shall we change to another one?

19
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,670
No need, Qiaoniang
left the door open for me.

20
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,960
You go in first.

21
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,800
I'll wait outside.

22
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,920
Okay, Zhan.

23
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,430
Candied hawthorn.

24
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,220
Candied hawthorn.

25
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,640
- Young Master.
- Candied hawthorn.

26
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,480
Young Master.

27
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,040
Young Master.

28
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,640
Didn't you say

29
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,270
men don't eat candied hawthorn?

30
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,040
In front of my sister,

31
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,880
I am a man.

32
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,480
In front of you, I'm your master.

33
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,800
I'll eat.

34
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,380
(Miss Jiang Si, always available)

35
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,800
So sweet.

36
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,480
Young Master.

37
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,040
Aren't you Jiang Zhan?

38
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,400
Last time, you left

39
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,200
after offending
Marquis Changxing's heir.

40
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,520
- This time,
- Flowers!

41
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,510
it won't be so easy.

42
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,570
Take a look!

43
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,460
Marquis Changxing's heir
is my brother-in-law.

44
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,480
What's it to you?

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,040
I just don't like the look of you.

46
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,360
What do you want?

47
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,320
If you want to fight,

48
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,120
I can do that.

49
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,910
But there are so many people here.

50
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,200
If we really fight,

51
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,240
it won't be long
before the officers come.

52
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,080
You won't get to have fun, right?

53
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,020
Let's change the place.

54
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,600
Good.

55
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,470
Young Master, your wound...

56
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,760
Tell my sister I have to go now.

57
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,200
Your father's here.

58
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,600
Chase him!

59
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,590
- Is he there?
- No.

60
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,200
- Is he here?
- No.

61
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,190
I'm here.

62
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,320
Jiang Zhan!

63
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,320
Young Master Zhan.

64
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,680
- The fruit looks fresh.
- Try some.

65
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,200
- Are they just picked?
- Yes.

66
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,190
I'll try one.

67
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,560
Put it on my family's account.

68
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,830
Thank you, Young Master Zhan.

69
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,760
So sweet.

70
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,420
Thanks for the compliment.

71
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,200
How straight
the lonely smoke of the desert is.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,080
How round the setting sun
over the river is.

73
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,270
Isn't this the setting sun of Ling'an?

74
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,910
Ling'an is really prosperous.

75
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,560
But the setting sun is not good enough.

76
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,110
Wait.

77
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,000
Where are you from?

78
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,880
How can you look down
on our setting sun?

79
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,800
What a narrow-minded frog.

80
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,270
I'm narrow-minded?

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,880
Tell me. Where is the best setting sun?

82
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,940
(Lu Chuchu, Yu Qi's senior)

83
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,590
Of course, it's outside the pass.

84
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,690
How straight
the lonely smoke of the desert is.

85
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,490
How round the setting sun
over the river is.

86
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,540
Have you heard of it?

87
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,540
It's about the scenery outside the pass.

88
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,440
Sound like you've been outside the pass.

89
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,590
Of course.

90
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,030
I'm traveling the world

91
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,680
to see

92
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,470
all the world's beautiful views.

93
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,510
I don't want to talk to you.

94
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,560
I don't want to talk to you either.

95
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,200
- Trinkets.
- Hey.

96
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,830
Miss, what would you like?

97
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,960
- This one.
- Eight wen each.

98
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,800
Sure.

99
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,640
You jerk.

100
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,660
You talked to me

101
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,220
so your accomplice could steal my money.

102
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,070
What?

103
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,040
What money?

104
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,880
Stop pretending.

105
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,820
Hurry and give it back.

106
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,950
Little girl,

107
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,160
you're so unreasonable.

108
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,310
You're not smart either.

109
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,390
What are you saying?

110
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,480
I'm saying you're not smart.

111
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,680
Your beauty is such a waste.

112
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,790
- You...
- What?

113
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,200
Come down if you dare.

114
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,720
What are you doing?

115
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,640
- Give me my money back.
- Pull me up.

116
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,700
Women shouldn't touch men.

117
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,800
Give me my money back.

118
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,640
Do I look like someone

119
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,950
who would steal your money?

120
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,690
You have a frivolous and rogue look.

121
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,880
You must've ruined your family

122
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,270
so you do this shady business now.

123
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,360
What are you doing?

124
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,200
Help!

125
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,240
She's harassing me!

126
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,080
Shut up.

127
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,950
Stop framing me.

128
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,880
She's robbing me!

129
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
Hurry! Help!

130
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,120
I don't have time to waste with you.

131
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,160
Since you don't admit it,

132
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,400
I'll take this as compensation.

133
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,220
I... I...

134
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,720
Aren't the locals here

135
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,860
supposed to be good swimmers?

136
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,040
Hey, you frog.

137
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,160
How come you can't even swim?

138
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,350
Everyone, leave.

139
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,070
Shopkeeper,

140
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,630
bring me a cup of hot tea.

141
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,470
Alright.

142
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,350
- Thank you.
- No problem.

143
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,880
Is he dead?

144
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,830
Wake up.

145
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,760
Wake up.

146
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,050
- Wake up.
- Young Master Zhan!

147
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,390
- Wake up.
- Young Master Zhan!

148
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,680
Ji, hurry. Young Master Zhan...

149
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,040
Wake up.

150
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,880
Zhan!

151
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,800
Si, I'm here!

152
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,830
Zhan!

153
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,750
- Zhan, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

154
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,840
Zhan, didn't you promise me

155
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,220
you wouldn't come to the riverbank?

156
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,360
Didn't I tell you?

157
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,750
You can't come to any riverbank.

158
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,800
I forgot.

159
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,680
How could you forget?

160
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,380
You promised me.

161
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,380
You can't swim.
You can't come to the riverbank.

162
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,280
Si, don't worry.

163
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,470
I promise you.

164
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,450
I swear to the heavens.

165
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,870
It's not about swearing.

166
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,400
I just want you to be safe.

167
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,320
You can't swim,

168
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,340
but you keep coming here.

169
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,380
It makes me worry.

170
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,750
I know I'm wrong.

171
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,320
Look, I'm fine.

172
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,180
Nothing's wrong. See?

173
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,900
Are you fine
after falling into the river?

174
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,620
I'm totally fine.

175
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,110
Sorry about this, Miss.

176
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,080
Miss, are you

177
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,440
a friend of my brother's?

178
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,280
What friend?

179
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,590
She's a robber.

180
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,500
What are you looking at?

181
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,230
Isn't it because of you?

182
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,640
Si,

183
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,400
I just talked to her.

184
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,920
She lost her money

185
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,180
and accused me of being a thief.

186
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,710
Then she took my money.

187
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,870
This is outrageous.

188
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,200
Since you didn't steal it,

189
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,200
take your money back.

190
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,450
It was mine in the first place.

191
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,440
What? You want to walk away?

192
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,160
Miss,

193
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,350
take this money for now.

194
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,680
Why, Si?

195
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,080
Your money was stolen;

196
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,380
my brother is partly responsible.

197
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,480
This is

198
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,520
a little gesture from us.

199
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,520
No need.

200
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,950
It's a misunderstanding.

201
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,470
I'm not someone who takes advantage.

202
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,310
I know

203
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,200
you must be

204
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,280
a reasonable person.

205
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,350
How about this?

206
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,230
This money is like a loan from me.

207
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,680
You must be new

208
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,160
to Ling'an

209
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,120
and probably need money

210
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,040
for many things.

211
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,950
Take this money first.

212
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,480
When you're in a better position,

213
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,530
you can return it to me
at Earl Dongping's Mansion.

214
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,200
You seem like a good person,

215
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,990
much better than your brother.

216
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,110
Thank you, Miss.

217
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,310
You're welcome.

218
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,350
Rest assured.

219
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,080
I will definitely return your money.

220
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,400
Okay.

221
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,470
Goodbye.

222
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,050
Si, you're letting the tiger
return to the mountain.

223
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,950
Stop talking.

224
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,200
My money...

225
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,520
By the way, my name is Lu Chuchu.

226
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,520
What's your name?

227
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,680
I'm Jiang Si.

228
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,230
Alright, I'll remember you.

229
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,160
Miss Jiang, see you.

230
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,440
Take care, Miss.

231
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,670
On, no.

232
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,160
The money is gone.

233
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,190
Zhan.

234
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,230
Enemies are best resolved.

235
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,280
Miss, how did you know

236
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,320
these formulas?

237
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,920
This combination is right.

238
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,470
That one too.

239
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,750
Senior, smell this.

240
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,320
It smells so good.

241
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,560
Look. Is this right?

242
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,560
I learned

243
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,440
the formulas from books.

244
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,590
Miss, you're really amazing.

245
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,440
Unlike you,

246
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,950
I can't even recognize a single word.

247
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,990
I'm just a blind fool.

248
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,950
Silly girl.

249
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,710
If you want to learn,

250
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,270
I'll teach you in the future.

251
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,440
Give me the bracelet.

252
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,460
But Miss,

253
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,320
why are you bringing
sleeping incense pills

254
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,990
to Marquis Changxing's Mansion?

255
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,110
I'm sensitive to beds.

256
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,080
When I go to unfamiliar places,

257
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,520
I have nightmares.

258
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,630
Miss Chi.

259
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,470
Niuniu.

260
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,430
Niuniu.

261
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,320
None of you are getting away.

262
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,100
You still want to run?

263
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,400
Come here.

264
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,520
Come here.

265
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,950
Miss Chi.

266
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,750
It's your turn.

267
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,590
Your turn.

268
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,710
Come.

269
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,040
Come on.

270
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,640
Come.

271
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,280
Come.

272
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,230
Come on.

273
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,070
Come.

274
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,040
Run?

275
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
You want to run?

276
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,870
Keep running.

277
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,700
(Modest Gentleman)
Run.

278
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,550
Run.

279
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,680
You want to run?

280
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,000
Run then.

281
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,470
Keep running.

282
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:38,500
(Marquis Changxing's Mansion)

283
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,460
(Talents Galore on Blessed Land)

284
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:58,260
(Marquis Changxing's Mansion)

285
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,240
Qian.

286
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,040
Pei.

287
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,260
(Jiang Qiao, Jiang Si's third sister)

288
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,350
Qiao.

289
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,710
You finally arrived.

290
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,320
Sorry for the wait.

291
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,080
Sorry for the trouble.

292
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,400
It's okay.

293
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,990
I'm so glad

294
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,680
you could come.

295
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,360
You must be tired

296
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,200
from the journey.

297
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,830
I've prepared tea, snacks, and meals
in the flower hall.

298
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,520
Let's go.

299
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,140
(Capital Security Office, Court)

300
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,290
Chief,

301
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,790
I went to check that Tianxiang House

302
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,630
Jiang Zhan mentioned.

303
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,280
I haven't found anything suspicious.

304
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,280
There are too few clues

305
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,910
to uncover anything.

306
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,360
I came to Ling'an

307
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,270
to investigate

308
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,390
the Nanwu incident,

309
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,560
which will take some time.

310
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,280
It won't be easy.

311
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,080
Now...

312
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,520
Now what?

313
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,670
Now, we should focus on our job.

314
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,390
The priority of Capital Security

315
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,830
is to find Ms. Xiu's daughter.

316
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,520
Yes.

317
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,510
I'll get the case file.

318
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,590
Please come this way.

319
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,720
Qian,

320
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,200
this garden is really big.

321
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,520
The peonies are so beautiful.

322
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,350
After we finish the meal,

323
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,200
I'll take you

324
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,420
for a walk around the garden.

325
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,800
Si, sit here.

326
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,000
Qiao, sit down.

327
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,190
Make yourself comfortable here.

328
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,560
Just treat it like home.

329
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,480
Qian, should we

330
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,110
go greet the Marchioness first?

331
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,070
I've mentioned

332
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,720
that you were coming for a short stay.

333
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,230
The Marchioness said

334
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,560
since you just arrived today,

335
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,760
you should rest first

336
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,870
and greet her tomorrow morning.

337
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,070
(Qiao is like)

338
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,910
(the old me,)

339
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,760
(cautious and careful,)

340
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,620
(always afraid of making mistakes.)

341
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,880
You must be hungry.

342
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,720
Let's have some food.

343
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,350
Darling, I'm back.

344
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,240
- Xingyu.
- Honey.

345
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,080
Xingyu.

346
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,110
Your sisters are here.

347
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,110
Good.

348
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,830
Qian.

349
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,640
Let go of me.

350
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,670
You smell so good.

351
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,340
- Let go of me.
- Still want to run?

352
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,800
Let go of me.

353
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,710
I forgot to send someone to tell you

354
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,830
that my sisters have arrived.

355
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,200
I didn't know

356
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,350
you were coming at this time.

357
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,480
I was too abrupt.

358
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,830
Take good care of them.

359
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,000
I'll go to the study.

360
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,590
Take care, honey.

361
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,670
Qiao, Si, please sit.

362
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,070
Qian.

363
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,310
Does Xingyu

364
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,960
dine with you every day?

365
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,910
Yes.

366
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,280
You are so affectionate.

367
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,000
Don't tease me.

368
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,450
These are the cases

369
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,450
of all the missing women
in the past five years.

370
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,150
So many.

371
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,240
All cold cases?

372
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,150
Yes.

373
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,920

(The Map of Ling'an)

377
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,630
What's wrong, Chief?

378
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,630
Is there a problem?

379
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,560
These marks are the places

380
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,880
where the missing women

381
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,240
were last seen.

These are the places

383
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,720
where the missing women
have been seen in the past year.

384
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,080
Did you notice anything?

385
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,640
No matter
if it's from the past five years

386
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,670
or the past year,

387
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,350
nothing has happened

388
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,240
(White Tiger Bridge)
in this area.

389
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,510
This stone from the artificial hill

390
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,800
was brought from South Lake.

391
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,150
This is called the Bayin Pavilion.

392
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,150
Qian,

393
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,520
those peonies look so beautiful.

394
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,280
You came at just the right time.

395
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,390
If you had come a little later,

396
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,910
the peonies would've withered.

397
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,680
Shall we go

398
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,520
enjoy the flowers?

399
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,880
I'm not used

400
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,910
to the scent of peonies.

401
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,200
How about this?

402
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,560
I'll rest in the pavilion.

403
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,820
You can do as you please.

404
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,280
I'll accompany you to the pavilion.

405
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,740
Alright.

406
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,760
Si, let's go together.

407
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,390
Alright.

408
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:15,870
Chief,

409
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,030
those two people

410
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,870
were just bought off.

411
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,620
Would it be useful for us
to find them now?

412
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,480
We're already here. No more talking.

413
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,660
(Wonton)

414
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,960
Come here.

415
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,790
My Lord, we know we are wrong.

416
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,080
We won't dare again, My Lord.

417
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes, yes.

418
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,240
We were confused

419
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,520
and blinded by money.

420
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,310
We only did this one wrong thing.

421
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,320
I'm not asking about that.

422
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,560
Have you seen the woman
in the painting?

423
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,440
Who is this?

424
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,800
This woman in the picture

425
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,280
went missing earlier this year.

426
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,960
Where are you going?

427
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,720
I'm standing here.

428
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,960
Where are you going?

429
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,150
Jump down, then.

430
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,670
My Lord,

431
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,190
please spare us.

432
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,140
We don't dare to discuss matters

433
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,680
about major officials.

434
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,520
What major officials?

435
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,750
She's not the only woman missing.

436
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,760
This is a major case.

437
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,550
It's

438
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,910
Marquis Changxing's heir.

439
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,040
This is the woman who came

440
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,590
with Marquis Changxing's heir.

441
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,760
That day, the heir

442
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,120
brought this woman

443
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,000
to my stall

444
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,840
for some wonton.

445
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,400
A customer finished eating,

446
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,240
stood up to leave,

447
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,760
and accidentally hit the heir.

448
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,560
That customer apologized,

449
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,110
but the heir wouldn't let it go.

450
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,630
He was so scary.

451
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,310
Yes, yes.

452
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,910
A lot of people saw it.

453
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,430
That woman even tried

454
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,430
to talk to the heir.

455
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,510
At this time,

456
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,480
the peonies are
at the end of the season.

457
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,160
The peonies elsewhere

458
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,110
often look

459
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,080
a little wilted,

460
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,550
but look at these here.

461
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,560
They are so beautiful.

462
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,350
This one looks nice.

463
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,590
That one too.

464
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,450
The flowers here bloom like a sunset.

465
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,190
It's truly a rare sight.

466
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,560
Si, what's wrong?

467
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,310
Nothing.

468
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,650
(Why is there a foul smell
among the floral scent?)

469
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,320
(I recognize this smell.)

470
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,660
(It's the smell of a corpse.)

471
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,590
(Under these peonies...)

472
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,120
It's really beautiful.

473
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,350
Qiao, don't touch it.

474
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,590
Si, why can't I touch it?

475
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,150
These flowers...

476
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,830
I can smell a bad odor.

477
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,760
Can't you smell it?

478
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,590
Now that you mention it,
it does seem like it.

479
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,430
It's not gold or silver.

480
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,000
What material is this?

481
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,320
It's a copper hairpin.

482
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,800
A copper hairpin?

483
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,970
I noticed

484
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:29,920
that even the maids here

485
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,190
wear gold or silver hairpins.

486
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,550
Why is there

487
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,520
a copper hairpin here?

488
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,070
(If a corpse is buried)

489
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,190
(under these peonies,)

490
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,690
(could this copper hairpin)

491
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,040
(belong to the victim?)

492
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,240
What are you two doing?

493
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,110
Young Master Cao.

494
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,150
Hello, Xingyu.

495
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,830
I'm admiring the flowers with Si.

496
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,190
(Can someone really be so cruel?)

497
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,070
(I need to find another chance)

498
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,240
(to investigate again.)

499
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,670
The peonies here

500
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,430
do bloom better than anywhere else.

501
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,480
Please, take your time.

502
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,240
Pei, have some perilla drink.

503
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,390
Qian,

504
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,110
Si really looks beautiful.

505
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,270
Standing among the peonies,

506
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,320
she's more beautiful than the flowers.

507
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,550
Even Xingyu couldn't help

508
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,390
but look at her.

509
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,480
It's so delicious.

510
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,630
Did I say something wrong?

511
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,760
No.

512
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,110
Among us,

513
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,800
even in all of Ling'an,

514
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,550
there's hardly anyone

515
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,630
who can surpass Si in looks.

516
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,910
I feel honored to have a sister

517
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,830
who is as beautiful as Luoshen.

518
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,130
Even if she's as pretty as a goddess,

519
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,160
she can't compare to you.

520
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,080
You married well.

521
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,720
Xingyu is cultured and elegant,

522
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,200
and he's Marquis Changxing's heir

523
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,870
of noble status.

524
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,240
Now, look at Si.

525
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,000
She canceled her engagement.

526
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,690
She'll most likely never get married.

527
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,520
Qian,

528
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,630
we're sisters.

529
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,430
I can't help but remind you

530
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,630
to be wary of Si.

531
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Don't let her stay

532
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,000
with Xingyu.

533
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,680
(Once Cao Xingyu targets a woman,)

534
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,390
(he won't stop until he has her.)

535
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,200
(It's Jiang Si's fault)

536
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,560
(for being too attractive)

537
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,720
(and losing the engagement)

538
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,480
(with Duke An's son.)

539
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,430
(I don't need to feel guilty.)

540
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,910
Lady Si.

541
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,440
Qian.

542
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,560
Why aren't you two
playing a little longer?

543
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,830
The peonies are indeed beautiful,

544
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,190
but the fragrance is too strong.

545
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,920
It's unbearable
if you stay for too long.

546
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,180
However beautiful a scene is,

547
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,260
it loses its charm
if you look at it for too long.

548
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,110
Sit and rest then.

549
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,310
Bring over the freshly-made

550
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,430
perilla drink for them.

551
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,190
Are you tired?

552
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,320
I'll have a maid take you to rest.

553
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,960
I'll listen to you.

554
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,790
The West and East Chambers
where the heir stays

555
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,730
have always been empty.

556
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,760
Qiao, Pei,

557
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,040
you two can stay in the West Chamber.

558
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,630
Si can stay in the East Chamber.

559
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,630
What do you think?

560
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,000
(It's easier for him if I live alone.)

561
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,200
(That's good.)

562
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,350
(Then Qiao won't be dragged)

563
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,270
(into this.)

564
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,310
Why should Si get to stay

565
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,480
in a separate chamber?

566
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,550
Pei.

567
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,390
Qian,

568
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,690
I don't want to stay

569
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,850
in the same chamber as Qiao.

570
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,920
She's so quiet.

571
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,260
It'll be boring to live with her.

572
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,910
Then I'll stay in the West Chamber
with Si.

573
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,590
Pei can stay in the East Chamber.

574
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,680
Alright.

575
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,040
Pei is worried that her teeth grinding

576
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,630
at night will scare you.

577
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,430
Qiao, are you scared?

578
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,750
If it's not a problem,

579
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,760
then it's settled.

580
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,590
Si, we haven't met in a long time.

581
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,030
I'll visit you tonight

582
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,000
to chat with you.

583
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,590
(Are you that eager?)

584
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,390
(I fell into this trap before.)

585
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,960
(How could I fall for it again?)

586
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,670
I saw you not long ago.

587
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,960
If I talk with you again,

588
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,030
Pei might get jealous,

589
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,110
saying I've been

590
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,950
monopolizing you.

591
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,960
Pei, on the other hand,

592
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,430
hasn't seen you in a long time.

593
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,230
I'm sure she has

594
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,240
a lot to say to you.

595
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,480
Yes, yes, Qian.

596
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,390
Alright.

597
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,830
I'll accompany Pei tonight

598
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,430
and go find you tomorrow.

599
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,430
(It's hard to bring him down,)

600
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,860
(but however difficult,)

601
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,150
(I'll make sure he pays the price.)

602
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,110
Si has endured such humiliation.

603
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,430
How can we keep quiet?

604
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,960
Even if I risk my life,

605
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,030
I will never

606
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,720
let Cao Xingyu have it easy.

607
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,080
Let's go, Si.

608
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,630
Let's report to the authorities.

609
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,310
Brother, you can't go.

610
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,320
No one steps out of this door.

611
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,520
Grandmother, what do you mean?

612
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,520
Brother, stop causing a scene.

613
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,960
If this continues,

614
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,240
Si's reputation will be ruined.

615
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,710
How will she ever hold her head high

616
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,830
at Duke An's Mansion?

617
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,200
You're just trying to save
your daughter's face.

618
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,590
Is your daughter's face

619
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:13,350
more important than Si's innocence?

620
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,790
Si is my niece.

621
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,430
I'm worried about her too.

622
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,720
Si has been wronged.

623
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,830
We're definitely concerned.

624
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,110
But given the Marquis's status,

625
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,030
even if you report it,

626
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,280
what will it do?

627
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,270
It's like hitting a stone with an egg.

628
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,110
Uncle Anmou,

629
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,760
you're worried
that offending the Marquis

630
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,190
would ruin your promotion, right?

631
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,310
That's too harsh.

632
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,630
Let's go.

633
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,240
If you step out of this door today,

634
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,270
Ancheng, you can come back

635
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,480
and collect my corpse.

636
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,510
My Lady, don't do that.

637
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,350
My Lady.

638
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,040
My Lady, don't do that.

639
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,760
Mother, don't.

640
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,280
Father.

641
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,280
Father.

642
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,780
(Haitang Chamber)
Si.

643
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,240
Sorry for my incapability.

644
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,920
I've asked many girls

645
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,390
who've been wronged by him,

646
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,240
but no one is willing

647
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,480
to come forward as a witness.

648
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,960
Many of the girls

649
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,920
have gone missing.

650
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,520
I think he's behind it.

651
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,760
Many girls

652
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,870
have gone missing?

653
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,480
It's only a suspicion.

654
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,870
Without evidence,

655
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,040
how can we report it?

656
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,760
Father,

657
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,630
forget it.

658
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,000
Let's not pursue it any further.

659
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,720
Aunt Xiao is right.

660
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,430
That jerk didn't succeed.

661
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,630
If this escalates,

662
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,030
it will be difficult for me

663
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,080
to lift my head in front

664
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,040
of my mother-in-law and husband.

665
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,830
Miss, Lady Qiao has come.

666
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,150
Si.

667
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,480
Qiao.

668
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,760
Why haven't you rested yet?

669
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,480
Si.

670
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,350
Can I sleep with you?

671
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,390
I'm used to sleeping alone.

672
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,160
I'm a bit uncomfortable

673
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,520
with the change of place.

674
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,640
I need someone familiar

675
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,760
to sleep soundly.

676
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,480
Just sleep with me tonight.

677
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,360
I'm used to sleeping alone.

678
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,560
I really can't sleep.

679
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,230
Just stay with me for one night.

680
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,070
Okay?

681
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,560
Nuo, make the bed.

682
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,080
How about this?

683
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,240
You sleep inside.

684
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,590
Si, I'm used to sleeping on the outside.

685
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,640
I didn't expect you to have

686
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,190
so many requirements for sleeping.

687
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,630
Tonight, just let me

688
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,350
sleep on the outside.

689
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,640
- You should...
- It's late.

690
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,630
Let's sleep.

691
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,960
(Last time, Qiao didn't come.)

692
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,520
(Why is she here this time?)

693
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,150
(And)

694
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,150
(Qiao isn't usually so insistent.)

695
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,350
(What's going on today?)

696
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,960
(Qian and her husband are targeting me.)

697
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,350
(If Jiang Qiao is always with me,)

698
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,430
(it'll be dangerous for her.)

699
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,110
(Since they can hurt me,)

700
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,690
(they absolutely won't)

701
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,080
(show mercy to Jiang Qiao.)

702
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,590
(Only tonight.)

703
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,630
(I can't let her cling to me tomorrow.)

704
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,000
(As for tonight...)

705
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,560
Nuo, light the lamp.

706
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,110
Nuo, Aman, light the lamp.

707
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,960
Hurry and light the lamp.

708
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,520
Alright, you can leave now.

709
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,040
Stay outside.

710
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,760
Yes.

711
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,560
Si.

712
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,110
Did you see him?

713
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,480
Cao Xingyu is a beast.

714
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,390
Qiao,

715
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,840
you already suspected.

716
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,000
Si, we'll return tomorrow.

717
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,150
Qian will definitely

718
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,000
try to stop us.

719
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,590
Is she going to physically stop us

720
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,520
from leaving?

721
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,670
Si.

722
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,990
Qian...

723
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,230
Si, let's go back tomorrow.

724
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,550
- Okay?- No.

725
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,190
Right now, in their eyes,

726
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,750
you're an outsider.

727
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,150
If you demand

728
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,310
to leave tomorrow morning...

729
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,230
As you sleep with me tonight,

730
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,150
and that beast comes by,

731
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,360
they'll surely think

732
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,710
you've discovered something.

733
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,270
Qiao, give me some time.

734
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,670
I'll go check it out.

735
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:54,920
I'll go with you.

736
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,760
It's fine.

737
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,280
The heir went out last night,

738
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,720
and he looked off when he came back.

739
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,760
He may be upset

740
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,150
so he came for her.

741
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,110
She's unlucky

742
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,230
and is meant to die today.

743
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,040
Anzi, help me. Hurry.

744
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,570
I'll go get the spade.

745
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,880
It has nothing to do with me.

746
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:57,980
Don't come looking for me.

747
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,670
It was the heir who killed you.

748
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,480
You'll be buried soon.

749
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,080
One of the spades is missing.

750
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,190
Did someone take it?

751
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,230
How could that happen?

752
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,190
The gardener tidied up for us earlier.

753
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,550
After we scolded them,

754
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,920
no one dared to touch it again.

755
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,480
Get a hoe. Hurry.

756
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,310
What's wrong?

757
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,270
Her hand...

758
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,630
There's a ghost.

759
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,070
Don't blame me.

760
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,630
You shouldn't have seen this.

761
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,630
Do we have to kill her?

762
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,840
Should we give her to the heir?

763
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,080
If she doesn't die, we will.

764
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,120
Hurry up and help.

765
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,160
Hurry.

766
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,120
(I can't die.)

767
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,560
(I can't die.)

768
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,000
Yu Qi?

769
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,560
Yu what? Hurry and run.

770
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,040
Why are you here?

771
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,280
Looks like Commandant Yu

772
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,710
isn't good at investigating.

773
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,510
You didn't even know

774
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,920
Marquis Changxing's heir

775
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,080
is my son-in-law.

776
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,710
You're still making jokes.

777
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,670
If I hadn't arrived in time,

778
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,360
you wouldn't have had
the chance to joke.

779
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,520
Then why are you here?

780
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,350
I'm investigating the missing cases.

781
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,960
I think it's related to Cao Xingyu.

782
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,310
Did he do anything to you?

783
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,630
What should he have done to me?

784
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,640
That's good.

785
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,560
Why do they want to kill you?

786
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,520
If you want to live, don't move.

787
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:53,950
Listen carefully.

788
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,920
Tonight, after you finish your work,

789
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,840
you lie down here and sleep.

790
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,560
You haven't met anyone.

791
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,030
Got it?

792
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,960
You haven't got it then.

793
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,520
Look, this is what I found
in the flower bushes.

794
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,190
I saw them

795
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,870
killing and burying the body.

796
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,870
I suspect

797
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,440
there may be more victims.

798
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,400
They are so bold.

799
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,750
Businesswomen often wear
copper hairpins.

800
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,400
Tomorrow, I will go verify.

801
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,150
If Ms. Xiu's daughter

802
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,000
really has died,

803
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,800
- what should she do?
- Enough.

804
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,780
Stop worrying about others.

805
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,150
Worry about yourself for a moment.

806
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,640
It's too dangerous here. Come with me.

807
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,990
Yu Qi,

808
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:40,950
I can't leave.

809
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,000
Tell me why.

810
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,920
Why can't you leave?

811
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,190
If I leave now,

812
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,510
Cao Xingyu will think of ways

813
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,520
to deal with my family.

814
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,360
My second sister is his wife.

815
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,470
Although...

816
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,270
Although it was her

817
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,110
who brought me here...

818
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,510
There's also my third sister.

819
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,510
She's so weak,

820
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,040
yet she's still trying to protect me.

821
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,110
And my fifth sister...

822
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:00,960
- Wait.
- She...

823
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,000
What do you mean?

824
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,470
Your second sister brought you here?

825
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,720
No, it's too dangerous here.

826
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,080
I'll take you home now.

827
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,430
After we get back,
I'll report to the Capital Security.

828
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,680
Yu Qi,

829
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,040
calm down.

830
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,190
Marquis Changxing has imperial favor,

831
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,000
and Cao Xingyu is his only son.

832
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,230
I know very well

833
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,560
that acting impulsively

834
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,150
will only alert the enemy.

835
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:27,990
Jiang Si,

836
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,840
I've found the witness.

837
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,400
That's the crime scene.

838
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,240
If I bring people over to search,

839
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,360
we'll surely find evidence.

840
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,200
It's useless.

841
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,070
Without thorough preparation,

842
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,830
the evidence will vanish,

843
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,800
and the witnesses will disappear
into thin air.

844
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,110
What do you mean?

845
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,110
Have you already

846
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:44,960
done something?

847
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,630
Anyway, you must trust me.

848
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,590
I really can't leave.

849
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,880
If I leave now,

850
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,150
it will only alert them,

851
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,870
and your case
will be delayed indefinitely.

852
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,410
Who will answer for those

853
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,970
who've lost their daughters and sisters?

854
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,100
Marquis Changxing's Mansion

855
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,310
is no ordinary place.

856
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,560
This needs careful planning.

857
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,270
We can't rush into anything.

858
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,060
