00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,240
who matches your influence,

195
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,910
your status,

196
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,630
and your background.

197
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,120
Jiang Si

198
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,430
is indeed pretty.

199
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,120
She has her mother's allure as well.

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,600
It's hard not to fall for her.

201
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,670
But you know what?

202
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,790
Your relationship is transient.

203
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,240
Even without my meddling,

204
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,510
you're not meant to be.

205
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,000
Who's there?

206
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,120
I want you gone.

207
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:30,790
Let her in.

208
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,270
Warm, caring, and full of tenderness.

209
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,030
I suppose Su Ke used

210
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,480
the same trick to seduce
my father back then.

211
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,960
You got rejected

212
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,670
by Commandant Yu,

213
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,670
but why are you taking it out on me?

214
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,910
Since you spoke ill

215
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,840
of my mother and me,

216
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,630
perhaps you could try

217
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,270
seducing him too.

218
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,840
See if it works.

219
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,670
The method's nature doesn't matter

220
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,240
as long as it works.

221
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,670
Shameless woman.

222
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,200
You thought it was a compliment?

223
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,630
You came uninvited

224
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,240
to speak with Commandant Yu

225
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,670
and even forced him to chat with you.

226
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,550
That is an act of seduction.

227
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,790
However, it didn't work
on Commandant Yu.

228
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,840
I've never seen a girl

229
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,480
who refuses to leave

230
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,310
despite the rejection.

231
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Impressive, Your Highness.

232
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,030
Very courageous.

233
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,150
An upright woman like me

234
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,720
can't even compare.

235
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,760
Your Highness, will you leave,

236
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,200
or must I make you?

237
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,670
Stop.

238
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,120
He is the Seventh Prince.

239
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,510
You should know your place.

240
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,630
You'll regret this.

241
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,720
You know it now.

242
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,480
I wanted to tell you.

243
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,080
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

244
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,150
Your Highness, please mind your conduct.

245
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,150
I was unaware of your identity.

246
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,480
My apologies.

247
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,910
Aman, let's go.

248
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,910
Yu Jin, you deserve a wife

249
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,120
who matches your influence,

250
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,840
your status,

251
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,510
and your background.

252
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,880
Come and eat.

253
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,550
Dig in.

254
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,600
Neither of you are eating.

255
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,150
Chief.

256
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,630
Who would split firewood

257
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,670
in the middle of the night?

258
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,390
Besides,

259
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
we are fighters,

260
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,120
not exactly woodcutters.

261
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,270
Come on, stop.

262
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,630
If it's necessary,

263
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,120
I'll apologize to Miss Jiang for you.

264
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,200
All right?

265
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,200
Whoah.

266
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,150
Take this.

267
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,240
For murder?

268
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,310
Tell her to come at me

269
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,030
instead of keeping all the frustration

270
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,960
to herself.

271
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,840
Relax, Chief.

272
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,360
Miss Jiang will feel

273
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,880
your sincerity once I apologize

274
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,670
to her.

275
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,240
I'll go now.

276
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,120
Go on.

277
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,630
This

278
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,030
is for my husband,

279
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,270
Yu Qi.

280
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,880
Why did you kill him too?

281
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,270
Do you truly think

282
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,880
he's simply the Yu Qi you know?

283
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,910
Yu Qi is the Seventh Prince

284
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,270
known to bear an ill fate.

285
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,310
He has never mentioned it.

286
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,310
The Princess Royal

287
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,880
must have felt threatened

288
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,150
after learning his real identity.

289
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,360
So, she took Yu Qi's command
over the army

290
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,430
and seized the Red Plume Cavalry

291
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,240
to tell the world he was dead.

292
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,240
But Cui Mingyue

293
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,360
fell in love with Yu Qi,

294
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,910
so his life was spared.

295
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,310
He was trapped in the palace.

296
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,000
My Lady, are you still upset?

297
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,120
Perhaps

298
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,880
I could use the secret passage

299
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,080
and talk to Commandant Yu.

300
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,670
No, the Seventh Prince.

301
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,670
I'll beat him up

302
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,720
for you.

303
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,390
Who says I'm upset about him?

304
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm mad at myself.

305
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,510
I should have

306
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,670
known him better.

307
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,310
He's kept me in the dark for so long.

308
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,350
However,

00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,680
you two haven't known each other

310
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,310
for that long.

311
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,310
From the annulled engagement,

312
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,720
to when he moved in,

313
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,030
and...

314
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,200

the Crown Prince
and Her Highness are close.

334
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,030
Last night, I tailed him and found

335
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,350
that His Highness

336
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,640
and a high-ranking official

337
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,790
went to Her Highness' mansion together.

by His Highness' guard.

342

I did my best to escape.

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,440
I went to the palace

to greet Mother today.

369
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,720

had returned

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,510

00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,680
how I should approach a brother

00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,960
I haven't seen in years.

379
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,590
But from what I heard from Mother,

380
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,030
His Majesty hasn't reinstated

381
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,350

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,590

384
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,270
Jin was summoned back

385
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,440
but was asked

386
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
to work with an alias.

387
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,240
What for?

388
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,350
Jin has garnered some influence

389
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,680
in the military.

390
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,070
The Red Plume Cavalry

391
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,110
he personally led

392
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,110
is famous.

393
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,960
But before that,

394
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,000
my father almost forgot

395
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,350
about this son.

396
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,400
So, why now?

397
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,270
Perhaps there are issues

398
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,070
no one else could handle,

399
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,350
except him.

400
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,720
Zhen Heng
of the Capital Administration Office

401
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,240
may be strong-willed,

402
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,550
but still a scholar nonetheless.

403
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,550
His methods are not aggressive.

404
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,550
Father tried Cao Xingyu personally.

405
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,400
Now, I suppose

406
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,870
Jin was the one who made it happen.

407
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,110
I know nothing about court affairs.

408
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,110
However, Jin is still a brother

409
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,550
who shares a mother with you.

410
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,550
Blood is thicker than water.

411
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,160
If he is influential in the military

412
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,070
as you mentioned,

413
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,790
I'm sure it will be
beneficial to have him

414
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,680
on your side.

415
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,790
Well said.

416
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,440
Father must have summoned Jin
back to Ling'an

417
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,760
because he's put the past

418
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,550
behind him.

419
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,310
Jin might get a powerful position.

420
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,270
Getting on his good side now

421
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,110
is a sound plan.

422
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,760
In my opinion,

423
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,160
we should throw him

424
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,550
a welcoming banquet at home.

425
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,000
From what I know, He isn't married yet.

426
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,790
I can invite some noble ladies

427
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,790
I know well

428
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,350
to liven things up.

429
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,720
How does that sound, Your Highness?

430
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:20,830
Sounds great!

431
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,870
It'll be a chance for me

432
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,680
to examine his personality.

433
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:29,070
I want to see
if he is after power, money,

434
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,790
or women.

435
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,270
Erniu!

436
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,680
Erniu!

437
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm counting on you.

438
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,680
Go!

439
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,110
Erniu?

440
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,510
Look, My Lady.

441
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,830
An apology.

442
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,680
[Qi]

443
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:38,870
Jin.

444
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,680
Jin.

445
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,440
We finally meet again,

446
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,030
my brother.

447
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:47,960
I prepared

448
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,920
a gift for you.

449
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

450
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,640
Don't be a stranger.

451
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,270
You can call me Zhang.

452
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,510
Zhang.

453
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,310
I didn't know you were back.

454
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,590
I can't believe

455
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,240
you live here.

456
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,720
It must have been tough.

457
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,070
Until you get your title back,

458
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,590
you can stay with me.

459
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:12,920
That won't be necessary.

460
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,590
I am used to

461
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,160
living by myself.

462
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,720
I shan't bother you

463
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,310
and your wife.

464
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,110
Don't be silly.

465
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,030
We are brothers.

466
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,350
However, I won't force you to move in

467
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,590
if you want to stay here.

468
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,510
You finally returned to Ling'an.

469
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,510
It's only right for us

470
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,720
to have a reunion.

471
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,200
My wife prepared a banquet for you

472
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,680
to welcome your return.

473
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,640
I...

474
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,110
You don't have to.

475
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,310
I like the quiet life here.

476
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,070
Yu Jin.

477
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,400
In Ling'an,

478
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,510
life gets difficult

479
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,480
without

480
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,480
proper socializing.

481
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,010
[Recipient: Yu Jin,
the Seventh Prince]

482
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,790
Thank you, Zhang.

483
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,790
I have work to tend to.

484
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,870
I must go now.

485
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,830
Very well. Go on ahead.

486
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,870
I'll wait for you at home.

487
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:16,830
Chief.

488
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,830
Are you going to the banquet?

489
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,400
Not a chance.

490
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,960
Your Highnesses,

491
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,640
the invitations for tomorrow's banquet

492
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,550
have been prepared

493
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,310
according to the list of names
we agreed on.

494
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,350
They've been delivered as well.

495
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,590
Add another one.

496
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,480
The Count of Dongping's Mansion.

497
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:37,760
Yes, sir.

498
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,400
The Count of Dongping's Mansion?

499
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,200
Jiang Si is indeed
one of the most famous beauties

500
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,240
in Ling'an City.

501
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,160
But she was once engaged to the son

502
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,110
of the Duke of Anguo.

503
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,590
Things got ugly

504
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,030
and her image was tarnished.

505
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,070
I'm concerned Jin might think

506
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,510
we took the matter too lightly.

507
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,070
That won't be a problem.

508
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,110
I'm more concerned

509
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,870
about the chances

510
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,350
of him not attending.

511
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,200
You are brothers of the same mother.

512
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,310
He wouldn't bring

513
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,720
such shame to you.

514
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,640
I hope you're right.

515
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:13,780
[Recipient, Jiang Si,
Daughter of the Count of Dongping]

516
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,870
Mother.

517
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,400
I don't want Si to go.

518
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,160
But this is

519
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,110
Prince Qi's banquet.

520
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
All the guests

521
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,960
are prominent figures

522
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,830
in Ling'an City.

523
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:25,960
If Si somehow

524
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,920
caught the eyes
of someone from a powerful family,

525
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,400
that's her fortune.

526
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,480
I don't want her

527
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,400
to get involved

528
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,960
with the rich and powerful.

529
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,240
She will likely suffer

530
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,350
if she marries one of them.

531
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,510
Ancheng, you worry too much.

532
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,590
In the past,

533
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,200
Si might indeed suffer

534
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,830
because of her personality.

535
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,000
But ever since she fell into the river,

536
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,030
she has become so headstrong.

537
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,790
I'd be glad

538
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,920
if she didn't make others suffer.

539
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,350
I wonder

540
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,000
if any of the rich and powerful

541
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,830
would want to marry her.

542
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,830
As if they are worthy

543
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,350
of my daughter!

544
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,510
Old Madam, Miss Si is here.

545
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,510
Grandmother.

546
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,240
Father.

547
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,480
Aunt Xiao.

548
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,440
Si,

549
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,720
did Afu catch you up to speed?

550
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,240
You got an invitation
from Prince Qi to attend

551
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,590
his banquet.

552
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,720
Proper preparations are due.

553
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,680
I have

554
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,920
a set of fine jadeite head ornaments.

555
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,350
Make sure you put it on.

556
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,310
I appreciate that.

557
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,400
But I have no intention

558
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,550
of attending it.

559
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,870
Is Prince Qi not worthy

560
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,760
of your attention?

561
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,920
I don't yearn for life

562
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,200
in a prominent family.

563
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,270
I only want a normal life.

564
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,680
Great! I expected nothing less
from my daughter!

565
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,160
Did you hear that?

566
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,240
See her temperament?

567
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,830
No son of a prestigious family

568
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,400
would dare mess with her.

569
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,200
That cursed Long Dan.

570
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,070
Why is he late?

571
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,110
Aman.

572
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:19,790
Aman.

573
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,680
Stop right there!

574
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,440
Miss Si doesn't want me to see you.

575
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,400
Aman.

576
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,870
Dear Aman.

577
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,400
Please tell me

578
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,350
how we can cheer

579
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,510
Miss Si up.

580
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,920
Chief is splitting firewood

581
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,240
out of frustration every day.

582
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,070
Now, there's enough firewood
to last until next year.

583
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,350
He won't eat

584
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,640
or sleep.

585
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,310
He's lost so much weight.

586
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,640
It pains me to see him like this.

587
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,270
Please.

588
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,440
He lied to Miss Si.

589
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,000
He deserves it!

590
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,920
You're an accomplice.
You deserve it too!

591
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,480
Chief only made

592
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,310
the same mistake

593
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,510
that all men make.

594
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,510
Why must Miss Jiang

595
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,680
be so unforgiving?

596
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,350
What?

597
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,350
Long Dan!

598
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:20,830
You know?

599
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,000
Miss Si got invited

600
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,070
to Prince Qi's banquet.

601
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:23,960
She will see

602
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,480
if every man in the world

603
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,720
is like Mr. Yu!

604
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,400
My Lady!

605
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,070
I won't stop you. Go ahead.

606
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,510
Fine, Long Dan!

607
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,240
So be it!

608
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,480
She can't go!

609
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,510
Aman, time to go.

610
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,790
They left.

611
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,510
I said, "Don't go!"

612
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,480
I thought it was "Go ahead."

613
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:10,510
[Princess Royal's Mansion]

614
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:18,720
Aunt.

615
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,070
What is it this time?

616
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,760
Aunt, did you know this?

617
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,310
Jin just came back
from the Southern Frontier

618
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,590
without telling anyone.

619
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,440
He is working with an alias

620
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,550
at the Capital Administration Office.

621
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,070
I was told even the Marquis of Changxing

622
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,440
was brought down by him.

623
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,270
Could it be

624
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,200
Father's order?

625
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,960
What is Father's stance

626
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,030
regarding Jin?

627
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,960
Is it going to affect my position

628
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,830
as the Crown Prince?

629
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,110
Calm down.

630
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,920
You are the Crown Prince.

631
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,310
You must stay composed.

632
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,350
Aunt, how can I not panic?

633
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,070
Father was never pleased with me.

634
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,070
I only

635
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,510
became the Crown Prince

636
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,400
because I was
the late Empress' only son.

637
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,480
Zhang and I have been

638
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,510
on equal footing for years.

639
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,680
Well...

640
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,960
Now, his brother, Jin,

641
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,760
made a sudden return.

642
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,590
He...

643
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,310
He is bound to be even more powerful.

644
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,790
Relax.

645
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,960
Yu Jin returned to Ling'an

646
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,200
without His Majesty's order.

647
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,640
His Majesty is just covering for him

648
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,310
due to fear of impeachment.

649
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,240
Really?

650
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,200
Why would I lie to you?

651
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:34,870
Sit.

652
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,270
Having said that,

653
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,000
he and Prince Qi have the same mother.

654
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,440
The Red Plume Cavalry respects him.

655
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,200
He is a threat.

656
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,870
You are right, Aunt.

657
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,200
I will be cautious.

658
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,920
Aunt, I wouldn't know what to do

659
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,270
without you.

660
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,000
How sweet of you to say so.

661
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,400
Mother?

662
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,510
It's rude to yell.

663
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,920
Mingyue is still innocent

664
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,350
like a child.

665
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,960
Lang, you're here too.

666
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:09,960
Mother.

667
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,110
Have you heard?

668
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,200
Prince Qi is throwing a banquet

669
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,870
to welcome the Seventh Prince's return.

670
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,640
What's the big deal?

671
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,000
I heard that Prince Qi invited

672
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,070
many noble ladies of Ling'an.

673
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,720
I suppose the banquet
is merely a facade.

674
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,680
He is actually matchmaking
for the Seventh Prince.

675
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,310
There are plenty of men
from the royal family.

676
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,240
You never seemed

677
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,550
so interested in any of them.

678
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,110
Lang.

679
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,510
Mother.

680
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,350
Perhaps you haven't heard.

681
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,760
When I fell

682
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,000
into the Jinshui River that day,

683
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,270
it was the Seventh Prince who saved me.

684
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:52,960
Your point being?

685
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,400
Therefore,

686
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,400
I want to...

687
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,440
You're in love with Yu Jin?

688
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,480
I can grant you anything else,

689
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,680
but you cannot be with Yu Jin.

690
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,760
Why not?

691
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,030
Just because you have a feud
with Imperial Concubine Xian,

692
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
and I'm not allowed

693
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,790
to marry the man I love?

694
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,760
He is a prince

695
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,350
destined for a life of misfortune.

696
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,400
He is not worthy

697
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,590
of your affection.

698
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
Mingyue, you're of age now.

699
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,000
It's time to talk about marriage.

700
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,920
I already have

701
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,350
a few candidates lined up for you.

702
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,440
I'll tell you about them.

703
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,110
I don't care.

704
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,400
I only want the Seventh Prince.

705
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,240
Aunt.

706
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,070
Mingyue is but a young girl.

707
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,070
It's normal for her to be lovestruck.

708
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,110
Besides,

709
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,270
Jin grew up

710
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,870
at the frontier.

711
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,640
He's not close with Prince Qi

712
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,350
and Imperial Concubine Xian.

713
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,200
If he marries Mingyue,

714
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,400
we can use him

715
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,110
to grow

716
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,960
our own influence.

717
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,070
How many times do I have to say it?

718
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,960
Mingyue must not get involved

719
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,240
with the power struggles!

720
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,600
Crown Prince,

721
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,200
did you forget?

722
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,120
You are right, Aunt.

723
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,520
I'll keep it in mind.

724
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,520
Guard!

725
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:12,870
Yes, ma'am.

726
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,989
Before Prince Qi's banquet ends,

727
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,159
watch the Princess closely.

728
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,469
She must not go outside.

729
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,239
Yes, ma'am.

730
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,469
Your Highness, please.

731
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,350
No fair!

732
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,389
Aunt, Mingyue is immature.

733
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,469
She didn't mean it.

734
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,949
Don't be upset.

735
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,120
I'll go talk to her.

736
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,199
Yu Jin,

737
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,949
the Seventh Prince...

738
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:55,830
Mingyue?

739
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:56,790
Mingyue?

740
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,430
What are you doing here?

741
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,990
You should stay in the room

742
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:02,990
for my mother's lecture.

743
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,120
Why are you out here?

744
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,240
I hate to see women cry.

745
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,080
Besides, you're my sister.

746
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,790
Mother was too mean.

747
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,160
Since I am grounded,

748
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,520
you can attend it for me.

749
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:18,990
Please.

750
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,080
Lang, please do me the favor.

751
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,830
Fine.

752
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,240
I will ruin

753
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,760
the banquet for you.

754
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,440
[Prince Qi's Mansion]

755
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,160
The world must have gone mad.

756
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,270
Even a nobody can enter

757
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,470
Prince Qi's Mansion.

758
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,200
I want to see it.

759
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,830
The invitation could be fake.

760
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,540
[Ji Fanghua, the third daughter]

761
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,310
[of the Duke of Anguo]
Nonsense!

762
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,720
It was Princess Consort Qi

763
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,080
who sent Miss Jiang the invitation.

764
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,240
What are you doing?

765
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,950
Even the servant is insolent.

766
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,600
Looks like your whole family

767
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,680
has no manners.

768
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,600
Today,

769
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,560
I shall teach her a proper lesson.

770
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,520
You just resent me

771
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,830
because I annulled my engagement

772
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
with your brother.

773
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,560
And you are taking it out on her.

774
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,470
What a joke.

775
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,270
It was my brother

776
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,310
who was unwilling to marry
a jinx like you.

777
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,470
Let's not dwell on the past.

778
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,780
[Kou Lingbo, the granddaughter
of Grand Preceptor Kou]

779
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,640
Let me have a look.

780
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,560
Princess Consort Qi is my cousin.

781
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,430
This is not her handwriting.

782
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,790
She does raise some suspicion.

783
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,200
I knew it.

784
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,680
Why would Prince Qi invite a girl

785
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,470
from a humble family?

786
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,350
I'm sorry,

787
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,120
but I never heard of any masters

788
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,790
who would write their own invitations

789
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,910
to the guests.

790
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:52,760
Indeed!

791
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,520
Even a humble family like ours

792
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,720
would ask the servant to write it.

793
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,560
You!

794
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,790
Lingbo can't be wrong.

795
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,310
Do you know Princess Consort Qi

796
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,520
better than her?

797
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:07,640
I don't.

798
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,990
But since Her Highness

799
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,120
invited me here,

800
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,680
she must have her reasons.

801
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,790
If you two insist on

802
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,350
stopping me from entering the mansion,

803
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,080
I need to give Her Highness
a clear explanation.

804
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,240
Otherwise, Her Highness might think

805
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,640
I am being rude.

806
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,910
Please relay a message for me.

807
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,240
Tell them

808
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,720
I was stopped by these two ladies,

809
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,680
so I can't attend the banquet today.

810
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:29,790
Yes.

811
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,310
Wait.

812
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,040
Go inside if you want.

813
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,040
I'm not afraid of you.

814
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,080
Lingbo is
from the Grand Preceptor Kou's Mansion.

815
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,790
Her uncle is the Left Chanceller.

816
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,310
You're from

817
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,350
a fifth-rank count's family.

818
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,390
You'll only

819
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,240
embarrass yourself sitting next to her.

820
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,240
Being born into nobility means nothing

821
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,790
if even a commoner

822
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,080
speaks more reasonably than you.

823
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,520
Aman, let's go.

824
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,160
Yes, Miss.

825
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,240
Everyone,

826
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,350
we are here to welcome
my brother,

827
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,390
Yu Jin's grand return.

828
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,950
Welcome home.

829
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,270
Let's raise a toast for him.

830
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,520
- Yes!
- Cheers.

831
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,520
The Crown Prince arrives.

832
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,790
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

833
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:36,830
Why

834
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,430
did you invite all your brothers

835
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,390
except me?

836
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,640
It's just a few of us

837
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,310
having a simple dinner.

838
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,600
Am I not

839
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,270
your brother?

840
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,720
Your Highness is a busy man.

841
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,520
I wouldn't dare trouble you.

842
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,040
Sit.

843
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,040
Take a seat.

844
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,310
Jin, you are here too.

845
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,520
Your Highness.

846
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:14,830
Prince Qi,

847
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,430
I must fault you for this.

848
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,240
Why didn't you inform me?

849
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,520
Well...

850
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,080
It was my oversight.

851
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,600
Please forgive me.

852
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,430
Jin,

853
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,830
we are meeting

854
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,240
for the first time,

855
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,240
but make yourself at home.

856
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,470
Yes, Your Highness.

857
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,270
I heard about your return.

858
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,560
I was going to take our brothers

859
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,160
to have a drink with you.

860
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,910
However,

861
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,950
you still haven't regained
your title and mansion.

862
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,760
We don't have a proper place

863
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,310
to drink.

864
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,950
We can have a drink anywhere.

865
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,950
It's all about the people,

866
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,640
not the place.

867
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,950
In that case,

868
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,390
since all that matters
is the people we are with,

869
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,830
it'd be wrong

870
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,350
for us to not make Jin

871
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,310
have a wonderful night.

872
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,390
Isn't that right?

873
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,830
- Yes.
- Lang is right.

874
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,240
Today, we shall drink

875
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,910
to our hearts' content with Jin.

876
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,830
I really appreciate the thought,

877
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,200
Your Highness.

878
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,200
But, I don't partake of alcohol.

879
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,830
I'll raise a toast to you
with tea instead.

880
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,390
That's my fault.

881
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,950
Come on, bring some tea over.

882
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,120
I was told

883
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,990
your Red Plume Cavalry
never lost a battle.

884
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:33,870
A fearsome warrior like you

885
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,430
can certainly handle a cup of liquor.

886
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:56,830
Your Highness.

887
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,310
The eight of us don't get to

888
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,080
gather around all the time.

889
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,950
Whether it's tea or liquor,

890
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,790
the bond we share with our brothers

891
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,790
will stay strong.

892
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,120
If it makes no difference,

893
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,760
why must he drink tea?

894
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,160
What if I insist

895
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,470
on seeing how much liquor

896
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,640
Jin can handle?

897
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,240
Jin,

898
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,350
go ahead.

899
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,910
You are persistent, Lang.

900
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,790
Then I shall gladly comply.

901
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,350
When I joined the Red Plume Cavalry,

902
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,270
as a way to keep my mind sharp,

903
00:41:58,830 --> 00:41:59,830
I took an oath of duty.

904
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,080
Should I drink,

905
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,560
I shall be punished by military law.

906
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,240
I wonder what His Majesty will think

907
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,270
when he finds out about this.

908
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:10,910
Never mind.

909
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,390
I wouldn't dare go against
Your Highness' order.

910
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,270
Lang, to your health.

911
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,160
Yu Jin, was that a threat?

912
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,240
I wouldn't dare.

913
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,310
I'm merely doing what you demand.

914
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,470
I'm risking my life for you.

915
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,430
Don't take it seriously, Jin.

916
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,120
I was messing with you.

917
