being the commandant

168
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,000
the poison has spread
throughout his body.

169
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,310
His life is in danger.

170
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,070
Detoxification requires
the right antidote.

171
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,070
We must first determine

172
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,270
what poison he was afflicted with.

173
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,950
It should be the poison
of his black scorpion.

174
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,120
It was kept here.

175
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,390
But it was gone

176
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,630
when I found out.

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,750
Sir, can you neutralize this poison?

178
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,910
There are many types of scorpions,

179
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,909
each with different venom,

180
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,600
so I cannot say for sure.

181
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,880
I'll do what I can

191
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
why don't I go get some ink and a brush

192
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,480
so you can paint?

193
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,910
Or shall I accompany you for a walk?

194
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,030
It's fine. That's unnecessary.

195
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,320
My Lady, are you worried
about Commandant Yu?

299
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,390

you shouldn't request it directly.

the princess is still young.

Perhaps

307
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,430
she'll grow more sensible
after getting married.

308
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,600
A husband?

309
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,880
Since it's marriage we're talking about,

310
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,270
Mother,

311
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,720

312
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,320

00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,790
I'm going easy on you.

321
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,390

323
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,030

325
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,270

326
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,720

328

You haven't shown me any concern at all.

329

330
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,150

at the hunting grounds.

You're concerned about me.

340
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,840

341
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,390

You're using the same trick.

345
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,990
I'm already tired of the act.

346
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,359

366
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,630

00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,230
We've lost our leads again.

375
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,080
It doesn't matter.

376
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,280
As long as something has been done,

377
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,520
it will leave a trace.

378
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,120
We just need to keep searching.

379
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,040
I don't know
if the scorpion's poison is infectious.

380
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,600
We shouldn't keep the body here.

381
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,710
Why don't we bury it first?

382
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,710
We should raid their hideout first

383
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,150
[Tianxiang Pleasure House]
and see if we can find any leads.

384
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,600
What is going on here?

385
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,280
What's the matter?

386
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,120
This...

387
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,080
Sir, I...

388
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,600
Sir,

389
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,280
this is just a restaurant.

390
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,630
Could there be a misunderstanding?

391
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,950
Sir, I'm innocent.

392
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,320
Chief, Liu Yan'er had escaped.

393
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,080
She only left this behind.

394
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,190
Sir...

395
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,710
Liu Yan'er's veil

396
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,840
and the assassin's handkerchief

397
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,670
came from the same person.

398
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,520
How dare you
harbor the wanted criminals here?

399
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,600
Tell us. Where is Liu Yan'er?

400
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:05,760
Sir,

401
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,760
this truly has nothing to do with me!

402
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,230
Liu Yan'er quit long ago.

403
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,840
I don't know where she went either.

404
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,360
I truly have no idea

405
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,600
about her background.

406
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,840
She worked for you.

407
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,320
You better tell us the truth.

408
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,150
She was the one

409
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,040
who wanted to join
Tianxiang Pleasure House willingly.

410
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,840
I saw that she had outstanding looks,

411
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,190
a talent for making incense,

412
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,630
and a tragic past.

413
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,560
That's why I took her in.

414
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,230
I would never dare

415
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,150
to take her in

416
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,760
had I known

417
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,120
that she had committed
such a heinous crime.

418
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,470
Good for her.

419
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,670
Her escape was swift.

420
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,120
She didn't leave any leads behind.

421
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,280
Issue a warrant
for Liu Yan'er and Du'er.

422
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:41,840
Let's go.

423
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,320
Yes, sir.

424
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,040
Let's go!

425
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,950
Once you wake up,

426
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,600
head to the derelict temple
outside the western gate.

427
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
The Capital Administration Office

428
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,600
is keeping guard over
Tianxiang Pleasure House.

429
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,040
There's no way for us to head back.

430
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,630
I think

431
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,520
we should seek another shelter.

432
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,600
It's cold out here at night.

433
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,840
I'm worried about your health.

434
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,120
I'm fine.

435
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,800
Let's wait a little longer.

436
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,990
I wonder if Jiang Si

437
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,320
is able to rescue Qi.

438
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,080
Remember.

439
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,320
Wait for Sang Qi at the derelict temple

440
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,080
outside the western gate.

441
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,470
In my opinion,

442
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,320
Jiang Si is untrustworthy.

443
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,230
First, she pretends

444
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:05,880
to be one of us

445
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,800
to get information from us.

446
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:07,840
Now,

447
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,520
she offers to help rescue Qi.

448
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,320
I can't tell if she's a friend or a foe.

449
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,880
But she had a worried look on her face

450
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,800
when she told me to escape.

451
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,800
I don't think she was faking it.

452
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,230
If so, what if we

453
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,150
didn't do what she wanted?

454
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,390
Would she still help us

455
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,360
if we didn't give up on the operation?

456
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,710
Qi!

457
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,280
Hurry!

458
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:30,880
Liu!

459
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,150
Du'er!

460
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,280
I...

461
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,710
You...

462
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,150
Be careful.

463
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:37,630
Sit down.

464
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,230
You...

465
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:39,910
That person...

466
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:40,880
She told me

467
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,470
to come here.

468
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,190
I never expected

469
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,080
you two to be here.

470
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,430
Did Jiang Si rescue you?

471
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,430
Who?

472
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,470
Jiang Si?

473
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,360
Who's that?

474
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Are you referring

475
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:02,910
to the girl

476
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,470
who looks quite pretty?

477
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,430
Yes. It was her.

478
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,600
Could she truly be a member

479
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,430
of the Nightingale Sect?

480
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,630
We've sent groups of men to rescue you

481
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,190
but to no avail.

482
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,630
She's a girl

483
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,840
who can't even defend herself.

484
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,630
How did she break you out of jail?

485
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:22,950
Break me out of jail?

486
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,840
She didn't do so.

487
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,630
The prison guard

488
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,390
brought her to the cell.

489
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,280
After that, she...

490
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,800
She...

491
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,120
She...

492
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,520
She pretended to speak to me.

493
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,800
After that,

494
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,390
she freed the scorpion

495
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,560
What exactly is she up to?

496
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,710
Du'er.

497
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,320
That's right. I remember now.

498
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,280
I remember now.

499
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,280
I found this

500
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,600
right after I woke up.

501
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,600
Look.

502
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,360
A bamboo letter from Grand Elder?

503
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,320
Du'er, what does it say?

504
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,120
Grand Elder wants us to return to Nanwu.

505
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,470
What?

506
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,470
Did Grand Elder

507
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,910
truly send Jiang Si to Ling'an?

508
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,470
The Nightingale Sect has been exposed.

509
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:16,760
I'm afraid

510
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,190
the entire Ling'an City

511
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,150
is searching for us now.

512
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,120
It's good to go back.

513
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,630
The puzzle

514
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,150
will be solved once we see

515
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,430
Grand Elder.

516
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,400
[Capital Administration Office]

517
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,910
What's going on?

518
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,230
Let's go and take a look.

519
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,900
[Wanted Notice]

520
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:42,710
Wanted Notice?

521
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:54,330
[Wanted Notice]

522
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,390
Long Dan.

523
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,430
Long Dan?

524
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:01,990
Yes, sir!

525
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:03,950
Chief?

526
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,760
Make a trip

527
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,950
to the milk cake stall.

528
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,040
This time,
you're not allowed to slack off.

529
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,190
Wait for

530
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,080
the freshly baked ones.

531
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,800
They must be for Miss Jiang.

532
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,390
I get it.

533
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:18,910
Let's go.

534
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:20,880
Commandant Yu.

535
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,520
Don't you think something's off

536
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,230
about Sang Qi's death?

537
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,560
Have you found any new leads?

538
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,470
I remember that the box
of poisonous scorpion

539
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,880
was kept under a stone brick.

540
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,560
It's impossible

541
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,040
for it to escape the box that easily.

542
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,470
You're right.

543
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,360
I've also heard

544
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,880
that Miss Jiang Si

545
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,670
visited the cell lately.

546
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,760
She visited the cell?

547
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,280
That's right.

548
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,230
She used your token as well.

549
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,670
Impossible! My token is here with...

550
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,390
Do you suspect that it's her?

551
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:07,910
No.

552
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,990
I don't suspect Miss Jiang.

553
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,230
Because I know

554
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,430
Sang Qi died

555
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,360
after Miss Jiang left the prison.

556
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,880
As for your token...

557
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,470
Don't worry.

558
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,190
It won't happen again.

559
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,430
Fine.

560
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,190
I trust you.

561
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,880
Commandant Yu.

562
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,120
Miss Jiang really isn't around.

563
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,320
You mustn't enter.

564
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,760
I saw her. She isn't around indeed.

565
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,710
This poison is too potent to neutralize.

566
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,190
I couldn't save him.

567
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,630
Why are you here all of a sudden?

568
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,800
I thought that you

569
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,760
would crave these snacks.

570
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,230
Why was the physician here?

571
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,120
Are you unwell?

572
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,390
So, you came all the way here

573
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,670
just to deliver these to me?

574
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,710
I'm more than happy to do so.

575
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,840
I've been extra happy...

576
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,390
Let's go.

577
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,560
after returning from the hunt.

578
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,950
What are you so happy about?

579
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,880
Have you ever heard of a hawk-tamer

580
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,710
whose eyes were gorged by his own hawk?

581
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,390
What do you mean?

582
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,990
I just found out
that a keeper of scorpions

583
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,950
was poisoned to death

584
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,840
by his own scorpion.

585
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,990
Do you think the scorpion

586
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,600
is well-versed in the law of Zhou?

587
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,630
How could it know
where to inject the poison?

588
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,520
It does sound interesting.

589
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,470
There's something even more interesting.

590
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
The token on my waist

591
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,910
must have grown legs

592
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,120
and went to the prison

593
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,080
when I wasn't paying attention.

594
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
Commandant Yu,

595
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,710
what are you trying to imply?

596
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,520
Miss Jiang, don't you have anything

597
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,630
to tell me?

598
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,230
That's right.

599
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,390
I took the token.

600
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,150
I bribed the physician.

601
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,950
Naturally, I was the one

602
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,800
who set Sang Qi free.

603
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,120
However,

604
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,230
I did it for a reason.

605
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,560
Then let's sit down

606
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,390
and talk about your reason.

607
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,390
Zhou and Nanwu have been at war

608
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,990
constantly for years.

609
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,190
But

610
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,320
who's the true victor here?

611
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,230
You fought on the frontline before.

612
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,390
I'm sure
you understand this better than me.

613
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,630
Violence

614
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,360
doesn't resolve any issues.

615
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,470
It only brings more devastation
and suffering

616
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,600
to the people.

617
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,630
Therefore,

618
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,120
I set Sang Qi free

619
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,230
to seek a better path to peace.

620
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,430
What path?

621
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,990
Do you know them well?

622
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:01,990
Have you lived there before?

623
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,080
Although I don't lead troops

624
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,040
in battles at the border like you,

625
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,630
I understand this fact too.

626
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,840
There is always a winner and a loser
on the battlefield.

627
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,190
But in war,

628
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,760
there are no true victors.

629
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,230
Once a war begins,

630
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,470
both sides will suffer casualties.

631
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,150
And behind every casualty,

632
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,080
there is a broken family.

633
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
I set Sang Qi free

634
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,800
to find out

635
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,990
why exactly they came here

636
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,230
and what they intended to do.

637
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,470
You're giving me a lecture
on military strategies now.

638
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,990
Know yourself and know the enemy,
and you can win every battle you fight.

639
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,520
If, in the future,

640
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,560
more and more people

641
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,910
of both Nanwu and Zhou

642
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,600
are willing to understand each other,

643
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:39,950
won't that resolve

644
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,800
the old grudges

645
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,880
and help us co-exist peacefully?

646
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,430
If both parties

647
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,520
can know each other well enough,

648
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,520
perhaps they could both win
without waging a war.

649
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,760
That sounds interesting.

650
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:57,880
Tell me about it, then.

651
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,990
Did you visit me

652
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,800
to return the token to me?

653
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,710
Or were you merely checking on me?

654
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,670
Since you're already interrogating me,

655
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,990
I have no choice
but to tell you the truth.

656
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,040
I visited you

657
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,710
to return the token to you.

658
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,880
I don't believe you.

659
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,520
Suit yourself.

660
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,390
Turn around.

661
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,280
And you.

[Tiande Hall]

669
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,910
Your Majesty, this is the new portrait

670
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,800
of the Seventh Prince
drawn by our portraitist.

671
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,230
It does look vivid.

672
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,950
But since I've met the real person,

673
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,760
now that I'm comparing them,

674
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,710
the figure in the portrait

675
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,600
doesn't seem as valiant.

676
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,710
The Seventh Prince
is handsome and poised.

677
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,430
Naturally, the portrait
can't depict him fully.

678
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,120
His brothers

679
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,800
have led a pampered life in Ling'an.

680
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,150
Yet no one cared for him
or looked after him.

681
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,280
He grew up
in the Southern Frontier all alone.

682
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,230
Even so, he still turned out dashing.

683
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,390
He must have suffered

684
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,840
a lot all these years.

685
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,080
You never forgot

686
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,190
about the Seventh Prince all along.

687
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,990
Not only did you
hire those tutors to teach him,

688
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,840
but you also ordered your men
to send his portrait to you every year.

689
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,840
You truly care a lot about him.

690
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,670
I'm sure the Seventh Prince
is aware of it.

691
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,910
Report!

692
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,760
Your Majesty,

693
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,560
Mr. Zhen and Mr. Yu have arrived.

694
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:26,600
Summon them.

695
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:27,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

696
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,630
Summon them.

697
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,560
Greetings, Your Majesty.

698
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,910
Greetings, Your Majesty.

699
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,990
Spare the formalities.

700
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,390
I ordered you two

701
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,670
to investigate my assassination
during the Mid-Autumn Hunt.

702
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,150
How's the progress?

703
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,150
Your Majesty,

704
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Wang Heng, the Imperial Insignia Guard,

705
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,040
Aling, the palace maidservant,

706
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,520
and Zhou Yi, the Minister of Rites,

707
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,710
have been thoroughly interrogated.

708
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,280
Their testimonies

709
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,910
have confirmed that the Nightingale Sect

710
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,430
was behind the assassination.

711
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,470
Currently,

712
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,950
the hideouts
of the Nightingale Sect in Ling'an City

713
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,120
have all been eradicated.

714
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,760
However, we're still trying

715
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,760
to arrest the two major offenders.

716
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,600
Mr. Zhen, I've always been at ease

717
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:17,910
when you handle a case.

718
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,080
I have a question.

719
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,120
Go ahead.

720
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,390
The Imperial Insignia Guards
and the Gale Guards

721
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,390
are both elite forces.

722
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,430
Cui Xu and Han Ran, the two generals,

723
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,630
were there as well.

724
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,600
So why did no one defend you

725
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,080
during the assassination?

726
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,280
I've already given them
a harsh punishment

727
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,800
for their negligence of duty.

728
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,190
Besides them,

729
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,760
there are some individuals
who should be punished

730
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,390
even though they weren't there.

731
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,670
For example,
the Directorate of Astronomy.

732
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:47,880
If they failed

733
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,390
to predict the solar eclipse,

734
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:51,910
that should be considered
negligence of duty.

735
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,150
If they did predict the solar eclipse

736
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,630
without reporting it to you,

737
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,190
that would be deceiving the Emperor.

738
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,600
They deserve punishment for that.

739
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,840
Excellent.

740
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,670
As expected of my...

741
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,160
You do live up to your reputation
as the commandant.

742
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:08,679
Baoping.

743
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,679
Yes, Your Majesty.

744
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,239
When I returned
to the palace last night,

745
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,909
I ordered my men to investigate
the Directorate of Astronomy.

746
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,389
They found this letter.

747
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,389
Take a look.

748
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,030
What kind of language is this?

749
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:23,840
It's the Nanwu language.

750
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,590
It's about the concealment

751
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,909
of one's report.

752
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,199
The Nanwu language

753
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,070
is forbidden in Zhou.

754
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,280
Your Majesty,

755
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,949
I spend a lot of time
with Commandant Yu.

756
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,760
I swear upon my life's reputation

757
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,239
that he's loyal
to the nation and its ruler.

758
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,719
He has no intention of betraying Zhou.

759
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,360
Your Majesty, please judge wisely.

760
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,510
Mr. Zhen, you may leave now.

761
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,280
But Your Majesty...

762
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,280
You may leave now.

763
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:47,429
Yes, Your Majesty.

764
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,360
You're pretty good
at winning people over, huh?

765
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,810
You joined
the Capital Administration Office

766
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,110
not long ago.

767
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:15,200
However, you managed to win
a stubborn man like Zhen Heng

768
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,840
to your side.

769
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:20,110
That's because Mr. Zhen
is able to judge fairly.

770
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,070
Jin, tell me about it.

771
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,280
Since when did you learn
the Nanwu language?

772
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,390
I learned it myself
when I was stationed at Nanwu.

773
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,240
I'm sure you did it
so that you could win the battles

774
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,240
by knowing our enemies.

775
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,510
At first, I did learn it
to win the battles.

776
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,390
But a certain individual

777
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,640
changed my thoughts.

778
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,160
Who is it?

779
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,390
A friend of mine.

780
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,760
My friend thought that we should know
ourselves and our enemies

781
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,910
so that we could win without a fight.

782
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,390
There are victories
and defeats on the battlefield.

783
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,640
But there are no true victors in war.

784
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,320
As long as the two sides engage in war,

785
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,640
there will surely be casualties.

786
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,470
Behind every casualty

787
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,390
lies a shattered family.

788
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,590
If more and more people

789
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,950
of both Nanwu and Zhou

790
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,320
try to understand each other,

791
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,590
the feud between the states
can be resolved,

792
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:07,720
and we can co-exist peacefully.

793
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,550
If so, both states

794
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,640
will win without a fight.

795
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,510
This friend of yours

796
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,800
is truly a talent.

797
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,550
It's a shame
that he's at the Southern Frontier.

798
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,640
Otherwise, I'd really like to meet him.

799
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,070
You'll get to see him one day.

800
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,070
Your Majesty,

801
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,590
lunch is ready at Jinhua Hall.

802
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,720
Come and have a meal with me

803
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,990
before leaving.

804
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,360
You can see your mother too.

805
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,110
But you said

806
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,910
I could continue being Yu Qi.

807
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,430
I may have permitted you to do so,

808
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:34,680
but I didn't say

809
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,990
that you could disown your parents.

810
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:37,800
Let's go.

811
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,360
[Grand Elder of Nanwu]

812
00:36:59,240 --> 00:36:59,800
Grand Elder.

813
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,430
Why are you back?

814
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,320
Grand Elder,

815
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,030
didn't you send us the bamboo letter

816
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,590
and tell us to return to Nanwu?

817
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,640
I summoned you back?

818
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:11,680
Look at this letter.

819
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,640
The handwriting is mine indeed.

820
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,160
However, I didn't write

821
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,510
this letter.

822
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,280
Could it be that someone
has forged your handwriting?

823
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,550
Where did you

824
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,590
get this letter?

825
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,390
It's hard to explain.

826
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,160
At that time,
Sang Qi was detained by Zhou.

827
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,360
Besides that,

828
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,680
it seems
as if she could predict the future.

829
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,880
Who exactly is she?

830
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,590
I've investigated her background.

831
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,590
She was born and raised in Zhou.

832
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,390
She has never left Ling'an before.

833
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,470
She wasn't related

834
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,070
to Nanwu as well.

835
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,110
But it was as if

836
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,030
she had known us for a long time.

837
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,280
Is that so?

838
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,160
Grand Elder,

839
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,160
according to the oracle of Nanwu,

840
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,470
the Saintess has the ability
to predict the future

841
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,720
and know all things.

842
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,430
Jiang Si's ability

843
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,800
matches that description.

844
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,470
Could it be
that she's related to the Saintess?

845
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,070
Could it be...

846
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,550
She's the Saintess herself.

847
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,840
Where are Sang Qi and Du'er?

848
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,880
Now, Zhou is trying to arrest us.

849
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,680
They stayed behind to hold the rear.

850
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,840
Tell them

851
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,360
to return to Zhou immediately

852
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,800
and bring the Saintess back

853
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,800
once everything settles down.

854
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,280
Yes.

855
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,060
[Imperial Concubine Xian,
Yu Jin's Biological Mother]

856
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:56,760
Your Majesty.

857
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,070
You could have told me in advance

858
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,390
that you've summoned Yu Jin
back to Ling'an.

859
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
I could have made some preparations.

860
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,070
I had no time

861
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,760
to summon Prince Qi to the palace.

862
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,880
He has always

863
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,910
been steady and composed.

864
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,800
He's kind to his siblings too.

865
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,550
I'm sure

866
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,720
his presence will make you happy.

867
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,510
Although you two hadn't met for years,

868
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,360
you are related by blood.

869
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,680
There's no need for a mother

870
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,160
to prepare anything
before seeing her son.

871
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,760
Your Majesty, you're right.

872
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:39,680
This is your welcome drink.

873
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,160
I don't drink alcohol.

874
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,390
Eat up.

875
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,720
I prepared

876
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,910
these dishes especially for you.

877
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,360
I haven't recovered from my injury yet.

878
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,680
I'm afraid I can't take any meat.

879
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,030
Look at you.

880
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,070
You don't even know your own son.

881
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,990
You need to learn a lot more about him.

882
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,160
Jin, don't take it to heart.

883
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,910
Hurry

884
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,320
and change the dishes.

885
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:13,910
Yes.

886
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,840
Your Highness, no need for that.

887
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,640
Why are you still
addressing her as Her Highness?

888
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:20,950
Yes.

889
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,240
Mother.

890
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,030
Jin,

891
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,590
you shall live in Jinhua Hall
for the time being

892
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,510
until the arrangements
for your residence are settled.

893
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,510
This will give you

894
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,640
a chance to bond.

895
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,680
I have official affairs to attend to
at the Capital Administration Office.

896
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,800
It's more convenient
if I live in my current residence.

897
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,840
If so, you should visit

898
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,200
Prince Qi's Mansion when you're free.

899
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:53,950
Your elder brother

900
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,430
will definitely look after you.

901
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,800
Naturally.

902
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,590
Knowing Commandant Yu's personality,

903
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,030
he might be in deep trouble

904
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,390
if he enrages His Majesty.

905
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,990
I should have

906
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,760
given him some reminders earlier.

907
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,470
This is truly worrying.

908
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,550
Where am I?

909
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:03,640
Over here!

910
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,070
You won't be drenched here!

911
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:10,760
Here.

912
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,030
Come up here.

913
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,070
Don't tell me you're lost as well.

914
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,910
It rained all of a sudden.

915
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,360
I'm afraid the palace gate
will be closed soon.

916
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,360
Are you leaving the palace?

917
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:32,760
That's right.

918
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,470
Is it fun out there?
