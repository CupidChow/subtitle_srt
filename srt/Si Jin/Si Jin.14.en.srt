I've already

16
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,430
been lying here for several days.

17
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,590
I wish to go out and take a walk.

18

Without my order,

19
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,200
don't even think
of leaving Mingyue Pavilion.

You're seriously wounded.

besides Yang Shengcai and your cousin?

30

It's just the Chief Censor.

What's there to fear?

00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,590
Besides, Zhang Sheng

He has already impeached you
in front of your uncle.

Your Highness,
thank you for your kind intentions.

123
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,910
However, my family is worried about me.

124
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,640
It's inconvenient for me
to stay outside.

125
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,560
The house was on fire.

126
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,560
Only you and Mingyue survived.

127
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,909
The families of the three victims

128
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,760
must feel terrible.

129
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,080
The Cui family is under me.

130
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,520
The Yang family is on good terms
with me as well.

136
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,350
Why do you think

137
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,909
the Zhang family pestered us

138
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,960

139

140

Your Highness, I respectfully request
your wise consideration.

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,560
That night, everyone was drunk.

142
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,150
I'm sure the wind

143
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,080
knocked over the candlestick

144
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,150
and started the fire!

145
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,000
Both Princess Mingyue and I

146
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,150
were victims!

147
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,150
The fire at the restaurant
was purely an accident!

148
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,790
Your Highness,
it was a natural disaster!

149
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,830
The Zhang family refused to accept

150
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,710
that it was an accident.

151
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,200
Now, one of you two will be blamed.

152
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,440
No matter if you knocked down
the candlestick

153
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,470
and started the fire by accident

154
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,470
or committed arson after getting drunk,

155
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,880
the culprit cannot be Mingyue.

156
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,560
You're an intelligent man.

157
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,470
You should know what I'm talking about.

158
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,909
Of course!

159
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,120
It can never be Princess Mingyue!

160
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,520
It cannot be her!

161
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,640
No!

162
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,830
No!

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It wasn't me either, Your Highness!

164
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,680
Your Highness, it wasn't me!

165
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,230
It's...

166
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,710
It's Jiang Zhan!

167
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,000
It's Jiang Zhan
from the Count of Dongping's Mansion!

168
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
Jiang Zhan?

169
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,120
The Count of Dongping's Mansion?

170
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,000
Shijiu, check it out.

171
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,710
Yes, Your Highness.

172
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,080
Poor Zhan.

173
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,350
He had already passed away
before he was able to get married.

174
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,230
Although the deceased is gone,

175
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,440
the living still needs to move on.

176
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,920
Mother,

177
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,830
shouldn't we decide

178
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,440
on Zhan's funeral by now?

179
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,870
My brother hasn't been located yet.

180
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,400
Nobody knows if he's dead or alive.

181
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,470
But Aunt Xiao, it seems like

182
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,870
you're in a rush to hold his funeral.

183
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,400
What ulterior motives do you have?

184
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,590
Zhan is gone!

185
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,990
I feel upset as well!

186
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,080
I know you two have a close bond.

187
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,350
You can't accept his passing.

188
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,710
But we've been searching
for him for seven days.

189
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,080
There's no way he's still alive by now.

190
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,510
As the saying goes,

191
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,560
the dead should be laid to rest.

192
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,200
Only then will we be able

193
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,110
to convey our grief

194
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,920
for Zhan's passing.

195
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,870
No matter what,

196
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,630
I won't give up on the search.

197
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,920
Zhan is a poor boy.

198
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,750
We can't just let his soul

199
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,200
wander around.

200
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Let's hurry and plan for his funeral.

201
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,440
Yes, Mother.

202
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,320
Both the Capital Administration Office
and our family

203
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,800
have conducted a search for days.

204
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,230
We only managed to find a shoe.

205
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,680
Most of the family's money
has been expended.

206
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
I'm afraid there's no hope.

207
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,800
Mother,

208
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,990
I have something to report.

209
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,870
Lately, we've spent a lot of money

210
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,750
to conduct the search for Zhan.

211
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,870
The family doesn't have much money left.

212
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,200
If we intend to continue the search,

213
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,230
Mother,

214
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,560
you need to allocate more money to us.

215
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,080
If he's alive, I need to see him.

216
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,680
If he's dead, I need to see his body.

217
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,510
We must find Zhan at all costs.

218
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,080
As for the money,

219
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,870
I'll think of something.

220
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,200
Anmou, you and your wife

221
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,230
don't need to worry about it.

222
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,630
Si, say no more.

223
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,320
Let's continue the search together.

224
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,560
It's all because you spoiled her!

225
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,800
You spoiled her so much

226
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,680
that she doesn't care
about anything in the world!

227
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,680
Your brother is dead because of you!

228
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,560
Grandmother?

229
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,990
What are you saying?

230
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,320
Your brother is dead because of you!

231
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,350
Ancheng, we've discussed

232
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,350
that Zhan

233
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,470
wouldn't stir up any trouble.

234
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,590
We hoped that he could lead a posh life

235
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,560
and spend the rest of his life safely.

236
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,110
But you?

237
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,160
You insisted on making him train.

238
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,750
He trained so much

239
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,160
that he didn't even have time

240
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,830
to have his meals!

241
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,400
Before this,
when Zhan left the house early,

242
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,320
he would come back in the evening

243
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,440
and greet me.

244
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,750
But this time,

245
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,680
he sneaked out

246
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,040
at night.

247
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,920
He didn't want to return home!

248
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,590
It's all because of you!

249
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,870
He died because of you!

250
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,800
It's all my fault.

251
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,320
I'm to blame.

252
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,040
That's why I have to find him

253
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,590
at all costs!

254
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,440
Si!

255
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,630
We're in trouble!

256
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,510
Old Madam, we're in trouble!

257
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,960
There are troops outside!

258
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,630
They've surrounded our mansion!

259
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,630
Let's go!

260
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,040
[Count of Dongping's Mansion]

261
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,280
Who are you guys?

262
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,080
I'm Shijiu, the leader

263
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,400
of Princess Royal Rong Yang's bodyguard.

264
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,630
I'm here to seal off

265
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,560
the Count of Dongping's Mansion

266
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,440
under Her Highness's order.

267
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,870
Why is Her Highness

268
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,680
sealing off our mansion?

269
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,750
Regarding the arson case
at Huiyue Restaurant,

270
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,080
Jiang Zhan is seen as a suspect.

271
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,280
To prevent his escape,

272
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,710
Her Highness sent us here
to keep watch over the mansion.

273
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,320
Nonsense!

274
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,280
My brother has already been harmed.

275
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,920
Now, you want him to bear the blame?

276
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,200
We'll clarify everything with you

277
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,680
once we find him.

278
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,440
We're doing this

279
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,040
for the sake
of your family's reputation.

280
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,590
If you guys refuse to comply,

281
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,630
don't blame us for showing you no mercy.

282
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,400
How dare you?

283
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,590
We appreciate
Her Highness's kind intentions.

284
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,630
Send Old Madam inside for now.

285
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,800
Mother, hurry.

286
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,230
Her Highness's nephew is dead.

287
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,040
Her only daughter
had a high fever for days.

288
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,800
She's still unconscious.

289
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,960
Her Highness
is deeply affected by this case.

290
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,590
That's why she sent us here

291
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,280
to aid the investigation.

292
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,510
The trial shall be conducted tomorrow.

293
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,320
Her Highness doesn't need to worry.

294
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,680
Besides that, I'll send my men

295
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,080
to keep an eye on Jiang Zhan.

296
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,280
Nothing will go wrong.

297
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,280
Please relay my advice
to the Princess Royal.

298
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,990
Do not overstep your boundaries
and give others

299
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,350
a reason to criticize you.

300
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,510
Mr. Yu, I hope you'll fulfill
your duty impartially.

301
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,320
Naturally.

302
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,440
Let's go!

303
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,510
Thankfully, you appeared in time.

304
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,630
Luckily, I received the news quickly.

305
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,440
I'm glad that everyone is fine.

306
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,080
Not only did I not manage to save Zhan,

307
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,470
but you also had to
risk your life because of me.

308
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,920
I'm truly sorry about this.

309
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,750
It's fine.

310
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,710
It wasn't your fault in the first place.

311
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,630
I have a question.

312
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,160
Regarding the things

313
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,710
you told me about Jiang Zhan,

314
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,560
it was more than just a dream, right?

315
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,710
I'm sorry.

316
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,470
I shouldn't have asked you that.

317
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
It made you upset for no reason.

318
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,870
I don't have time to be upset.

319
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,280
Even now, no one knows where Zhan is.

320
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,040
I'm afraid Princess Royal

321
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,800
will push all the blame

322
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,230
on him.

323
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,280
But that night...

324
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,200
Remember what I told you.

325
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,630
You weren't there that night.

326
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,320
Don't tell me I have to let them

327
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,920
throw all the blame on my brother

328
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,230
so that I can clear myself of suspicion.

329
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,560
I think your brother

330
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,630
would never want you to risk your life

331
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,400
because of him.

332
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,870
Let's come up with other solutions.

333
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,870
Mother,

334
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,280
before this, didn't you say

335
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,320
that you wanted to betroth Miss Si

336
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
to the Zhen family?

337
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,560
I was just saying.

338
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,960
The Zhen family
hasn't asked for her hand yet.

339
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,750
You saw it yourself.

340
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,400
The Princess Royal was fierce
and intimidating.

341
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
Now,

342
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,470
I don't care anymore.

343
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,710
I'll marry Si off

344
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,110
to any family
that can ensure our safety.

345
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,710
Mother, you're thoughtful indeed.

346
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,870
But if we do so,

347
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
won't outsiders say

348
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,510
that we are

349
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,680
marrying our daughter off
to two families?

350
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,200
We don't even know
if Zhan is dead or alive now.

351
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,080
Do you think I care
about other people's opinions?

352
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,040
Before this,

353
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,590
I told you to stay in your courtyard

354
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,560
because you were sick.

355
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,560
I wanted you

356
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,630
to rest more and work less.

357
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,320
But now, look at you.

358
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,470
You've fully recovered.

359
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,800
Besides, Si, that lass,

360
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,830
she's too young after all.

361
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,320
I've already instructed our men

362
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,320
to deliver
the house pass and keys to you.

363
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,680
In the future,
you'll be in charge of our mansion.

364
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,280
I appreciate your efforts.

365
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,040
Mother, no need to say that.

366
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,630
Don't worry.

367
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,350
I

368
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,470
won't let down your trust.

369
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,320
As long as we stay united,

370
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,400
we can overcome every obstacle there is.

371
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,800
Old Madam,

372
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,400
your soothing soup is ready.

373
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,470
Let me do it.

374
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,750
Mother, have it while it's hot.

375
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,590
It's Yu Qi again, huh?

376
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,040
Your Highness!

377
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,200
I know my fault now!

378
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,230
Your Highness, please spare me!

379
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,230
What a fool.

380
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,630
Drag her away and flog her 20 times.

381
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,280
Yes, Your Highness!

382
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,710
I know my fault now!

383
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,630
What a careless fool.

384
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,830
Your Highness, the trial is nearing.

385
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
They don't have time to find him.

386
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,040
Everything

387
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,160
is proceeding according to your plan.

388
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,320
It's time
for the Count of Dongping's Mansion

389
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,590
to reap what they sow.

390
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,230
Miss Si,

391
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,270
the trial will be conducted soon.

392
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,790
Do you have any solutions?

393
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:15,920
Aman,

394
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,990
invite Qiaoniang here.

395
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,750
Yes, Miss Si.

396
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,840
Qiaoniang.

397
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:44,710
Here.

398
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,310
Aman, keep watch outside.

399
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:49,750
Yes, Miss Si.

400
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,200
Si.

401
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,400
You've lost a lot of weight.

402
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,070
Your tummy is huge now.

403
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,710
Your baby is due soon, right?

404
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,160
Come on. Sit down for now.

405
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,070
Careful.

406
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,120
Sit down.

407
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,070
Si,

408
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,990
even now,

409
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,070
you still address me respectfully.

410
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,600
I'm truly ashamed of myself.

411
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,840
Although my family is in shambles,

412
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,600
you're still willing to visit me
in the middle of the night.

413
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,400
I'm sure you still treat me

414
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,160
as your younger sister, right?

415
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,710
My dear sister.

416
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,120
It's all because of

417
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,120
that scoundrel Ji Chongyi.

418
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,920
He should've been burned

419
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,710
or drowned to death

420
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
as an apology to your brother.

421
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,270
Qiaoniang.

422
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,790
Did Ji Chongyi

423
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,750
tell you anything?

424
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,510
A few days ago,

425
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,120
the Princess Royal sent her men

426
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,440
to our mansion and captured him.

427
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,310
Today, I heard

428
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,920
that their men sealed off your mansion.

429
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,400
Ji Chongyi

430
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,840
told me

431
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,310
the full story.

432
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,840
No matter how much
my brother had suffered,

433
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,790
please tell me about it.

434
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,680
That night...

435
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,360
Why didn't the fire

436
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,920
devour all of them?

437
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,510
Now, Cui Mingyue

438
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,990
is still alive.

439
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:28,960
But my brother's body

440
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,680
is nowhere to be found!

441
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,230
You and Ji Chongyi

442
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,470
wouldn't have become enemies

443
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,270
if it weren't for me.

444
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,470
Cui Mingyue is the culprit here.

445
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,230
Ji Chongyi isn't bold enough

446
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,120
to do something like that.

447
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,600
But I don't understand something.

448
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,840
Why did Cui Mingyue

449
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,310
target my brother?

450
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,960
Why did she target
the Lushengxiang Store?

451
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,360
That day, the princess was riding
a horse through the streets

452
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,030
and had a conflict with you

453
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,790
and your brother.

454
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,400
Mr. Yu took her back
to the Capital Administration Office.

455
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,680
She was almost flogged.

456
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,680
The princess has never
endured such humiliation before.

457
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,360
Therefore, she held a grudge
against you two.

458
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,960
What's the difference

459
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,030
between a person and an ant?

460
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,600
Perhaps to Cui Mingyue,

461
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,270
my brother's life

462
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,750
is as insignificant as an ant's.

463
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,230
Even if she gets
into the deepest of trouble,

464
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,600
she has a mother

465
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,550
who wields absolute authority

466
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,710
to help her clean her mess.

467
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,120
Now, the Princess Royal

468
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,750
falsely claimed
that Cui Mingyue's fever hadn't subsided

469
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,880
and that she's in a coma.

470
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,310
She even brought Ji Chongyi
to her mansion by force

471
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,200
for him to receive treatment.

472
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,600
I'm sure she is trying
to push all the blame

473
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,160
on your brother.

474
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,160
If it works out,
everyone has a happy ending.

475
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,070
If it doesn't,

476
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,510
Ji Chongyi will be her scapegoat.

477
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,400
Cui Mingyue won't be affected.

478
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,270
The Count of Dongping dare not

479
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,230
go against the Princess Royal directly.

480
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,360
I don't know how I can help you out.

481
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:44,640
Thank you.

482
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,750
No matter what,

483
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,990
I must demand an account from them.

484
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,440
I think I know what to do now.

485
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,360
Sir!

486
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,420
[Capital Administration Office]
My brother, Jiang Zhan,

487
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,160
is still nowhere to be found.

488
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,310
Today, I wish to file a complaint

489
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,360
against Ji Chongyi, Zhang Sheng,

490
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,030
Yang Shengcai, Cui Yi, and Cui Mingyue.

491
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,030
The five of them

492
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,470
conspired to harm my brother.

493
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,470
Do not spout nonsense!

494
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,880
Jiang Zhan was the one
who set fire to the restaurant

495
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,400
after he got drunk,

496
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,960
causing the deaths
of Mr. Cui, Mr. Zhang,

497
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,880
and Mr. Yang.

498
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,120
Although both Princess Mingyue and I

499
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,680
were lucky enough to survive,

500
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,200
she was seriously wounded.

501
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
My Lord, please practice wise judgment!

502
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,230
You said Jiang Zhan committed arson
after getting drunk.

503
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,680
Do you have any evidence?

504
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,960
I'm the witness.

505
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,470
My brother doesn't know

506
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,270
Princess Mingyue.

507
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,710
Why did he attend the banquet?

508
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,510
Princess Mingyue held a banquet.

509
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,960
She invited Mr. Zhang.

510
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,120
Mr. Zhang was kind and chivalrous.

511
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,230
He knew

512
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,990
that there was a feud between me
and the Count of Dongping's Mansion.

513
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,840
Therefore, he invited Jiang Zhan
to the banquet.

514
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,710
He wanted to be the mediator

515
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,510
and resolve the conflict between us.

516
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,440
But Jiang Zhan,

517
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,710
right after he finished
a few cups of huangjiu,

518
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,230
not only did he speak arrogantly,

519
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,710
but he also told Zhang Sheng off
for meddling with his affair.

520
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,840
He even got into a fight with Mr. Zhang

521
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,710
even though he was the mediator.

522
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,440
In the end, he set the pavilion on fire.

523
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,750
According to you,

524
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,680
my brother set the fire by himself

525
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:08,990
while the five of you

526
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,270
just stood idly by, huh?

527
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,990
Let's forget
about Princess Mingyue for now.

528
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,710
You and the other men

529
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,030
are young and strong.

530
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,440
And, most of you
had practiced martial arts.

531
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,750
Even if my brother
is extraordinarily strong,

532
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,230
don't tell me the five of you

533
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,270
can't stop him?

534
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:21,840
You!

535
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,790
It's one versus five.
How is that possible?

536
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,470
In my opinion,

537
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,640
I don't think Jiang Zhan
was the culprit.

538
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,400
Princess Mingyue

539
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,840
is the Princess Royal's only daughter.

540
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,160
Jiang Zhan

541
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,880
wouldn't dare to do so,

542
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,710
even if he had lost his mind.

543
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,790
It's hard to say.

544
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,440
Liquor does boost one's courage.

545
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,360
Silence!

546
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,550
How do you explain yourself?

547
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,990
I didn't say that Jiang Zhan

548
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,790
set the fire in front of us.

549
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,710
After we left, he took a detour,

550
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,990
sneaked back, and set it on fire

551
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,440
while we were drunk.

552
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,400
Since you guys

553
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,710
were drunk,

554
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,840
and you said my brother set
the pavilion on fire sneakily,

555
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,360
how would you know

556
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,960
that the culprit was him?

557
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,790
I needed to use the washroom urgently.

558
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,880
After I came back,

559
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,400
I bumped into Jiang Zhan.

560
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,310
I saw him setting fire.

561
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,960
After he saw me,

562
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,360
he escaped by jumping into the water.

563
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,160
But the restaurant was already on fire.

564
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,550
It couldn't be extinguished.

565
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:08,790
Sir,

566
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,470
this man held a grudge against my family

567
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,400
for canceling his marriage.

568
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,680
His current statement is contradictory

569
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,710
and does not stand up

570
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:15,750
to scrutiny.

571
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,470
Sir,

572
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,680
the burn marks on my legs

573
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,510
are the most direct evidence I have.

574
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,840
The situation that night was critical.

575
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,990
Everyone was panicking.

576
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,360
It's reasonable

577
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,750
if I couldn't remember the details.

578
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,360
Moreover, you have conducted
a search for days.

579
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,270
Jiang Zhan was the one
who was nowhere to be found.

580
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,200
I'm sure
he must have fled to escape punishment.

581
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,030
Sir, please issue a wanted warrant
as soon as possible.

582
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,960
Please uphold justice

583
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,160
for the dead

584
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,230
and the wounded!

585
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,960
Your statements alone

586
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,640
aren't sufficient to convict Jiang Zhan.

587
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,030
But right now,

588
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,750
we have to find Jiang Zhan

589
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,750
before we can proceed with the case.

590
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,310
Sir, my brother has told me everything

591
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,510
that happened on that night.

592
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,680
Do you know where Jiang Zhan is?

593
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:01,600
That's right.

594
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:02,920
Impossible.

595
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,600
Isn't Jiang Zhan already...?

596
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,440
What did you say? Why is it impossible?

597
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,750
Indeed.

598
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,200
The Count of Dongping's Mansion
deceived the public

599
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,600
by saying that Jiang Zhan went missing
after falling into the water.

600
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,230
In reality, you are keeping him
somewhere else.

601
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,840
Sir, you mustn't show favoritism!

602
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,750
Jiang Si.

603
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,200
Where exactly is Jiang Zhan?

604
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,230
My brother appeared
in my dream last night.

605
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,160
He told me the entire story

606
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,070
without omitting a single detail.

607
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,030
He didn't set
the pavilion on fire at all.

608
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,960
I can't allow any crooks

609
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,120
to slander him.

610
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,550
Thunder in broad daylight?
I'm sure there are grievances involved.

611
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,360
I never expected Jiang Zhan
to appear in his sister's dream

612
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,470
even after death.

613
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,160
Do ghosts actually

614
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,840
appear in one's dream
to relay their messages?

615
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,510
Zhang Sheng lured my brother

616
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,750
to Huiyue Restaurant.

617
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,920
During that period,

618
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,710
the five of them abused him.

619
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,310
They abused him until he died.

620
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,120
Are they inhumane?

621
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,360
That's going too far！

622
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,640
That princess is so cruel.

623
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,360
Precisely.

624
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,310
What a joke.

625
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,880
We're in court.

626
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,790
How could we believe something

627
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,510
as ridiculous as a ghost
appearing in her dream?

628
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,510
Sir, you may instruct your men
to conduct an investigation.

629
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,880
Among the evidence

630
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,600
that you guys have found,

631
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,470
have you guys found
a duck-shaped incense furnace?

632
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,160
Someone!

633
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,440
Make haste.

634
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,120
Ji Chongyi.

635
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,710
Let me ask you this.

636
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,070
Did you see

637
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,790
this furnace when you were there?

638
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:44,550
I...

639
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,960
I couldn't remember.

640
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,710
Let me help you
recall your memories, then.

641
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,230
When you guys got tired
of beating my brother up,

642
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,200
you realized that he
was no longer breathing.

643
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,750
You and Cui Yi

644
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,510
dumped my brother's body
into the Jinshui River!

645
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,160
Ji Chongyi!

646
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,230
You murdered my brother.

647
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,960
You should pay for it with your life!

648
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,400
Nonsense!

649
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,230
I didn't kill him!

650
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,470
I merely kicked him!

651
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,840
Her Highness told the others

652
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,400
to push him into the river!
It's none of my business!

653
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,400
I didn't kill him!

654
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,710
I didn't!

655
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,600
Ji Chongyi, how dare you?

656
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,360
How dare you malign Her Highness?

657
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,960
Did he actually malign her?

658
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,510
Or was the Princess Royal's Mansion
taking innocent lives for fun

659
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,680
just because of their authority?

660
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:20,960
Do you guys think

661
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,510
you can disregard the lives
of other people

662
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,310
just because you all
are from the imperial family?

663
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,920
Not only have you guys
committed a crime,

664
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,070
but you guys also shamelessly

665
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:27,680
shifted the blame

666
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,880
onto an innocent person!

667
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,680
Precisely!

668
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,070
How could they bully them like that?

669
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,510
They have no regard
for other people's lives!

670
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,400
He's from the Princess Royal's Mansion!

671
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
Yeah! He is!

672
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,510
Mind your manners!

673
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:36,960
Silence!

674
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,070
This is the main hall
of the Capital Administration Office.

675
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,310
This isn't the marketplace.

676
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,200
Though dream communication
is improbable,

677
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,640
Jiang Si's evidence

678
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,550
precisely

679
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,990
matches the case.

680
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,070
Let me ask you this.

681
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,880
Has your brother mentioned the fire

682
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:53,960
when he was in your dream?

683
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,230
I...

684
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,310
Remember.

685
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,640
Tonight, you were with me all the time.

686
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
You didn't go anywhere else.

687
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,880
The fire occurred because the wind
knocked down the candlestick.

688
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:06,990
It was an accident.

689
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,640
It's on fire!

690
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,550
The place is burning!

691
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,960
Stop drinking!

692
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,600
It's on fire!

693
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,840
Hurry and run!

694
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:13,960
Fire!

695
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,680
It's burning up!

696
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,070
Fire!

697
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,070
It's burning up!

698
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,960
Why did they not act
when there was a fire?

699
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,750
It's all because they were drunk.

700
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,270
They thought the fire
was their hallucination.

701
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
After that, Cui Mingyue
was the first to escape.

702
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,310
She jumped out of the window
and into the river.

703
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,470
Zhang Sheng and Cui Yi

704
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,990
were trapped by the pillar.

705
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,310
Yang Shengcai couldn't swim.

706
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,400
He drowned.

707
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,160
Zhang Sheng asked Ji Chongyi for help.

708
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,790
But he ignored his plea

709
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,640
and escaped alone.

710
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,790
As for the two who were trapped,

711
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,030
they perished in the fire.

712
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,790
Someone, summon the coroner.

713
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,230
Sir,

714
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
Zhang Sheng's stomach does contain

715
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,710
a large amount of liquor
that was burned up.

716
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,510
The Yang family and the Cui family

717
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,710
didn't allow us to perform an autopsy.

718
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,230
Therefore, I don't know.

719
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,880
But Zhang Sheng and Cui Yi

720
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,790
did die from inhaling excess smoke.

721
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,440
Yang Shengcai drowned.

722
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,840
All of her statements
match the coroner's!

723
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,230
This is truly magical.

724
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,270
I'm sure Jiang Zhan
suffered a wrongful death.

725
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,470
His soul witnessed the entire process.

726
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,200
That's why he relayed
the message to Miss Si.

727
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:23,990
Ji Chongyi,

728
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,750
it has already come to this.

729
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,920
You better confess.

730
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,600
Did you and the gang
conspire to kill Jiang Zhan?

731
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,270
Dream communication?

732
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,270
This place shouldn't be called
the Capital Administration Office,

733
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,600
but the Office
of the Underworld's Judge.

734
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,440
We don't need magistrates like you all.

735
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,550
Wouldn't it be easier
to just hire a psychic

736
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,400
to talk to ghosts?

737
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,230
That's right.

738
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,600
That's right.

739
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,070
What nonsense are you talking about?

740
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,310
I think something's off

741
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,160
with the Capital Administration Office.

742
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,470
You guys conspired with Jiang Si

743
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,270
and conjured such a tale
to deceive the public.

744
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,640
If you don't believe
in the existence of relentless souls,

745
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,680
why did you confess

746
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,920
that someone else abused
and killed Jiang Zhan?

747
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,200
Why did you say
that Cui Mingyue instructed them

748
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,030
to toss Jiang Zhan
into the Jinshui River

749
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,360
while you merely kicked him a few times?

750
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:04,990
Just now,

751
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,120
Jiang Si spooked me with her words.

752
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,750
That's why I spoke without thinking.

753
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,710
Is that so?

754
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,640
Ji Chongyi, this is the court.

755
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:13,960
Every single word and action of yours

756
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,070
will be recorded.

757
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,960
You won't get to deny it.

758
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,200
Anyway, I'm not convinced
that you can close this case

759
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,550
with the statements
of dream communication.

760
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,120
I'll never yield

761
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,270
unless you have substantial evidence!

762
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,120
How dare you not yield?

763
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,160
Who said he didn't have
substantial evidence?

764
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,710
Where did he come from?

765
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,550
He's utterly drenched.

766
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
But it didn't rain.

767
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,270
Indeed.

768
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,070
A ghost!

769
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,070
That's a ghost!

770
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,960
A ghost!

771
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,070
Ji Chongyi,

772
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,070
if you don't tell them the truth,

773
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,120
I'll drag you down

774
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,680
to the Underground with me.

775
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,990
Don't come near me!

776
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,440
I didn't kill you!

777
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,790
It has nothing to do with me!

778
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,550
It's all...

779
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,960
It's all because of Princess Mingyue!

780
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,510
She told me to do it!

781
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,120
The Princess Royal.

782
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:32,920
She didn't want her daughter

783
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,400
to be involved with a court case!

784
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,270
That's why she forced me
to give false testimony!

785
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,230
Princess Mingyue

786
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,310
didn't faint at all!

787
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,640
Go and find her! Don't come to me!

788
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,710
I don't know anything!

789
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,960
I didn't do anything!

790
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,120
I'm begging you!

791
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,230
Please don't kill me!

792
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,230
I beg of you!

793
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,200
Don't kill me!

794
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,310
Zhan.

795
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,160
You're back.

796
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,400
Was the second son of the Jiang family

797
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,640
a soul? Or was he alive?

798
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,790
The Capital Administration Office
can conduct trials for humans,

799
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,400
but can they conduct trials

800
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,120
for vengeful souls?

801
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,880
That's too much of a cliffhanger.

802
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,790
Now, we have no mood to eat!

803
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,160
- Precisely.
- Yeah.

804
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,960
What about this?

805
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,920
I'll pay you
for the next session as well.

806
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,920
Tell us the entire story.

807
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,600
- Yeah, hurry up.
- Yeah.

808
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,550
Hurry up.

809
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,990
If you wish to know what happens next,

810
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,790
please attend the next session.

811
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:51,880
Father.

812
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:00,990
Father?

813
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
Father!

814
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,070
Zhan?

815
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:16,310
Zhan!

816
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,070
Zhan!

817
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,600
Zhan!

818
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,070
Father!

819
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,790
Zhan, is it truly you?

820
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,470
I'm back.

821
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,880
I'm glad that you're back.

822
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,680
Zhan, I'm so glad!

823
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,550
Father!

824
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,710
Zhan, slow down.

825
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,400
Don't choke yourself.

826
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:48,920
This is so delicious.

827
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,790
Have some water.

828
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:53,840
By the way, Zhan,

829
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,470
how are your injuries

830
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,790
now?

831
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,680
Yeah.

832
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,680
Shouldn't we hire a physician

833
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,160
to give you another diagnosis
just in case?

834
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,960
I think so.

835
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,960
No need for that. I've fully recovered.

836
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:06,750
Look.

837
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,030
I'll return to my normal state

838
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,470
after resting for a few more days.

839
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:16,990
Besides,

840
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,640
do those rascals think

841
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,030
that they can hurt me?

842
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,880
I'm not afraid
even if they call for backup.

843
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,990
You brat,

844
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,550
you never liked admitting defeat.

845
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,310
All right. Tell us now.

846
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,510
How did you escape

847
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,920
from the jaws of death?

848
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:37,840
I pretended to be dead.

849
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,160
How?

850
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,640
Their goal was to kill me.

851
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,680
That's why I pretended to be dead.

852
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,230
They can't just

853
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,230
revive me, right?

854
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,310
Your Highness, he's really dead.

855
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,400
What do we do?

856
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,750
Then let's just throw him into the river

857
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,550
and be done with it.

858
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,270
I never expected

859
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,640
those rascals

860
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,440
to try and erase
all traces of their crime.

861
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,400
I didn't realize

862
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,400
that the Jinshui River was that deep.

863
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,110
In a daze,

864
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,550
I heard you calling me.

865
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,989
So, I struggled desperately.

866
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,960
But my body couldn't take it

867
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,719
before I reached the surface.

868
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,070
I thought to myself

869
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,719
that I wouldn't be able
to see you two again.

870
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,630
I don't know

871
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,469
what happened after that.

872
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,400
So,

873
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,840
how were you rescued in the end?

874
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,150
Of course

875
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:28,800
I went to his rescue.

876
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,670
It was because of
Qi's accurate prediction.

877
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,239
He told me to check the downstream.

878
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,400
Amazing.

879
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,150
Of course.

880
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,280
Who do you take me for?

881
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,670
I covered all of his meals.

882
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,719
I even went into the river
to catch some fish.

883
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,110
Since you were rescued,

884
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,510
why didn't you hurry back?

885
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,840
You had me worried sick,

886
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,150
you know?

887
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:51,960
Father,

888
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,719
how I wished I could grow wings

889
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,760
and fly back immediately.

890
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,190
But I was still injured back then.

891
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,070
In addition,

892
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,840
the mountain trail was hard to traverse.

893
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,280
What are you doing?

894
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:54,720
I'm applying medicine to your wound.

895
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,960
What medicine?

896
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,920
Does it hurt?

897
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,990
A little.

898
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,190
Bear with it.

899
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,360
Be gentle, then...

900
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,720
That hurts!

901
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,110
You're fine since you can shout.

902
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,470
That means you'll recover soon.

903
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,960
You're a girl.

904
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,760
How are you this strong?

905
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,590
Press it yourself.

906
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,920
Men and women should keep
a proper distance.

907
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,190
Hold it properly.

908
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,070
Don't let it fall.

909
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:51,990
Understood?

910
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,550
Understood.

911
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:10,960
Tonight,

912
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,720
let's rest here.

913
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,400
Here?

914
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,720
I just returned to life.

915
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,510
Now, I have to spend the night here?

916
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,990
I'll end up
as a corpse in the wilderness.

917
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,240
Touchwood!

918
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,110
I don't want to end up

919
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:25,990
as a corpse in the wilderness like you.

920
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,440
Just you see.

921
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,240
I'll go and catch a fish.

922
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,920
Let me join you.

923
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:35,920
You?

924
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,440
Forget it.

925
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,720
If you get injured again,

926
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,920
it'll make things troublesome.

927
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,280
I'm fine.

928
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,590

00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:15,920
Where?

965
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:22,840
What is this?

966
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,720
I was bored last night.

967
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,110
I carved it out of boredom.
It's for you.

968
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,150
Jiang Zhan, I never expected you

969
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,880
to be good at handicrafts.

970
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,800
What's with the silly grin?

971
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:43,760
What is that?

972
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,510
It's nothing.

973
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,880
Is that a horse

974
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,800
or something else?

975
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,030
This pig carving

976
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,990
does resemble the real deal.

977
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,280
Come on.

978
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,320
This is a horse carving.

979
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,800
It's a carving of your horse.

980
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,800
When Lushengxiang Store first opened,

981
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,110
you gave

982
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,510
my little sister

983
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,670
the horse carving you made.

984
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,760
So, it's a horse.

985
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,510
All right. I'll use it

986
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,720
as my new protective charm.

987
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:27,880
So,

988
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,990
thank you.

989
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:31,760
Thanks for saving me.

990
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,280
It's nothing.

991
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,550
Even if

992
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,150
a dog

993
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,720
were in the river,

994
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,280
I would've rescued it too.

995
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,360
After that, I told Chuchu

996
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,150
to take me back to Ling'an
after I felt better.

997
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,070
But when we entered the city,

998
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,510
I heard the streets buzzing about

999
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,960
the public trial conducted
by the Capital Administration Office.

1000
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,470
After some inquiries,

1001
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,800
Chuchu was witty enough

1002
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,920
to tell me

1003
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,030
to attend the trial

1004
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,070
by pretending to be a ghost.

1005
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:04,670
By the way, Zhan,

1006
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,150
why was your face bleeding, then?

1007
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:15,800
It's amazing, right?

1008
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,510
I wonder

1009
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,990
what Chuchu is doing now.

1010
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,070
I haven't had the chance

1011
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,510
to thank her in person yet.

1012
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,360
Madam Jiang has invited us

1013
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:36,990
to her banquet.

1014
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,110
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1015
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:39,720
Lu Chuchu!

1016
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,550
Go and get changed!
