and caused a tragic incident.

187
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,770
He is permanently banned

188
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,990
from the imperial exam
and any official position.

189
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,320
The Duke of Anguo had failed
to educate his son properly.

190
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,110
His salary will be forfeited
for three years.

191
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,200
May she abide by the laws

192
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,680
and speak and act with caution.

193
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,230
The authorities will enforce the decree.

194
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,280
The authorities will enforce the decree.

195
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,680
Come and receive the decree.

196
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,110
His Majesty has issued a decree.

197
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,040
Jiang Zhan
of the Count of Dongping's Mansion

198
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,470
is intelligent, diligent in learning,
and exceptional in martial skills.

199
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,710
He has been granted a special promotion
to the Imperial Insignia Guard.

200
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,230
The Count of Dongping had done well
in educating his child.

201
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,750
He is granted the hereditary title
for up to five generations.

202
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,830
The authorities will enforce the decree.

203
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,920
Count of Dongping, Mr. Jiang,

204
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,800
receive the decree
and thank His Majesty's grace.

205
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,200
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

206
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,440
Please rise.

207
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,350
This is great.

208
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,750
Sir, thank you for coming.

209
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,680
I've worked hard for so long.

210
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,110
But now, due to the imperial decree,

211
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,200
I don't even need

212
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,200
to attend the selections.

213
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,830
This is good.

214
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,400
Zhan, you're lucky.

215
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,350
Zhan,

216
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,230
this is truly great news.

217
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,750
It was a blessing in disguise all along.

218
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,830
His Majesty

219
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,510
has treated
the Count of Dongping's Mansion well.

220
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,320
Treated us well?

221
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,870
His Majesty has treated
the Princess Royal's Mansion well.

222
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,750
He tosses us

223
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,350
a small benefit

224
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,590
and expects us to drop the matter.

225
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,320
It's all to ensure

226
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,560
that Cui Mingyue stays unharmed.

227
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,960
Stop it.

228
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,920
If others hear what you said,

229
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,400
the consequences will be dire.

230
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,110
Look at this child.

231
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,470
Zhan,

232
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,160
I thought our hereditary title

233
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,590
would've ended

234
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,750
at your father's generation.

235
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,230
But you've managed to extend it
for two more generations.

236
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,280
You've contributed a lot

237
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,280
to the Count of Dongping's Mansion.

238
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,110
Grandmother,

239
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,920
do you think

240
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,230
that beating I took

241
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,510
was totally worth it?

242
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,470
What are you doing here alone?

243
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,080
I...

244
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,040
Your family is worried about you

245
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,920
because they can't find you.

246
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,280
I just want to...

247
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,400
How did you know that I was here?

248
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,560
I was just trying my luck.

249
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,200
You and I first met at this spot.

250
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:33,920
Since the weather is good,

251
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,040
I thought you might be here

252
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,960
to enjoy the view again.

253
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,470
I just want some time alone.

254
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,960
If so, just treat it as if I'm not here.

255
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,080
Hey, I said I needed some time alone.

256
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,830
You're so annoying.

257
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,710
I just never expected His Majesty

258
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,630
to extend our hereditary title,
which is a huge deal,

259
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,870
just to silence us.

260
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,160
The funniest thing

261
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,750
is that taking that beating

262
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,040
was actually the best thing

263
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,400
I've ever done for my family.

264
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,200
I'm sure you think I'm useless.

265
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,320
You know, I've loved

266
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,350
reading storybooks

267
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
ever since I was a kid.

268
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,510
I wanted

269
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,830
to be a wandering swordswoman.

270
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,280
However, I've never
stepped outside my house before.

271
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
I could only travel the world

272
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,200
in my dreams.

273
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,830
But look at me.

274
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,110
I'm sitting right in front of you now.

275
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:09,830
Therefore,

276
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,080
no matter how far our destination is,

277
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,960
as long as we hold it
close to our hearts,

278
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,510
we'll arrive eventually.

279
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,470
We'll arrive eventually, huh?

280
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,080
We'll arrive eventually.

281
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,080
I already told you.
I'm not going to Lingshui.

282
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,440
Mother,

283
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,920
I don't want to go to Lingshui.

284
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,470
Like it or not, you're going there.

285
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,320
Do you dare defy the imperial decree?

286
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,320
Mother,

287
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,920
you should make a plea
for me in front of Uncle.

288
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,830
He listens to everything you say.

289
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,400
How could you not understand?

290
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,400
He's sending you there
so that you can lay low.

291
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,680
Right now, the civil officials

292
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,470
in the court are criticizing you.

293
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,470
Everyone on the streets
is talking about what you've done.

294
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,960
Public opinion is terrifying, you know?

295
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,750
I managed to procure

296
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,350
this imperial decree

297
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,590
after a lot of effort.

298
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,040
Your Highness,

299
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,710
Her Highness has already done
everything she could.

300
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,110
You should lay low
in Lingshui for the time being.

301
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,630
Once everything settles down,

302
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,560
Her Highness
will definitely ask His Majesty

303
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,960
to grant your return.

304
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,110
You're Her Highness's only daughter.

305
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,280
How could she bear

306
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,920
to part with you?

307
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,400
If so,

308
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,350
how long do I have to stay there?

309
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,470
Until you truly repent of your actions

310
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,920
and stop causing trouble.

311
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,230
Mother,

312
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,830
I know my fault now.

313
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,080
Don't worry.

314
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,830
I'll head to Lingshui
just like I'm supposed to.

315
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,750
I'll head to the ancestral hall

316
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,350
and chant sutras
for my late cousin every day.

317
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,870
I'll never cause any trouble again.

318
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,160
The weather is getting colder,

319
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,680
so bring her more warm clothes.

320
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,359
She has always had a sensitive stomach
and is quite picky with food.

321
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,069
Send two chefs from the household
to cook for her.

322
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,750
Yes, Your Highness. Don't worry.

323
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,470
I've made the necessary preparations.

324
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,960
You must reflect upon your actions.

325
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,550
Do not disappoint me again.

326
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,680
Understood, Mother.

327
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,960
Xiaolyu.

328
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,640
What have I done wrong?

329
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
I was wrong for not being cruel enough.

330
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,790
I should have stabbed Jiang Zhan

331
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,880
at least a dozen times

332
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,710
to make sure that he was dead.

333
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,790
Wait.

334
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
You just rescued me.

335
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,840
Tell me.

336
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,840
What do you want?

337
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,550
Go.

338
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,200
Send a letter to Zaoshu Alley.

339
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
Tell Yu Qi

340
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,710
to see me off tomorrow
at the Wuli Pavilion

341
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,120
outside the city.

342
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,510
Tell him this.

343
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,710
If he doesn't show up,

344
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,360
I'll invite the Jiang family there.

345
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,550
Yes, Your Highness.

346
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,470
Let's have some tea first.

347
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,550
Zhan had a close shave this time.

348
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,470
I'm sure all of us

349
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,600
were anxious and nervous.

350
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,600
Now that everything is getting better,

351
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,360
why don't we go on a trip?

352
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,680
Let's go and have some fun, shall we?

353
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,470
- Sure.
- Sure.

354
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,030
Where are we heading?

355
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,270
Let's head to...

356
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,710
Lingshui.

357
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,030
Si and I intend to head back

358
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,310
and pay respect to our ancestors anyway.

359
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,990
Since I survived this ordeal,

360
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,680
I should tell Yi about it.

361
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,470
You're quite clever, huh?

362
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,960
You're making us escort you there

363
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,230
so that you can perform your duties.

364
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,120
It's more fun this way.

365
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,120
Besides,

366
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,550
the scenery along the way is enchanting.

367
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,310
I guarantee that you'll like it.

368
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,030
I need to join

369
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,400
the Imperial Insignia Guards
in a few days.

370
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,960
We don't have time to waste.

371
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,840
I'll head back

372
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,710
and notify Father.

373
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,790
Let's depart tomorrow.

374
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,030
Zhan, we should see Mr. Zhen

375
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,440
before our departure.

376
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,550
This is your second time

377
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,790
dropping your charges.

378
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,920
Indeed.

379
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,400
The mastermind, Cui Mingyue,

380
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,510
was deemed as an accomplice.

381
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,680
She merely received
a demotion by one rank.

382
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,270
How is that a punishment?

383
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,230
Mr. Zhan, you were abused by them.

384
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,640
Do you intend
to let them off just like that?

385
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,470
Or are you choosing

386
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,640
to keep quiet

387
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,270
because of the rewards you've received?

388
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,070
Mr. Zhen, are you belittling me?

389
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,840
His Majesty issued the decree

390
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,920
as a gesture of consolation and a test.

391
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,840
If the Count of Dongping's Mansion
rejected the reward and pressed charges

392
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,640
to the very end,

393
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,710
Cui Mingyue

394
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,790
would get the punishment she deserves.

395
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,840
Mr. Zhen, it's easy for you to say.

396
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,680
What would you do

397
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,710
if you were in my shoes?

398
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,470
If I were in your shoes...

399
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,880
I would definitely press charges
against her until the end.

400
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,600
Only death may stop me.

401
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,710
Miss Si,

402
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,230
Mr. Zhan,

403
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,640
I do not indulge in endless discussions

404
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,640
without taking action.

405
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,640
As long as you two are willing,

406
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,030
I'll accompany you until the end

407
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,120
even if it means I have to risk

408
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,440
losing my position.

409
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,710
If, in the future,

410
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,510
His Majesty still chooses
to practice favoritism,

411
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,440
I'll definitely offer my counsel
to His Majesty

412
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,400
even at the cost of my life.

413
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,270
Thank you. Mr. Zhen.

414
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,640
But

415
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,310
that will be unnecessary.

416
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,510
Miss Si, do you not believe me?

417
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,470
I do believe you.

418
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,230
But the Count of Dongping's Mansion

419
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,960
is unworthy of such a favor.

420
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,030
Mr. Zhen, all of us know

421
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,750
that you're a good official.

422
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,840
So you should fight for the benefit

423
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,710
of the people of Ling'an.

424
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,550
You shouldn't take such a huge risk

425
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,550
for the sake

426
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,030
of our family.

427
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,070
Moreover,

428
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,400
we know that you're noble and fearless.

429
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,310
However,

430
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,680
we're mere commoners.

431
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,880
Although the Count of Dongping's Mansion

432
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,070
isn't exactly satisfied

433
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,440
with the current result,

434
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,750
we understand the importance
of recognizing the situation.

435
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,680
Mr. Zhen, please don't worry about us.

436
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,200
Farewell.

437
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,180
[Main Hall
of the Capital Administration Office]

438
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,960
Miss Si, wait.

439
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,470
Mr. Zhen, do you need anything else?

440
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,750
I...

441
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,360
It's nothing.

442
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,070
I just wish to speak with you

443
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,510
in private.

444
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Zhan, you can wait for me

445
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,640
over there.

446
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,790
All right.

447
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:05,880
Miss Si,

448
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,030
I still have feelings...

449
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,710
Mr. Zhen.

450
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,880
Zhen, in the future,

451
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,400
you don't need

452
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,710
to waste your time on me.

453
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,400
Did I make you upset

454
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
with my words just now?

455
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,360
That's not it.

456
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,200
Zhen, you have an upright nature.

457
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,990
I'm impressed

458
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,310
by what you said just now.

459
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,680
Miss Si,

460
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,440
I knew that you could understand me.

461
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,710
The Princess Royal wields
absolute authority.

462
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,360
I will surely not press the issue

463
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,360
if it were someone else.

464
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,270
But you are Miss Si

465
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,600
who fears neither gossip

466
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,470
nor power and wealth.

467
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,030
You could even...

468
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:42,550
Zhen.

469
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,270
My brother has just experienced

470
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,070
a near-death crisis.

471
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,200
He was lucky enough

472
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,710
to have survived the ordeal.

473
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,160
In the future,

474
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,990
I only hope that my family and I

475
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,680
can lead peaceful lives.

476
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,470
Also, about what you said just now,

477
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,990
the Jiang Si who once had the courage

478
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,960
to stand up in court

479
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,070
is not all that I am.

480
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,990
Most of the time,

481
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,680
I'll fear, go into hiding,

482
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,750
and weigh the pros and cons.

483
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,270
You don't need
to belittle yourself like that.

484
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,270
As the saying goes,
true courage appears as caution.

485
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,310
How many women in this world

486
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,550
can muster the same courage

487
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,400
as you?

488
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,640
I didn't belittle myself.

489
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,120
Zhen,

490
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,310
I'm not as good

491
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,600
as you imagine.

492
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,230
The sky has dark clouds,

493
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,990
just like how people have shadows.

494
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,230
In the court,

495
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,880
I once lied.

496
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,120
I've resorted to certain means

497
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,600
outside the court

498
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,200
in order to achieve my goals.

499
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,200
Zhen, in your world,

500
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,790
everything is either black or white.

501
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,510
Therefore, you and I

502
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,470
don't suit each other.

503
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,640
I beg to differ.

504
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:11,990
Constant dripping wears away the stone,

505
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,750
and faith will move mountains.

506
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,310
But I'm not the one you're seeking.

507
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,550
Miss Si, you rejected me
and didn't even give me a chance.

508
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,960
It's because you already
have someone you fancy,

509
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,400
right?

510
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,030
I rejected you

511
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,600
merely because

512
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,470
we don't suit each other.

513
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,510
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

514
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,680
I see.

515
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,120
Farewell.

516
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,230

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,680
Has Yu Qi

518
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,160
seen your dark side before?

519
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,360
Does he know everything about you?

520
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,030
He does.

00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,440

They look great.

Look. I arranged these flowers for you.

Do they look nice?

538
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,400
You returned to Ling'an
without being summoned.

539
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:22,960
Does His Majesty know about it?

540
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,470
Are you blackmailing me?

541
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,510
You're an intelligent man.

if you're an exiled prince

547

that she can provide him
with a luxurious life

can rise through the ranks, huh?

00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,790
Do you all truly think

558
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,920
that everything will proceed

559
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,790
according to your will
just because you have power?

560
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,230
If so, how did Cao Xingyu
of the Marquis of Changxing's Mansion

561
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,470
end up in prison?

562
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
How was Ji Chongyi
of the Duke of Anguo's Mansion

563
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,750
banned from all official positions?

564
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:21,600
And you, the esteemed Princess Mingyue,

565
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,200
was demoted to a county princess.

566
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,550
You're leaving Ling'an City in disgrace.

567
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,510
Your Highness, I don't think

568
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,790
I need you to worry about my future.

569
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,550
Let me offer you a piece of advice.

570
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,160
Do not repeat your mistake

571
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,550
and ruin your future.

572
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,990
Is it all because of that wretch,
Jiang Si?

573
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,400
Mark my words.

574
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,510
If anyone dares

575
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,750
to covet the person I like,

576
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,310
I'll gouge out her eyes

577
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,960
and cut off her hands.

578
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,640
Try it if you dare.

579
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,550
If you dare

580
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,750
lay a finger on Jiang Si,

581
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,990
you'll get to see

582
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,440
whether this mere commandant

583
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,030
will take your life

584
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,680
or not.

585
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,550
No men ever dared to reject me.

586
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,550
Yu Qi,

587
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,750
one day,

588
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,120
I'll make you marry me

589
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
of your own accord!

590
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,070
Aman.

591
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,550
Miss Chuchu.

592
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,790
I was planning to visit you.

593
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,710
What are you doing here?

594
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,880
Mr. Zhan hasn't had

595
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,880
much of an appetite these past few days.

596
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,230
Miss Si told me to buy some snacks

597
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,310
so that he could have them
during the trip.

598
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,550
Seems like he was deeply affected

599
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,030
by the incident with Princess Mingyue.

600
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,360
Miss Chuchu, you have no idea.

601
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,990
Just now, I saw Princess Mingyue

602
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,310
board the carriage for Lingshui.

603
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,070
She brought so many valuables

604
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
that it didn't seem like she was exiled.

605
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,790
It seemed like
she was going on a trip instead.

606
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,680
Aman, you head back first.

607
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,920
Tell Jiang Zhan

608
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,600
that I'll be there later.

609
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:27,990
Miss Chuchu...

610
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,120
Should I have kept it from her?

611
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,740
[Jiang]

612
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,840
Chuchu and I were supposed
to meet at this time.

613
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,880
Where is she?

614
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,710
Mr. Zhan?

615
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,270
Mr. Zhan.

616
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:47,920
Aman,

617
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,160
have you seen Miss Chuchu

618
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,440
on your way back?

619
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,230
Miss Chuchu said
she had something to attend to.

620
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,200
She'll come here later.

621
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,680
She had something to attend to?

622
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,200
Mr. Zhan,

623
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,270
I also have things to attend to.
I'll leave now.

624
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:01,990
Wait.

625
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:02,960
Aman,

626
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,310
did she not tell you
what she went to do?

627
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:28,940
[Lingshui County]

628
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,110
[Lingshui County]

629
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,510
[Lingshui County]

630
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,070
Over here.

631
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,310
[Lingshui County]

632
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,840
What's the matter?

633
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,230
Why are you all in a daze? Keep going.

634
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:46,980
[Lingshui County]

635
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,340
[Lingshui County]

636
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,400
Why haven't we arrived at the inn yet?

637
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,800
Your Highness, please pardon us.

638
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:14,989
I was perplexed as well.

639
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,840
We should have arrived
at the inn long ago.

640
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,510
Maybe we took the detour.

641
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,400
Useless fool.

642
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,320
It's so hot in here.

643
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,510
Your Highness, I think

644
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,719
we just passed by this place.

645
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:27,190
Are we stuck

646
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,960
in some kind of ghostly illusion?

647
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,440
What nonsense are you talking about?

648
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,920
Seems like someone needs

649
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,150
to spend the night in the woods.

650
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,510
Who's there?

651
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:37,880
After her!

652
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,110
Stop right there!

653
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,960
- Stop right there!
- Stop right there!

654
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,110
Stop right there!

655
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,400
Stop right there!

656
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,239
Stop right there!

657
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,360
Stop right there!

658
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,470
Chuchu,

659
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,880
where exactly did you go?

660
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,190
I was out for a stroll.

661
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,320
Aman, are you done packing?

662
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,550
Well, if you were out for a stroll...

663
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,150
Is your arm injured?

664
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,510
It's nothing. I just bumped

665
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,670
into a carriage during my walk.

666
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,510
Miss Chuchu.

667
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,070
I'm done packing.

668
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,800
Where's Miss Si?

669
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:20,670
She's at Haitang House.

670
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,320
Let's go see her.

671
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,030
Sure. Let's go.

672
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,280
Mr. Zhan, please join us.

673
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,760
Let's go.

674
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,510
What's with all the secrecy?

675
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,360
I'll get you some ointment.

676
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:36,920
Chief,

677
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,470
there's progress on the incident
related to the Directorate of Astronomy.

678
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,030
Back then,
the Chief Astronomer, Mr. Chu,

679
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:40,720
and the Registrar, Mr. Xiao,
were the first ones

680
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,320
to submit a false memorial
accusing you of being ominous.

681
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,800
Where are they right now?

682
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,590
They're both at Lingshui.

683
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,070
Lingshui?

684
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,550
If so, let's return to the city first.

685
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,550
We'll depart for Lingshui tomorrow.

686
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,360
There's no need to return.

687
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,840
I've already brought everything

688
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,670
we needed.

689
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,760
We can depart now.

690
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,760
Back then, a fortune teller said

691
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,240
that I was ill-fated.

692
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,760
It caused my father

693
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,110
to send me to somewhere distant.

694
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
If the weak

695
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,470
are unjustly blamed

696
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,840
with baseless accusations by others

697
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,510
yet refuse to seek the truth

698
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,470
or fight back,

699
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,960
they only validate

700
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,070
those wicked people's lies

701
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,670
and become their accomplices.

702
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,920
If I were framed,

703
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,840
I'd make sure those responsible

704
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,030
pay the price.

705
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:25,440
Chief.

706
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:26,720
Chief?

707
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,030
Chief,

708
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,280
were you worried about Miss Si just now?

709
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,440
I don't know

710
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,550
if I should say this.

711
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,880
But I'm worried that Miss Si

712
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,240
has already included you in her plans.

713
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,720
Chief, I'm not done yet.

714
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,400
I haven't started my analysis yet.

715
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,240
I think Miss Si really

716
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,070
has the Saintess's ability
to predict the future.

717
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,630
Chief!

718
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,630
Yu.

719
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,510
Qi.

720
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,550
Where are you all going?

721
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,630
Now, I'm a member
of the Imperial Insignia Guards.

722
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,760
I wish to return to our hometown
at Lingshui with my sister

723
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,190
and pay respect to our ancestors
before assuming my position.

724
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,720
We're using the opportunity
to go on a trip as well.

725
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,280
I've never been to Lingshui before.

726
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,360
That's why I joined them.

727
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,800
That sounds pretty fun.

728
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,880
Commandant Yu,

729
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,670
why don't you join us, then?

730
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,840
Yeah. The more the merrier.

731
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,400
That's right.

732
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,190
Chief has some official affairs
to attend to.

733
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,150
Official affairs?

734
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
I thought you

735
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,240
came all the way here to see us off.

736
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,880
We're not exactly here to see you off.

737
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,030
Just now, we...

738
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,470
Just now,
we were wandering around nearby

739
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,280
with no particular purpose.

740
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,320
I guess we could join you

741
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:38,920
for the trip.

742
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,960
That's great.

743
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:40,920
Yu,

744
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,720
they're so slow.

745
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,670
I wanted

746
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,840
to race against someone, you know?

747
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,510
You think you can race against Qi?

748
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,590
Try to catch up with me first.

749
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,110
You didn't do the countdown.

750
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,400
All right. You two can go ahead.

751
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,240
I'll take a breather first.

752
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,280
All right. We'll see you later.

753
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,670
What's wrong?

754
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,470
Are you homesick?

755
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:21,760
I'm fine.

756
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,030
I'm glad that you're here with me.

757
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,470
Miss Jiang,

758
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,240
the scenery is great.

759
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,280
Would you like to take a walk?

760
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,190
Thank you, Commandant Yu.

761
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,240
But it's fine.

762
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,150
I'll enjoy the view in the carriage.

763
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,510
We aren't in court.

764
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,440
Don't call me Commandant Yu.
It sounds distant.

765
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,110
I'll call you

766
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,440
Mr. Yu, then?

767
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,320
Sure.

768
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,280
Mr. Yu.

769
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,720
I have to thank you

770
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,360
for rescuing my brother.

771
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,190
Close neighbors are more reliable
than distant relatives, you know?

772
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,670
If you ever

773
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,070
need any help in the future,

774
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,800
just let me know.

775
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,470
Are you sure you two
are just close neighbors?

776
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,240
I think there are at least

777
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,670
eight families in the neighborhood.

778
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,150
Mr. Yu, I never saw you

779
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,840
putting in that much effort
to help them out.

780
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,280
Miss Si, it's all because of you.

781
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,550
You and your silver tongue.

782
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,320
Mr. Yu,

783
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,800
before this, I had a nightmare.

784
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,990
I dreamt that my brother
would be in trouble.

785
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,880
When I told other people about it,

786
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,630
they all thought I was overthinking it.

787
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,800
You were the only person who believed me

788
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,840
when I told you about it.

789
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,670
You had no reason

790
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,630
to lie to me anyway.

791
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,030
But seeing your dreams come true

792
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,240
must be quite interesting.

793
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,030
Have you dreamed

794
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,920
of anything else?

795
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,550
Maybe you can predict the future.

796
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,670
Mr. Yu, you must be joking.

797
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,630
How could an ordinary person like me

798
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,960
possess such a power?

799
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,110
Yu, Si,

800
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,800
there's a beautiful stream up ahead.

801
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,510
Let's go there together

802
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,240
and take a break.

803
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,400
I caught it!

804
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,190
Long Dan, you're amazing!

805
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,070
Chief! I caught one!

806
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,280
Hurry. Put it in the basket!

807
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:37,990
You're amazing!

808
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,960
That's a huge fish!

809
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:39,880
Hurry. It's slippery.

810
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,360
That's such a small fish.

811
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,190
I'll catch a big one for you.

812
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,070
Come on, then.

813
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,720
Mr. Zhan, are you sure about this?

814
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,800
Zhan, you should start the fire.

815
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,960
I think I'll go and start the fire.

816
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,670
We don't have any firewood.

817
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,720
I'll help you.

818
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,030
I'll gather some dry branches
over there.

819
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,550
Sure.

820
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,150
Be careful not to cut your hand.

821
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,510
Jiang Zhan, look!

822
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,280
I caught one!

823
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,110
You're amazing!

824
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:52,590
What's wrong?

825
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,470
What happened?

826
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,920
Wait for me.

827
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,030
What's wrong? Did you sprain your ankle?

828
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,360
Let me carry you on my back.

829
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,440
Can you get on my back?

830
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,720
One, two, up!

831
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,280
Let's go.

832
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,550
Put me down.

833
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:31,990
It's going to rain.

834
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,470
I'll carry you to the woods ahead.

835
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:35,670
Let's go.

836
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,030
Be careful.

837
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:44,800
Be careful.
