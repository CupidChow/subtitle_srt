to tell the truth now!

129

It won't kill her, right?

130

374
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,160
He's your only kin.

375
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,600
You should look after him.

376
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,200
Go now.

377
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,710
Thank you, Your Highness.

378
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,120
Let's go.

379
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,640
What are you doing here?

380
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,070
Aunt, we're in trouble.

381
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,960
Are you sure about that?

382
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,990
Yes.

383
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,030
Should we notify Her Highness?

384
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,160
That's inappropriate.

385
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,680
Her Highness only cares
about the results,

386
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,470
not the process.

387
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,880
All these years, many people

388
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,710
have tried everything
to get close to her.

389
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,920
Her Highness no longer

390
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,200
trusts me as much either.

391
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,550
We can't afford

392
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,440
to fail this task.

393
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,270
Yes, Aunt.

394
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,030
Why did you take me here?

395
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,920
Why are we using the back door?

396
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,230
Aunt, we've arrived.

397
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,990
Where are we?

398
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,270
Look at this place.

399
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,640
You...

400
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,840
You're finally here.

401
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,920
What exactly is going on?

402
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,920
The same poison

403
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,550
took Su Ke's life easily.

404
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,400
How did things go wrong

405
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,960
when it came to her daughter?

406
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,510
Who could've known?

407
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,470
Prince Yan encountered such poison

408
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,920
when he was in Nanwu.

409
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,400
He gave Jiang Si

410
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,120
the antidote.

411
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,230
Jiang Si will regain consciousness soon.

412
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,470
Could it be that the poison
could be neutralized?

413
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,470
What did you say?

414
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,360
Nothing.

415
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,790
Prince Yan also said

416
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,990
that Jiang Si

417
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,440
was very lucky.

418
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,840
If the dosage of the poison

419
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,440
was just a little higher,

420
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,960
she would've been dead.

421
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,840
That's why

422
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,440
I had him bring you here.

423
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,400
You have to come up
with a solution for me.

424
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,990
If news of this gets out,

425
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,310
I'll be done for.

426
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,230
Why are you panicking?

427
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,790
If so,

428
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,270
we can increase
the dosage of the poison.

429
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,550
Nanny Xu, we meet again.

430
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,990
Your Highness?

431
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,160
You're alive?

432
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,510
Nanny Xu,

433
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,510
I'm afraid things
won't proceed as you wish.

434
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:56,990
You!

435
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,640
You!

436
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,440
How dare you betray me?

437
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,600
This is Eternal Slumber,

438
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,070
a plant unique to Nanwu.

439
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,470
It releases poison
when in contact with water.

440
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,200
It can cause vomiting and drowsiness,

441
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,360
leading to exhaustion and death.

442
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
This is called Eternal Slumber.

443
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
It's unique to Nanwu.

444
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,510
Seems like Princess Royal

445
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,960
was colluding with Nanwu long ago.

446
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,070
But Nanny Xu

447
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,600
has served her for many years.

448
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,790
She's deeply influenced by her.

449
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,840
I'm sure it's difficult

450
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
to make her talk.

451
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,990
Don't worry. I have an idea.

452
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,400
Long Dan!

453
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,790
How cruel.

454
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,750
You're resourceful indeed.

455
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,160
What?

456
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,640
I said you were resourceful.

457
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,840
Sauce full?

458
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,790
I said, you were resourceful!

459
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:17,920
Useless fool!

460
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,710
Your Highness, please pardon me!

461
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,030
Mother, are you okay?

462
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,880
I'm fine.

463
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,270
What's with Nanny Xu?

464
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,470
She sleeps all the time.

465
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,880
It's one thing for you
to indulge her on ordinary days.

466
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,270
She knew
that the old ailment on your arm

467
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,640
would act up during rainy days.

468
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,920
She forgot

469
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,960
that only her massage

470
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,230
could provide relief to your pain.

471
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,750
She's getting ahead of herself here.

472
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
Enough already.

473
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,470
You're making my head hurt.

474
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,600
Her niece-in-law
is the one giving birth.

475
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,920
Why is she over there?

476
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,270
Shijiu!

477
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,640
Yes, Your Highness.

478
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,790
Bring Nanny Xu back.

479
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,360
Why are you still standing there?

480
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,550
Go now.

481
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,400
Yes, Your Highness.

482
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,310
How was it?

483
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,600
Do you want to confess now?

484
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,550
I wanted to confess long ago.

485
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,510
But you stuffed my mouth.

486
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,120
How could I speak?

487
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,030
Princess Royal first used this flower

488
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,310
to poison my mother to death.

489
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,270
Now, she attempted to poison me as well.

490
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,640
Let me ask you this.

491
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,680
What feud does the Princess Royal have

492
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,840
toward my family?

493
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,750
The one who offended Her Highness

494
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,400
was your mother, Su Ke.

495
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,030
Your Highness, Nanny Xu is in trouble.

496
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,510
What?

497
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,880
Who told her

498
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,920
to be so alluring?

499
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,840
Not only did your father
annul his marriage for her,

500
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,270
but the Prince Consort, Mr. Cui,

501
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,030
also resisted the imperial decree
and rejected his marriage

502
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,880
because of her.

503
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,160
To Her Highness,

504
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,920
that was utter humiliation!

505
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,640
My mother and Mr. Cui?

506
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,680
I thought you two

507
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,310
were the children of Miss Su

508
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,550
and Mr. Cui.

509
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,200
Miss Fei, by Mr. Cui,

510
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,510
do you mean Cui Mingyue's father?

511
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,230
My parents

512
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,160
were devoted to each other.

513
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,030
Since she has chosen

514
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:30,880
to get married to Father,

515
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,440
why would she get involved

516
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,360
with Mr. Cui?

517
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,400
Your father was devoted to her.

518
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:41,120
He gave up on his future because of her.

519
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,710
For her sake,

520
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,270
Mr. Cui grew distant from Her Highness,

521
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,960
and they eventually
became a resentful couple.

522
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,710
But Su Ke?

523
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,960
She stole someone's beloved,
and she was fickle and unfaithful.

524
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,200
She toyed with men...

525
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,640
Shut up!

526
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,400
You're not allowed to insult my mother!

527
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:01,880
Nanny Xu.

528
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,270
Tell us

529
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:03,960
how the plant

530
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,990
ended up in Princess Royal's hands.

531
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,360
Cure her itch.

532
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,400
Is it itchy?

533
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,990
I'll confess!

534
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,550
The woman from Nanwu

535
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,750
tricked Her Highness!

536
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,440
Your Highness, this item

537
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,920
will resolve your issues.

538
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,960
I've heard that Nanwu
is highly skilled in poisoning arts.

539
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,750
I once read from the books

540
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,270
that a woman from Nanwu

541
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,510
planted a love curse on her husband.

542
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,200
After that, her husband
only had eyes for her.

543
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,790
Is this the legendary item?

544
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,030
That was

545
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,360
just a myth.

546
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,840
If Nanwu had a way

547
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,160
to control one's heart and mind,

548
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,550
our realm

549
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,790
would've been different by now.

550
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,120
What is this, then?

551
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,400
It's something
that can help you get rid of

552
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,230
the person you hate.

553
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,230
What a joke.

554
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,920
I'm the Princess Royal of Zhou.

555
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,160
I merely need to lift my finger
for someone to vanish.

556
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,120
Of course.

557
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,920
Your Highness,
you hold a prestigious position.

558
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,710
You don't need to dirty your hands

559
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,710
just to get rid of someone.

560
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,120
I'm willing to be your sword.

561
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,360
This item

562
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,710
can make someone die without a trace.

563
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,200
No one

564
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,750
will be able to figure it out.

565
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,440
Xiao Shi and Su Ke
never got along with each other.

566
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,230
We found out that Xiao Shi

567
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,230
was trying to drug Su Ke.

568
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,680
[Renxin Jishi Hall]
That's why we bribed

569
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,310
the traveling physician

570
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,230
and swapped out the medicine
for Eternal Slumber.

571
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,990
We murdered Su Ke through Xiao Shi.

572
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,160
Su Ke was dead.

573
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,750
But Her Highness

574
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,510
didn't get what she wished for.

575
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,710
Mr. Cui grew even more distant from her.

576
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,750
But the woman from Nanwu

577
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,230
gained more and more

578
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,070
of Her Highness's trust.

579
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,960
Where is she right now?

580
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,840
She's very mysterious.

581
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,790
She always shows up with a veil.

582
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,310
How would I know where she is?

583
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,600
Nanny Xu,

584
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,120
you know
that this plant is considered evidence.

585
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,070
If we do investigate the case,

586
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,230
the Princess Royal

587
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,990
can completely absolve herself
of any responsibilities.

588
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,920
But not you.

589
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,030
You don't want to rat out your lady.

590
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,470
That's why you made up a story

591
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,920
about a woman from Nanwu

592
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,640
so that we couldn't
investigate the case.

593
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,070
Long Dan, continue.

594
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,230
No!

595
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,470
Don't do it!

596
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,920
I'll try to recall it!

597
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,310
All right. Please go ahead.

598
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,750
I remember now.

599
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,440
After that, the woman from Nanwu

600
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,360
made Her Highness
help her enter the palace.

601
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,030
I remember it was Changning Palace.

602
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,030
Changning Palace?

603
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,200
It's the palace
where the empress resides.

604
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,790
If Her Highness

605
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,550
found out that I've told you

606
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,310
about all of these,

607
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,160
I'm afraid

608
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,640
all three of us

609
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,510
will be in danger.

610
00:28:58,990 --> 00:28:59,960
I have an idea.

611
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,160
Just treat it as if
you have never seen me before.

612
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,030
I was never here.

613
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,440
The encounter never happened,

614
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:04,840
am I right?

615
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,550
That's right.

616
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,710
What a joke.

617
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,840
Do you think I'll let my mother

618
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,790
die in vain?

619
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,600
Don't tell me

620
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,510
you wish to deal with Her Highness?

621
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,480
An imperial family member
who breaks the law

622
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,270
will be punished just like a commoner!

623
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,960
Such naivety.

624
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,640
Her Highness

625
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,600
is His Majesty's dearest sister.

626
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,030
She's second to none
other than His Majesty himself.

627
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,200
Forget about your mother.

628
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
The victims of the arson case
at the Jinshui River

629
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,030
were members of the imperial family.

630
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,310
Even so, His Majesty

631
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,990
merely stripped
Princess Mingyue of her title.

632
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,510
Do you think

633
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,070
he'll punish his own sister

634
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,710
for the daughter of a merchant?

635
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,360
Colluding with Nanwu is treason!

636
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,550
His dearest sister?

637
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,440
Do you think
His Majesty will bend the law?

638
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,880
It's Her Highness we're talking about...

639
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,990
This is bad! Prince Yan! My Lady!

640
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,400
A lot of people showed up out there!

641
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,920
Your Highness,
you intruded upon my residence.

642
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,840
What is your motive?

643
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,310
Prince Yan, why are you
playing the victim here?

644
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,750
You abducted Nanny Xu,
who is my servant.

645
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,440
How dare you ask me what my motive is?

646
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,470
Shijiu, why are you
still standing there?

647
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,230
Search the place.

648
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,840
Your Highness!

649
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,550
Your Highness! Please save me!

650
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,710
They lured me here!

651
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,200
I didn't say anything!

652
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,230
I don't know anything!

653
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,120
- Shut up!
- I don't know...

654
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,680
Let's go.

655
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,550
Do not hurt Her Highness!

656
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,070
Jiang Si, what are you up to?

657
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,960
Do you intend to kill me?

658
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,960
Come on, then. Kill me!

659
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,230
Do it!

660
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,360
Jiang Si
from the Count of Dongping's Mansion

661
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,270
deceived others
and tried to harm the Princess Royal.

662
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,120
Take her down!

663
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,880
Yu Jin, you arranged for this.

664
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,960
It's been your plan, huh?

665
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,030
Do you intend to rebel?

666
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,600
Don't you believe

667
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,270
that I'll kill all of you right now?

668
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,640
His Majesty's decree has arrived.

669
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,840
Rong Yang.

670
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,400
What are you doing here?

671
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,550
You're quite well-informed, aren't you?

672
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,710
You rushed all the way here

673
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,550
just to save her daughter.

674
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,070
Prince Yan, accept the decree.

675
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,840
As per His Majesty's decree,

676
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,160
Prince Yan, Yu Jin,

677
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,920
is to enter the palace
and see His Majesty immediately.

678
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

679
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,790
Mr. Cui, I'm afraid you have to

680
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,920
report to His Majesty

681
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,920
that Her Highness doesn't intend

682
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,070
to let me see him.

683
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,270
Why would Her Highness put her nephew

684
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,470
on the spot?

685
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,990
Let's go.

686
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,600
Not Nanny Xu.

687
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,840
I've already dropped my charges.

688
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,990
You're getting ahead of yourself.

689
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,510
Nanny Xu already confessed

690
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,840
that she poisoned my mother to death.

691
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,710
If you leave with Her Highness now,

692
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,400
she'll only silence you.

693
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,270
Wait.

694
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,880
What poison?

695
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,840
Who harmed your mother?

696
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,070
Didn't Su Ke pass away
due to an illness?

697
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,070
Her Highness
was jealous of her back then.

698
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,160
She instructed Nanny Xu
to poison my mother to death

699
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,510
using a mysterious poison.

700
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
Is she telling the truth?

701
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,070
Is she?

702
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:34,920
Answer me!

703
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,640
Nanny Xu, tell us the truth.

704
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,440
Both Prince Yan and Mr. Cui are here.

705
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,120
The Princess Royal can't

706
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,640
just do whatever she wants in Zhou.

707
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:44,070
Your Highness, I deserve to die!

708
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,640
I don't know

709
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,750
what they had fed me.

710
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,840
I lost my senses momentarily.

711
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,680
Mr. Cui,

712
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,550
you mustn't trust them!

713
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,750
If so,

714
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,990
it'll make you grow distant

715
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,400
from Her Highness!

716
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,120
You're devious and cunning indeed.

717
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,680
You heard what Nanny Xu said.

718
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,990
Do you trust my maid?

719
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,120
Or do you trust her daughter?

720
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,270
Let's go.

721
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,550
Miss Jiang,

722
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,750
how exactly did

723
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,200
your mother die?

724
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,070
Mr. Cui!

725
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,070
Mr. Cui!

726
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,160
Mr. Cui! No!

727
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,160
Stop!

728
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,880
It's been so long

729
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,760
since we sat down
and had a proper meal together.

730
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:26,360
Mr. Cui, you were busy
with military affairs.

731
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,320
You had to travel to various camps.

732
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,550
You were too busy to visit me

733
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,760
and have a meal with me.

734
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,670
Rong Yang,

735
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,719
why do you have to speak

736
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,989
with a sarcastic tone?

737
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,880
I'm the Princess Royal of Zhou.

738
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,760
All men in the world

739
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,880
except for my brother have to kneel

740
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,320
when they speak to me.

741
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,070
Remember this.

742
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,590
It's impossible for me

743
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,550
to act
like that lowly merchant's daughter.

744
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,990
I would never

745
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,920
try to please you with my words.

746
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,070
It's been years

747
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,670
since Su Ke's passing.

748
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,470
Even so, you still
insult her and call her

749
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,280
a lowly wretch.

750
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,280
Listen up.

751
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,440
In my heart,

752
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,240
she was

753
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,510
the best

754
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,470
and noblest woman in the world.

755
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,030
That's why I killed her.

756
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,590
This way, she'll never grow old

757
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,800
or change.

758
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,840
She can live in your heart forever

759
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,190
as the noblest and prettiest lady
in the world.

760
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,630
You loved Su Ke,

761
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,400
yet she died because of you.

762
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,880
If you wish to seek revenge,

763
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,070
you shouldn't just seek me out.

764
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,320
In the end,

765
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,920
it's all your fault.

766
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,150
Enough!

767
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,880
I was already married to you!

768
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,510
Why couldn't you let her off?

769
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,400
Why?

770
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,760
She was the one
who didn't give up on you!

771
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,110
She was already married.

772
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,070
Why did she meet up with you in private

773
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,400
at Qingyin Temple?

774
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,360
Your Highness,

775
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,400
Mr. Cui left the city
on horseback this morning.

776
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,470
He was headed toward Qingyin Temple.

777
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,670
He doesn't believe in deities or Buddha.

778
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,920
What is he doing there?

779
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,720
Our men who were keeping an eye
on the Count of Dongping's Mansion

780
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,590
had a message for us.

781
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,320
They said Su Ke went there

782
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,670
in a carriage.

783
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,590
What?

784
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,510
Your Highness,

785
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,150
should we head inside?

786
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,240
Let's return to the palace.

787
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,840
How many times have I told you?

788
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,110
That day, I visited Qingyin Temple

789
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,630
alone!

790
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,280
There was nothing between Su Ke and I!

791
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,240
We never met again
after getting married!

792
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,400
I don't believe you!

793
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,960
She didn't sever her ties with you.

794
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,280
You two deserve it!

795
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,240
Rong Yang!

796
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,720
You never believed me.

797
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,960
Never!

798
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,920
I went to Qingyin Temple that day

799
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,630
to put an end to my past.

800
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,840
Do you truly...

801
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,030
Do you truly think

802
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,320
that Su Ke was the reason

803
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:26,760
our marriage

804
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,720
ended up like this?

805
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,360
Isn't that so?

806
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,400
You think so, huh?

807
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,240
Never mind.

808
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:51,960
Forget it.

809
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:55,630
Come on.

810
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,190
Sit down. Let's have a drink.

811
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:03,960
Take a seat!

812
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,550
Once we finish the drink,

813
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,280
we should let

814
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,630
bygones be bygones.

815
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,150
Do you intend to divorce me?

816
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,320
Do you know how old we are now?

817
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,280
What's the point

818
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,280
of getting a divorce?

819
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:54,990
Once we finish this drink,

820
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,990
our ties as husband and wife shall end.

821
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,990
From now on,
we shall go our separate ways.

822
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,960
Rong Yang,

823
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,720
cease this torment upon me.

824
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:16,190
And spare yourself the suffering too.

825
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,880
I told you before.

826
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,440
I, Rong Yang,

827
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,990
will never lower myself

828
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,360
to seek a man's favor.

829
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,030
All these years,

830
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,630
you could come and go as you wish.

831
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,510
Since when have I stopped you?

832
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,320
Since that's the case,

833
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,510
once we finish this drink,

834
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,280
our ties shall be severed.

835
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,470
Don't drink it!

836
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,960
Father, Mother.

837
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,470
Were you trying to kill me?

838
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,470
So you tried to kill me.

839
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,070
You intend to take your life as well.

840
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,510
You were going to take both of our lives

841
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,590
to make up for that wretch's death, huh?

842
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:50,990
Mingyue,

843
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,110
from today onward,

844
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,280
you have no father.

845
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,880
Mother, Father was...

846
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,510
Shut up!

847
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,720
If you want to call him Father,

848
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,320
do not call me Mother again.

849
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,360
But Mother...

850
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:15,840
Father!

851
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:17,880
Someone!

852
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,030
Your Highness.

853
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,150
From today onward,

854
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,470
Cui Xu

855
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,150
is not allowed to step foot
into this mansion.

856
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,510
Mr. Cui, please.
