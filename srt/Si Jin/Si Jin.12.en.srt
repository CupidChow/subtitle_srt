114
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,100
I'm going deaf soon.

115
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,220

117
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,260
Stop hitting it.

118
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:12,900
You can do this!

119
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,540
Come on!

120
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,140
I can't do it.

121
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,300
I'm finished.

122

Mr. Zhan.

123
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,660
Master Qin told Miss Si

124
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,780
before leaving.

125
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,940
I was told to supervise you.

126
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,140
I can't do it anymore.

127
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,020
I could get crippled.

128
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,740
Who do we have here?

129
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,659
What happened

130
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,260
over the past few days while I was away?

131
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,659
Why are you here?

132
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,620
To make fun of me?

133
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,940
Jiang Zhan, don't be disheartened.

134
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,620

135

to teach you a few self-defense moves

136

to make up for the lessons

137

This is insane.

138
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,580
My sister must have gone insane!

139

140
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,140
Do me a favor.

141
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,780
Knock me out now.

142
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,220

143
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,100
Enough whining. Do as I say.

We start practicing now.

145
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:08,980

146
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,020
I've had enough of this!

147
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,020
Fine!

148
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,860
I'll do whatever you say!

149
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,940
Today,

150
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,900
we'll practice this.

151
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,100
What is going on now?

152
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:28,820

153
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,740
you've used up

154
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,860
a lot of energy lately.

155
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,659
We martial artists

156

are mindful of limits.

157
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,300
Do not get hasty

158
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,940
unless you want to get weaker.

159
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,140
My way of training starts

160
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,380
with replenishing strength.

161
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,060
Miss Lu, I can't believe a girl

162
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,500
as brilliant and kind as you

163
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,100
still exist!

164
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,659
Enough chitchat.

165
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:50,820
Eat up.

166
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,620
It's always nicer outside.

167
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,780
Being grounded

168
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,180
almost killed me with boredom.

169
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,380
Cursed Jiang Si.

170
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,140
I'll exact vengeance.

171
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:03,740
Ji!

172
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,700
Bring some liquor!

173
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,420
Yes!

174
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,900
Who is that?

175
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,460
Madam Xiao,

176
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,740
I heard that is Miss Si's friend.

177
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,900
The name is Lu Chuchu.

178
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,820
Lu Chuchu?

179
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,900
She is a girl?

180
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,580
Why would a girl

181
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,620
dress up like that?

182
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,740
She is clearly

183
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,980
not from a proper family.

184
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,060
She is a vagabond for sure.

185
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,179
Jiang Si.

186
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,860
While I was grounded,

187
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,059
she planted another spy

188
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,620
in the Jiang family.

189
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,100
It seems she is eager to replace me

190
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,220
as the family head.

191
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,900
Mother.

192
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,300
Though you've been released,

193
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,620
from now on,

194
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,940
be mindful of your actions.

195
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,940
Do not make the same mistake again.

196
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,540
Indeed.

197
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,380
I'll keep that in mind.

198
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,460
Allow me.

199
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,180
Mother.

200
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,420
While I was sick,

201
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,860
you've done so much for our family.

202
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,580
I'm glad you appreciate it.

203
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,900
While I was grounded,

204
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,500
I reflected on a lot of things.

205
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,340
I made some mistakes
with my way of educating the children.

206
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,980
Unlike Miss Si, she has done a great job

207
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,420
managing the family affairs.

208
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,700
Even Zhan has become more diligent.

209
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,180
I heard he has been

210
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,540
practicing martial arts.

211
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,820
They are fooling around.

212
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,740
However, I noticed

213
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,380
there was another girl

214
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,020
in the house.

215
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,100
It even looks like she and Zhan

216
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,340
are sharing an unusual relationship.

217
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,340
Who is the girl?

218
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,020
Nanny Li,

219
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,300
who is that girl?

220
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,540
Old Madam,

221
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,180
she is Miss Si's friend,

222
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,500
named Lu Chuchu.

223
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,820
We don't know much about her.

224
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,260
Ling'an has been crawling

225
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,860
with refugees lately.

226
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,780
Perhaps Lu Chuchu is one of them.

227
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,820
A refugee?

228
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,700
It doesn't matter who she is

229
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,860
as long as she has a good heart

230
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,020
and Zhan likes her.

231
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,860
Indeed.

232
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,140
You are totally right.

233
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,220
On my way here,

234
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,380
we actually

235
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,100
saw Miss Chuchu.

236
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,460
She does bear a hint of heroic poise.

237
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,780
But she is a Han girl,

238
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,860
why would she wear

239
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,980
Hu clothes?

240
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,620
Madam Xiao,

241
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,820
just days ago, I saw her feeding

242
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,180
Mr. Zhan

243
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,380
in the garden.

244
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,380
They were so intimate.

245
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,740
She was like a vixen.

246
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,380
Enough, stop talking.

247
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,260
What is that nonsense about?

248
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,900
Mother, calm down.

249
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,100
Relax.

250
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,780
If Nanny Li is right,

251
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,020
the girl clearly has ulterior motives.

252
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,100
Zhan's marriage will be
the least of our concerns.

253
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,100
The reputation of our family

254
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,740
is at stake.

255
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,340
Enough.

256
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,900
I've heard enough.

257
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,420
A nameless girl of unknown background

258
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,900
can't be married into our family!

259
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:19,940
Yes.

260
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,700
Greetings, Grandmother.

261
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,260
Did you send for me?

262
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,260
Zhan.

263
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,620
What is your relationship

264
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,660
with Miss Lu Chuchu?

265
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,100
She is Commandant Yu's friend

266
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,980
and also a friend of Si.

267
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,180
How does Miss Chuchu

268
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,260
also know Commandant Yu?

269
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,140
I think

270
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,420
they were childhood friends.

271
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,420
Grandmother,

272
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,900
why the sudden interest in her?

273
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,900
My point is

274
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,660
that if you truly like Miss Chuchu,

275
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,900
you should've told me.

276
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,220
But I want you to understand one thing.

277
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,780
How much do you

278
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,220
actually know about her?

279
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,060
You know the rules

280
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,940
of our family.

281
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,460
A girl with no background

282
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,260
and possibly ill intent

283
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,260
can never be

284
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,300
a member of the Jiang family.

285
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,900
Grandmother.

286
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,900
I think you are mistaken.

287
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,140
First of all,

288
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,500
Miss Chuchu and I

289
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,820
are only friends.

290
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,500
There's no romance involved.

291
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,900
Secondly, she is

292
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,620
the daughter
of the Pacification General.

293
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,380
She is not nameless.

294
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,710
What?

295
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,780
Pacification General

296
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,340
is her father?

297
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,100
Yeah.

298
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,420
He was a legendary general,

299
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,940
feared across the land,

300
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,900
with countless victories

301
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,300
and unparalleled feats!

302
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,020
Are you

303
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,100
telling me the truth?

304
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,060
Of course.

305
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,340
Besides,

306
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,060
Miss Chuchu has spent

307
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,380
all her wealth on the welfare

308
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,580
and aid

309
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,660
the refugees need.

310
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,020
How could you call that ill intent?

311
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,740
She would sacrifice her wealth
for the refugees?

312
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,100
She truly has a heart of gold.

313
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,060
Of course.

314
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,900
Don't believe the false rumors.

315
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,060
Let me get you some water.

316
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,380
That's a relief, Old Madam.

317
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,060
Mother!

318
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,780
Mother, Lu Chuchu

319
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,300
is a bad person.

320
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,140
You told me to keep her away

321
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,340
from Zhan,

322
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,460
but she was brash

323
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,260
and gave me a difficult time.

324
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,980
Aunt Xiao.

325
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,900
Zhan?

326
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,580
Who are you talking about?

327
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:29,900
Chief,

328
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,620
I think I get it now.

329
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,540
You've fallen for Miss Jiang.

330
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,500
But what I don't get

331
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,780
is why aren't you

332
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,940
making any moves?

333
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,860
Mr. Zhen, a scholar,

334
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,660
would scale mountains

335
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,540
to find her an orchid.

336
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,860
If it were me,

337
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,500
I'd be so moved that I'd marry him.

338
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,780
If he can get one,

339
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,780
I can get a hundred!

340
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,820
If he can learn

341
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,700
martial arts,

342
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,780
I can write a treatise!

343
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,220
An orchid is graceful,

344
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,060
but a hundred of them is madness.

345
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,340
What is love?

346
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,940
It's beautiful but unattainable.

347
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,180
It's a symphony of feelings

348
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,660
in a simple expression.

349
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:17,940
Your

350
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,340
crude approach

351
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,780
will only destroy

352
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,700
love's subtlety.

353
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,180
So, what do I do now?

354
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,300
People sent love letters with geese.

355
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,220
Today,

356
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,500
we'll do the same, but with peonies.

357
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,820
The Chief says

358
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,180
a brute like him

359
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,660
can't manage the flowers well.

360
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,900
The peony plant

361
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,340
is losing leaves.

362
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,540
Perhaps it's an issue

363
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,300
with the soil.

364
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,660
He asked me

365
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,140
to bring it to Miss Si to...

366
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,060
You can't even grow a peony plant?

367
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,380
Please, stay away from the plants.

368
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,100
Wait.

369
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,060
Hear me out!

370
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,100
Why are you mad at me?

371
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,340
Should I use

372
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,420
a more direct approach?

373
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:00,860
Never mind.

374
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,820
Miss Si will find out

375
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,540
when she loosens the soil.

376
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,420
I wanted

377
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,660
to explain everything

378
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,980
to Mr. Zhen and Madam Zhen

379
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,060
the other day.

380
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,180
But, I didn't know

381
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,420
how to turn them down.

382
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,580
I didn't get to

383
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,460
tell them my thoughts.

384
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,340
I think it's best not to tell them.

385
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,580
I think

386
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,140
Mr. Zhen is a great man.

387
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,220
He doesn't talk much,

while collecting the orchid for you.

391
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,180
He's nothing like Mr. Yu
who returned the peony plant

392
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,700
you sent him.

393
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,860
Yes, Mr. Yu took an arrow for you

394
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,220

he simply doesn't excite me.

406
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,220
than mere admiration for him.

Have some tea.

580
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,250
Miss Si, you've been working all night.

581
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,610
The commotion earlier

582
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,570
cost us six months' worth

583
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,330
of profit.

584
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,330
After we finally got
a little money to spare?

585
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,330
Miss Si, you've contributed

586
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,610
no small amount to this family.

587
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,570
What do we do now?

588
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:44,810
We'll sell off

589
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,330
every valuable item in this house.

590
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,370
But even that isn't enough.

591
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:48,770
Miss Si,

592
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,570
we could go to Qiaoniang

593
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,650
for a loan.

594
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:52,370
No.

595
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,770
The Duke's family and I have a grudge.

596
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:55,930
If people found out

597
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,970
she helped me again,

598
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:57,970
she'd have a hard time

599
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:58,810
in the family.

600
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:01,930
We'll figure something out.

601
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,890
Erniu!

602
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,210
Miss Si?

603
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:17,570
What are these?

604
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:18,690
Silver notes!

605
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,130
It's 1000 liang!

606
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,090
Erniu,

607
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,610
we should start calling you

608
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,490
Caishen!

609
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,290
But

610
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,130
where did it

611
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:26,970
get so much money?

612
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:27,850
Isn't it obvious?

613
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:28,850
It's Mr. Yu.

614
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,010
It's from Mr. Yu?

615
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,610
Miss,

616
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,370
could this be a fake?

617
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,610
Where did Mr. Yu

618
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,770
get so much money?

619
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,770
Is it fake?

620
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:37,690
He doesn't strike me

621
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,010
as the well-off type.

622
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:40,610
Yeah.

623
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,890
He lives in a small house.

624
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,170
There are barely

625
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,650
any luxuries in his daily life.

626
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:45,490
Miss Si,

627
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,050
perhaps I was wrong

628
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,890
about him.

629
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,450
Mr. Yu's affection for you

630
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,730
is unyielding.

631
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:51,890
You said the opposite

632
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,210
just a few days ago.

633
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,970
Action speaks louder than words

634
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,170
in a time like this.

635
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,210
Miss Si,

636
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,410
poor Mr. Yu must have

637
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,250
used up

638
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,330
every wits he had

639
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,890
to get this amount of money

640
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,290
just to give it all to you!

641
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,890
How is this not true love?

642
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:07,490
Aman,

643
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,130
did he get it from a loan shark?

644
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,090
The interest alone

645
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,090
can crush him!

646
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,050
Erniu!

647
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:44,650
Mr. Yu?

648
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,010
Came for a walk?

649
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,010
I was sending Erniu home.

650
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,250
I can tell.

651
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:57,770
Mr. Yu.

652
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,370
I can't accept the money.

653
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,450
But your shop was wrecked.

654
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,850
You're in need of the money.

655
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,050
I am,

656
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,610
but I can't just take it.

657
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:08,690
Besides,

658
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,450
is this really your money?

659
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,290
Of course it's mine.

660
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,650
But your salary

661
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:15,610
isn't that high.

662
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,850
Long Dan receives the payments for me.

663
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,690
Don't you know how much

664
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,490
you make every month?

665
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,130
No idea.

666
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,210
Is this money not enough?

667
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:23,890
I can get more.

668
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,650
Wait. No.

669
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,370
It's enough.

670
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,610
I never thought

671
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,010
you were this wealthy.

672
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,970
Money is only a worldly possession.

673
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,530
Only the truly rich people

674
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,770
can utter those words.

675
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,770
I'm not that well off.

676
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,090
Anyway, I can't take the money.

677
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:42,890
Take it back.

678
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,410
I have no use for the money.

679
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,290
You're in urgent need of it.

680
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,810
So, go ahead and take it.

681
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,730
Don't be a stranger.

682
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,290
But I...

683
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,650
Miss Si, are you done?

684
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,130
Someone is coming.

685
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,490
Yes, I got it.

686
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,490
I will

687
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,570
take care of it myself.

688
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,890
I must return the silver notes.

689
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,410
But...

690
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,210
You have my thanks.

691
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:04,650
Wait. Hold on!

692
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:05,730
I have an idea.

693
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,170
I'll become a shareholder.

694
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,850
You can pay me a dividend
at the end of the year.

695
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,210
As you said,

696
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,450
money is meaningful
when you let the wealth grow.

697
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,850
Some mice might chew up

698
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,130
the silver notes

699
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,690
if I leave them in a closet.

700
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,410
Very well.

701
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,810
I'll only take 500 liang.

702
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,130
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

703
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,130
Do not look back.

704
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,170
You must not look back.

705
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:10,690
Useless fools!

706
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,010
Since Jiang Si came forth,

707
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,290
you should've

708
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,610
exposed her as the shop owner!

709
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,050
But you let her

710
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,770
see through your ploy!

711
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,370
I was careless.

712
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,130
I didn't recognize Jiang Si

713
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:23,930
right away.

714
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,010
Fool!

715
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,330
Cousin,

716
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,690
is this the woman

717
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,050
you brought to appease me?

718
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,770
She was from the Linglong Troupe.

719
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,850
I thought she was smart enough

720
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:35,850
to talk her way through it.

721
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,490
But she turned out to be worthless.

722
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,090
Get out of my sight now!

723
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,890
Your presence is bothering Her Highness!

724
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:42,530
Yes.

725
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,530
Wait.

726
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,330
Did I say you could go?

727
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,330
Since she's not good with her speech...

728
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,090
perhaps there is no need

729
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,770
for her

730
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,490
to keep her voice.

731
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:57,730
Take her outside

732
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,610
and cripple her voice.

733
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:01,450
Someone.

734
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,610
Your Highness! Have mercy on me!

735
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:03,970
Your Highness!

736
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,130
Sir!

737
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,850
Please save me!

738
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:09,210
I beg of you!

739
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,450
Do you feel bad about her?

740
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:13,130
Not at all.

741
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,890
She is just a mere player.

742
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,170
I'm glad to hear that.

743
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,890
We can't

744
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,890
have her blabbing

745
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:26,570
or going silent at the wrong moment.

746
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,970
Your Highness, I assure you

747
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:29,890
I will not

748
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,530
let even a word

749
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,690
get to Uncle.

750
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,530
You are my dear cousin.

751
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,330
Of course I trust you.

752
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,570
However,

753
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,650
the people you hired

754
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,890
were all good-for-nothing.

755
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,210
A foolish player

756
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,010
and a worthless scholar.

757
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,610
Ji Chongyi,

758
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,210
you are the son of the Duke Of Anguo.

759
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,610
Even when he is powerless,

760
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,890
he still holds a title.

761
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,490
Your reprimand is well-deserved.

762
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,370
I am deeply impressed

763
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,130
by your swift approach.

764
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:07,970
But I know Jiang Si.

765
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,610
She is both calculating

766
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,010
and shameless.

767
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,290
She divorced me with the help

768
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,210
of the Capital Administration Office.

769
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:15,970
I'm afraid

770
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,690
Zhen Heng and Yu Qi

771
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,730
are both charmed by her.

772
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:20,850
These two

773
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,570
are infamously hard to deal with.

774
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,890
If we openly

775
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,170
go against her,

776
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,570
it is unwise at best.

777
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,370
It's those two again.

778
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,730
Am I no match

779
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,210
for the Capital Administration Office?

780
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,850
That's not true.

781
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,330
But we are in Ling'an.

782
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,850
His Majesty is here.

783
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,650
If the matter escalates,

784
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,890
and the General and Princess Royal
get wind of this,

785
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,730
Your Highness will lose
more than you can gain.

786
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,850
It's hard to take down Jiang Si,

787
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,530
but her brother, Jiang Zhan,

788
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,090
is a slacker

789
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,210
with basically no intelligence.

790
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,530
She cares about her brother

791
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,490
more than anything.

792
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,690
If we go after him instead,

793
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,210
it will be much easier.

794
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,690
Bad news!

795
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,050
Something's up!

796
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,130
Bad news! Miss Si!

797
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,770
Mr. Zhan went missing again!

798
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:15,850
Miss Si!

799
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,450
Your Grace!

800
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,330
Well?

801
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,850
No sign of Mr. Zhan in the mansion.

802
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,010
Check the eastern courtyard.

803
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:26,450
Yes.

804
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,330
Your Grace!

805
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,410
We searched the places

806
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,610
where he went fishing. No sign of him.

807
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,770
And the tea house?

808
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,050
Search the tea house.

809
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:32,450
- Yes.
- Yes.

810
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:34,930
Si.

811
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,250
Would you calm down for a moment?

812
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,690
He used to run off

813
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,650
from time to time.

814
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:41,770
Don't worry.

815
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,050
He'll be back when he's tired.

816
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,810
Father, it's different this time.

817
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,210
He will be in danger!

818
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,210
He's a grown man.

819
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,330
What danger could there be?

820
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,850
Things are just different this time.

821
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,730
You're the one
who is different these days.

822
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,410
You've locked him up for days,

823
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,490
made him practice

824
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,690
martial arts,

825
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,970
and made him study.

826
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,450
I'm surprised

827
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,290
it took him this long

828
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,930
to escape.

829
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,290
Miss Si, Your Grace.

830
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:06,690
Master Qin, how is it?

831
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,370
Any lead?

832
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,170
We searched the mansion. He's not here.

833
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,410
We also checked

834
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,050
the tavern, parlors, and cuju fields

835
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,090
he frequented.

836
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:13,930
No sign of him.

837
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,050
The riverside.

838
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,370
Search there now!

839
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,010
Mr. Yu!

840
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,050
Mr. Zhen!

841
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,530
[Main Hall
of the Capital Administration Office]

842
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,650
Miss Si sent me to inform you

843
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,890
that Mr. Zhan has gone missing.

844
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,250
Please send a search party

845
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,450
to find him.

846
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:30,970
How long has Mr. Zhan

847
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:31,930
been missing?

848
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,890
Half a day since this morning.

849
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,410
He is an adult.

850
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,570
It's not a missing person

851
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,570
if it's only half a day.

852
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,930
It's impossible for us

853
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:39,890
to build a case.

854
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,090
But Miss Si says

855
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:41,610
his life

856
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,010
will be in grave danger.

857
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,050
Long Dan, let's go.

858
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:44,610
Yes.

859
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,170
Hold up.

860
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,530
This is against protocols.

861
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,690
If everyone filed a report

862
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,050
because someone hadn't been seen

863
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:50,890
for half a day,

864
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,330
it'd be complete chaos in here.

865
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,290
Well said. Time to start searching.

866
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,570
Anything over here?

867
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:05,490
No.

868
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,370
Anything over there?

869
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,090
No.

870
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,090
Did you find anything?

871
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,170
No.

872
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,610
Master Qin, anything?

873
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:11,850
No.

874
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:16,690
This way.

875
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,490
Sir, come inside.

876
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,610
This is

877
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,650
the best suite here.

878
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,890
I'm confident that this suite

879
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:25,610
has the best view

880
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,810
in the entire Ling'an.

881
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,570
Should I send a girl

882
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,690
to sing or play a song for you?

883
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,050
Perhaps a bit of liquor for extra mood?

884
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,370
Tell the musicians

885
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,290
and singers

886
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,530
to leave me be.

887
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,570
Sure.

888
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:47,410
Thank you.

889
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,130
Take some good rest.

890
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:52,130
Certainly.

891
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:00,970
More!

892
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:05,370
Again!

893
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,290
Again!

894
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,650
Incredible!

895
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:23,770
Toss him!

896
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,290
What are you doing?

897
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:27,610
Toss him around!

898
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,050
Toss him!

899
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,450
Smooth move!

900
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:36,930
Toss him!

901
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:39,690
Toss him!

902
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,010
Zhan!

903
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:42,650
Si!

904
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,810
Why are you here?

905
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:44,730
Master Qin...

906
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,530
We searched the city for you!

907
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,010
I...

908
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,530
I was watching
the Imperial Insignia Guards train.

909
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,890
You must come home now!

910
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,970
Zhan, please don't wander off.

911
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:53,730
Yes. But I...

912
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,050
Yu!

913
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,090
Yu! You're here too!

914
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,370
Help me.

915
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,490
Si has lost her mind.

916
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,810
She won't let me go outside.

917
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:03,610
Mr. Yu.

918
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,290
Thank you for the help.

919
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,490
Let me walk you home.

920
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:08,530
Never mind.

921
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:10,449
I'll send my brother home.

922
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,290
Farewell.

923
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,810
Come with me now! Let's go!

924
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:16,090
Mr. Yu, drop by for dinner sometimes.

925
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,650
Mr. Yu, we'll take our leave now.

926
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,889
We must thank Mr. Yu

927
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:31,449
for helping us with the search.

928
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:32,530
I brought

929
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,250
the snacks

930
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,290
Miss Si made for you.

931
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:36,730
I knew it was too delicious.

932
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,489
No one is an outsider here.

933
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:40,130
There's no need to thank me.

934
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,610
However,

935
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,250
Miss Jiang was indeed

936
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,489
overreacting

937
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:46,610
a little bit.

938
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:48,770
I hope you don't mind me asking.

939
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,489
Did something happen in the family?

940
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,489
Or perhaps there was
something unusual with Jiang?

941
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,810
Nothing unusual.

942
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,250
However, something was weird.

943
00:34:59,330 --> 00:34:59,930
What is it?

944
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,610
According to Mr. Zhan,

945
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,170
Miss Si didn't pay him any attention.

946
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:05,810
But lately, she's been

947
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,370
acting like a different person.

948
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,250
She makes him train.

949
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,410
She asks the physician

950
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:12,730
to check his pulse every day.

951
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,090
Mr. Zhan can't stand

952
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,170
the routine.

953
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,210
So today,

954
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,690
he sneaked out

955
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,970
and made us search for a good while.

956
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,170
At first,

957
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,570
I thought Miss Si

958
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,370
grounded Mr. Zhan because the deadline

959
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,490
for the recruitment

960
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,850
was around the corner.

961
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,970
But when I helped with the search,

962
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,090
I noticed

963
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,850
she changed

964
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,450
all the servants tending to Mr. Zhan.

965
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:42,650
She even tests Mr. Zhan's food

966
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,450
with a silver needle

967
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,170
to check for poison.

968
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,170
She is simply paranoid.

969
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:49,770
It was the same today.

970
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,690
She got so anxious after only

971
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:52,450
half a day.

972
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,050
That sounds serious.

973
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,330
Does it mean someone

974
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,530
is really after Jiang Zhan's life?

975
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,290
He is a wayward young man

976
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,530
with no title to inherit.

977
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,450
Who would waste their time
going after his life?

978
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,210
Wait.

979
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,410
Miss Jiang has always

980
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:08,970
been cautious.

981
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:09,530
She must have

982
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,690
a reason for the precautions.

983
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,010
Master Qin,

984
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,610
I know some martial arts.

985
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,650
I'll go with you tomorrow.

986
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,610
If it's not enough

987
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,130
to ease Miss Jiang's mind,

988
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,570
we shall take her along.

989
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:23,810
That's a sound plan.

990
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,370
I will relay your message to her.

991
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,250
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

992
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,010
Cheers.

993
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,850
I have a day off.

994
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,690
The boredom of being cooped up
in the house

995
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,450
is bad for your health, Jiang.

996
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:49,410
I can coach him.

997
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,050
Master Qin is here too.

998
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,410
Miss Jiang, you have nothing
to worry about.

999
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,450
I'm counting on you, Mr. Yu.

1000
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:58,570
Zhan,

1001
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,450
I'll go now.

1002
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,370
Yu, you're a true friend indeed.

1003
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,610
You use horseback archery

1004
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,410
as a ruse to get me out.

1005
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,060
A true friend indeed!

1006
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,700
A true friend indeed.

1007
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,660
In that case,

1008
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,140
do the horse stance for an hour

1009
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:20,910
as a warm-up.

1010
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,740
Yes. An hour?

1011
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,350
Wait a minute, Yu.

1012
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,670
I've already

1013
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,510
mastered the techniques.

1014
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,430
I don't need warm-ups.

1015
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,350
I can practice now.

1016
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,330
Let's do it.

1017
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,610
You sneaked out yesterday.

1018
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,090
Your family was worried sick.

1019
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,740
Some punishment is due.

1020
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,420
We are buddies.

1021
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,070
You are my best pal.

1022
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,830
In that case,

1023
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,150
I must take

1024
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,030
full responsibility.

1025
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,510
Your sister can watch you.

1026
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,550
Hold on, Yu!

1027
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,150
I'm doing the stance. See?

1028
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,230
Don't be mad.

1029
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,550
That kick was for your sister.

1030
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,350
Mr. Zhen?

1031
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,710
More flowers for Miss Si?

1032
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,270
I think she and Mr. Zhan left
for the equestrian center

1033
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,510
in the western suburbs.

1034

1039

Cape jasmine.

1040
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,790
It was an orchid last time.

1041
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,870
