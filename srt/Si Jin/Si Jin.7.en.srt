What a huge surprise.

29
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,740
What are you doing at Ling'an?

30
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,180
I've been upholding justice

31
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,460
and traveling the world.

32
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,980
I arrived at Ling'an unknowingly.

33
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,740
Maybe it's because I sensed

34
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,900
that you needed me.

35
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,780
Indeed. When I met Long Dan,

36
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,980
I heard that you were seriously wounded.

37
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,020
Let me see. Where were you hurt?

38
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,180

It's been so many years.

Can't you behave

42
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,780
like a lady for once?

43
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:36,980
Be a lady? How?

44
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,540
By adhering to those outdated notions

45
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,660

46
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,220

47
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,060
I know now.

48
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,900
I'm sure you came here to hide
because your family

49
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,100
urged you to get married.

50
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,380

58
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,100

64
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,860

65

We grew up together.

66
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,900
We even had

67
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,700
the same martial arts mentor.

68
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,140
However,

69
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,140
Qi established
the Red Plume Cavalry later.

70
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,300
He went to a new camp.

71
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,500
That's why we were separated.

72
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,180
No wonder I haven't seen her before.

73
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,780

74
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,980

Judging from your condition,

91
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,860
it should take

92
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,260
a few more days for the remaining toxins
to be completely neutralized.

93
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,220

94

you deliver to me every day.

00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,500
You're too naive for your own good.

193
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,539
In the future,

194
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,580
I have to ask your uncle

195
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,860
to find you the best man in the world.

196
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,059
And, I have to

197
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,179
test him first.

198
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,940
I can only rest at ease

199
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,220
once he passes the test.

200
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,540
Mother, you're the best.

201
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,140
His Lordship requests an audience.

202
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,540
My Lord.

203
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,260
Your Highness.

204
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,340
This treasure is known
as the Golden Plant.

205
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,620
The branches are made of pure gold.

206
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,780
The flowers, pure white nephrite.

207
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,580
And the leaves, top-quality jadeite.

208
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,820
I went to great lengths

209
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,180
to obtain it from Lingnan.

210
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,820
I'm here to present it
to you, Your Highness.

211
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,420
You came here
in the middle of the night.

212
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,900
I suppose you're here for your son.

213
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,540
Your Highness, you're wise indeed.

214
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,220
Zhen Heng
of the Capital Administration Office

215
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,060
and the new commandant, Yu Qi,

216
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,140
are reckless, arrogant,
and show no regard for others.

217
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,100
They don't respect me at all.

218
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,460
They came up

219
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,940
with a ridiculous excuse

220
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,780
to send my son to prison.

221
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,940
They intend
to sentence him to death as well!

222
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,600
Your Highness.

223
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,150
You must uphold justice for me!

224
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,220
Did you make up this charge?

225
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,180
Or is it true?

226
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,030
Your Highness.

227
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,390
Every word I utter is true.

228
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,240
I dare not make up such charges!

229
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,790
Your Highness, as you know,

230
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,390
I only have one son!

231
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,960
You want me to help you out,

232
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,550
yet you're not telling me the truth.

233
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,480
How can I help you out?

234
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,030
I...

235
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,980
[Main Hall
of the Capital Administration Office]

236
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:05,980
Chief.

237
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,180
Chief, how is your arm?

238
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:08,700
It's healed.

239
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,140
Take a look at this.

240
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,540
When we were searching
the Marquis of Changxing's Mansion,

241
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,700
not only did we find whips

242
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,340
in the secret chamber,

243
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,740
but we also found this.

244
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,460
I've asked Miss Chi about this.

245
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,180
Cao Xingyu calls this drug

246
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,060
Divine Bliss.

247
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,420
He'd take one pill

248
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,300
before he started abusing his victims.

249
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,620
This drug is...

250
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,340
Open it!

251
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,060
This drug

252
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,460
is the real deal.

253
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,780
How did he swallow this?

254
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,940
Go and ask a physician

255
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,340
if he has some sort of chronic illness.

256
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,060
I've done the inquiry.

257
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:49,700
He...

258
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,140
You see, this drug is...

259
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,580
Out with it. Stop mumbling.

260
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,300
It's an aphrodisiac.

261
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,540
The key is that the main ingredient

262
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,020
is a plant called Pueraria lobata.

263
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,020
Such plants

264
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,220
are only found in Nanwu.

265
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,740
The physician said

266
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,740
he only saw these plants

267
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,500
when Zhou and Nanwu

268
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,420
were still

269
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,340
open for trade.

270
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,260
They've been banned for ages.

271
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,940
Seems like Cao Xingyu has committed

272
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,460
more than just murder.

273
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,940
I was anxious about not having any leads.

274
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,580
And then he just hands them over.

275
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,460
Report!

276
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,180
Mr. Yu!

277
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,260
Mr. Zhen!

278
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,780
Outside...

279
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,860
Hurry and check it out!

280
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,980
Who are the Gale Guards?

281
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,780
They're
under His Majesty's direct command.

282
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,300
They investigate public sentiment
and oversee all officials.

283
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,540
They have more power
than the Capital Administration Office.

284
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,020
The one who's visiting us today

285
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,060
is their commander, Han Ran.

286
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,820
Amazing.

287
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,580
Mr. Han!

288
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,180
Mr. Han.

289
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,760
[Han Ran, Commander of the Gale Guards]

290
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,780
Your Lordship,

291
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,900
Her Highness sent me with this message.

292
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,800
She's aware of the matter

293
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,820
of the Capital Administration Office.

294
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,440
Please don't worry.

295
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,270
Her Highness said

296
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,510
you're a distinguished general
of the realm.

297
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,000
By helping you, Her Highness
is also helping our realm.

298
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,390
Her Highness also said

299
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,510
that after this incident,

300
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,910
your son cannot stay

301
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,870
at Ling'an any longer.

302
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,600
Relay my message to Her Highness.

303
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,670
I'll send

304
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,200
that unfilial son of mine
somewhere far away.

305
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,480
He shall never set foot
in Ling'an again.

306
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,390
[Main Hall]
I came here today

307
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,600
[of the Capital Administration Office]
to demand an individual

308
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,320
from you.

309
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:46,960
Who is it?

310
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,910
The Marquis of Changxing's
heir apparent,

311
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,750
Cao Xingyu.

312
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,790
This person

313
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,200
is a major criminal
of the Capital Administration Office.

314
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,670
The case hasn't been solved yet.

315
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,320
Pardon us for not being able to comply.

316
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,480
What a coincidence.

317
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,600
Cao Xingyu

318
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,910
is also related to a case

319
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,390
that the Gale Guards
have been investigating

320
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,360
for many years.

321
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,360
And, it's a major case related
to collusion with Nanwu.

322
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,030
Mr. Han,

323
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,240
do you have the official documents?

324
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
There are just a few sentences.

325
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,670
And, they're not detailed.

326
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,720
I'm afraid it's not convincing enough.

327
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,000
Commandant Yu, you just assumed
your position not long ago.

328
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,510
I suppose you have no idea.

329
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,390
The cases
that the Gale Guards investigate

330
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,080
are confidential cases
of the imperial court.

331
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,960
As for the details of the cases,

332
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,030
they're confidential.

333
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,960
All right.

334
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,480
I'm a busy man.

335
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,670
Please

336
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,120
bring Cao Xingyu here
as soon as possible

337
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,240
and hand him to me.

338
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,320
Cao Xingyu

339
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,440
is suspected
of taking more than ten lives.

340
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,030
His sin is unpardonable.

341
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,320
The Capital Administration Office
hasn't even closed the case yet,

342
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,750
but you want to take him with you

343
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,720
by saying
that your case is confidential?

344
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,840
If so,

345
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,910
please pardon us for not being
able to cooperate with you.

346
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,600
Although the Gale Guards
follow His Majesty's order,

347
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,910
the Capital Administration Office
are handling major cases too.

348
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,000
Everything

349
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,270
must follow the order of precedence.

350
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,840
Since we arrested him first,

351
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,910
we should be the ones
conducting the trial.

352
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,150
Miss Chi is safe here.

353
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,320
Don't worry.

354
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,510
I've heard
about the Gale Guards visiting you all

355
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,240
this afternoon.

356
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,720
Thank you for that.

357
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,030
This matter

358
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,390
has truly caused you trouble, huh?

359
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,910
It's nothing.

360
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,440
I just didn't expect someone
to rat me out.

361
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,270
Miss Chi is inside.

362
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,550
Go on in.

363
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,000
I won't join you.

364
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,790
Okay. I'll go and check on her, then.

365
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,030
Come here.

366
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,510
Regarding the matter this afternoon,

367
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,510
Aman was the one...

368
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,240
Have you obtained
the documents from Han Ran?

369
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,080
Take some rest. I'll do it.

370
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,510
I can't just rest here.

371
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,600
By the way, Miss Chi,

372
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,200
do you need to write

373
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,750
to your family first?

374
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,790
No need for that.

375
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,360
I don't have any kin.

376
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,870
I was an orphan since young.

377
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,630
My brother and his wife took me in.

378
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,440
However,

379
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,840
they sold me off to a pleasure house.

380
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,600
Miss Si, you have no idea.

381
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,360
They don't care about kinship at all.

382
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,750
Their minds are only filled
with their own interests.

383
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,590
Right after I settled down
in the outskirts,

384
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,590
they rushed here overnight

385
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,590
upon hearing about it.

386
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,160
I thought

387
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,240
they felt terrible for me.

388
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,200
In the end...

389
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,069
I was such a fool.

390
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,240
I shouldn't have had
any expectations of them.

391
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,880
What did you say?

392
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,400
You want me

393
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,680
to be Cao Xingyu's concubine?

394
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,030
Shuying,

395
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,310
given your condition,

396
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,160
who else do you think
you can get married to?

397
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,790
We're talking about
the Marquis of Changxing's Mansion here.

398
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,550
The betrothal gifts they sent us

399
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,830
had filled our entire courtyard,
you know?

400
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,070
Even the marriage

401
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,640
between your brother and I

402
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,880
wasn't as glorious as such.

403
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,160
Once you marry into their family,

404
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,400
no one dares to gossip

405
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,750
or talk bad about you.

406
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,070
We're doing this for your own good.

407
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,640
Seriously?

408
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,480
Our parents entrusted me to you

409
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,310
before they passed away.

410
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,750
What? Was it not enough

411
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,880
for you to sell me off
to a pleasure house?

412
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,000
Now, you're trying to kick me
into another abyss?

413
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,070
Back then,

414
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,640
I had no choice either.

415
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,200
An opportunity

416
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,680
is staring you in the face.

417
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,880
I just want you to lead a good life.

418
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,270
Now that I think about it,

419
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,310
ever since the day

420
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,240
they sold me off to the pleasure house,

421
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,400
my family

422
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,400
no longer exists.

423
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,880
Miss Chi,

424
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,640
although you've escaped from danger,

425
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,750
you're still willing to risk your life

426
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
to save other people.

427
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,270
With your courage and resilience,

428
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,110
I'm sure you can overcome all obstacles.

429
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,400
You taught me that.

430
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,920
Miss Jiang,

431
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,880
you rescued me
without expecting anything in return.

432
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,350
I'll surely follow your ways.

433
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,200
When other people are in trouble,

434
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,920
I'll lend them a hand.

435
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,640
Don't worry.

436
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,440
We have Commandant Yu
and Mr. Zhen with us.

437
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,440
The truth

438
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,200
will be brought to light.

439
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,960
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

440
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,980
[Capital Administration Office]

441
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,350
Cao Xingyu.

442
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,110
Do you intend

443
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,680
to keep pretending to be mute?

444
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,350
You should open your eyes
and take a look.

445
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,960
We found this

446
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,030
in your study.

447
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,400
It's called Divine Bliss, right?

448
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,750
What is that?

449
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,480
I've never heard of it before.

450
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,160
Is that so?

451
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,590
I suppose you didn't use it, then.

452
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,070
Don't tell me your father
was the one using it.

453
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,110
Shut up!

454
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,160
Fine. I'll shut up.

455
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,830
His father is pretty old.

456
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,550
I never expected him to use this.

457
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:45,960
My goodness.

458
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,400
Yu Qi!

459
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,200
Fine.

460
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,240
I won't bring it up.

461
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,830
Let's talk about something else.

462
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,030
The formula came

463
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,400
from Nanwu, right?

464
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,830
I never expected

465
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,400
the Marquis of Changxing's family

466
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,310
to collude with Nanwu

467
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,680
and betray our realm.

468
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,720
Yu Qi.

469
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,830
Listen up.

470
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,920
Stop trying to slander my family.

471
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,400
You said you found this
in my study, huh?

472
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,480
I can say that you're framing me!

473
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:22,880
Excellent.

474
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,920
I can rest at ease

475
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,000
when you're showing me that reaction.

476
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,030
I trust you.

477
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,240
Show it to him.

478
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,220
[Cao Xingyu, heir apparent
to the Marquis of Changxing,]

479
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,460
[has colluded with Nanwu]

480
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,440
What does this mean?

481
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,880
Being locked up in prison,

482
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,960
you're naturally cut off
from information.

483
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,270
Just now, the Gale Guards were here.

484
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,070
They wanted to take you with them

485
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,030
under the crime of collusion with Nanwu.

486
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,720
Cao Xingyu

487
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
murdered individuals
and buried their bodies

488
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,920
because he was
under the control of Nanwu.

489
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,400
Nanwu?

490
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
According to

491
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,920
our years of investigation,

492
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,750
the people of Nanwu have sent their men

493
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,030
to infiltrate Ling'an City

494
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,640
and establish the Nightingale Sect

495
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,880
to approach high-ranking officials

496
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,030
to gather intel
and seek opportunities for subversion.

497
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,110
The Marquis of Changxing
is the top general of our realm.

498
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,750
He holds a high position
in the military.

499
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,680
He also guards the imperial city.

500
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,750
They tempted him several times

501
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,400
but to no avail.

502
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,070
That's why they shifted their focus

503
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,000
to his son, Cao Xingyu.

504
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,480
They controlled him by using drugs,

505
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
forcing him to commit murder.

506
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,110
If they could use the drug

507
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,750
to control Cao Xingyu,

508
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,110
why didn't they control
his father directly?

509
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,400
This is the Nanwu people's

510
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,160
counterintelligence plot.

511
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,110
Their goal

512
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,440
is to drive a wedge
between the Marquis of Changxing

513
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,590
and His Majesty.

514
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,550
What's wrong?

515
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,270
The Gale Guards
are trying to arrest this person.

516
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,160
Do you think you can keep him

517
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
from us by force?

518
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,200
Today,

519
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,550
you

520
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,440
have to hand Cao Xingyu over

521
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,680
by hook or by crook.

522
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,550
I won't!

523
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,830
Do you dare to steal him from us?

524
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,440
Aren't you afraid
that I might report you

525
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,550
to His Majesty?

526
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,270
Go ahead.

527
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,510
Hurry up.

528
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,550
If you can bring

529
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,960
His Majesty's edict here,

530
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:21,860
you

531
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,100
can take him with you.

532
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,140
If not,

533
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,660
don't even think about it.

534
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,680
Three days.

535
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,000
You have three days.

536
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,640
You had no idea

537
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,350
how much I did

538
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,640
in order to keep you here.

539
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,480
You should know

540
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,960
what consequences await you

541
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,830
if they get their hands

542
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,920
on such evidence.

543
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,030
What do you want?

544
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,680
It's not about me.

545
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,110
It's about how you intend
to give me an account.

546
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,480
Where did you get the drugs?

547
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,860
[Base of Nightingale Sect]

550
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,550
Du'er, you summoned me
in the middle of the night.

551
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,220
Did something happen?

00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,620
[Du'er, Leader of Nightingale Sect]

553
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,790
The case of
the Marquis of Changxing's Mansion

554
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,550
has been causing quite a stir
these past two days.

555
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:02,920
I heard

556
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,720
that they even found leads
that were related to Nanwu.

557
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,830
You were in charge
of keeping an eye on their family.

558
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,160
What happened?

559
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,070
Du'er, here's the thing.

560
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,160
Cao Xingyu is a lecherous man.

561
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,830
I wanted to use that to our advantage

562
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,640
and make him a pawn of our sect.

563
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,720
He was supposed
to be our new pawn in Ling'an.

564
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,110
I never expected him to be so foolish.

565
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,440
After he had tortured

566
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,550
and murdered over ten girls,

567
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,400
he actually hid their bodies

568
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,590
in his garden.

569
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,920
But Du'er, don't worry.

570
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,350
He was imprisoned
for the crime of murder.

571
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,960
It has nothing to do with Nanwu.

572
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,350
But the spy I planted

573
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,830
within the Gale Guards said

574
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,240
that Han Ran wanted
to take Cao Xingyu away

575
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,070
for the crime of collusion
with the enemy.

576
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,350
I assume

577
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,070
the Marquis of Changxing came up
with the fake charge

578
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
in order to rescue his son.

579
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,310
I don't think he has
any substantial evidence.

580
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,240
Du'er,

581
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,510
you know the way I do things.

582
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,030
I will never leave

583
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,480
any trace behind.

584
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,160
The Nightingale Sect

585
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,640
had lurked in Ling'an for ten years

586
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,790
for us to have our hidden network

587
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,680
and places of hiding.

588
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,880
Now, we have no news of the Saintess.

589
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,680
Zhou hasn't fallen either.

590
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,750
We still have a long way to go.

591
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,480
We must be steady
with each step we take.

592
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,480
Yes, sir.

593
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,790
So, you were confident

594
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,550
that you could

595
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,790
handle the incident
related to Divine Bliss

596
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,790
before I found out, huh?

597
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,270
Du'er, please be appeased.

598
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,160
It was a sudden occurrence.

599
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
The Capital Administration Office

600
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,440
confiscated the Divine Bliss kept
in the Marquis of Changxing's Mansion

601
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,240
before we could retrieve it.

602
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,480
You should act cautiously these days

603
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,880
to avoid implications.

604
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:52,830
Yes, sir.

605
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,720
Du'er,

606
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,310
why don't I silence

607
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,070
Cao Xingyu

608
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,030
to prevent future troubles?

609
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,720
No need for that.

610
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,480
Cao Xingyu is useless now.

611
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,200
There's no need to waste our time.

612
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,310
Remember.

613
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,830
More doing, more mistakes.

614
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:08,680
Yes, sir.

615
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,110
You may go.

616
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,400
What will
the Capital Administration Office do

617
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,830
about Cao Xingyu?

618
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:21,880
Will they release him?

619
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,440
Or will they execute him?

620
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,680
Time for another good show.

621
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,790
So, in your opinion,

622
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
is this case

623
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,640
related to the Nightingale Sect?

624
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,240
They're lurking in the dark

625
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,830
while we're on the surface.

626
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,160
I'm sure they're waiting

627
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,400
to see how we'll clean up this mess.

628
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Cao Xingyu's crimes are irrefutable.

629
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,240
If we release him,

630
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,350
the innocent souls of the girls

631
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,000
will suffer injustice.

632
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,240
The Capital Administration Office

633
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,440
will lose all of its credibility.

634
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,680
If we execute him,

635
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,680
[Main Hall]
the Marquis will lose his only son.

636
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,270
[of the Capital Administration Office]
He'll bear a grudge toward the court

637
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,200
and harbor treacherous intentions.

638
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,000
So no matter which decision we make,

639
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,680
to them,

640
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,070
it'll only be beneficial.

641
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,920
What a despicable plot.

642
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,550
Now,

643
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,440
we're caught in a dilemma.

644
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,830
So, Mr. Zhen, what will be your choice?

645
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,070
As the sages have said,

646
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,880
"Those who govern the world must not act

647
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,240
without laws and standards.

648
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,070
When both rulers
and subjects follow the law,

649
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,160
this is called great governance."

650
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,790
Therefore,

651
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,960
following one's heart
while obeying the law

652
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,550
is the solution to our dilemma.

653
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,550
Miss Jiang,

654
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,310
every injustice has its perpetrator.

655
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,880
Don't tell me we can only stand idly by

656
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,310
while the villain is at large.

657
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,070
Must my daughter

658
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,960
suffer a wrongful death as such?

659
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,160
Madam Xiu, calm down.

660
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,960
I did come up with an idea.

661
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,920
But it's quite risky.

662
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,240
I don't know

663
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,640
if you're willing to give it a shot.

664
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,000
Commandant Yu.

665
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,640
Among the military officers
in Ling'an City,

666
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,960
I've seen few
as wise and courteous as you,

667
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,590
yet also eloquent and persuasive.

668
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,400
I'm sure you're an educated individual.

669
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,790
May I know who your mentor is?

670
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,440
Why did you choose
to be a military official

671
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,070
instead of a civil official?

672
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,030
It's a long story.

673
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,750
Right now, we should figure out

674
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,480
how to handle the case.

675
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,640
Even if we conduct it impartially

676
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,270
and close the case in three days,

677
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,110
we still have to hand Cao Xingyu over

678
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,350
when they come.

679
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,110
Once Cao Xingyu is in their hands,

680
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,830
they'll overturn the testimonies.

681
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,270
They'll find a spy from Nanwu
to be his scapegoat.

682
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,680
This case

683
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,480
will be pointless.

684
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,680
You have a point.

685
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,400
How should we handle the case, then?

686
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,880
Request His Majesty to conduct a trial.

687
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,640
Request His Majesty to conduct a trial.

688
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,270
Right now, we are in a busy marketplace.

689
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,920
Please make sure not to show yourself.

690
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,350
[Eunuch Liu, Palace Attendant]
It'll be terrible

691
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,400
if people recognize you.

692
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,480
Wait.

693
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:29,830
Stop!

694
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:31,960
Your Majesty.

695
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,440
I mean, Master.

696
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,590
Buy me some iced drinks.

697
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,350
For this discreet visit,

698
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,000
only a few guards were brought along.

699
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,160
We only ordered secret patrols
from the Capital Administration Office.

700
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,350
I thought that was unnecessary.

701
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,750
Cut the nonsense. Buy it.

702
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,000
Yes, Master.

703
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,830
I'd like a bowl, please.

704
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,680
All right.

705
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,510
Here you go.

706
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,240
Master.

707
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,680
Depart.

708
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,310
Your Majesty!

709
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,590
I'm innocent!

710
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,830
Your Majesty,
please uphold justice for me!

711
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,030
Drag her away.

712
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,920
Your Majesty!

713
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:39,790
Wait.

714
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,680
Miss,

715
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,270
[Emperor Jingming, Emperor of Zhou]
continue.

716
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,550
Your Majesty,

717
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,830
I truly have no choice!

718
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,070
I can only risk my life
to report this to you, Your Majesty.

719
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,310
I implore you.

720
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,830
Please uphold justice

721
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,880
for my late daughter!

722
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,640
Why didn't you report it
to the authorities?

723
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,000
What about
the Capital Administration Office?

724
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,830
That murderer holds
a high position of power.

725
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,680
He can cover up
for any crime he commits.

726
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,270
My daughter wasn't the only one
who suffered a wrongful death.

727
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,310
There were also
more than a dozen young girls

728
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,030
of similar age
who suffered the same fate.

729
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
That's why
the Capital Administration Office

730
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,480
arrested him.

731
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,310
The case is not yet closed,

732
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,880
yet someone has come
to negotiate his release.

733
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,960
I'm afraid they'll set him free

734
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,400
in a few more days.

735
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,510
Who's bold enough to do so?

736
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,000
The heir apparent
to the Marquis of Changxing,

737
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,590
Cao Xingyu.

738
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,680
I never expected

739
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,200
my son's matter
to stir up trouble again.

740
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,310
I have made you worry.

741
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,790
Your Highness,
you hold an important position.

742
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,680
Your words are influential.

743
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,750
I hope you can speak up for me again.

744
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,590
If I'm able to overcome this trial,

745
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,110
I'll follow

746
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,440
your every command.

747
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,960
Do not get ahead of yourself.

748
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,310
Before this, you hid the truth from me.

749
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,110
Even so, I helped you out.

750
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,880
I've already done everything
I could for you.

751
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,680
But your son has committed
unpardonable crimes.

752
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,160
Perhaps this is simply his fate.

753
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,920
Marquis,

754
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,680
you must accept fate
when the time comes.

755
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,720
Fate, huh?

756
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,000
This is my fate!

757
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,510
Pardon me for being rude.

758
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Now, you want

759
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,720
to sever your ties with me?

760
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,110
Don't you think it's too late?

761
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,510
If your good intentions
lead to a bad outcome,

762
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,400
it's still your fate, Your Highness.

763
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,350
Since you don't know
what's good for you,

764
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,350
forget it.

765
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,920
Present it to him.

766
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,880
That good son of yours

767
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,640
exchanged Zhou's intel

768
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,480
with Nanwu's Nightingale Sect

769
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,400
for Divine Bliss

770
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,920
so that he could enjoy himself.

771
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,400
Impossible!

772
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,680
That's impossible!

773
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
No matter how ridiculous his acts were,

774
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,510
he would never do such a thing!

775
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,590
This is slander!

776
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,550
It doesn't matter.

777
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,880
The Gale Guards

778
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,750
have plenty of similar letters as such.

779
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,480
We'll know whether or not
it's a misunderstanding

780
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,920
upon reading them.

781
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,480
Your Highness! I deserve to die!

782
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,920
Please pardon me.

783
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,720
Your Highness, please tell me

784
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,440
what I should do.

785
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,160
This is nothing but a farce.

786
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,160
It's time to end it.

787
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,960
Although my son is unfilial,

788
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,790
he's still my only son,

789
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,350
Your Highness!

790
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,590
If it's the lives of more
than several young girls,

791
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,440
at most, it'll cost your son his life.

792
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,680
But if he's convicted of the crime
of collusion with the enemy,

793
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,880
everyone in your mansion

794
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,510
will be executed.

795
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,280
Is there still a need to debate

796
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,070
which choice is better?

797
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,190
Since you brought

798
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,030
this treasure

799
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,070
all the way from Lingnan,

800
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,510
I shouldn't take it.

801
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,000
I've admired it for a few days.

802
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,320
It's time for you to take it back.

803
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,400
Golden Plant, huh?

804
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,590
It's utterly worthless.

805
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,540
[Tiande Hall, Imperial Palace]

806
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,000
Your Majesty.

807
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,510
We have both witnesses
and substantial evidence.

808
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,230
What else do you
have to say for yourself?

809
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,190
Father?

810
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,320
Father!

811
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,840
Your Majesty, I...

812
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,320
Your Majesty!

813
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,510
It's all my fault.

814
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,110
Do not spout nonsense
in front of His Majesty!

815
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:28,630
Cao Yong!

816
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,880
A child is better unborn than untaught.

817
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,400
Since young,

818
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,510
whenever he didn't

819
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,920
meet his father's expectations,

820
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,030
he would receive a severe beating.

821
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,550
I was weak and inept.

822
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,630
I couldn't stop him.

823
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,480
For our child to end up like this,

824
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,480
my husband and I bear heavy guilt.

825
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,230
Such audacity!

826
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:50,920
Shut up!

827
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,280
Don't you hit my mother!

828
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,480
Your Majesty!

829
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,800
Our child only ended up like this

830
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,840
because we failed
to educate him properly!

831
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,400
Your Majesty,

832
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,670
please spare

833
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,400
his life!

834
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,800
Mother.

835
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:10,840
Mother?

836
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:11,710
Mother.

837
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,400
Mother.

838
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,480
If I spare your son,

839
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,280
who will uphold the law, then?

840
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,920
A life for a life.

841
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,420
I took the poison

842
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,590
before coming here.

843
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,950
I only hope that the dead

844
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,760
will be appeased with my death.

845
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,000
Mother?

846
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,110
Mother.

847
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,510
Mother?

848
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,070
Mother! I know my fault now!

849
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,000
Mother!

850
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,190
Mother!

851
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,360
This is His Majesty's decree.

852
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,000
Cao Xingyu, heir apparent
to the Marquis of Changxing,

853
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,510
abducted women, abused his wife,

854
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,000
and showed no regard for human lives.
His sins are unpardonable.

855
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,920
He shall be executed after fall.

856
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,230
Cao Yong, Marquis of Changxing,
has failed to educate his child.

857
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,800
In consideration of his military merits,

858
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,110
his title shall be retained

859
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,230
but will not be passed down.

860
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,340
The decree will be carried out
on a chosen date.

861
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:52,060
[Tiande Hall]

862
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,960
You do have some self-awareness.

863
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,920
Your Majesty, I know my fault.

864
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,070
How did she file her petition

865
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,190
to me that accurately?

866
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,920
How did she recognize me

867
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,000
out of all the sedan chairs

868
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,840
in the street?

869
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,110
I

870
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,760
have misused my authority
over the Capital Administration Office.

871
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:05,880
That's why Your Majesty

872
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,280
had to conduct a trial for Cao Xingyu.

873
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,030
After this trial,

874
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,840
the Marquis of Changxing
has lost both his son

875
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,030
and his wife.

876
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,920
Do you know
who the Marquis of Changxing is?

877
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,030
I do.

878
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:17,960
Out of friendship,

879
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,760
you and Marquis of Changxing
risked your lives

880
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,360
to defend the realm together.

881
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,880
In the court,

882
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,670
he's the pillar of the realm.

883
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,280
Your Majesty, your action

884
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,000
has let the Marquis of Changxing down.

885
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,150
I'm afraid

886
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,880
he won't serve the realm again.

887
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,480
But Your Majesty,

888
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,800
I had no choice either.

889
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,150
In your opinion,

890
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,670
which is more important?
The innocent lives

891
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,110
or the son of a high-ranking minister

892
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,710
who rightfully deserves to face justice?

893
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,400
My knowledge is limited.

894
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,590
I had no choice but to resort to this.

895
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,760
Are you saying

896
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,670
that I cannot differentiate
between right and wrong?

897
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,480
You think I don't know
if the innocent lives that were lost

898
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,230
were more important
than the life of Cao Yong's son?

899
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,670
Your Majesty, I knew you could
differentiate between right and wrong.

900
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,360
That's why

901
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,880
you're heartbroken right now.

902
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,440
After I returned
to the 23rd year of the Jingming era,

903
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,710
Qiaoniang got married to Ji Chongyi.

904
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,590
Cao Xingyu was sent to prison.

905
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,670
Everything has changed.

906
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,880
Since that's the case,

907
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,030
I'm sure

908
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,400
there's a way

909
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,320
to change the fate
of my brother, sister,

910
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,800
and father.

911
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,550
Commandant Yu?

912
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,630
You should be in the imperial palace.

913
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,550
It's just a result announcement.

914
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,510
I'm thirsty.

915
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,190
Miss Jiang, I came here

916
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,480
to ask for a drink.

917
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,710
Excuse me. Please get him some tea.

918
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,510
Sir, please enjoy your tea.

919
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,880
You didn't let us down.

920
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,030
All the innocent girls
who had lost their lives

921
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,000
can finally rest in peace now.

922
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,840
His mother took her own life

923
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,670
in order to atone for his sin.

924
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,960
How pitiful of her.

925
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,400
She took her own life

926
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,400
in order to atone for her son's sin.

927
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,480
Pitiful?

928
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,150
Her son stirred up a ruckus

929
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,760
in their residence.

930
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,960
Her daughter-in-law
was abused all the time.

931
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,110
She was the female head of the family.

932
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,030
How could she not know about it?

933
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,800
I think she just

934
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,280
turned a blind eye to his crime.

935
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,190
No matter what,

936
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,670
all mothers in the world

937
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,030
love their children the most.

938
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,920
It's the same for Cao Xingyu's mother.

939
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,590
So was

940
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,400
that scheming Aunt Xiao of mine.

941
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,960
You've dedicated years
to the Capital Administration Office.

942
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,070
I know you well.

943
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,760
You may be able

944
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,360
to come up with a way
to redress the grievances

945
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,280
of those innocent lives that were lost,

946
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,630
but there's no way you can do something

947
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,840
like reporting the case directly to me.

948
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,320
Don't tell me

949
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,400
that woman

950
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,590
came up with this idea.

951
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,510
Who was it?

952
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,190
Tell me.

953
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,670
I won't punish you for it.

954
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,480
Your Majesty,

955
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,480
I have a good friend.

956
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,280
Whenever I can't

957
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,440
make sense of a case,

958
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,030
I'll discuss it with him.

959
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,190
He can tell right from wrong

960
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,800
and often thinks out of the box.

961
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,320
This time,

962
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,030
he was the one
who came up with the idea.

963
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,670
The person you mentioned,

964
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,840
is he one of our officials?

965
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,150
He's the new commandant

966
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,320
of the Capital Administration Office,

967
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,230
Yu Qi.

968
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,320
Yu Qi?

969
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,230
The world is vast.

970
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,030
There are also mothers

971
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:28,960
who don't love their children.

972
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,670
Mr. Yu, are you referring

973
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,230
to your mother?

974
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,630
I suppose I don't have such a fortune.

975
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,150
The departed are long gone.

976
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,400
Mr. Yu, please accept my condolences.

977
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,480
You misunderstood me.

978
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,760
I meant...

979
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,880
I was abandoned when I was young.

980
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,150
She never

981
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,030
cared for me.

982
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,190
Therefore, to me,

983
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,070
I don't have a mother.

984
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,440
It's been so many years since then.

985
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,230
Have you not tried looking for her?

986
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,280
Maybe she had bitter reasons

987
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,710
for leaving you back then.

988
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,440
I never looked for her.

989
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,800
Bitter reasons, huh?

990
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,800
Back then, a fortune teller said

991
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,400
that I was ill-fated.

992
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,320
He said I would bring disaster
upon the family.

993
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,360
She feared that she might be implicated
and lose favor,

994
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,070
so she came up with a way

995
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,920
to make my father

996
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,150
send me somewhere distant.

997
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,150
That's the gist of it.

998
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,840
In the past,

999
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,440
[Southern Frontier]
he wasn't willing

1000
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,030
to talk about his background.

1001
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,920
I only know
that he was shunned by his family,

1002
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,400
and was exiled to guard the frontier.

1003
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,280
I never expected him

1004
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,480
to have a similar fate as me.

1005
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:46,800
From birth,

1006
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,840
he was burdened
with the fate of being a jinx.
