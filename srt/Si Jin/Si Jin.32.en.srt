Even if she knew about
the truth back then,

188
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,720
she would make her daughter

189
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,560
keep the secret.

190
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,280
Between a pair of eyes and her life,

191
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,320
I'm sure she knows
which is the better option.

192
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,920
Times have changed.

193
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,080
No matter how timid or inept she is,

194
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,600
she's been the Empress for many years.

195
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,920
Power

196
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,880
is what blinds people the most.

197
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,760
It makes them forget who they are.

198
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,200
What if we compare her

199
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,240
to the late Empress
who was at the height

200
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,040
of her power?

201
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Who's better?

202
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,200
You're right.

203
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,920
I lost my composure just now.

204
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,520
I need to let them know

205
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,560
who my brother cares about

206
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,240
and believes the most.

207
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,080
The Empress and Yu Jin,

208
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,240
who do they think they are?

209
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,400
We can't afford to let Princess Royal

210
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,960
harm the Imperial Palace

211
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,920
and the innocent again.

212
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,120
If we report her

213
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,240
to His Majesty together

214
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,040
and reopen the case
of the late Empress' death,

215
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,160
the Crown Prince

216
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,320
will stop supporting her.

217
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,120
Only by bringing her to justice

218
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,200
can Princess Fuqing

219
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,720
truly be at peace

220
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,320
and be rid of the nightmares
that haunt her.

221
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,040
This won't do.

222
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,080
Mother?

223
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,520
Fuqing has lost her sight for ten years.

224
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,920
Do you intend
to let her off just like that?

225
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,440
I can endure everything

226
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,160
as long as Fuqing is safe.

227
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,120
Before this, the late Empress
pitted herself against her.

228
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,360
She even had the Crown Prince's backing.

229
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,920
But what happened to her in the end?

230
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,520
She didn't do anything wrong,

231
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,560
yet she suffered a terrible death.

232
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,800
I've lived in this palace

233
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,120
for many years.

234
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,360
Although I'm not capable,

235
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,880
there's one thing

236
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,560
I understand clearly.

237
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,600
To His Majesty, the Princess Royal

238
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,280
is different from everyone else.

239
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,440
Although she's not
his biological sister,

240
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,560
they grew up

241
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,720
and went through
thick and thin together.

242
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,480
She even protected him

243
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,600
during Prince Xiang's rebellion.

244
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,080
She risked her own life

245
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,560
to rescue His Majesty.

246
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,080
Forget about Fuqing.

247
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,000
Even the Crown Prince and Prince Qi

248
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,200
cannot compare to her weight

249
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,280
in His Majesty's heart.

250
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,040
If it doesn't concern one's life,

251
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,720
you should tolerate it.

252
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,960
Once you get married,

253
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,520
you can form your family

254
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,720
and lead your own life.

255
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,960
Do not pit yourself against her.

256
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,960
But Your Majesty...

257
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,080
Your Majesty, we understand

258
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,440
your intentions.

259
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,440
Mother.

260
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,000
Mother, have you heard?

261
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,880
Jiang Si actually found
a folk prescription

262
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,760
that cured Princess Fuqing's eyes.

263
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,960
She was blind for many years.

264
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,720
Now, Uncle

265
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,800
will only favor her even more.

266
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,400
Do you still have a way

267
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,000
to make Uncle change his mind?

268
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,320
Am I no longer able

269
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,240
to be married to Yu Jin?

270
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,160
If that's the case,

271
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,600
I don't want to live anymore!

272
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,880
You only talk about Yu Jin.

273
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,160
Do you even remember

274
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,200
that my birth date is nearing?

275
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,680
I...

276
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,760
Uncle

277
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,760
celebrates your birthday

278
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,840
with us every year.

279
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,440
I've never begged anyone in my life,

280
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,480
including my brother.

281
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,520
This time, I'm doing it for you.

282
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,320
Thank you, Mother.

283
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,720
To uproot a corrupted pillar

284
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,640
like the Princess Royal

285
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,400
isn't as simple as I think.

286
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,360
If I hadn't

287
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
revealed my identity
in front of Nanny Duo,

288
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,280
I wouldn't have to be

289
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,320
so cautious now.

290
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,240
You've already done a great job.

291
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,560
Don't blame yourself.

292
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,360
Judging from Her Majesty's attitude,

293
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,520
even if

294
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,000
we present Nanny Duo

295
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,200
to her,

296
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,040
she won't

297
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,280
pit herself against the Princess Royal.

298
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,400
But someone needs
to take the first step somehow.

299
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,960
There are certain things
that have to be done.

300
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,960
I thought Her Majesty

301
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,000
made a good point just now.

302
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,400
What point?

303
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,640
We have to lead our own lives.

304
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,240
We can't just focus on

305
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,280
our fight against the Princess Royal

306
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,160
until we forget about our wedding.

307
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,160
The Office of Ceremonies

308
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,400
will handle the wedding.

309
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,320
They're well-versed and experienced.

310
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,640
Don't tell me

311
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,720
we need to take it to hand.

312
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,200
Have you learned palace etiquette?

313
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,720
It's just a ruse.

314
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,920
Besides,

315
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,000
if I do take it seriously,

316
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,440
I'm sure I can master it quickly.

317
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,520
Have you tried the wedding gown?

318
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,280
No.

319
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,960
What about the furniture
and decoration of my mansion?

320
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,360
You're the future female head there.

321
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,200
Do I need to pick them personally?

322
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,480
But the current furniture
and decoration there

323
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,600
look pretty good to me.

324
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,480
Is that so, huh?

325
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,760
You're just afraid of trouble.

326
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,040
This is our wedding.

327
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,360
It's the most important event

328
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,120
of our lives.

329
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
Of course I hope

330
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,880
that you're happy with the mansion,

331
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,160
the banquet,

332
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,200
and the wedding gown you wear.

333
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,240
Most importantly,

334
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,120
I'm happy with my groom.

335
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,200
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

336
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,040
Your Highness.

337
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,680
I've fasted for three days

338
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,960
and copied this Diamond Sutra

339
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,840
myself.

340
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,040
For birthday gifts,
it's the thought that counts.

341
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,800
[Diamond Sutra]
A sutra?

342
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,400
Aunt never liked

343
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,280
chanting sutras or praying to Buddha.

344
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,200
I'm afraid

345
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,400
she won't like something like this.

346
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,080
Your Highness, what about this?

347
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,560
This is the Tree of Prosperity.

348
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,290
It's a gift
from the Commander of Xiling.

349
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,760
[Crown Princess]
It's a gift
from the Commander of Xiling.

[Crown Princess]

351
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,320
It implies prosperity and fortune.

352
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,480
My dear, I'm afraid you forgot

353
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,120
that we gave her the same gift

354
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,320
three years ago.

355
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,520
This isn't sincere enough.

356
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,320
All of these won't do.

357
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,120
All of you, leave.

358
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,440
Your Highness,

359
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,600
it's just a birthday gift.

360
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,320
If you don't like them,

361
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,840
I can prepare something else.

362
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,440
You don't need to be this nervous.

363
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
How could I not?

364
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,000
After Mother's passing,

365
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,560
Imperial Concubine Xian
tried multiple times

366
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,520
to do me in

367
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,720
so that Zhang could

368
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,160
take my place.

369
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,400
Did you forget about that?

370
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,240
I dare not.

371
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,960
You couldn't take walnuts.

372
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,080
But she mixed

373
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,080
crushed walnuts

374
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,120
into your snacks.

375
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,960
You almost died because of it.

376
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,880
The Princess Royal rescued you

377
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,280
and reported it to His Majesty.

378
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,560
Only then
was Imperial Concubine Xian punished.

379
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,920
That's precisely it.

380
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,640
I'm only able

381
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,720
to retain my position

382
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,000
all because Aunt let go
of the grudge she had against Mother.

383
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,640
Zhang has been competing

384
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,440
with me all these years,

385
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,160
but he never got the upper hand.

386
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:03,840
Why?

387
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,080
It's because Aunt

388
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,760
was supporting me.

389
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,640
Your Highness, you're right.

390
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,200
I'll remember it.

391
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

392
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,200
The Princess Royal's servants
notified us

393
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,280
that she wouldn't be holding

394
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:20,840
a birthday celebration this year.

395
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,360
She's not having one?

396
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,880
But she holds it every year.

397
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,360
I'm sure Mingyue has annoyed her so much

398
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,720
that she's in no mood to hold it.

399
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,080
It's all Jin's fault.

400
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,240
Since that's the case,

401
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,160
Your Highness,

402
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
there's no need
to prepare any birthday gifts.

403
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,600
If she's not holding a celebration,

404
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,600
the gifts have to be extra special.

405
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,640
Forget it.

406
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,600
I'll prepare it myself.

407
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,080
You only remember your aunt's birthday.

408
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,600
But you've already forgotten about

409
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,080

Why is there no one here?

412

Today's her birthday.

413
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,240
Look at how desolate the place is.

is at the pavilion...

Today's your birthday.

418
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,280
Why are you

419
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,800
drinking at the pavilion alone?

420

you're the only person

422
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,640
who remembers my birthday now.

423
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,080
Nonsense.

424
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,400
What about your husband,

I have nothing left.

428
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,880
Cui Xu has left me.

429
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,520
I raised Mingyue in vain.

430
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,680
She argued with me

Of course.

439
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
You wore this

440
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,160
to lure Prince Xiang's rebel army away

441
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,920
back then.

442
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,680

to assume my throne

00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,440
all because you risked your life.

445

Without you,

446
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,400
I'm afraid

447
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,520
Prince Xiang would've been

448
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,000
in my place.

449
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,160
I never regretted it,

for three days and nights.

454
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,720

00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,360
and reorganize my thoughts.

565
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,800
I'll resume
my investigations after that.

566
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,640
To me,

567
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,080
you're capable of anything.

568
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,440
It turns out

569
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,880
that you feel down sometimes.

570
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,440
Of course.

571
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,560
There are two sides

572
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,320
to every person

573
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,040
and every affair.

574
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,280
If there's a bright side,

575
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,880
naturally, there's a dark side.

576
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,440
Your Highness, you're allowed
to leave the palace now.

577
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,920
You've regained your sight too.

578
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,560
Naturally, you can witness

579
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,800
the beauty of the world.

580
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,360
But at the same time,

581
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,720
you'll witness
the unpleasant side of the world.

582
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,080
Your Highness,

583
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,400
if you do encounter that moment,

584
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,880
please do not be afraid.

585
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,440
In my opinion,

586
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,360
any issues

587
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,640
can be resolved

588
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,880
as long as you seek the truth.

589
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,520
What do you think?

590
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,200
Mr. Zhen, everyone said

591
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,520
that you were stubborn and inflexible.

592
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,240
But today,

593
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,480
I've understood you a little better.

594
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,880
You're trying

595
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,600
to change
the unpleasant side of the world

596
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,520
so that everyone

597
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,200
can live happily under the sun.

598
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,400
That's why you have
to be determined and resolute

599
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,400
for you to ward off the shadows.

600
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,560
To me,

601
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,680
the law is the light.

602
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,640
It punishes evil and upholds goodness,
dispelling the shadows in the process.

603
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,280
What is this?

604
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,160
It's actually blinking.

605
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,440
These are fireflies.

606
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,120
I heard that they guide people

607
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,600
during dark nights.

608
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,520
They light themselves up

609
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,760
in order to shine for others.

610
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,520
It can rest on your hand?

611
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,920
You see,

612
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,280
what the heart longs for
will always echo back.

613
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:58,720
Here.

614
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,080
Give it a try.

615
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,560
Where did Mr. Zhen

616
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,920
take Her Highness?

617
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,200
The palace gate is closing soon.

618
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,440
Why isn't she back yet?

You're finally back.

622

Mr. Zhen, it was fun today.

623
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,080
Thank you, Mr. Zhen.

624
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,360
The palace gate will be closed soon.

625
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,840
I shall take Her Highness back.

626
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,400
All right.

this afternoon?

632
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,720
I waited for you for so long.

633
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,280
I broke a porcelain vase.

634
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,120
The shopkeeper wanted
to extort money from me.

635
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,720
He wasn't willing to let me leave.

The imperial decree has arrived!

660
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,120
Prince Yan, Yu Jin, accept the decree!

661
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,480
Prince Yan, Yu Jin,

662
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,200
has virtue and talent,
is diligent and steadfast,

663
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,040
has led the Red Plume Cavalry
to many victories,

664
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,840
and solved numerous cases
in the Capital Administration Office.

665
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,960
He is filial to his parents,

666
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,080
and treats his siblings well.

667
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,880
He left the palace at a young age,

668
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,520
never having the chance
to fulfill his filial duties.

669
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,360
I feel guilty towards him.

670
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,560
Although I've granted Jiang Si,
the daughter of Count of Dongping,

671
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,400
to him as his principal consort,

672
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,080
the Jiang family's status
is not prominent enough.

673
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,720
Therefore, I've selected

674
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,640

675
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,000

The two consorts shall embrace
equal status.
