it's better

14
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,270
to return the betrothal gifts

to Duke An's Mansion

16
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,670
and cancel the engagement.

17
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,840
They've been

18
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,790
used up.

19
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,950
What?

20
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,720
Your branch isn't in charge.

21
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,790
You don't know how much we cost daily.

22
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,510
You've barely had any income these years.

23
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,240
Your son loafs around every day.

24
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,390
Look at everything

25
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,550
in this mansion.

26
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,670
Nothing is free.

27
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,520
Mother went for Buddhist meditation

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,950
in the mountain earlier.

29
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,000
That cost money, too.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,830
- But...
- You don't believe me?

31
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,110
Here are the accounts.

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,320
Show him.

33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,110
Here you are, Master.

34
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,870
The betrothal gifts

35
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,080
are better than nothing.

36
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,440
Your branch has finally
contributed to our mansion.

37
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,710
If you insist

38
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,950
on returning them,

39
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,790
you'll be pushing all of us

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,920
off the cliff

41
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,110
- But...
- into the abyss.

42
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,160
I understand.

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,480
It's not easy to manage

44
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,640
the entire household,

45
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,430
but those gifts are given to Si.

46
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,520
How could you...?

47
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,360
Brother,

48
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,020
are you blaming me?

49

(List of Gifts)

50
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,270
Here's the list of those gifts.

51
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,360
Check the items.

52
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,590
If anything is missing,

53
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,830
make up for the losses.

54
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,270
Then return everything to cancel

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,710
the engagement.

56
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,880
I...

57
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,800
I almost forgot.

58
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,440
This is one of the gifts, too.

59
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,040
Return it as well!

60
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,760
- You...
- It's hard

61
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,060
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)
to manage everything!

62
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,480
I'm so useless.

63
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,880
Don't blame yourself, Father.

64
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,640
I believe

65
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,600
she must've

66
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,040
hidden the gifts somewhere.

67
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,920
I'll figure out a way

68
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,710
to find them.

69
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,600
But I need to

70
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,230
borrow Mother's dowry.

71
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,920
Do my hairpin and pendant

72
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,990
- match?
- Of course.

73
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,670
What about my dress?

74
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,800
Stunning.

75
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,270
I'm going for an outing
with those noble ladies tomorrow.

76
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,830
I cannot be overshadowed by them.

77
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,200
I'll wear this outfit.

78
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,710
Cousin Si.

79
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,200
Greetings, Cousin Pei.

80
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,600
Aman, serve her tea.

81
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,440
Yes.

82
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,640
You seem to be in a good mood,

83
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,440
and you're dressed up.

84
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,520
How come I never saw

85
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,660
you wear such jewelry before?

86
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,680
I'm simply wearing them for fun.

87
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,680
You look nice, too,

88
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,350
although your hairpin

89
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,030
and bracelet

90
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,830
are less classy.

91
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,880
You're gorgeous.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,350
It's a shame

93
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,150
that they don't bring out your beauty.

94
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,950
Don't be so condescending.

95
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,760
I picked the headwear randomly

96
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,030
and threw it on.

97
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,310
The better ones are

98
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,440
kept in my room.

99
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,760
I'm not a show-off

100
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,600
like you.

101
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,670
Is that so?

102
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,470
I doubt it.

103
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,880
If you had better ones,

104
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,320
wouldn't you wear them

105
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,240
and show them off?

106
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,880
You have nothing valuable

107
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,470
and wear those cheap ones instead.

108
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,520
You...

109
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,400
Just you wait.

110
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,800
Miss, where are you going?

111
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,640
Leave me alone!

112
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,310
Aman.

113
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,160
Yes.

114
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,350
Stop rushing me! Come on!

115
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,950
You don't know what to do without me?

116
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,590
I'll return it as soon as I'm done.

117
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,180
(Listen to the Rain)

118
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,200
How did it go, Aman?

119
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,640
Gather some strong servants.

120
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,280
Stop!

121
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,760
How audacious of you!

122
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,390
Who told you to move these out?

123
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,560
How dare you touch the betrothal gifts!

124
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,230
Aunt Xiao,

125
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,320
those gifts belong to our branch.

126
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,800
Now, we're moving them out.

127
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,150
Is there a problem?

128
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,240
We're family.

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,830
Everything in the warehouse

130
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,320
belongs to Earl Dongping's Mansion!

131
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,710
Are you saying

132
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,640
you mean to

133
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,910
hog my betrothal gifts?

134
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,110
Wait.

135
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,100
(Jiang Anmou, Earl Dongping's Brother)
Father said

136
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,350
you had used up

137
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,120
all of them.

138
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,920
He went to great lengths

139
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,910
to buy these to fill the gap.

140
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,880
They have nothing

141
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,000
to do with you.

142
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,440
- Move them.
- I dare you!

143
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,080
Who dares to stop them?

144
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,710
Brother,

145
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,590
I'm glad you're here.

146
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,680
Look at these servants.

147
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,920
Look how wild

148
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,390
and audacious they are.

149
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,470
They're moving things out

150
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,080
from our warehouse.

151
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,240
This is Earl Dongping's Mansion.

152
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,030
After all,

153
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,710
I, Earl Dongping, own it.

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,830
You're only managing the household for now.

155
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,030
I hushed up your branch meaning to

156
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,440
pocket the betrothal gifts,

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,600
but I won't let it slide.

158
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,150
Did you see me

159
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,710
pocketing those gifts?

160
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,470
Don't push me,

161
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,320
or I'll turn nasty!

162
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,160
Mother made me take charge!

163
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,080
She can talk to me!

164
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,630
Enough. Stop arguing.

165
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,750
Calm down, both of you.

166
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,350
Brother,

167
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,830
my wife wants

168
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,990
the best for our mansion.

169
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,750
Now that Brother has decided to

170
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,950
cancel the engagement,

171
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,560
let him go.

172
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,950
Darling.

173
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,590
Brother,

174
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
I have a question, though.

175
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,200
I wonder

176
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,230
if you alone

177
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,040
can cancel

178
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,590
the engagement.

179
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,230
What if Duke An's Mansion disagrees?

180
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,080
The betrothal gifts are a lot.

181
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,630
If we move them back and forth,

182
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,120
won't others

183
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,080
laugh at our two clans?

184
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,110
You do have a point.

185
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:24,950
See?

186
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,560
Nevertheless, I have to return them first.

187
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,520
- Brother...
- Move.

00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,470
we'll be colleagues.

195
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,590
As the Vice Prefect of this office,

196
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,710
I head the East Yamen.

197
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,870
I hear and judge cases

198
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,320
and process paperwork.

199
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,320
You'll head the West Yamen.

200
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,160
Security patrol

201
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,830
and arrest are your duties.

202
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,280
But always remember

203
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,950
to obey the East Yamen

204
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,080
and follow orders.

205
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,630
To facilitate

206
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,080
our cooperation in the future,

207
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,560
I've listed all the things

208
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,520
you should look out for.

209
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,830
This is long.

210
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,920
Sorry for troubling you, Mr. Zhen.

211
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,470
No trouble at all.

212
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,830
Commandant Yu,

213
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,590
I'll break down the rules for you.

214
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,230
The Yamen opens at the Mao hour

215
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,560
and closes before dusk daily.

216
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,710
Absenteeism isn't allowed.

217
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,360
We shall meet

218
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,800
every morning and night

219
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,590
to decide today's work

220
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,110
and discuss the plan for tomorrow.

221
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,280
Sure.

222
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,950
We'll continue later.

223
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,630
(Jiang)
I told Brother

224
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,630
his plan wouldn't work.

225
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,620
We shouldn't return them.

226
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,240
What...?

227
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,710
Who brought these back?

228
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,550
Master,

229
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,960
I think Duke An's Mansion

230
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,990
had them sent back.

231
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,440
We weren't sure what to do

232
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,440
and asked Ms. Xiao to come here.

233
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,550
I had sent them

234
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,800
to Duke An's Mansion.

235
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,110
How come they were moved back?

236
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,320
Send them over again.

237
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,950
Master, their butler said

238
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,350
if you resent them,

239
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,990
they'd bring them back again.

240
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,040
Did they return the gifts?

241
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,630
Sending them back and forth

242
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,440
was a lot of work.

243
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,560
Don't be upset.

244
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,600
This shows that they like Si so much

245
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,240
that they refuse to cancel the engagement.

246
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,510
Young Master Ji

247
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,110
lost his head for the moment.

248
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,670
He'll still marry Si

249
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,830
and treat her well.

250
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,350
Brother.

251
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,870
Our mansion has become

252
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,840
a laughingstock because of you.

253
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,710
Look what you've done.

254
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,870
Servants.

255
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,470
Bring all these back.

256
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,440
Get them out of my sight!

257
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,400
Yes.

258
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,680
You're brilliant, Master.

259
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,630
Brother didn't even

260
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,750
consider his daughter's name.

261
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,550
Darling,

262
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,350
don't fan the flames.

263
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,230
Now that the gifts are back again,

264
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
I'm relieved.

265
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,920
Sir, over here, over here.

266
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,470
Nice view.

267
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,920
Water vitalizes the land.

268
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,400
True. This river links
the Inner and Outer Cities.

269
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,160
You have a dog, too.

270
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,310
Be careful.

271
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,240
Careful.

272
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,280
Good. This house is conveniently located.

273
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,660
(Zaoshu Lane)
He doesn't bite.

274
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,520
That's good.

275
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,400
Earl Dongping's Mansion lies ahead.

276
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,440
This is its north side.

277
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,750
Feel free to look around.

278
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,440
Check out the table, chairs,

279
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,440
and the bed.

280
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,400
They're brand new.

281
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,990
The Outer City is

282
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,230
less safe than the Inner City.

283
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,870
It's good to keep a dog

284
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,950
to guard the house.

285
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,500
(Er'niu, Yu Qi's Army Dog)
Er'niu isn't a pet.

286
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,680
He's a pure army...

287
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,640
Here.

288
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,630
He's a handsome

289
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,040
and majestic treasure.

290
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,880
Yes, a treasure.

291
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,960
The rich and the poor

292
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,830
live separately in town.

293
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,840
Most of the privileged

294
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,680
and powerful figures

295
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,870
dwell in the Inner City.

296
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,950
Sir,

297
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,320
if you aren't strapped for cash,

298
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,560
it's better to

299
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,400
purchase properties in the Inner City.

300
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,630
No, thanks. I'll take this one.

301
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,230
According to the law,

302
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,510
to buy this house,

303
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,080
we have to ask

304
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
the owner's relatives

305
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,680
and the neighbors first.

306
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,110
If they won't buy it,

307
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,080
you can take it.

308
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,040
Go ask them then.

309
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,060
(Jiang)

310
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,080
Only Long Dan and I will live there.

311
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,510
His life will be much easier.

312
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,630
I don't need a servant.

313
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,480
The size of that house

314
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,590
is perfect for you.

315
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,190
- Mr. Yu.
- Miss Jiang.

316
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,990
What house are you talking about?

317
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,350
Mr. Yu will move

318
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,560
into that house on Zaoshu Lane.

319
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,530
He's asking the neighbors

320
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,730
if anyone else wants to buy it.

321
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,710
We're going to

322
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,920
purchase that courtyard.

323
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,120
Others can't

324
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,990
live there.

325
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,830
Wait. When did we decide to...?

326
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,750
I'm sorry, Mr. Yu.

327
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,920
We've long decided

328
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,040
to buy that house

329
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,280
on Zaoshu Lane.

330
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,360
Sorry for the inconvenience.

331
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,070
It's fine.

332
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,350
Name your price, Miss Jiang.

333
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,200
What do you want to give up that house?

334
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,520
Think about it.

335
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,640
Er'niu.

336
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,560
Sorry, he isn't himself today.

337
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,420

Over here.

348
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,190
Sister.

349
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,100
(Ji Chongyi, Duke An's Heir)

350
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,080
We have honorable guests.

351
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,680
No wonder I didn't see others.

352
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,100
Greetings, Duchess An.

353
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,380
(Ms. Wei, Duchess An)

354
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,080
I'm here to apologize.

355
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,920
Please forgive me, Father-in-law.

356
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,990
Stop.

357
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,910
I'm not your father-in-law.

358
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,600
I had the betrothal gifts returned yesterday,

359
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,570
but you didn't take them.

360
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,240
Now that you're here,

361
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,800
go home with them now.

362
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,520
We can't take them back.

363
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,310
Duchess An,

364
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,030
Si was hurt.

365
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,880
It's understandable that her father

366
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,150
is mad.

367
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,990
Chongyi made a mistake.

368
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,040
As his mother, I won't cover for him.

369
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,320
His father has given him physical punishment.

370
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,390
I hope Earl Dongping and Miss Si

371
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,030
can give him another chance.

372
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,040
Give him another chance

373
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,240
to kill my sister again?

374
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,080
Kill her?

375
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,040
Young Master Zhan,

376
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,750
what makes you say that?

377
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,880
Didn't your son tell you

378
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,160
he pushed Si into the river?

379
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,000
Zhan,

380
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,350
don't interrupt when elders speak.

381
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,440
Chongyi, what happened?

382
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,310
It wasn't like that, Mother.

383
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,240
Tell them the truth.

384
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,480
Say it!

385
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,160
Father-in-law,

386
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,680
Miss Si slipped

387
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,590
and fell.

388
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,750
It was an accident.

389
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,070
I have witnesses.

390
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,470
They can vouch for me.

391
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,310
Young Master Zhan,

392
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,680
you can't accuse me of murder

393
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,000
without any proof.

394
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,990
I know my son, Chongyi.

395
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,000
He's a good boy. He'd never

396
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,670
do such evil deeds.

397
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,960
That day, after Miss Si fell,

398
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,070
our whole family was

399
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,150
worried sick,

400
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,520
especially Chongyi.

401
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,360
He insisted on jumping off to find her.

402
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,200
Have a sit, ma'am.

403
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,110
Be seated.

404
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
Brother,

405
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,680
look, he has kneeled down

406
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
and apologized.

407
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,110
Clearly, it's a misunderstanding.

408
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,170
- That's it.
- He insisted on jumping off?

409
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,150
Wasn't he in a rush to check

410
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,000
if I drowned

411
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,990
so that he could

412
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,360
marry his lover?

413
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,200
Si,

414
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,550
you're an unmarried girl.

415
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,670
Watch your mouth.

416
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,040
Miss Si,

417
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,590
I study sages' teachings.

418
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,600
I'd never harm girls.

419
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,880
Not to mention you're

420
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,350
my fiancée.

421
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,720
Trust me, Miss Si.

422
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,070
Once you two get married,

423
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,920
I'll treat you

424
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,070
as my own daughter.

425
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,670
No one can hurt you.

426
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,600
If Chongyi is mean to you,

427
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,560
I'll punish him.

428
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,670
Greetings, Mother.

429
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,670
Chongyi didn't come home again last night?

430
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,560
Your husband doesn't come back,

431
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,440
leaving you alone.

432
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,870
That's your fault. You're useless.

433
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,310
Chongyi keeps going out

434
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,320
simply because you're unattractive.

435
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,760
You should at least learn from others

436
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,960
and dress yourself up.

437
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,870
You're too dull.

438
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,480
I understand.

439
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,040
Have some tea, Mother.

440
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,750
You're coquettishly dressed.

441
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,830
Who are you going to seduce?

442
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,800
Get lost.

443
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,430
Do you hear that, Si?

444
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,120
Your mother-in-law is wonderful.

445
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,440
You'll enjoy a happy marriage for sure.

446
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,830
Am I right, Brother?

447
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,870
If you agree to marry my son,

448
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,150
let's set the wedding day today.

449
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,550
I can't wait to

450
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,190
see you marry my son.

451
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,910
Ms. Wei,

452
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,200
my decision is the same.

453
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,040
No.

454
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,190
I'm being kind enough

455
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,870
to come to your house.

456
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,430
As per the law,

457
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,920
to cancel the engagement,

458
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,240
you'll be flogged 60 times.

459
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,360
Think twice, Miss Si.

460
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,070
Fine. We can

461
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,350
go to the place where justice

462
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,390
will be served by law.

463
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,560
Not only will the engagement be canceled,

464
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,600
but Young Master Ji will also be

465
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,960
guilty of murdering his fiancée

466
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,000
to cover up his affair!

467
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,960
Right!

468
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,910
Miss Si...

469
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,710
Duke An's Mansion isn't afraid

470
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,720
of a humble girl like you.

471
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,110
If you insist on going to court,

472
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,000
we'll see you there.

473
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,280
By the way, Ms. Wei,

474
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,520
bring the betrothal gifts back with you

475
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,150
to spare us the trouble

476
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,390
of sending them again.

477
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,620
Don't argue with them.

478
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,300
We'll settle everything in court.

479
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,200
Sister, do you remember

480
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,480
where exactly he pushed you

481
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,590
into the river?

482
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,480
I need witnesses.

483
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,520
I'm trying to recall

484
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,680
who could've seen him

485
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,760
pushing me off the bridge.

486
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,760
Miss Jiang.

487
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,480
- Mr. Yu.
- Why are you still here?

488
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,750
I meant to negotiate

489
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,480
with you about that house

490
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,240
and stuck around.

491
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,120
Sorry, I overheard your home affairs.

492
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,350
I meant to leave,

493
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,350
but thinking that you might

494
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,470
need my help,

495
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,150
I stayed for a few more minutes.

496
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,800
I need your help?

497
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,190
Who got you out of the water?

498
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,110
You did.

499
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,390
You saved my sister, Mr. Yu?

500
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,630
That was nothing.

501
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,110
Mr. Yu,

502
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,550
you saved

503
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,640
both of us.

504
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,270
Starting today, I, Jiang Zhan...

505
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,880
Mr. Yu, did you also see me

506
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,970
being pushed into the river?

507
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,190
No, actually.

508
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,680
But I know

509
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,000
who might've seen it.

510
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,590
- Who was it?
- Who was it?

511
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,350
About that house...

512
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,830
It's negotiable.

513
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,840
Great!

514
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,160
We're going to be neighbors.

515
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,110
- Right.
- Mr. Yu,

516
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,840
never did I know we'd share

517
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,160
such a deep bond.

518
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,000
Yes, indeed.

519
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,350
Young Master Ji!

520
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,430
Miss Si.

521
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:15,910
Miss,

522
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,240
are you worried about the suit?

523
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,960
Miss,

524
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,630
don't stay up too late.

525
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,030
You almost drowned.

526
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,800
The cold energy remains in your body.

527
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,280
Aman, fetch an umbrella.

528
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,320
It's too late.

529
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,760
Where are you going?

530
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,590
I'm going to see a friend.

531
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,220
(Qiaoxiang Shop)

532
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,820
(Qiaoniang, Owner of Qiaoxiang Shop)

533
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,680
There you are.

534
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,630
I knew you'd come.

535
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,630
I'm glad to see

536
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,560
you're fine.

537
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,800
Did Ji Chongyi go to a tryst

538
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,040
with you that day?

539
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,960
Yes.

540
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,000
How candid.

541
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,480
I'm somewhat surprised.

542
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,080
Thanks to you

543
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,870
I can sell the incense I made

544
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,280
in your shop these years

545
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,190
to earn money

546
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,350
to support my family.

547
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,280
The business was slow back then.

548
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,640
Then the unique incense

549
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,590
you created

550
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,280
swept the city

551
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,760
and saved my shop from bankruptcy.

552
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,630
Taste it.

553
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,630
I made them for you.

554
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,390
It's really good!

555
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,240
What's this?

556
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,670
The key to my shop.

557
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,960
Keep it safe.

558
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,560
When you feel bored at home,

559
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,520
or when you're sad,

560
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,670
come to my shop anytime.

561
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,320
Consider it your second home.

562
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,570
After Qian got married...
Is it for me?

563
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,720
I felt lonely.

564
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,960
You tried everything to cheer me up.

565
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,810
Thanks, Qiaoniang.

566
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:35,760
I knew.
You're the best.

567
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,590
You treated me as your sister.

568
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,800
You're like my best sister, too.

569
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,200
You were like that.

570
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,520
There's no point

571
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,550
in hiding the truth from you anymore.

572
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,360
Among all those kinds of incense here,

573
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,910
which one do you think is made for me?

574
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,800
Let me think about it.

575
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,080
Show Miss Si the most expensive incense

576
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,350
you have here.

577
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,430
My treat.

578
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,360
No, thanks, Young Master Ji.

579
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,310
This Fruit Incense

580
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,470
is nothing expensive,

581
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,680
but tons of scholars

582
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,870
love it.

583
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,750
It's my favorite, too.

584
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,040
It has a pleasant smell,

585
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,040
able to calm the mind.

586
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,320
He can't be trusted.

587
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,960
He doesn't like me, actually.

588
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,840
He hit on me only to use my money

589
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,160
to pay off his gambling debts.

590
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,830
You knew all that?

591
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,590
He thought he played me like a fiddle,

592
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,800
but I simply played along

593
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,910
to climb up the ladder

594
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,560
and attain a higher status.

595
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,520
You wouldn't understand.

596
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,830
My father was at the bottom

597
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,150
of society

598
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,870
and abused to death by the powerful.

599
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,480
After he died,

600
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,800
I swore

601
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,310
not to be a humble

602
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,320
and lowly businesswoman.

603
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,510
When Ji Chongyi

604
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,760
laid eyes on me,

605
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,590
I couldn't run away,

606
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,670
but I didn't want to be his toy either.

607
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,320
I decided to use him

608
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,920
to marry into Duke An's Mansion

609
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,080
and change my life.

610
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,720
How silly, Qiaoniang!

611
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,070
You were jumping into the abyss.

612
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,930
Businesswomen

613
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,320
struggle in the abyss every day.

614
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,790
We're always

615
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,200
criticized and judged

616
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,270
by countless decent people.

617
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,310
The more money we make,

618
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,720
the more we're blamed.

619
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,000
In terms of marriage,

620
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,510
businesswomen

621
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,640
won't be accepted

622
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,620
by families of officials.

623
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,720
Businessmen also despise us.

624
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,350
They won't marry us either.

625
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,480
Those poor scholars

626
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,360
only sweet-talk us

627
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,630
into giving them money.

628
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,960
Once they become officials,

629
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,800
they'll abandon us

630
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,080
and divorce us.

631
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,910
I didn't mean to jump into the abyss.

632
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,720
I simply chose the most rewarding one

633
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,960
among all of them.

634
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,110
I'm not marrying Ji Chongyi

635
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,000
but his powerful clan!

636
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,870
Only in that way

637
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,440
can I secure a bright future

638
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,480
for my child.

639
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,880
He'll be of noble birth

640
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,670
and won't be abused by the powerful.

641
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,280
Child?

642
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,870
Are you pregnant?

643
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,130
Your mother's family was
the richest in Lingshui.

644
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,000
Even she chose to bring a fortune

645
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,840
to marry an earl

646
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,790
because

647
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,840
her children would be of noble birth.

648
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,480
Their future could be expected.

649
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,550
You want to use that baby

650
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,090
to gain a foothold in Duke An's Mansion,

651
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,400
but how can you be sure

652
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,840
it's a boy?

653
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,520
If it's a boy, that'd be the best.

654
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,150
If not,

655
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,670
I'll give birth to twins.

656
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,760
A boy and a girl.

657
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,960
You've even planned that out.

658
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,630
Only if I can cross the threshold

659
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,080
will my and my baby's status

660
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,960
become more secure.

661
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:37,390
Sorry, I betrayed you, Si.

662
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,260
(Earl Dongping's Mansion)

663
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
What? Cancel it?

664
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,200
(Lady Jiang, Earl's Mother)
Yes, Grandmother.

665
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,160
I only meditated

666
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,400
in the mountain for half a month.

667
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,320
Is Si going to turn our house upside down?

668
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,270
I tried to change her mind over and over

669
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,360
until my throat hurt.

670
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,590
But she had no respect for me

671
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,520
at all

672
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,320
and threatened to go to court.

673
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,350
Is she going to turn a joyful event

674
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,520
into a suit?

675
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,150
Grandmother,

676
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,000
Si also

677
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,040
slapped my mother.

678
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,830
Don't bring that up.

679
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,390
It was humiliating.

680
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,960
But that girl was

681
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,310
so heartless

682
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,520
as to hurt her family.

683
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,080
My face still hurts.

684
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,430
That girl was

685
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,920
way out of line.

686
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,720
How wildly audacious of her!

687
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,310
Fu, go now.

688
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,800
Fetch Si.

689
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,190
Yes, My Lady.

690
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,070
Have some tea, Grandmother.

691
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,910
Don't be mad.

692
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,350
My Lady,

693
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,550
the maid in her chamber said

694
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,750
she didn't feel well.

695
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,710
She's still sleeping.

696
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,550
What?

697
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,840
Look what time it is.

698
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,960
Is she still in bed?

699
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,800
See, Grandmother?

700
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,670
Xiao,

701
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,960
is this how you manage the household?

702
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,430
I'm incompetent, Mother.

703
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,800
But ever since she

704
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,790
fell into the river,

705
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,110
she has become a different person.

706
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,830
She's been so wild

707
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,110
as if she's given herself up.

708
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,200
How did Ancheng

709
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,870
discipline his daughter?

710
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,400
Forget about him.

711
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,510
When Si stirred up trouble,

712
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,750
he didn't stop her

713
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,470
but went to Duke An's Mansion

714
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,920
to cancel the engagement himself.

715
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,230
He claimed

716
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,630
that he wouldn't give up until he

717
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,100
received the Letter of Annulment.

718
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,520
Let's go.

719
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,190
I'd like to see

720
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,240
how sick Si is

721
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,480
that she can't

722
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,150
get out of bed!

723
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:51,180
(Peace)

724
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,600
My Lady, Ms. Xiao,

725
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,440
Miss Pei.

726
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,600
Grandmother just returned from the mountain.

727
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,960
She missed Si

728
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,150
and had her maid fetch her.

729
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,350
She was perfectly fine

730
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,710
to cancel her engagement yesterday.

731
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,190
How come she's too sick to get up now?

732
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,670
She had almost drowned

733
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,320
and then caught a cold yesterday.

734
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,510
That's why...

735
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,680
Let me check on her, I insist.

736
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,750
Wait. Stop, Miss Pei!

737
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,590
Miss Pei...

738
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,160
Aman, Pei is here.

739
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,230
Why didn't you tell me?

740
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,430
What's this?

741
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,960
I felt cold from top to bottom

742
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,590
and had a foot bath with ginger water.

743
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,640
- Mother!
- It's fine. Calm down.

744
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,040
Welcome back, Grandmother.

745
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,040
Mother.

746
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,040
Kneel!

747
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,560
(I kneeled too many times before.)

748
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,920
(I foolishly believed)

749
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,160
(if I got down on my knees,)

750
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,200
(problems would be solved.)

751
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,240
Si,

752
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,560
do you know

753
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,790
how many people envy

754
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,480
your engagement with Duke An's heir?

755
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,160
Your two married cousins will gain

756
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,360
more respect from our in-laws.

757
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,630
Over the past year,

758
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,990
those who have come

759
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,480
to propose to your third cousin

760
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,510
are of a much higher class.

761
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,480
The truth is

762
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,750
they're eager

763
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,150
to form a link with Duke An's Mansion.

764
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,390
How short-sighted.

765
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,430
What was that?

766
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,830
Nothing.

767
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,240
I understand, Grandmother.

768
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,080
You look more obedient

769
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,430
when your grandmother is back.

770
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,110
Well then,

771
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,440
let's

772
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,320
apologize to Duke An's Mansion

773
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,430
and proceed with the marriage.

774
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,190
Fine. It's all up to you, Aunt Xiao.

775
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,310
Grandmother, may I

776
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,350
get up now?

777
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,430
Don't move.

778
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,550
Look how much trouble

779
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,680
you've stirred up,

780
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,240
causing unnecessary conflicts
between the two clans.

781
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,270
Kneel there to reflect on yourself

782
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,240
for two hours.

783
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,630
Be careful, Mother.

784
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,120
You said she had changed after that incident.

785
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,080
But to me, she seems the same as before.

786
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,320
Perhaps I thought too much.

787
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,720
Flog her.

788
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,200
Do it!

789
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
Don't! Stop!

790
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,680
- Zhan!
- Grandmother!

791
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,640
I dare you to shield her!

792
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,280
Please think twice, Mother.

793
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,310
Ji Chongyi

794
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,150
pushed Si into the river.

795
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,280
He's not a good man!

796
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,520
Don't be silly, Brother.

797
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,200
He's Duke An's heir.

798
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,120
It's so lucky of you

799
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,280
to marry your daughter up to him.

800
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,150
Don't nitpick.

801
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,400
Si represents

802
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,960
the entire Jiang Clan.

803
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,520
If the lineal daughter

804
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,830
is so selfish

805
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,240
as to file a suit

806
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
to cancel her engagement,

807
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,310
she'll

808
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,160
bring shame on our whole clan

809
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,070
and ruin our name!

810
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,480
- You...
- You're right.

811
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,990
Si is being unruly

812
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,030
and acting without scruple.

813
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,510
I won't tolerate that.

814
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,780
What does Earl Dongping's Mansion

815
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,760
value the most?

816
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,960
Our name!

817
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,310
I won't allow anyone

818
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,510
to tarnish it!

819
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,870
- But...
- What?

820
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,150
Duke An's Mansion is at fault.

821
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,870
Once she marries the heir,

822
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,360
his family will make it up to her.

823
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,230
They won't mistreat her.

824
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,150
What exactly is the problem?

825
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,990
Grandmother,

826
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,400
Si refuses to marry him.

827
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,990
Could you please not push her?

828
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,720
What? Are you on her side?

829
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,840
Flog them both!

830
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,680
Yes.

831
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,280
Father!

832
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,560
Do it!

833
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,670
Father!

834
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,040
Ancheng.

835
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,550
Enough, Grandmother!

836
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,550
Please stop!

837
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,470
I'll marry him!

838
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,320
I'll marry Ji Chongyi!

839
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,160
Stop.

840
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,710
Brother!

841
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,270
Brother!

842
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,520
Miss, Miss!

843
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,480
(Morning Drizzle)
You had meant to cancel

844
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,880
your engagement in court.

845
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,670
Just now, in front of Lady Jiang,

846
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,920
you said it was all up to Ms. Xiao

847
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,270
to proceed with the marriage.

848
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,670
What were you thinking?

849
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,920
We'll still go to court,

850
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,200
but

851
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,880
we have to be discreet.

852
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,960
Grandmother can't know before it happens.

853
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,520
(Court)
Send in the drummer!

854
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,870
Your Honor,

855
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,080
I'm filing a suit.

856
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,280
Take her paper.

857
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,520
Granted.

858
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,150
The hearing will be held later.

859
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,710
Who exactly saw me fall into the river?

860
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,030
I have a question.

861
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,960
Do you mind

862
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,400
enlightening me first?

863
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,560
What is it?

864
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,190
I saved your life

865
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,070
and then volunteered to help you

866
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,230
find the witnesses.

867
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,590
I didn't ask for any return

868
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,310
or offend you, did I?

869
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,870
No.

870
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,320
Why did you keep pushing me away

871
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,760
from your neighborhood?

872
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,750
Am I such an eyesore?

873
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,440
I also have a question for you.

874
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,190
In all of Ling'an,

875
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,270
among all those houses,

876
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,510
why pick the one

877
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,040
right next to our mansion?

878
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,110
Because your brother and I

879
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,590
bonded straight away.

880
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,750
I think he also wants me

881
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,280
to live closer to him

882
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,750
so that we can see each other often.

883
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,630
My brother's always been

884
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,280
kind and friendly.

885
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,150
He's nice to everyone.

886
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,000
He has so many friends

887
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,480
but forgets them quickly.

888
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,190
Don't take such a bond

889
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,590
too seriously.

890
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,000
You know what?

891
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,400
I happen to adore

892
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,150
carefree men like him.

893
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,630
Hearing what you just said,

894
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,420
I want to be his neighbor even more.

895
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,150
Stop beating around the bush.

896
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,470
Who are the witnesses?

897
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,480
If you don't know,

898
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,670
then stop wasting my time.

899
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,280
This matter is too important.

900
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,230
Don't fool me.

901
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,000
I know, of course.

902
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,230
See? They're the witnesses.

903
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,590
They're right across the place

904
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,000
where you fell.

905
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,320
(Wonton)
Others might not have seen you,

906
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,230
but they

907
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,240
certainly did.

908
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,230
(Cancel the engagement,)

909
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,520
(then I can start all over again, right?)

910
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,590
(This time,)

911
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,740

Ji Chongyi,

920
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,150
Jiang Si accused you of attempted murder.

921
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,190
How do you plead?

922
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,080
Not guilty, Your Honor.

923
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,920
That was an accident.

924
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,630
I think that girl slipped

925
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,360
and fell into the water.

926
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,440
I heard someone else

927
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,440
gave her family

928
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,360
more betrothal gifts.

929
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,960
That's why they're suing Duke An's heir.

930
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,080
Was she promised to two families?

931
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,670
- Nonsense!
- Yes, that's right.

932
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,800
That's not true.

933
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,570
- Were you sent by the defendant?
- Who's he?

934
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,840
Your Honor,

935
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,150
I have witnesses.

936
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,750
Send them in.

937
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,310
- Send them in!
- Send them in!

938
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,060
(Guard the State and People)

939
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,030
Master,

940
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,710
say something!

941
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,080
Other things aside,

942
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,360
should we

943
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,310
try to buy Mr. Zhen over?

944
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,110
What's your decision?

945
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,590
Others can be bought over,

946
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,990
(Duke An)

947
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,560
but Zhen Heng of Capital Security

948
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,280
is too rigid and stubborn.

949
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,710
He won't be swayed by anyone.

950
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,000
Sometimes even His Majesty

951
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,880
has to compromise.

952
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,670
That's why

953
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,110
he's got the hardest job

954
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,960
to be the Vice Prefect

955
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,590
of Capital Security.

956
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,110
Your name.

957
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,000
Wang Dongsheng, Your Honor.

958
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,790
Occupation.

959
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,880
I'm a waiter at a wonton shop.

960
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:43,800
Answer my question.

961
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,400
What

962
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,590
did you see that night?

963
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,520
I was by the river,

964
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,110
but it was too dark.

965
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
I barely saw anything.

966
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,150
You're in court.

967
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,400
Do not lie.

968
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,880
What exactly did you see?

969
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,210
I didn't get a good look.

970
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,820
(Ji Chongli, Ji Chongyi's Brother)

971
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,110
But I've

972
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,560
said in public

973
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,750
Young Master Ji pushed Miss Si.

974
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,840
I heard

975
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,150
your mother is

976
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,630
old and lame.

977
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,080
What do you want?

978
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,960
It was too dark that night.

979
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,790
You barely saw anything.

980
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,280
Jiang Si,

981
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,110
what do you have to say?

982
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,080
Your Honor,

983
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,360
I have another witness,

984
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,400
the owner of an artwork shop, Song Lin.

985
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,230
Greetings, Your Honor.

986
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,150
I did see Miss Si

987
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,270
fall into the river,

988
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,110
but

989
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,750
she slipped and fell.

990
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,160
Song Lin,

991
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,360
did you see it clearly?

992
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,110
Yes, Your Honor.

993
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,270
I got a good look at what happened.

994
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,710
You two may leave.

995
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,520
Yes, Your Honor.

996
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,110
Looks like someone

997
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,880
pushed me into the water

998
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,590
and suborned the witnesses.

999
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,040
It was dark and slippery.

1000
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,630
Their view might've been affected.

1001
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,710
Great wits have short memories, huh?

1002
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,440
I held a lantern that night.

1003
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,150
If it could shine a light

1004
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,400
on your dirty business,

1005
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,110
it could certainly light up the path.

1006
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,520
You're lying!

1007
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,920
Your Honor, we did bicker.

1008
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,920
Miss Si

1009
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,270
lost her temper,

1010
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,400
and she somehow

1011
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,840
fell into the river.

1012
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,150
Miss Si,

1013
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,710
I know you're mad at me,

1014
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,720
but you cannot lie

1015
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,360
to frame me in court.

1016
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,720
Your Honor, what's the sentence

1017
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,880
for a frame-up?

1018
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,440
Your Honor, I have one more witness.

1019
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,480
Who else?

1020
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,750
The girl Ji Chongyi dated that night,

1021
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,230
Qiaoniang.

1022
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,510
Right.

1023
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,110
She was the closest person

1024
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,040
to the scene.

1025
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,680
Guards.

1026
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,590
Send Sun Qiaoniang in.

1027
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,150
Send Qiaoniang in!

1028
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,150
I, Sun Qiaoniang, greet you,

1029
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,920
Your Honor.

1030
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,750
Sun Qiaoniang,

1031
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,150
answer my question.

1032
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,320
Did Ji Chongyi push Jiang Si

1033
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,310
into the river?

1034
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:55,110
Qiaoniang, tell the truth.

1035
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,880
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

1036
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:05,100
