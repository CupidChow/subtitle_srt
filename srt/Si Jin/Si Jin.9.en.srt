[Count of Dongping's Mansion]

13
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,410
Old Madam.

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,280
I heard about the celebration.

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,490
I wasn't invited,

16
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,440
but I feel happy for you.

17
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,610
I've prepared a small gift

18
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,800
as a token of goodwill.

19
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,330
May you be blessed with great fortune

20
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,440
and enduring longevity.

21
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,000
Much appreciated.

22
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,930
This celebration was merely

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,690
an excuse for me

24
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,570
to bring the family together

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,520
for a reunion.

26
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,690
I didn't expect you
and Mr. Zhen would come.

27
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,690
It's such a delightful surprise.

28
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,160
Mr. Zhen.

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,050
I'd love to have a chance

30
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,680
to properly thank you.

31
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,840
Our family has faced

32
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,930
a trying time recently.

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,800
But we made it through, thanks to
the Capital Administration Office.

34
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:12,610
Old Madam.

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,080
You are most welcome.

36
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,640
Ensuring societal peace

37
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,960
has always been

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,680
our duty.

39
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,010
I merely did my job

40
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,730
and solved the case.

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,520
Mr. Zhen has a righteous heart.

42
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,450
It's a blessing

43
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,560
for the people of Ling'an.

44
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,770
I'm flattered.

45
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,960
Much obliged.

46
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,680
When I entered the mansion,

47
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,210
the whole place

48
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,290
was so lively.

49
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,520
You have such a flourishing family.

50
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,240
I couldn't help but envy you.

51
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,360
Well, at my age,

52
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,290
having a house full of children
is a great blessing.

53
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,240
Indeed.

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
The young ladies are all
well-mannered and educated.

55
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,170
Their poise is outstanding,

56
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,010
especially Miss Si.

57
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,610
How so?

at the Marquis of Changxing's Mansion

some time ago

61
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,490
was truly terrifying.

62
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,210
Miss Si made it out alive

63
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,400
and saved her sister.

64
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,610
I certainly pity

65
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,520
Miss Qian

66
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,330
for being part of this.

67
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:08,960
Mother.

68
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,560
Miss Si is so brilliant and courageous,

69
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,400
all thanks to your teaching,

70
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,560
Old Madam.

71
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,640
Indeed.

72
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,050
As her aunt,

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,930
I am grateful for Miss Si.

74
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,329
Without her,

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,890
Qian would still

76
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,930
be living

77
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,520

78

by your side.

81
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:38,840
You are right.

82
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,329
Qian can always

83
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,770
count on me,

84
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,360
unlike Miss Si

85
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,840
who grew up without a mother.

86
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,520
She lost her mother?

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,960
Yes.

88
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,210
Her mother passed away
as soon as she was born.

89
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,240
Everyone thinks she jinxed...

90
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,400
Poor girl.

91
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,890
She grew up to be remarkable

92
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,890
even without her mother to guide her.

93
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,730
Members of your family

94
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,240
are truly gifted.

95
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,800
Why would the Duke of Anguo

96
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,120
cancel the engagement

97
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,200
with her?

98
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,610
It's their loss for sure.

99
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,050
Old Madam,

100
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,529
I wonder if Miss Si has found

101
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,730
a new suitor?

102
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,360
Not that I know of.

103
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,649
After all,

104
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,650
great men
are hard to come by these days.

105
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,410
Only a handful of them
can be as remarkable

106
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,530
as Mr. Zhen.

107
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,090
You're too kind, Old Madam.

108
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,610
It's the Old Madam's birthday.

109
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,800
Miss Qian specially prepared

110
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,050
fine pieces of jewelry

111
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,290
for Miss Pei.

112
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,610
What's the meaning of this?

113
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,680
Miss Pei says

114
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,120
gifts from the Marquis' family

115
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,290
bring bad luck.

116
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,360
She doesn't want them.

117
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,320
Show some respect!

118
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,560
When Miss Qian

119
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,610
was the Marquis' daughter-in-law,

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,090
Miss Pei was always eager

121
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,320
to take all the gifts

122
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
for herself.

123
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,120
But now she acts like this.

124
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,440
You're right.

125
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,880
Things are different now.

126
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,050
The Marquis' son got a death sentence.

127
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,120
Miss Qian got a divorce

128
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,120
and came home.

129
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,240
She was abandoned.

130
00:04:59,290 --> 00:04:59,880
It's no surprise though.

131
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,850
Miss Qian was cruel and evil.

132
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,930
She invited her sisters and cousins

133
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,090
to the jaws of danger.

134
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,320
Speaking of which,

135
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,440
it was all thanks to Miss Si.

136
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,680
If it weren't for her,

137
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,490
Miss Pei

138
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,610
might have become a victim too.

139
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,850
You lowly maid.

140
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,650
How audacious of you.

141
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,090
You dare badmouth your master.

142
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,730
Madam Xiao, I'm sorry.

143
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,000
I won't do it again.

144
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,050
Listen up.

145
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,360
Even though my daughter got a divorce,

146
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,610
she is still the most distinguished lady

147
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,560
in this family.

148
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,050
Madam Xiao, I'm sorry.

149
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,650
Madam Xiao, please have mercy on me.

150
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,090
Madam Xiao.

151
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:27,610
Nanny Li.

152
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Lock her in the storeroom.

153
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,880
Starve her for a few days.

154
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,730
She must know

155
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,760
her place in this house.

156
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,530
Please have mercy on me.

157
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,170
Where's Jiang Pei?

158
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,240
I haven't seen her lately.

159
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,090
She hasn't greeted me properly

160
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,000
and is disrespectful.

161
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,610
Ground her for two weeks.

162
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,760
Let her reflect on her mistakes.

163
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,170
Old Madam.

164
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,320
From what I know,
the Zhen family doesn't have

165
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,930
much influence in the capital.

166
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,800
What would you know?

167
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,200
Each noble family is different

168
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,560
in its own way.

169
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,970
Some noble families

170
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,000
are influential

171
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,970
in the imperial court.

172
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,930
People yearn to be
part of those families.

173
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,880
But the Count of Dongping's Mansion,

174
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,290
distant from court affairs

175
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,880
and merely receiving a fixed stipend

176
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,050
pales in comparison

177
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,560
to an official who wields

178
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,880
real power in court.

179
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:16,930
Zhen Heng...

180
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,410
Zhen Heng

181
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,760
is the Deputy Magistrate.

182
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,170
He has both real power in his hands

183
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,880
and His Majestys's favor

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,560
on his side.

185
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,360
He has a bright and promising future.

186
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,610
It sounds like

187
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,000
Miss Si

188
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,360
is truly fortunate.

189
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,490
Her mother passed away

190
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,290
not long

191
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,610
after giving birth to her.

192
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,680
Her father lost his job.

193
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,440
Our title was cut off

194
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,560
after only three generations.

195
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,360
The birthday banquets

196
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,760
of the past

197
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,440
were grand and magnificent,

198
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,120
nothing like
the modest celebrations of today.

199
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:03,800
Grandmother.

200
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,850
You asked for me.

201
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,050
Si,

202
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,760
sit next to me.

203
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,970
Si.

204
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,240
Mr. Zhen and his mother came by today

205
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,320
to send me their regards.

206
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,650
As you know,

207
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
our family has gone through

208
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,090
a very trying time.

209
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,930
We made it through,
thanks to Mr. Zhen's help.

210
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:27,880
Today,

211
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,880
make sure you take care of Madam Zhen

212
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,409
the best you can.

213
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:33,970
Is that clear?

214
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,490
Understood.

215
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,170
This color

216
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,680
is too eye-catching.

217
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,320
The color

218
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:52,360
of that hairpin you're wearing
is too plain.

219
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm picking you a better one.

220
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,440
Maybe this one.

221
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,170
I wore this hairpin

222
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,930
when I was married into this mansion.

223
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,610
It's festive.

224
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,800
Grandmother, I...

225
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,730
Keep it.

226
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,530
Thank you, Grandmother.

227
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,650
Afu.

228
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,090
Ask the steward

229
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,290
to buy some more fabrics.

230
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,760
Si,

231
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,850
go ahead and pick some fine fabrics.

232
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,410
Get yourself a couple of new outfits.

233
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,800
And remember,

234
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,130
you will also need

235
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,250
new accessories.

236
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:30,770
Zhenbao Jewelry Store.

237
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,409
Browse around at the store.

238
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,770
They have some pretty ones.

239
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,320
Buy some for yourself.

240
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,130
Keep it on the mansion's tab.

241
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,049
Thank you, Grandmother.

242
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:42,929
Qian?

243
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,370
Qian?

244
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:49,890
This girl...

245
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,840
She drank so much again.

246
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,800
Qian?

247
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,010
Qian, stop intoxicating yourself.

248
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,600
Mother, you're back.

249
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,320
Look at this.

250
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,050
Is this letter of divorce real?

251
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,370
Is Cao Xingyu

252
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,720
really not my husband anymore?

253
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,560
He won't abuse me again, right?

254
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,530
My dear daughter,

255
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,960
you've read this letter

256
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,800
countless times

257
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,080
over the past few days.

258
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,370
It's all written clearly

259
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,770
in black and white.

260
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,200
There is no need to fear anymore.

261
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,770
That cursed pervert

262
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:33,840
will be executed after autumn.

263
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,440
That's wonderful, Mother!

264
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,320
Liquor! Let me drink!

265
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:39,890
Stop drinking.

266
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,410
I want to drink my fill.

267
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,680
Qian, stop drinking.

268
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,530
Silly girl.

269
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,680
Do you want

270
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,600
to ruin your future
by drinking your life away?

271
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,600
It's not worth it

272
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,890
over an animal who abused you

273
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,170
every day of your life.

274
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,080
My future?

275
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,720
I am a divorced woman.

276
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,320
No one in this family

277
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,560
respects me.

278
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,960
What future do I have?

279
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,800
What's wrong with being divorced?

280
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,050
Empress Jiahui was also

281
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,050
divorced and returned
to her maiden family.

282
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,600
Then, she ascended
to the position of Empress,

283
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,370
second only to His Majesty.

284
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:28,840
Qian.

285
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,250
I know

286
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,770
you're in pain, both physically

287
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,290
and emotionally.

288
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,800
But we mustn't lose hope

289
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,130
because of an unfortunate

290
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,050
and failed marriage.

291
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,890
If we plan well and do our best,

292
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,770
you can still

293
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,930
have a wonderful life.

294
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,290
When the day comes,

295
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:52,930
you will still be

296
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,560
the granddaughter

297
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,720
Old Madam is most proud of
in our family.

298
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,320
Mother.

299
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,960
Do you mean it?

300
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,840
I promise you

301
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,720
everything will be better.

302
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,800
Come on, stand up.

303
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,290
If you behave yourself

304
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,290
and stop being an alcoholic,

305
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,010
you will have

306
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,600
an even better life

307
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,410
than Jiang Si.

308
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,050
Jiang Si...

309
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:40,800
Mother.

310
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,370
Do you hold a grudge against her?

311
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,890
I wouldn't have escaped

312
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,170
without her help.

313
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
She's even been

314
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,930
visiting me.

315
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,440
She is

316
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,770
much kinder

317
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,130
than Jiang Pei who kicks me
when I'm down.

318
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,650
Why am I grounded?

319
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:04,530
I can't even

320
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,530
attend the banquet now.

321
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,770
Madam Ruan, what should I do now?

322
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,320
I'm hoping to have my mother

323
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,370
fix me up with Mr. Zhen

324
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,200
at the birthday banquet.

325
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,480
Pei.

326
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,010
Miss Qian gave you

327
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,530
the jewelry and fine fabric

328
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,840
out of generosity.

329
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,370
As I said,

330
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,440
you should accept them,

331
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,320
even if you don't need them.

332
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,930
Why did you return them?

333
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,320
Those gifts bring bad luck.

334
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,170
At least I returned them

335
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,200
instead of setting them on fire.

336
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,320
You'll get into trouble if you

337
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,290
don't control your temper.

338
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,170
Madam Xiao is

339
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,200
only your legal mother.

340
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,010
Of course, she'll give you a hard time

341
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,600
now that you've offended Miss Qian.

342
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,480
Jiang Pei is foolish.

343
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,680
She fusses over small things

344
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,250
and fails to see the big picture.

345
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,930
Her thoughts are written

346
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,480
all over her face.

347
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,720
Even a fool can see that.

348
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,370
But Jiang Si is different.

349
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,250
She is a master schemer.

350
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,600
She puts up

351
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,200
a harmless and innocent look,

352
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,960
but she is capable of outrageous things.

353
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,080
She called off the engagement,
reported the crime to the authorities,

354
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,250
and talked you into divorcing.

355
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,530
Jiang Pei could never

356
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,680
have done any of these things.

357
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,440
Qian has trouble sleeping.

358
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,170
I want to make a soothing incense

359
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:09,930
for her to try.

360
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,650
Madam Xiao and Miss Qian

361
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,530
treat you badly.

362
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,650
Why bother?

363
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:14,890
I pity Qian

364
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,440
because she had no choice.

365
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,170
Aman, we must never

366
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,410
dwell too much

367
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,370
on the past.

368
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,080
You'd only live in the past

369
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,770
and never move forward.

370
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,320
But in any case,

371
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,840
she helped me.

372
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,080
Helped you?

373
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,200
She is hoping

374
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,720
to benefit from your misfortune.

375
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,600
With you facing hardship,

376
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,370
our branch is engulfed
in gloom and misery.

377
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,130
But the main branch

378
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,840
is having the best time of their life.

379
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,480
You probably don't know this yet.

380
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,010
She used your misfortune

381
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,560
as a way to earn

382
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,290
Deputy Magistrate Zhen Heng's favor.

383
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,600
What?

384
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,600
You are too young

385
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,530
to understand certain things.

386
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,650
Keep in mind

387
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,800
that it's a zero-sum game
for the two branches.

388
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,600
If Jiang Si gains the advantage,

389
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,290
even I will find it hard

390
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,010
to overcome her cunningness.

391
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,320
You need not worry.

392
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,560
Zhen Heng shouldn't worry you.

393
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,010
From what I've heard,

394
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,410
he is not a people person.

395
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,410
He got on the bad side
of most of the noble families

396
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,930
in this city.

397
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,200
His career looks grim.

398
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,650
He is over 25,

399
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,080
but still unmarried.

400
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,170
These are superficial.

401
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,840
I asked around.

402
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,600
Zhen Heng is known to be upright
among civil officials.

403
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,370
He was appointed

404
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,600
by His Majesty personally.

405
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,170
On the surface, His Majesty
pays him no attention,

406
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,200
but he is actually training
and promoting him

407
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,800
so he can serve in the imperial court

408
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,480
as a Grand Chancellor.

409
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,130
If Jiang Si actually becomes the wife

410
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,410
of the next Grand Chancellor,

411
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,250
the second branch is as good

412
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,680
as doomed.

413
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,890
This can't be allowed.
We need a plan.

414
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,130
She must never marry Zhen Heng.

415
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,320
Jiang Si is vying for Mr. Zhen too?

416
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,410
I may not be your birth mother,

417
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,530
but you are my daughter.

418
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,840
Qian has no hope of marrying him.

419
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,800
I was hoping you could.

420
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,370
What a shame.

421
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,770
Mother.

422
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,320
Figure something out for me.

423
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,200
Mother.

424
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,480
I was in the wrong before.

425
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,840
Punish me however you like.

426
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,250
Please help me out this time.

427
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,130
Please, Mother.

428
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,530
I beg of you, Mother.

429
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,200
Well,

430
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,290
I do have a plan.

431
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,960
But I'm not sure

432
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,200
if you dare to try it.

433
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,270
[Birthday]

434
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,270
[Jiang]

435
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:39,930
You may leave now.

436
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,130
Madam Zhen, take a seat.

437
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,170
Mr. Zhen.

438
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,170
Miss Jiang.

439
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,370
Let me introduce you.

440
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,720
This is my mother.

441
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,410
Miss Si, we meet again.

442
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:08,609
Si,

443
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,170
when did you and Madam Zhen meet?

444
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,650
My niece from my maternal family

445
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,680
is arriving soon.

446
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:14,440
I'd like to prepare

447
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,930
two welcome gifts.

448
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,440
Greetings, Madam Zhen.

449
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,329
Mother, when did you
and Miss Jiang meet?

450
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,569
Fate brought us together.

451
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,930
Your banquet is truly lively!

452
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:28,810
We have a big family.

453
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,720
Uncle Anmou.

454
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,650
This is...?

455
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,680
This is Commandant Yu
from the Capital Administration Office.

456
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,650
A dear friend of mine.

457
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,810
You are Zhan's friend.

458
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,240
Welcome.

459
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:43,650
Let's go.

460
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,850
Mr. Zhen

461
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,240
is always

462
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,440
hovering around my sister.

463
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,170
How shameless!

464
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,200
Just seeing it makes me furious!

465
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:55,810
Yes.

466
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,610
Why are you furious?

467
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,570
I share your fury.

468
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,130
My dearest friend.

469
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,040
With this opportunity,

470
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,570
I raise a toast

471
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,440
to all of you.

472
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,650
Let's all celebrate together.

473
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,570
With harmony comes prosperity.
May all the fortune gather here.

474
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:17,960
Cheers!

475
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,410
Mother.

476
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Si is the fragrance expert

477
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,930
in our family.

478
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,090
This is your birthday celebration.

479
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,930
We should ask her to light
some incense for you.

480
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,570
Sure. Great idea.

481
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,570
Having Si around

482
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,040
means we won't have to rely

483
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,480
on the Four Divisions and Six Bureaus

484
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,370
for future family banquets.

485
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,960
Grandmother, given it's your birthday,

486
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,680
the incense shall be your present.

487
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,480
I hope the fragrant scent

488
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,570
can bring joy to you

489
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,720
and all our guests.

490
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,680
This is the Eight Steps to Intoxication.

491
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,850
It's colorless and odorless,

492
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,850
yet potent enough
to render one completely drunk.

493
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,440
If Jiang Si were to get drunk

494
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,330
in front of everyone,

495
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,610
who knows what disgraceful things
she might do?

496
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,170
Then, she will blow her chance

497
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,440
with Mr. Zhen.

498
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,810
Pei,

499
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,760
this is

500
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,680
the golden opportunity.

501
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,040
I gave my all to plan this for you.

502
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,720
Don't mess it up.

503
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,440
This scent is truly marvelous.

504
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,570
Ladies, children,

505
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,520
gather around.

506
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,650
Come here.

507
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,760
Come and smell this incense.

508
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,760
This scent is exquisite.

509
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:21,330
Come.

510
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,890
Girls, have a sniff. Come on.

511
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,240
My sister made this. It's incredible!

512
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,890
Look at the sky lighting up.

513
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,760
All right, my children.

514
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,930
You may return to your seats.

515
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,960
What an amazing scent.

516
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,520
Simply remarkable.

517
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:53,440
Si...

518
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,810
Where is Si?

519
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:57,810
Where's Jiang Si?

520
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,890
Commandant Yu is gone too.

521
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,760
Did the two of them

522
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,280
run away together?

523
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,040
Please stop spewing nonsense.

524
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,890
Madam Zhen, Mr. Zhen,

525
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,480
my apologies.

526
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,130
Zhan.

527
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,280
Commandant Yu is your friend, isn't he?

528
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,130
Where is he?

529
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,200
Go find them!

530
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,720
Well, isn't this a real oddity?

531
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,440
Let's go.

532
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,520
I'll help.

533
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,720
Xiao,

534
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,000
go look for her now.

535
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,440
See if Si is feeling unwell.

536
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,480
Yes, Old Madam.

537
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,240
Nanny Li.

538
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,520
Search the place.

539
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,130
Search every inch of the house.

540
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,520
Yes, ma'am.

541
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,000
You two, search over there.

542
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:36,680
Yes, Madam Xiao.

543
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,040
You two, go that way.

544
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:38,610
Yes, ma'am.

545
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,330
Have you seen Miss Si?

546
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:43,850
No.

547
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,200
Have you seen Miss Si?

548
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,760
No.

549
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,570
Si!

550
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,200
Have you seen my sister?

551
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,480
No, Mr. Zhan.

552
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,370
Let's go.

553
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,240
Did you see Si?

554
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,760
No.

555
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,850
All right. Go search for her.

556
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,000
Si!

557
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:58,960
Madam.

558
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,680
We checked the backyard.

559
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,480
She wasn't there.

560
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,650
You two,

561
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,280
keep watch at Haitang House.

562
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,810
You two, search the place thoroughly.

563
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,570
Yes, ma'am.

564
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,170
Well? Did you find her?

565
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,520
No.

566
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,480
What about you?

567
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:12,810
Let's search there.

568
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,960
This is strange.

569
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,890
She is nowhere to be found.

570
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,000
Let's go.

571
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,680
Darling, don't go.

572
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,040
Darling, don't go.

573
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,960
Miss Jiang, what did you call me?

574
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,960
Darling.

575
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,440
You said you missed me, didn't you?

576
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,410
Sit down.

577
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,370
Miss Jiang, what's gotten into you?

578
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,040
My darling.

579
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,650
Didn't you say you missed me?

580
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Come here.

581
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:13,650
Fine.

582
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,520
Keep your voice down.

583
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,650
I'll sit down.

584
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,520
Darling...

585
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,200
Darling...

586
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,040
Why won't you hold me in your arms?

587
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,570
I missed you.

588
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,200
Darling.

589
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,440
You promised me

590
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,890
you'd stay with me

591
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,570
and settle down in Zhou.

592
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,200
Settling down in Zhou?

593
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,890
Do you like it here?

594
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,170
Of course.

595
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,440
I was born

596
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,850
and raised in Zhou.

597
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,810
How can I not like it?

598
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,440
But what I like more

599
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,850
is having a life with you.

600
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,130
Miss Jiang, this is wrong.

601
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:03,680

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,200
I want to marry you.

659
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,680
I want you to be my wife.

663
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,130
I don't want to hurt you.

664
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,000
All the more reason for you to marry me.

665
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,370
I am a man of misfortune.

666
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:05,810
From now on,

667
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,130
we can bring each other bad luck.

668
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,680
I wish I could meet you sooner.

669
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,240
Had I met you sooner,

670
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,280
I could have shielded you

671
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,280

what the future holds,

674
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,040
I want to face it together with you.

675
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:27,480
Do you trust me?

676
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,330
I don't believe in fate,

677
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,610
but I believe in you.

678
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:54,680
Si.

679
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,930
Marry me.

680
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:05,370
Mother.

681
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,810
I searched every inch of the mansion.

682
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,650
Si is nowhere to be found.

683
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,480
Commandant Yu is nowhere
to be seen either.

684
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,000
Did Si and Commandant Yu

685
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,680
actually leave the mansion

686
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,850
together?

687
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,680
No way.

688
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,440
If they were seen together,

689
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,000
it'd be bad for our reputation.

690
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,280
Si's engagement with the Duke's son

691
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,130
was just canceled.

692
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,610
Now, of all times, she's gotten herself

693
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:30,480
involved in a scandal.

694
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,370
Enough!

695
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,280

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,610

gossip at a time like this?

698
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,960
I'm just worried.

699
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,200
Until we find her,

700
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,170
anything

701
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,280
could happen.

702
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,330

00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,440

I wasn’t expecting the fireworks at all,

744
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,760
and I was completely caught off guard.

Why don't we report it
to the authorities?

Si is standing here

953
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,250
safe and sound.

954
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,330
Why report it to the authorities?

955
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,250
Mother, you are right.

956
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,440
From now on, girls from our family

957
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,480
should stay away from military officers

958
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,160
like Commandant Yu.

959
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,850
Wasn't Qian's case

960
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,330
enough of a lesson?

961
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,410
Grandmother.

962
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,250
You can't judge everyone

963
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,480
the same way.

964
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,080
Just because Cao Xingyu did evil,

965
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,810
that doesn't mean all military officers

966
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:01,730
are bad.

967
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,770
Without military officers
defending our borders,

968
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:04,810
how could we even

969
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,890
have a peaceful life?

970
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,290
Do you hear her, Mother?

971
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,000
Is this something a young lady

972
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,250
should be saying?

973
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,850
How sharp-tongued you are.

974
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,600
Is there really something going on

975
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,080
between you and him?

976
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,410
Of course not, Grandmother.

977
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,160
No?

978
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,770
We'll drop the matter here then.

979
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,600
All right.

980
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,120
We've been talking here
for quite some time.

981
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,330
I'm tired. You all may leave now.

982
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,890
Mother, let me help you.

983
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,480
Dear!

984
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,930
She fainted.

985
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,810
- Hurry.
- Is she all right?

986
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,770
Help her up.

987
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,770
- Mother.
- Help her up.

988
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,330
Get up now.

989
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,440
Come on, Mother, please get up.

990
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,290
Hurry and get up.

991
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:51,410
Please get up, Mother.

992
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,440
Why is she grinning?

993
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,890
What was that for?

994
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,640
Anmou, you heartless thing.

995
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,930
It's been ages

996
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:00,890
since you set foot in my room.

997
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:01,690
What are you doing?

998
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,290
How disgraceful to behave

999
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:03,930
like this in public.

1000
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,370
Quick. Get her dressed.

1001
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:05,810
Anmou,

1002
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,520
don't you like it when I hit you?

1003
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:11,120
Anmou, take off your clothes.

1004
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:13,250
Anmou.

1005
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,770
Hurry! Stop her!

1006
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,040
Don't run away, Anmou.

1007
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,120
Come to my room and we'll have some fun!

1008
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:18,890
Have some fun!

1009
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,000
She…

1010
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,410
She's gone mad!

1011
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,690
Shameless!

1012
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:23,960
Disgraceful!

1013
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,520
Anmou, listen up!

1014
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,890
Without my permission,

1015
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,330
she is not allowed
to leave this residence.

1016
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,440
Yes.

1017
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,410
What… What happened?

1018
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,520
How did she suddenly go mad?

1019
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,080
Grandmother.

1020
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,960
Could it be that someone drugged her?

1021
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,890
She was drugged?

1022
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,960
Drugged?

1023
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,480
Your mother just said it herself,

1024
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,810
didn't she?

1025
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,040
Such a thing

1026
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,850
can never happen in our household.

1027
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:46,370
That's right.

1028
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,960
Aunt Xiao is strict
in managing the household.

1029
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,850
She would never allow
such a mistake to happen.

1030
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,250
It seems that Xiao is no longer fit

1031
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,640
to manage the household.

1032
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,370
All of you,

1033
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,890
think carefully.

1034
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,290
Who should manage this household
from now on?

1035
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,520
Grandmother.

1036
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:08,960
By all means,

1037
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,000
Qian should take over

1038
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,040
Aunt Xiao's duties.

1039
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,000
Depressed and dispirited.

1040
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,370
No.

1041
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,250
Daughter of a concubine.

1042
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:22,600
No.

1043
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:30,440
Grandmother.

1044
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,730
I think Si is most suited for this role.

1045
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,290
Mother.

1046
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,410
Si is too young to…

1047
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,560
I've made my decision.
