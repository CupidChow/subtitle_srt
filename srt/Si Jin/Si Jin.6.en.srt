It's none

195
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,580
other than my spouse,

196
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,220
Jiang Qian.

197
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,100
Stop barking.

198
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,539
[Arrest Warrant
Issued by the Capital City Garrison]

199
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,380
Cao Xingyu accused Qian

200
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,260
of wrongdoing?

201
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:38,860
Yes.

202
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,299
He claimed that Jiang Qian

203
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,539
was the culprit of the murder.

204
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,580
Miss Qian!

205
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,460
Qian.

206
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,420
They are the culprits.

207
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,500
This is unfair!

208
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,340
Madam Qian,

209
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,700
please follow me.

210
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,060
Si is right.

211
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,540
I should have listened to her

212
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,740
and brought Cao Xingyu to justice.

213
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,460
What do I do, Mother?

214
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:56,940
Fear not, Qian.

215
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,380
You're not leaving.

216
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:58,700
Seize her.

217
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,740
What are you doing?

218
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,860
- Miss Qian!
- Stop!

219
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,620
- Miss Qian!
- Qian!

220
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,420
Find Jiang Si!

221
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,620
Only she can help me.

222
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,340
Mother!

223
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,700
Let go of me!

224
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,340
[Capital Administration Office]

225
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,780
You might as well confess

226
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,220
to your crime now.

227
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,620
You had an affair with Anzi.

228
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,340
He was close

229
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,340
to those women,

230
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,620
and you became jealous.

231
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,460
Thus, you asked Anzi

232
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,780
to murder them.

233
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,340
I have married an accursed soul.

234
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,660
Nonsense.

235
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,700
I did no such thing!

236
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,340
I haven't never met

237
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,220
those women before.

238
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,700
Why would I kill them?

239
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,740
Believe me, sir.

240
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,300
Like those women, I am a victim

241
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,780
of Cao Xingyu's physical abuse.

242
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,180
Yet we are too afraid to take action.

243
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,660
To my dismay,

244
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,020
he framed me for murder.

245
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:44,940
Sir,

246
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,500
please check the wounds on her body.

247
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,980
They are the same wounds

248
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,740
as the ones

249
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,620
on the victims.

250
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,980
But I have evidence

251
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,740
proving that this wretched woman

252
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,420
had an affair with Anzi.

253
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,180
She then asked Anzi to commit the crime.

254
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,500
This is a button

255
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,460
Jiang Qian left in Anzi's abode.

256
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,300
Anzi's wife also

257
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,900
testified in writing

258
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,620
that she saw them committing adultery

259
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,740
and plotting the murder.

260
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,020
Bring it to me.

261
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,620
He's framing me!

262
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,260
He has but found a random button

263
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,900
and threatened Anzi's family

264
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,420
into lying

265
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,260
to frame me, sir!

266
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,420
I saw with my own eyes

267
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,300
that Anzi buried the bodies.

268
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,420
And that night,

269
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,380
Jiang Qian

270
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,700
was sleeping in her chamber.

271
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,300
She couldn't possibly be the culprit.

272
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,580
So you were the one
who reported the incident.

273
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,500
Sir,

274
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,220
they are sisters.

275
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,060
They must have put the blame on me

276
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,180
because their deception

277
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,340
is about to be discovered.

278
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,020
You must help me, sir.

279
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,660
[Jiang Qian and Anzi had an affair.
She killed out of jealousy.]

280
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,420
Summon the witness.

281
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,300
Summon the witness!

282
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,220
Sir, the witness is here.

283
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,980
What is your name?

284
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,780
My name is Chi Shuying, sir.

285
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,940
Tell me.

286
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,820
Do you know the Jiang sisters?

287
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,180
No, they have nothing

288
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,420
to do with me.

289
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,940
Do you know

290
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:24,980
Cao Xingyu then?

291
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,220
Yes,

292
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,540
sir.

293
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,420
This wicked man

294
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,100
lured me
to the Marquis of Changxing's Mansion.

295
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,460
He then imprisoned me
in the Western Garden

296
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,220
where he tortured me every day.

297
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,420
I...

298
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,180
I saw how he murdered the victims.

299
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,260
Liar!

300
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,420
Come back.

301
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,940
Sir, she seduced me first.

302
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,300
She wanted me to leave my wife.

303
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:43,940
I said no,

304
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,220
so she's taking revenge on me.

305
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,260
Sir, my wounds

306
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,300
are the evidence.

307
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,340
Miss Chi.

308
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,660
You saw Cao Xingyu murder someone.

309
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,620
Did you see the weapon he used?

310
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,140
Sir,

311
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,620
he used a horsewhip.

312
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,260
Run! I dare you!

313
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,380
Is it fun?

314
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,420
Isn't it exciting?

315
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,380
She

316
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,060
is trying to frame me.

317
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,740
Do not believe her.

318
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,460
I will preside over this trial

319
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
with fairness.

320
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,740
Do you know

321
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,340
where the whip is?

322
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,340
It is
in the Marquis of Changxing's Mansion...

323
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,060
Miss Chi!

324
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,660
Think twice before you speak.

325
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,100
I am the heir apparent to my father.

326
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,220
You can't just accuse me like that.

327
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,420
You might be the heir apparent,

328
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,780
but in my court, you need

329
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,500
to watch your behavior.

330
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,740
Miss Chi.

331
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,380
Do not fear.

332
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,220
Please continue.

333
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,100
I am speaking the truth.

334
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,740
The weapon is
in the Marquis of Changxing's Mansion...

335
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,700
Shut your mouth!

336
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,740
Miss Chi.

337
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,020
Miss Chi!

338
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,980
Long Dan!

339
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,380
Commandant Yu!

340
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,140
Are you all right?

341
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:13,900
Let go of me!

342
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,380
Get up!

343
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,580
How dare you,

344
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,860
Cao Xingyu.

345
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,340
You endangered the lives of others

346
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,700
in my court with a weapon.

347
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,900
Take him away.

348
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,380
I am the heir apparent
to the Marquis of Changxing.

349
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,660
You can't touch me!

350
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,420
Long Dan!

351
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,380
Put him in a cell for his trial!

352
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:28,700
Yes, sir!

353
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,620
Let go of me!

354
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,340
Commandant Yu!

355
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,740
Get a physician.

356
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,860
Are you all right, Commandant Yu?

357
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,220
I'm fine.

358
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,260
Commandant Yu!

359
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,420
Sir,

360
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,660
how is Mr. Yu?

361
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,300
He was fortunate
to receive prompt treatment.

362
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,500
Any moment later

363
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,900
and he might be too far gone

364
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,220
for even the greatest physician.

365
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,460
Most of the toxins in his body

366
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,860
have been cleared out.

367
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,940
What wonderful news.

368
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,420
Thank you, sir.

369
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,940
However, do not leave his side tonight.

370
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,900
Notify me

371
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,940
if anything happens.

372
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,660
Come with me to my store

373
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,380
to get some detoxifying herbs.

374
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,500
Miss Jiang, could you...?

375
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,220
Don't worry.

376
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,300
I'll stay

377
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,260
to look after Commander Yu.

378
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:32,940
Let's get the herbs.

379
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,100
You thought I was the Saintess.

380
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,300
Yet you didn't kill me.

381
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,860
You even risked your life to save me.

382
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,020
You're awake.

383
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,700
Thank you for taking care of me,
Miss Jiang.

384
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,580
You were injured because of me.

385
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,900
I will not forgive myself

386
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,460
if I don't take good care of you.

387
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,700
I'm already used to

388
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,020
such trivial injuries.

389
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,100
Do not worry about me.

390
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,660
This is not a trivial injury.

391
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,300
The physician said

392
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,780
that if we arrived later,

393
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,220
we might

394
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,580
have to bury you.

395
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:44,940
Commander Yu.

396
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,580
You and I are strangers.

397
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,540
Why did you risk your life to save me?

398
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,660
I didn't expect

399
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,340
the arrow to be poisoned.

400
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,820
Miss Chi and you

401
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,220
are strangers too.

402
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,900
Yet you risked your life to save her.

403
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,060
Right.

404
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,540
Who would have thought
that the arrow was poison?

405
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,500
Let me get you some water.

406
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,460
Miss Si, let me do it.

407
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,540
Aman, I can do it.

408
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,580
Miss Jiang.

409
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,660
Mr. Zhen.

410
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,020
Let me do it.

411
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,500
Sure.

412
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,540
What do I do?

413
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,460
What am I supposed to do?

414
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,740
Cao Xingyu

415
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,100
is imprisoned.

416
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,540
His father will do everything he can

417
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,100
to clear his name.

418
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,140
If Cao Xingyu is freed,

419
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,260
Qian

420
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,820
will be in danger once more.

421
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,140
Anmou, help us.

422
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,460
Anmou!

423
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:53,940
Mother.

424
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,020
Mother.

425
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,780
Mother, help us.

426
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,700
Qian grew up

427
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,020
under your watch.

428
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,580
You won't sit by

429
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,300
and watch her die, will you, Mother?

430
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:11,619
Anmou,

431
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,380
do something.

432
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,579
See if you can find any aid

433
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,260
in the Imperial Court.

434
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:20,980
Mother.

435
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,180
Qian

436
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,980
is also my proudest daughter.

437
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,380
I too care for her.

438
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,300
I have asked around today,

439
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,700
but I was shunned by all.

440
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,380
They are afraid

441
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,140
of the Marquis of Changxing too.

442
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,540
But Mother,

443
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,460
an opportunity
might present itself in the future.

444
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,260
Hurry up and help Mother unwind.

445
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,420
I should leave you two be.

446
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,300
Anmou!

447
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,460
Anmou!

448
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,660
Anmou!

449
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,060
Don't go, Anmou!

450
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,940
Please.

451
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:01,900
Commandant Yu.

452
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,660
Commandant Yu.

453
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,060
Have some water.

454
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,580
Right, your hand is injured.

455
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,700
Let me feed you.

456
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,700
My left hand's still good.

457
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,060
Can you

458
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,820
put the cup next to me?

459
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,580
So,

460
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,020
how are you?

461
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,980
Nothing much.

462
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,620
Did you find the evidence?

463
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,700
I did.

464
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,780
Every time I encounter cases like this,

465
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,460
it reminds me

466
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,700
of how depraved

467
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,500
humanity can be.

468
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,700
I have adjudged

469
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,180
many cases,

470
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,380
yet I still cannot

471
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,860
get used to it.

472
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,980
Mr. Zhen, that's because

473
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,980
you have empathy.

474
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,380
And thus, you can adjudge

475
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,220
with fairness.

476
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,340
No innocent men

477
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,860
will be wrongfully convicted,

478
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,500
and no criminal can walk away

479
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,580
scot-free.

480
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,060
You seek a life

481
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,260
of accountability.

482
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,460
Miss Jiang...

483
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,180
That's why the people need

484
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,180
the Capital Administration Office,
Mr. Zhen.

485
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,380
Especially you.

486
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,860
Laws cannot force everyone

487
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,220
to be kind.

488
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,100
But it can make them

489
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,620
think twice

490
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,300
before doing

491
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,260
evil.

492
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,180
You're right, Commandant Yu.

493
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,580
Miss Jiang.

494
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,020
But some people

495
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,580
are not afraid of laws.

496
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,180
Because they are not humans.

497
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,340
They are animals.

498
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,340
Ease your mind, Commandant Yu.

499
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,220
The evidence is as secured as it can be.

500
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,180
Cao Xingyu will not get away.

501
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,980
But Mr. Zhen,

502
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,380
you must take precautions.

503
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,620
The Marquis of Changxing

504
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,580
will be taking action

505
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,580
before the trial.

506
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,900
He will use all his connections

507
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,780
in the Imperial Court

508
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,060
and do anything

509
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,900
to put you under pressure.

510
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,020
I am impressed

511
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,380
by your foresight, Miss Jiang.

512
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,660
Worry not,

513
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,980
Miss Jiang.

514
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,860
Whatever it is,

515
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,500
I will not cave

516
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,700
under any pressure.

517
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,460
I

518
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,100
can vouch for that.

519
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,940
He is quite impervious.

520
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,740
See?

521
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,140
His injury is almost healed.

522
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,540
Thank you for the compliment,
Commandant Yu.

523
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,300
You know what?

524
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,620
I

525
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,980
will look after Commandant Yu today.

526
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,900
You have had a shock just now,

527
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,380
so you ought to take some rest.

528
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,740
Long Dan

529
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,020
went with the physician
to collect some herbs.

530
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,020
He'll be back soon.

531
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,420
I can stay

532
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,860
to brew the medicine for Commandant Yu.

533
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,420
Don't.

534
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,220
That is a menial task.

535
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,340
Long Dan can do it.

536
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,900
I can do it too.

537
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,820
Perhaps Miss Jiang should stay.

538
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,180
I gave Long Dan

539
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,340
some other tasks.

540
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,500
For the Capital Administration Office.

541
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,500
Or I can arrange for two guards
to come here.

542
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,700
You can't possibly ask Miss Jiang

543
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,380
to stay up all night for you.

544
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,500
Since when did you learn
to be so protective

545
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,100
of women?

546
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,100
Thank you, Mr. Zhen.

547
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,740
Have a good rest, Commandant Yu.

548
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,900
I'll visit tomorrow.

549
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,140
Miss Jiang,

550
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,780
let me see you out.

551
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:50,940
Sure.

552
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,620
Please stay, Mr. Zhen.

553
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,340
You need to look after Commandant Yu.

554
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,140
Commandant Yu.

555
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,620
Commandant Yu.

556
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,740
Is it just me

557
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,420
or is Miss Jiang

558
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,900
quite different

559
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,180
from the other ladies out there?

560
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,460
She was so ravishing

561
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,660
when she stood her ground

562
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,380
in the courthouse.

563
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,940
Besides, she's

564
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,500
very grateful for her savior.

565
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,020
Commandant Yu?

566
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,180
Commandant Yu?

567
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,180
Did you hear me?

568
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,020
Well,

569
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,820
if I had taken the arrow instead,

570
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,180
perhaps...

571
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,700
Perhaps we would have a funeral repast.

572
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,940
A repast?

573
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,700
That

574
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,500
would be great.

575
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,700
The Cao family is horrible.

576
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,700
I feel sorry for Qian.

577
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,220
Shu,

578
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,580
this is

579
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,340
my family.

580
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,420
[Madam Ruan, Jiang Anmou's concubine]
Qian is my daughter.

581
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,380
So I do care for her.

582
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,060
Please don't blame me.

583
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,380
I didn't know

584
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,300
things would turn out

585
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,580
this way.

586
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,300
I thought I could just power
through it with grit.

587
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,020
Alas,

588
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,020
Cao Xingyu turned around

589
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,020
and accused us of wrongdoing.

590
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,260
He

591
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,780
is imprisoned,

592
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,540
but there's nothing much we can do.

593
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,460
If the Marquis manages to save him,

594
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,980
Qian

595
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,540
will suffer a lot.

596
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,340
Even if the Marquis manages to save him,

597
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,860
so long as Qian

598
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,980
is freed from the wicked man's torture,

599
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,060

600
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,940
Pei, and I

601
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,940
remain together.

602
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,220
That's better than anything.

603
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,620
Anmou, the future
is full of possibilities.

604
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,900
Just believe

605
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,340
that what goes around, comes around.

606
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,500
Well said.

607
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:15,980
Shu,

608
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,300
you're the only one

609
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,460
who knows

610
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,780
how to comfort me in this family.

611
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,580
You and your daughter

612
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,460
killed my entire family,

613
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,300
forcing me to leave Zhou.

614
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,980
And you continue to hunt me down
to the Southern Frontier.

615
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,220
Today is my wedding day.

616
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,780
You are the Princess Royal.

617
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,100
Just because your daughter

618
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,940
is in love with my husband,

619
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,140
you now want me to pen
a letter of separation

620
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,980
and jump off this cliff?

621
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,660
Sooner or later, you will be punished

622
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,660
for your cruelty!

623
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,820
Yu Qi should feel honored

624
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,660
that my daughter fancies him.

625
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,980
Whoever my daughter wants,

626
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,780
I'll get them for her.

627
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,380
Jiang Si,

628
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,500
you can't think

629
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,340
that a man

630
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,460
will stay loyal to you forever.

631
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,220
Pen the letter of separation

632
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,660
and Yu Qi will know

633
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,820
to give up on you.

634
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,700
Mingyue and he

635
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,460
are bound to get married.

636
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,180
Just give up already.

637
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,060
I will not pen the letter.

638
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,660

639
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,340

What did you do to him?

642
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,220
Let go of me.

643
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,020
Don't hurt him!

644
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,860
You will decide

645
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,340
what I'll do to him.

646
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,660
Pen

647
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,900
the letter of separation

648
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,180
and jump off the cliff,

649
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,300
and I will spare his life.

650
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,140

will be at my mercy.

stay with him?

717
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,340

I'm asking you a question.

00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,740
would stay with him.

in our short life.

728
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,660
On many occasions,

729
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,660
we cannot

730
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,820
be our authentic selves.

732
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,060
cannot express their love freely,

733
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,300
then what is

735
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,220

737

was arrested?

Didn't you handle everything already?

739
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,660

740
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,660

741
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,780
Is the witness...?

742
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,260
Don't worry about the witness.

743
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,780
They want to find out the truth.

744
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,500
I'll make them find a body instead.

745
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,420
They'll be stumped.

746
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,620
When will Yu ever be freed then?

747
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,860
He won't eat

748
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,340
or sleep well in the prison.

749
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,340

00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,860
You are the mole among us.

770
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,660
[Haitang House]

771
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:21,740
Si.

772
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,260
Zhan.

773
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,060
Where are you going?

774
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,660
I want

775
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,700
to check on Commandant Yu.

776
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,380
Great.

777
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,820
I want to pay him

778
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,780
a visit too.

779
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,540
Let's go together.

780
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,500
Sure, let's go.

781
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,260
Sir.

782
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,700
Didn't we just visit Commandant Yu?

783
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,620
My sister cannot be alone

784
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,260
with him in a room.

785
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,740
Besides,

786
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,420
can't you smell how delicious it is

787
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,300
the soup she's carrying?

788
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,580
Mr. Yu.

789
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:58,740
Yu.

790
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,820
Jiang Si brewed the soup for you.

791
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,300
Try it.

792
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:02,980
Thank you.

793
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,140
It smells good.

794
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,020
Like good liquor,

795
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,940
soup is best enjoyed together.

796
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,659
Perhaps Jiang,
you should do the honor first?

797
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:21,420
No.

798
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,020
It's for your recovery.

799
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,780
It's okay.

800
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,580
I can't do that to you.

801
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,380
Bring us a bowl.

802
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,500
But sharing

803
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,940
makes this more meaningful.

804
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,219
Here.

805
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,699
Mr. Yu, there's another bowl here.

806
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,780
- See?
- We have a bowl.

807
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,020
I'll dig in then.

808
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,659
Be my guest.

809
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:44,980
Never have I

810
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,139
had such refreshing fish soup.

811
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,739
There's not even a hint of gamey taste

812
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:49,500
in it.

813
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,449
Yu, I'm not just bragging

814
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,300
about my sister.

815
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,659
But this soup has

816
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,739
such a nuanced flavor profile.

817
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,300
She put her soul into it.

818
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,660
And she's also thoughtful.

819
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,380
She knows you're wounded

820
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,260
and must avoid spices.

821
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,740
So she didn't add pepper.

822
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,420
It...

823
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,260
Do we have pepper?

824
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,580
Here.

825
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,060
Mr. Yu.

826
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,140
Thank you so much.

827
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,820
You have been so kind

828
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,460
toward me

829
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,100
and I do not know how to repay it.

830
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:19,940
Perhaps I...

831
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,340
No need to betroth her.

832
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,020
Perhaps I can repay your kindness

833
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,780
with more sumptuous meals.

834
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,420
Drink while it's warm.

835
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,380
Slow down,

836
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,260
or you'll choke.

837
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,900
I'm sorry that I couldn't give you

838
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,060
a more comfortable life.

839
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,460
Once

840
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,500
we find our way

841
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,460

What

844
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,300
will you make?

845
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,420
I have to imagine it.

846
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,060
Sure.

847
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,220
I'll find

848
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,860
a fresh crucian carp

849
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,220
in the Jinshui River.

850
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,980
Then I brush egg white

851
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,420
and huangjiu on it

852
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,300
to marinate it.

853
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,220
After that,

854
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,420
I put it in a hot pan

855
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,460
and fry it till it's golden brown.

856
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,740
Then, I'll add condiments

857
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,060
such as ginger and chenpi

858
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,340
before simmering it for two hours.

859
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,340
The fish will be flavorful

860
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,540
and tender,

861
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,460
and its soup will be a milky color.

862
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,340
Miss Jiang.

863
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,460

885

did you just say

886

this was a dagger used by Nie Yinniang?

How many hours are there?

920
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,060
No need to count.

921
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,820
It's for you to check the time,

922
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,220
right,

00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:07,460

So this is...?

And this one.

927
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,060
Sir, could this be...?

928

This is the remaining last stone

929

used by the Goddess Nyuwa

930
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,380
when she was repairing the sky.

931
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,580
Exactly.

932
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,420
What do you think of this stone?

933
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,300
Why do I feel like

934
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,340
he's a scammer?

935
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,420
That took you so long!

936
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:34,900
He is a scammer.

937

What's going on?

940
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:36,740
So

941
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,100
Nie Yinniang's dagger

942
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:38,620
is also fake?

943
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,460
No such dagger exists

00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,180
I might not

960
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,100
have enough money to buy you a meal.

961
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,700
Oh, my dear money!

962
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,620
Have some.

963
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,260
This too.

964
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,060
- Great!
- Splendid!

965
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,180
- Wonderful!
- Excellent!

966
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,220
For today's tales of oddities,

967
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,020
let's talk about the cursed soul,

968
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,380
the Seventh Prince.

969
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,580
Do you still remember

970
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,020
the battle by the frontier 20 years ago?

971
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,580
It was a dim night.

972
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,340
Those Nanwu scoundrels
attacked our realm

973
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,020
without a sign.

974
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,180
Our soldiers were taken by surprise,

975
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,340
and many people died.

976
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,780
Yet that night,

977
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,980
the Seventh Prince

978
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,580
was born.

979
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,140
The Imperial Palace was basking
in merriment.

980
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,100
Yet

981
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,260
as news of the defeat

982
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,940
spread to Ling'an,

983
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,220
everything

984
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,500
changed.

985
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,820
What happened to him then?

986
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,620
Stop running

987
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,900
or I'll ask the Nanwu barbarians
to take you away.

988
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,940
As the crisis approached its precipice,

989
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,380
the Directorate of Astronomy
submitted a memorial,

990
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,180
claiming that the Seventh Prince
was the reincarnation of misfortune.

991
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,500
His birth

992
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,540
had brought about unrest at the border.

993
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,580
That night,

994
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,820
hundreds of officials
knelt in the palace,

995
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,980
urging His Majesty to eliminate
the Seventh Prince

996
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,380
to save the realm.

997
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,200
But he was born moments ago.

998
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,660
His Majesty didn't have it in him

999
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,860
to do so,

1000
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,620
so he had someone

1001
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,540
send the baby

1002
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,940
to the Southern Frontier.

1003
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,460
If he makes it through, it's up to fate.

1004
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,300
Should he die,

1005
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,380
it will offer solace
to the valiant soldiers.

1006
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,060
And that was enough to placate
everyone in the palace.

1007
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,980
Interestingly,

1008
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,620
since then,

1009
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:14,740
we

1010
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,500
have never won a battle.

1011
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,300
Our realm shrinks in size.

1012
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,860
All because

1013
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,260
the embodiment of misfortune lives

1014
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,500
in the army.

1015
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,660
That's right.

1016
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,380
Sheesh.

1017
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,300
- Exactly.
- Indeed.

1018
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,900
The accursed Seventh Prince...

1019
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,500
Who did that?

1020
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,660
What's going on?

1021
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,540
What the heck?

1022
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,060
This is unacceptable!

1023
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,660
What is the meaning of this?

1024
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:37,660
You

1025
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,780
fabricated a baseless story.

1026
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,060
I shall rip your tongue out.

1027
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,780
Spare me, miss. I'm just doing my job.

1028
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,540
Chuchu?

1029
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,460
Long Dan?
