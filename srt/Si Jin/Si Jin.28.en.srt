Ancheng,

17
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,960
are you so overwhelmed with joy

18
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,390
that you lost your senses?

19
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,960
I am perfectly clear-headed.

20
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,270
But this marriage

21
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,030
cannot happen!

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,720
Then tell us

23
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,640
why it can't happen.

24
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,080
The imperial palace and inner court

55
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,550
That was because

56
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,040
I didn't know his identity back then.

65
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,150
He just can't bear

66
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,270

67
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,960

Didn't you promise me?

86
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,230
Then why is the marriage decree

87
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,790

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,640
There, there.

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,880
Jiang Si doesn't deserve that marriage.

90
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,029
The decree is nothing

91
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,880
but a death warrant.

92
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,760
A death warrant? What do you mean?

93
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,270
Have I ever failed

Si,

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,680
I have failed you.

to marry into an ordinary family sooner,

100
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,960

101
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,230
into the pit known
as the imperial family.

102
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,390

103
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,680
It's not as bad
as you make it out to be.

104
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,000

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,200
the Princess Consort Yan?

106
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,560
It must have been that Prince Yan

107

108
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,520
I'll go confront him!

109
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,390
Father, confronting him now

110
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,080
will only make people suspicious.

111
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,150
They will think
your daughter and Prince Yan

112
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,760
had an affair long before this decree.

113
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,200
Father, don't be anxious.

114
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,000
Prince Yan is a good man.

115
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,200
And…

116
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,270
And I do

117
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,440

118
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,230
Si.

119
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,790
You are young and naive.

120
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,909
A good man isn't always

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,150
a suitable life partner.

122
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,200
Besides,

123
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,760
he is not as honest as he appears.

124
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,560
Otherwise,

125
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,520
why would he deceive

126
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,120
all of us?

127
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,560
It wasn't exactly deception.

128
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,270
I've known his identity

129
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,200
for a long time.

130
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,030
He had his reasons.

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,150
Besides, I believe

132
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,560
that Prince Yan's character and virtue

133
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,710
make him a reliable life partner.

134
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,350
In the end,

135
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,520

Si,

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,680
are you really sure that Prince Yan

139
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,760
will never betray you?

140
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,000
He is a prince, after all.

141
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,350
If he falls in love

142
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,200
with another woman,

143
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,270
no amount of crying

144
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,150
or arguing will change your fate.

145
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,560
You won't even get

146
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,390
to divorce him.

147
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,270
Well,

148
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,830
the imperial decree

149
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,030
has already been issued.

150
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,520
Even if I were unwilling,

151
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,760
what else can be done?

152
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,680
Then we feign illness.

153
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,960
I'll send you

154

out of the city discreetly.

155
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,910
You can marry another man

156
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,200
or travel the world.

157
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,590
What matters is that you live

158
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,960
a carefree life.

159
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,080
I don't want

160
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,710
to spend my life hiding.

161
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,440

162
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,470

Father.

165
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,440
It's really not

166
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,710
as scary as you think.

167
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,270
Your Highness.

168
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,710
When will we hire some maids

169
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,150
for this mansion?

170
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:53,830
This mansion

171
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,470
is way too big compared to the residence
in Zaoshu Alley.

172
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,230
I can't manage everything

173
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,390
on my own.

174
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,000
Once my princess consort moves in,

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,030
you'll have all the help you need.

176
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,680
These hands that wielded swords

177
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
on the battlefield

178
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,200
are now wiping railings.

179
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,520
Royal wedding rituals

180
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,470
are excessive and overly complex.

181
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,200
Do you think Si will be overexerted?

182
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,470
Chief.

183
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,910
You are very considerate of Miss Jiang.

184
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,350
I'll have goose pear incense
for our wedding chamber.

185
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,680
Si likes that.

186
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,960
Prepare more of it.

187
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,150
And the decorations in the mansion

188
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,350
must be rearranged

189
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,830
according to her preferences.

190
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,910

191

192

Plant more of them in the courtyard.

193
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,320
Yes, sir.

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,680
How dare you falsely accuse your master

385
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,800
with such blatant lies!

386
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,560
Someone! Drag her out and lock her

387
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,800
in the woodshed!

388
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,110
Let her starve for a full day and night!

389
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,040
She needs to learn

390
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,800
the consequences of speaking recklessly!

391
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,710
Grandmother…

392
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,080
I need to take care of Miss Si.

393
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,750
You wretched girl!

394
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,990
You have no say here!

395
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:56,750
Move!

396
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,350
Grandmother.

397
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,800
Aman only said that

398
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,630
because she was anxious.

399
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,470
Si is still ill.

400
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,560
She needs Aman to care for her.

401
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,630
That's right, Mother.

402
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,080
Let Aman stay

403
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
and look after Si.

404
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,320
Surely the Count of Dongping's Mansion

405
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,400
can find another maid

406
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,470
to look after Miss Si, no?

407
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,110
For all we know,

408
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,830
it could be Aman

409
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,320
who gave Si

410
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,590
something bad to eat,

411
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,870
making her

412
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,800
fall ill like this.

413
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,800
Must I seek

414
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,990
the permission of you two

415
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,040
to discipline

416
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,990
a mere maid now?

417
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,080
She isn't sick?

418
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,630
Then why did she cough up blood?

419
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,200
Why won't she wake up?

420
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,630
Well…

421
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,440
Indeed.

422
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,680
She's coughing up blood
and has been in a deep sleep.

423
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,320
Ancheng.

424
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,710
Could this be the same illness

425
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,830
that Su Ke had back then?

426
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,880
No. That's impossible.

427
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,120
Right. Physician Xu,

428
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,510
I remember you were the one

429
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,510
who treated Su Ke back then.

430
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,230
Now that you've mentioned it,

431
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,200
the symptoms are indeed quite similar.

432
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,030
After giving birth,

433
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,470
Madam Su also coughed up blood
and fell into a deep sleep,

434
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,550
with her condition
rapidly deteriorating.

435
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,230
Within days,

436
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,160
she died from heart failure.

437
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,359
I searched through

438
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,440
every medical text

439
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,680
and could not find the cause.

440
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,680
Your Lordship, you summoned

441
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,960
every famous physician in Ling'an,

442
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,790
yet none of them

443
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,030
could do anything.

444
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,230
This can't be…

445
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,360
How could Si

446
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,470
have the same illness as her mother?

447
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,030
There's nothing more I can do.

448
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,310
Please excuse me.

449
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,360
Physician Xu, this way, please.

450
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,030
Could this be something

451
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,470
she inherited from her mother?

452
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,510
Impossible.

453
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,440
If it were inherited,

454
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
then why are Zhan and Yi

455
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,070
perfectly healthy?

456
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,270
Indeed.

457
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,400
Si has always

458
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,200
been healthy.

459
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,270
This must be

460
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,070
Aman's fault

461
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,960
for not taking proper care of her.

462
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,790
Let's do this.

463
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,470
We'll move to the front hall

464
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,680
and discuss

465
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,600
how to treat her properly.

466
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
We shouldn't disturb her rest.

467
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,470
All right.

468
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,440
Yes, let's do that.

469
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,790
The poor girl.

470
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,960
Nanny Li, you keep watch.

471
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,360
Make sure nothing else happens.

472
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,840
Yes, Madam.

473
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,790
What? She coughed up blood?

474
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,750
Where's Aman?

475
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,840
Grandmother found a fault in her

476
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,960
and locked her in the woodshed.

477
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,600
Well, I'll go and see Yu.

478
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,470
You go to Si first.

479
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,230
Chief.

480
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,070
Did we buy too much?

481
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,360
For something this important,

482
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,230
I must ensure she gets

483
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,440
only the best.

484
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:33,710
Understood.

485
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,360
Jiang, why are you standing outside?

486
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:35,880
Yu!

487
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,710
[Prince Yan's Mansion]
Bad news!

488
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,750
What happened?

489
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,070
Si has fallen into a coma.

490
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,310
Chief!

491
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:50,990
So cold…

492
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,310
What did you say?

493
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,200
So cold…

494
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:54,880
So…

495
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,680
Cold?

496
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:58,960
How do you feel?

497
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,230
Hot…

498
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,960
Better?

499
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,600
It's hot…

500
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,030
You're burning up.

501
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,600
First, you're cold, then you're hot.

502
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,030
What's going on here?

503
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,270
Someone!

504
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,310
Is anyone here?

505
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
She really is just a country girl
after all.

506
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,070
Has everyone in this mansion died?

507
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,680
There's not a single person around!

508
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,470
Miss,
this is the Count of Dongping's Mansion.

509
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,680
We follow rules here.

510
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,120
This is not some marketplace.

511
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,070
You shouldn't be shouting like that.

512
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,600
Miss Si is ill.

513
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,160
You shouldn't be talking about death.

514
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,600
Oh, so you do know Miss Si is sick?

515
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,680
Yet while she lies ill,

516
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,880
you all are eating, drinking,

517
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,710
and laughing in her courtyard?

518
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,680
Are those behaviors

519
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,880
that observe the rules of this mansion?

520
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,200
Wasn't it you who told us

521
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,440
to stay away from Miss Si?

522
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,270
Didn't you say it was Mr. Zhan's orders?

523
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,470
You're so devoted

524
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,990
to caring for Miss Si.

525
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,510
Did Mr. Zhan

526
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,710
promise you something?

527
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,400
Mr. Zhan is known
for his flirtatious nature.

528
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,990
I hope you won't end up

529
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,600
with nothing in the end.

530
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,270
You, go fetch some hot water.

531
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,680
You, go get some ice.

532
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,750
And you.

533
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,400
Have His Lordship
go to the palace at once

534
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,230
to fetch the imperial physicians.

535
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,360
If you refuse,

536
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,270
my dagger won't be

537
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,470
so merciful next time.

538
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,230
What happened?

539
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,600
Jiang Zhan didn't explain clearly.

540
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,750
Apparently, she has

541
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
the same illness her mother had.

542
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,680
Coughing up blood, falling unconscious,

543
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,270
and slowly wasting away.

544
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,640
I'll go get the imperial physicians.

545
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,550
You stay with her.

546
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,310
Wait.

547
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,990
His Lordship just saw
the imperial physicians out.

548
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,230
They're all useless.

549
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,310
They checked her pulse
and said they couldn't cure her.

550
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,440
They didn't even prescribe any medicine.

551
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,030
I know you only want

552
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,120
to protect your family

553
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
and live an ordinary life.

554
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,310
But I can only protect you

555
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,470
if I first secure my own position.

556
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,160
You said

557
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,230
you would protect me

558
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,440
and keep me safe.

559
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,680
I thought

560
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,960
I'd never see you again.

561
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,230
What happened to you?

562
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,680
You were fine just a few days ago.

563
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,440
Snake Concealment Grass.

564
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,960
You mean

565
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,960
you were poisoned
by Snake Concealment Grass?

566
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,990
Snake Concealment Grass can cure you?

567
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,120
Snake Concealment Grass.

568
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,790
The world only knows

569
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,400
that Snake Concealment Grass
is highly poisonous,

570
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,640
but they don't realize

571
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,440
that it can also neutralize
hundreds of poisons.

572
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,780
Wait for me.

573
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:25,210
♪Words fail to convey

Your Highness, Princess Mingyue
has regained her appetite.

590
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,840
She ate everything that was sent.

591
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,230
Your Highness,
there's one more thing.

592
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,200
Count of Dongping's Mansion

593
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,680
has sought
every physician's help in the city,

594
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,030
yet none can cure Jiang Si.

595
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,790
Her days are likely numbered.

596
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,640
Your Highness will soon

597
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,710
hear good news.

598
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,600
Everyone is worried about you.

599
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,750
I'll let them know you're awake.

600
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,070
Not yet.

601
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,120
I don't think I'm sick.

602
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,510
I suspect

603
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,960
I was poisoned.

604
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,120
Who do you suspect?

605
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,750
Xiao Shi.

606
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,400
First, she had someone

607
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,600
splash me with water.

608
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,550
Then, she sent bathing supplies.

609
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,790
Finally, she brought
a bowl of ginger soup

610
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,400
to "prove" her innocence.

611
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,960
It's too much of a coincidence.

612
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,600
It's a well-planned scheme.

613
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,710
So you intend to feign illness

614
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,710
and wait for her to expose herself?

615
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,990
The sun has risen.

616
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,030
Let's set up a trap

617
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,230
and lure her into it.

618
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,600
Your Highness, do you truly have a way

619
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,550
to save Si?

620
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,510
I have seen

621
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,270
this illness before.

622
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,030
Ancheng, please wait.

623
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,990
What is it now, Xiao?

624
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:43,840
Ancheng.

625
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,510
I understand your desperation
to save your daughter,

626
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,990
but His Highness is an outsider.

627
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,400
It's improper for him

628
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,310
to enter her chambers.

629
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,120
He is her husband-to-be.

630
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,360
He is not an outsider!

631
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,200
Saving her life is what really matters!

632
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,510
Your Highness, please follow me!

633
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,270
Madam.

634
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,360
Are we really letting him

635
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,360
treat Miss Si?

636
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,360
Look at them, rushing in like that.

637
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,510
How could I have stopped them?

638
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,510
If I ask too many questions,
I'll raise suspicions.

639
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,400
How is she?

640
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
From her pulse,

641
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,360
it matches the illness I encountered

642
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:16,990
years ago.

643
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,160
Her condition fluctuates.

644
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,680
The cranial rest point behind her ear
has stagnant qi and blood.

645
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,360
The symptoms match.

646
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:23,960
Father!

647
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,750
Father!

648
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,920
How is Si?

649
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,710
Calm down.

650
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,710
His Highness is diagnosing her.

651
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:31,790
He encountered

652
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,840
someone in Nanwu with the same illness.

653
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,230
Is it the same strange disease

654
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,030
Mother had?

655
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,640
Yes, it is.

656
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,640
The patient dies in their sleep.

657
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,120
Their body temperature fluctuates

658
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,920
between fever and chills.

659
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,640
Yes, yes!

660
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,840
Si had those same symptoms yesterday.

661
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,640
She kept saying
she was hot and then cold.

662
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,600
Your Highness,

663
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,880
do you have a cure for Si?

664
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,790
Mr. Jiang, rest assured.

665
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,550
I still have the prescription
from back then.

666
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,640
This is wonderful!

667
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,120
There is hope for Si, Father.

668
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,710
This is great news!

669
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:02,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

670
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,470
Azhu, go fetch

671
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,750
some sweat-absorbing handkerchiefs.

672
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,030
Your Highness, what can we do to help?

673
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,310
You came at the right time.

674
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,550
Listen carefully, all of you.

675
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,200
Take note.

676
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,270
Her illness is extremely severe.

677
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,070
The treatment requires precise control.

678
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,470
The timing, heat, and sequence

679
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,470
must be exactly right.

680
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,030
To lure the culprit

681
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,160
into the trap,

682
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,070
we must come up

683
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,880
with a complicated prescription.

684
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,440
Aunt Xiao is meticulous.

685
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,070
If it's too straightforward,

686
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,880
she'll see right through it.

687
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,550
So,

688
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,160
this plan needs at least three steps.

689
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,160
The first decoction
is for stabilizing the body.

690
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,270
Boil it over high heat for two hours.

691
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,510
The second decoction
is for clearing the internal heat.

692
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,270
Simmer on low heat for four hours.

693
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,400
The third decoction

694
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,440
is the most important
for neutralizing the poison.

695
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Use morning dew as the medium.

696
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,790
Boil it over high heat for three hours,

697
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,400
then simmer on low heat
for another two hours.

698
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,310
Madam.

699
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,230
Even antidotal herbs can be found

700
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,360
nearby venomous snakes.

701
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,510
Do you think Prince Yan

702
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,400
stumbled upon the cure by sheer luck?

703
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,440
Can such a coincidence be real?

704
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,120
Let's not get flustered.

705
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,270
Have our people
keep watch at Haitang House.

706
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,030
See if they're actually brewing medicine

707
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,440
or just putting on an act.

708
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,470
Will this medicine

709
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,030
really cure Si?

710
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,270
Don't worry.

711
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,550
I trust no one else,

712
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,640
but I trust Qi.

713
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,640
Si…

714
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
Si's hand moved!

715
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,710
That wretched girl

716
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,440
still clings to life.

717
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,070
Does that Yu Qi

718
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,960
actually have the cure?

719
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,120
Madam, don't panic.

720
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,600
The final decoction

721
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,960
is the critical dose.

722
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,550
We still have a chance.

723
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,550
Oh, one more thing.

724
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,960
There is a herb

725
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,710
in the third decoction

726
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,550
that I brought back from Nanwu.

727
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,200
It's impossible to find in Ling'an.

728
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,840
If anything goes wrong with it,

729
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,160
all our efforts will be wasted.

730
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,310
Understood.

731
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:05,880
Don't worry.

732
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,960
There are so many of us

733
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,070
guarding the medicine.

734
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,070
Nothing will go wrong.

735
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,270
The medicine will be safe
as long as we're around.

736
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,160
The fire isn't just cooking herbs.

737
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,510
It is testing humanity.

738
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,920
They're already brewing
the second decoction.

739
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,510
There's no time to hesitate.

740
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,640
If we destroy

741
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,470
the third decoction,

742
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,990
even deities

743
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,510
won't be able to save that girl.

744
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,790
Once she's gone,

745
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,120
this mansion will be yours
to command again.

746
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,030
That new maid

747
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,640
tending to Old Madam, Fangqin,

748
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,230
is your niece, yes?

749
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,510
Fangqin is timid.

750
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,070
I fear...

751
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,790
Fear?

752
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,550
What's there to fear at this point?

753
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,510
Time it perfectly.

754
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,600
Once the third decoction
is halfway brewed,

755
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,070
send Fangqin in.

756
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,550
Yes, Madam.

757
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,200
Did we all fall asleep?

758
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,310
Weren't we supposed to…

759
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,920
Did you collect all of that?

760
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,710
Miss Si!

761
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,790
- Aman. You're back.
- Mr. Zhan.

762
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,440
How is Miss Si?

763
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,470
Your Highness, how is Miss Si?

764
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:29,750
Don't panic.

765
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,600
Miss Yi.

766
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,640
She still hasn't woken up.

767
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,230
Brew the third decoction.

768
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,550
Let's begin.

769
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,990
The final step in luring the culprit
into the trap

770
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,270
is to create an opportunity.

771
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,600
And your departure

772
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,750
is that opportunity.

773
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:10,960
Miss Yi.

774
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,160
Old Madam said everyone

775
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,680
must be tired
after staying up all night.

776
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,880
She ordered me

777
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,120
to bring some pastries for everyone.

778
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,440
Thank you. I'll take them.

779
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
Prince Yan and Mr. Zhan

780
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,400
are inside, right?

781
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,960
I'll take these to them.

782
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,120
No need.

783
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,680
Just give them to me.

784
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,270
Prince Yan had to return
to his residence.

785
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,470
Thank Grandmother for us.

786
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,360
Remember to eat the pastries, Miss Yi.

787
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,680
Madam.

788
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,270
How did it go?

789
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,960
Fangqin went to Haitang House to check.

790
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,840
Yu Qi has left for some business.

791
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,510
Excellent!

792
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,680
Our chance has come.

793
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,960
Find a few trustworthy guards

794
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,030
to come with me

795
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,400
to Haitang House.

796
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,760
Madam.

797
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,550
Fangqin sent word

798
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,400
that Old Madam
didn't sleep well last night.

799
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:12,510
She's resting today

800
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,989
and no one is allowed to disturb her.

801
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,280
Mr. Anmou and His Lordship

802
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:16,630
are also away for some business.

803
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,239
You two stay here

804
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,320
and make sure no one enters.

805
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,280
If anyone asks,
say there was a break-in.

806
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:22,960
Yes, Madam.

807
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:28,800
Search the place.

808
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,280
Yes, Madam.

809
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,110
Madam Xiao.

810
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,320
This is Miss Si's courtyard.

811
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,590
Why have you brought all those men here?

812
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,110
Since when do I need

813
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,510
to report my actions to you?

814
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,590
Here's the deal, Miss Aman.

815
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,469
I lost

816
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,800
a gilded bangle.

817
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,440
We've searched everywhere in the mansion

818
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,070
except for Haitang House.

819
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,960
So, I've come here to look for it.

820
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,670
All right?

821
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:49,840
Search the place.

822
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,840
What's with all this commotion?

823
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,440
Aunt Xiao, Si is still sick.

824
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,590
It's inappropriate for you to barge in

825
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,320
with all these men.

826
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,920
I will personally help you
search for the bangle

827
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,720
once my sister recovers.

828
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,280
Here's the thing.

829
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,670
The bangle I lost

830
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,440
was an heirloom.

831
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,550
It was given to me by my mother
as part of my dowry.

832
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,190
It belonged to my mother's mother,

833
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,840
my mother's grandmother,

834
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,510
my grandmother's mother…

835
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,800
In short,

836
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,240
it has been passed down for generations.

837
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,240
If it's lost in my hands,

838
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,400
what would I do?

839
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,070
The Count of Dongping's Mansion
is large,

840
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,070
with many people coming and going.

841
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,070
If some dishonest servant

842
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,960
took it

843
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:27,800
and sold it,

844
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,800
I'd never

845
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,550
find it again.

846
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,990
Don't worry.

847
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,590
I'll have them be quiet.

848
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,030
We won't disturb your sister.

849
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:36,800
Lower your voices.

850
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:37,630
Search.

851
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,360
Stay where you are!

852
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,840
I dare you to move!

853
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:46,470
What are you doing?

854
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,190
What…

855
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:47,960
What do you think you're doing?

856
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,720
Are you really going to fight me?

857
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,510
Aunt Xiao!

858
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,070
What is this?

859
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,360
Miss Si's medicine!

860
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,240
How could you be so careless?

861
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,190
Miss Si's medicine!

862
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:04,590
Look!

863
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,280
You were too careless!

864
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,280
Aunt Xiao! You…

865
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,550
What? It wasn't me. It was her.

866
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,280
Aunt Xiao.

867
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,720
Are you sure it wasn't intentional?

868
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,320
No wonder I woke up late today.

869
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,400
You actually dared to drug me!

870
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,760
Is there anyone in this mansion

871
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,470
you wouldn't dare to harm?

872
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,070
Mother,

873
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,720
you mustn't believe

874
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,070
Jiang Si's one-sided accusations.

875
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:41,760
Grandmother.

876
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,400
It was fortunate that Prince Yan

877
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,190
saw through Aunt Xiao's scheme in time

878
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,360
and replaced the drug

879
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,440
with a sleep-inducing incense.

880
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,280
That was absolutely not some drug!

881
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,720
It was just a calming tonic
to aid sleep!

882
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,590
Did you really think

883
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,760
that by making Grandmother sleep longer,

884
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,320
you could quietly dispose of my medicine

885
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,360
without anyone noticing?

886
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,800
First, you made me unconscious.

887
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,920
Then, you tried to destroy the medicine
that could save your niece's life.

888
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,590
There are both witnesses and evidence.

889
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,840
What do you have to say for yourself?

890
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:03,880
Mother.

891
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,280
Jiang Si is sitting there

892
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,880
perfectly fine.

893
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,470
What "life-saving medicine"?

894
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,280
What nonsense!

895
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,590
That's right, Mother.

896
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,190
Everyone can see it.

897
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,470
Si is completely cured.

898
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,440
She's unharmed.

899
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,510
Xiao just made an unintentional mistake.

900
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,110
Uncle Anmou.

901
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,510
She used the excuse
of looking for something

902
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,470
to bring people into Haitang House
to destroy the medicine,

903
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,240
which nearly cost Si's life.

904
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,150
And you still call that
an "unintentional mistake"?

905
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,400
Fangqin.

906
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,280
What exactly did you give me?

907
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,550
Old Madam, please discern the truth.

908
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,840
I would never dare

909
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,240
to drug you!

910
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,760
Who gave you the order?

911
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,510
Speak!

912
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,400
Speak!

913
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,630
It was…

914
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,440
It was…

915
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,110
Drug her?

916
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,280
Aunt, I can't possibly bring myself

917
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,110
to do this.

918
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,190
If you don't comply,

919
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,110
failing this task is one thing,

920
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,070
but we'll struggle to keep our footing

921
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,030
in this mansion.

922
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,800
But…

923
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,760
Right now, Madam Xiao is in charge.

924
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,280
You should think about your own future.

925
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,240
But if this gets discovered…

926
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,880
What are you afraid of?

927
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,840
By the time Old Madam wakes up

928
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,030
and the matter
in Miss Si's courtyard is settled,

929
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,920
who will know?

930
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,510
Who would dare speak up?

931
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,240
Think it through before you choose

932
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,920
what to do.

933
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,360
Why are you looking at me?

934
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,760
Mother, that wretched girl

935
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,590
isn't innocent either!

936
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,800
She knew Fangqin was going to drug you,

937
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,190
yet she went along with it!

938
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,030
She even pretended to be sick

939
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,320
and deceived everyone!

940
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,510
"Went along with it"?

941
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,360
So, Aunt Xiao,

942
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,240
you admit to your scheme?

943
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:38,990
Someone!

944
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,720
Take both of them away

945
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,110
and have them each flogged twenty times.

946
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,960
- Old Madam, we're innocent!
- Old Madam!

947
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,920
Old Madam!

948
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,190
Look at what you've done!

949
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:49,760
Mother.

950
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,150
Si, you are far too bold.

951
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,150
Using your own health as bait.

952
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,510
You threw the entire household

953
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,920
into chaos.

954
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,280
Just think

955
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,630
of your father,

956
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,760
who has been restless day and night.

957
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,590
It was my oversight.

958
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,400
I caused you and Father to worry.

959
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,280
After Prince Yan
brought me back to consciousness,

960
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,360
I realized I had been poisoned,

961
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,720
so I continued to feign illness.

962
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,110
Poisoned?

963
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,280
You weren't sick

964
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,590
but poisoned?

965
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,400
That's right.

966
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,070
And the person who poisoned me

967
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,190
was Aunt Xiao!

968
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,440
How did Ke die?

969
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,670
Ke's symptoms were exactly

970
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,800
the same as Si's!

971
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,470
You've harmed Si.

972
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,920
Did you use the same method

973
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,800
to kill Ke back then?

974
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:49,670
What?

975
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:50,510
Father.

976
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:52,990
What do you mean?

977
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:53,990
Is what

978
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,590
Ancheng said true?

979
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,030
I don't know.

980
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,190
I don't know.

981
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:00,800
I don't know

982
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,670
what Ancheng is talking about.

983
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,590
I don't know

984
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,670
how Su Ke died.

985
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,440
Mother, I truly don't know.

986
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,400
Was it you who poisoned my mother

987
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,800
and killed her?

988
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,470
Did you do it?

989
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,030
Tell the truth!

990
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,760
Why are you yelling at me?

991
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,760
Su Ke's life was destined to be brief.

992
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,630
She's been dead

993
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,550
for so many years,

994
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,800
and now, all of you are blaming me
for her death!

995
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,070
You say I poisoned her?

996
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,360
Fine! Show me the evidence!

997
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,550
Father!

998
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,470
The night before I fell ill,

999
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,670
you first had someone

1000
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,920
douse me in water.

1001
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,800
Then, you had them
sent over bathing supplies.

1002
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,360
After that, you gave me

1003
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,800
a bowl of ginger soup without poison.

1004
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,440
If my guess is right,

1005
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:44,920
the poison

1006
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,590
was in the bathwater.

1007
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,630
Si,

1008
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,190
you're speaking so convincingly.

1009
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,990
But I'll say it again.

1010
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,920
Whether it's the past or the present,

1011
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,470
if you claim I poisoned someone,

1012
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,630
show me the evidence.

1013
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,670
Have you ever heard of a certain flower?

1014
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,960
A dark red flower

1015
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,630
with yellow pollen on its petals.

1016
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,840
When dissolved in water,

1017
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,030
it turns into

1018
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,360
a very nourishing bath.

1019
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,070
I've never heard of it.

1020
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,990
Never heard of it?

1021
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,760
But wasn't it

1022
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,760
this very flower's petals

1023
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,030
that you prepared for my bath?

1024
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,630
Such an amazing
beauty-enhancing bathwater.

1025
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,630
I've prepared a bowl of it today

1026
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,030
for you to try it out yourself.

1027
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:36,840
Dear!

1028
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,590
Why are you so scared of it, Aunt Xiao?

1029
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,670
It's just clean water

1030
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,960
with some flower petals.

1031
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,670
Unless you do know

1032
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,360
that flower was actually poisonous?

1033
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,800
I never imagined Madam Xiao

1034
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,630
could be so ruthless.

1035
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,840
If I had contended with her
even just a bit more back then,

1036
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,030
my fate

1037
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,190
might have been worse than Su Ke's.

1038
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:02,990
Madam Ruan.

1039
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,400
Perhaps

1040
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,840
we should leave.

1041
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,110
Let's go.

1042
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,630
Mother!

1043
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,670
Mother!

1044
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,670
I have worked tirelessly
for this family my entire life.

1045
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,110
And yet, the main branch smears my name!

1046
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:21,920
Grandmother.

1047
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:22,880
This matter involves

1048
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,190
the truth behind my mother's death.

1049
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,590
If no one in this family
will uphold justice,

1050
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,280
then I will report this matter
to the authorities!

1051
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,550
We'll find the evidence

1052
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,030
and get to the bottom of this!

1053
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,800
No!

1054
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,470
Get up!

1055
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,110
Even now,

1056
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,800
you still refuse to tell the truth?

1057
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,190
Confess everything right now!

1058
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,990
Or do you really want us
to take this to court?

1059
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,550
You hit me?

1060
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,470
Why shouldn't I?

1061
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,110
If not for you,

1062
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,360
how could I have made one mistake

1063
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,800
after another?

1064
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,190
So, you really did poison her?

1065
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,990
There's no enmity between you and Ke.

1066
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:00,720
Why would you
do something so cruel to her?

1067
