193
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,240
- Great!
- Bravo!

194
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,870
Caiyun Troupe does live up to its name.

195
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,830
That was superb!

196
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,830
Madam Yi, Yan is missing!

197
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,320
It was great.

198
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
That was an excellent performance.

199
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,960
How could she be missing?

200
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,830
Wasn't she with you

201
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,560
all the time?

202
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,040
I was buying some osmanthus cake.

203
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,320
She went missing when I turned around.

204
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,080
The streets are crowded tonight.

205
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,590
Nothing must happen to her.

206
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,800
Madam Yi.

207
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,830
Commandant Xie.

208
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,400
What happened? Why the rush?

209
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,470
Yan is missing.

210
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,920
Can you help us to look for her?

211
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,680
Calm down.

212
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,560
How about this?
Let's split up and look for her.

213
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,080
All right. Thank you.

214
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,750
Zhu, search that area.

215
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,510
I'll search there.

216
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,750
Mr. Yu.

217
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,710
Why are you observing
the performance from here?

218
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,750
The view here is amazing.

219
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,750
The groom on the boat

220
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,110
resembled you.

221
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,870
Is that so?

222
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,200
Both of us have two eyes, a nose,

223
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,230
and a mask.

224
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,040
That's why we look alike.

225
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,590
What is this?

226
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
When I just came back,

227
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,350
Mr. Meng said he was sick.

228
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,230
He requested me

229
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,040
to perform on his behalf.

230
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,870
You didn't need

231
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,470
to expose me like that.

232
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,960
Is that so?

233
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,830
I insisted on doing it.

234
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,400
But why?

235
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,470
It's because I don't want you

236
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,350
to be married to someone else.

237
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,350
What? I couldn't hear you.

238
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,990
It's because I don't want you

239
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,960
to be married to someone else,

240
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,040
even if it's an act.

241
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,630
Madam, we're in trouble.

242
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,160
Feiniang had sprained her ankle.

243
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,750
What?

244
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,470
Miss Fei, are you okay?

245
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,800
What should we do?

246
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,960
The performance will begin soon.

247
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,400
Here, sit down.

248
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,280
Our priority tonight

249
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,200
is the Water Festival.

250
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,040
But the ceremonial dance,
the most important part,

251
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,080
is now impossible.

252
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,510
The Zhu family

253
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,830
is utterly embarrassed!

254
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,110
You're something else!

255
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,440
You knew that you had to perform,

256
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,680
yet you were still careless.

257
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,560
Where's Yi?

258
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,440
Where did she go?

259
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,960
Madam,

260
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,960
we've searched

261
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,320
the entire Yunshui House.

262
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,080
We never saw Madam Yi.

263
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,110
She must be trying to avoid me.

264
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,510
She wants me

265
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,040
to clean up her mess.

266
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,350
Where did Yi go?

267
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,160
She cares about
the Water Festival the most.

268
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,750
She wouldn't leave
without any valid reasons.

269
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,510
What exactly happened?

270
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,280
Yan?

271
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,560
Madam.

272
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,680
Have you seen a girl around?

273
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,590
Have you?

274
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,680
No.

275
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,830
Yan!

276
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,750
Have you seen a girl around?

277
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,470
No, I haven't.

278
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,160
Miss Fei,

279
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,800
is there anyone in the troupe

280
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,470
who can replace you?

281
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,110
The ceremonial dance is very difficult.

282
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,230
No one in the troupe can replace me.

283
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,400
By chance, I learned some dances

284
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,470
in my childhood.

285
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,630
All this while, I've been serving

286
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,160
the troupe in Yunshui House.

287
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,350
I saw Miss Fei's dance before.

288
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,320
I may give it a try.

289
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,400
Excellent.

290
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,750
What do you think? Isn't it nice?

291
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,320
It's pretty good.

292
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,110
First, Yanniang got an allergy.

293
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,830
After that, Miss Fei sprained her ankle.

294
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,630
Coincidentally, she can perform
the ceremonial dance.

295
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,110
I don't believe
that all of these are mere coincidences.

296
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,630
Miss Fei said

297
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,560
Chinese yam extract triggers her asthma.

298
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,080
Once she suffers a relapse,
she'll lose all strength.

299
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,990
Therefore, Qing'er's

300
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,750
initial target

301
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,630
was Miss Fei.

302
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,990
Yanniang just applied the lip balm

303
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,470
with Chinese yam extract by accident.

304
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,920
I never expected her

305
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,080
to catch hold of this opportunity.

306
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,280
First, she made your sister
commit a mistake.

307
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,710
After that, she came to the rescue.

308
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,630
With this opportunity, she could
show herself to the Zhu family.

309
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,400
That Qing'er is no simpleton.

310
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,800
We have no time to waste.

311
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,870
I'll go find Yi.

312
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,200
Keep an eye on Qing'er.

313
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,280
Let's split up and act.

314
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,510
Be careful.

315
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,960
Yan!

316
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,560
Yinlou!

317
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,560
Miss Jiang.

318
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,350
Have you seen Yi around?

319
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,870
She thought Yan had gone missing.

320
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,110
She should be searching for her.

321
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
Yan, who were you with?

322
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,110
How did you get lost?

323
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,410
That's not it.

324
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,990
[Yan, Jiang Yi's daughter]
I fell asleep.

325
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,960
I only saw Uncle Xie when I woke up.

326
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,510
Seems like Yan

327
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,400
didn't get lost on her own.

328
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,990
Someone must've
taken her away on purpose.

329
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,590
But why?

330
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:17,960
I know now.

331
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,230
They did so to lure my sister away.

332
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,400
Let's split up

333
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,280
and find them as soon as possible.

334
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:23,750
Okay.

335
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,160
Take her with you.

336
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,990
Okay.

337
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,350
Yan, be a good girl.

338
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,280
Let's go.

339
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,350
Yi?

340
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,990
Yi!

341
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,990
Feiniang can't perform now.

342
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,320
Since Qing'er has already
achieved her goal,

343
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
what's the point

344
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,080
of luring Yi away?

345
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,990
Great!

346
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,350
You wretch!

347
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,160
How could you be this careless?

348
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,470
Mother.

349
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:14,870
Let me take you to the room.

350
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,590
Yan?

351
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,280
Yan?

352
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,630
Yi?

353
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,320
Yi?

354
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,870
Wake up.

355
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,590
Where's Yan?

356
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,920
Where's Yan?

357
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,680
Yan is fine.

358
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,710
Don't worry.

359
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,750
Yi, what happened?

360
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,230
Yi's asthma was acting up.

361
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,920
I brought her here to rest.

362
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,040
Asthma?

363
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,200
Useless.

364
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,990
Of all the times

365
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,280
to suffer a relapse.

366
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,990
I'll hire a physician

367
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,870
to check on her.

368
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,630
Mother, there's no rush
for you to get changed.

369
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,920
Let's take Yi back

370
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,680
to the mansion for now.

371
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,510
Why?

372
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,800
Are you heartbroken
just because she's coughing?

373
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,030
Do you know how old I am?

374
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,230
Don't you think I'll catch a cold

375
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,640
if I don't change
out of these wet clothes?

376
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,400
Go.

377
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:03,960
Bring me

378
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,990
my outfit.

379
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,510
Yes, Madam.

380
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,119
Why...

381
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,310
Why is there a man over here?

382
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,160
Mr. Meng?

383
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,920
Close the door.

384
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,400
Do not let anyone in.

385
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,310
Go!

386
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:39,840
Yes, Madam Zhu.

387
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,960
Close the door.

388
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,400
Do not let anyone in.

389
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,030
Yi.

390
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,120
What exactly is going on?

391
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,640
What is he doing here?

392
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,030
You wretch.

393
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:57,960
How dare you

394
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,640
have an affair with a troupe member?

395
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,920
You even told your sister

396
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,880
to cover up for you.

397
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,790
Mother, that's not true.

398
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,400
I came here to find Yan.

399
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,510
I have no idea

400
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,790
why he's here either.

401
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,550
Dear, trust me.

402
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,200
Trust you?

403
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,270
Your lover is already here.

404
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,270
We already caught you red-handed.

405
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,230
How dare you still deny it?

406
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,440
I'll kill you!

407
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,160
Madam Zhu!

408
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,600
You...

409
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,880
What do you mean by this?

410
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
What do I mean?

411
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,310
Ziyu,

412
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,070
you have

413
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,270
to get to the bottom of this.

414
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,230
If you

415
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,960
malign my sister

416
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
without finding out the truth,

417
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,270
you'll be embarrassed as well.

418
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,400
There are only three people in the room.

419
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,360
You're saying it's not Yi, huh?

420
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,200
Could it be you, then?

421
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,790
This has nothing to do with Si.

422
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,550
It has nothing to do with her?

423
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,360
Did you say you were maligned?

424
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,880
Are you saying that a grown man like him

425
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,310
entered the room by himself?

426
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,550
It was me.

427
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
I was the one meeting him in private.

428
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,960
It has nothing to do with them.

429
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,360
Meng and I were supposed
to meet in private.

430
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,640
We didn't want Madam Yi

431
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,880
and Miss Si to bump into us.

432
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Meng panicked.

433
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,960
He fell unconscious
after falling off the bed by accident.

434
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,880
I begged them

435
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,710
to hide the truth for me.

436
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,920
That's why
the misunderstanding occurred.

437
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,470
I'm truly sorry.

438
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,470
Yi.

439
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,400
I panicked just now.

440
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,790
I blamed you

441
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
before I figured out the whole story.

442
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,360
When Mr. Meng wakes up,

443
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,600
I'm going to get the truth out of him.

444
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,920
And then, I'll clear your name.

445
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,990
So, you still don't trust me, huh?

446
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,470
Miss Qing'er.

447
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,600
Where are you going?

448
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,070
Madam Zhu?

449
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,160
Mr. Zhu.

450
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,750
Mr. Meng.

451
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,710
Be honest with us

452
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,640
and tell us who you were supposed

453
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,600
to meet in private.

454
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,270
If you dare to lie,

455
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,990
the Zhu family

456
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,270
will make you
bite off more than you can chew.

457
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,470
It was Madam Yi.

458
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,680
How could it be me?

459
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,510
I haven't even spoken to you before.

460
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,880
Madam Yi sent her maid

461
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,600
to notify me.

462
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,920
She said that she had admired me
for a long time.

463
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,710
She said she would kick Caiyun Troupe

464
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,880
out of Lingshui

465
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,160
if I didn't meet her here.

466
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,440
That's nonsense.

467
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,200
Since when did I admire you?

468
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,600
Why are you trying to frame me?

469
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,840
Yi.

470
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,030
Let me ask you this.

471
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,710
You said Yi sent her maid

472
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,710
to notify you, right?

473
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,160
Was it Qing'er?

474
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,230
Miss, why are you asking me

475
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,360
when you know the answer?

476
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,120
Nonsense!

477
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,360
Qing'er just joined
the family not long ago.

478
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,550
If Yi truly wanted

479
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,680
to do something discreet as such,

480
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,360
she'd send someone she could trust.

481
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:41,880
Why would she send Qing'er?

482
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,120
It was Qing'er.

483
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,710
She framed me.

484
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,960
She lured me here

485
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,360
using Yan.

486
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,030
Yan is over there.

487
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,550
Where?

488
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,310
Follow me.

489
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,510
Madam Yi, Yan is inside.

490
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,400
Feiniang.

491
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,600
You said

492
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,790
you came here to meet him in private.

493
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
But he said

494
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
he came here to meet Jiang Yi.

495
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,920
Who exactly is it?

496
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,790
Someone. Bring Qing'er here.

497
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,360
Yi.

498
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,440
How can I trust you now?

499
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,470
We've been married for many years.

500
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,070
Everyone in Lingshui

501
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,790
knows how well I treat you.

502
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,840
Each of you is sticking
to your own version of the story.

503
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,880
We can only wait for Qing'er's arrival

504
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,510
to prove your innocence

505
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,120
and locate the culprit
who tried to harm you.

506
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,270
Open the door.

507
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,750
Go inside.

508
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,270
Madam Yi instructed me

509
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,640
to send a letter to Mr. Meng.

510
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,990
She said
I wouldn't arouse any suspicions

511
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,230
since I was new to the family.

512
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,440
She said she would send me

513
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,880
to Ling'an after tonight.

514
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,030
Ling'an is way better than Lingshui.

515
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,920
Qing'er, what are you saying?

516
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,270
I should've heeded
Si's advice back then.

517
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,990
I shouldn't have taken you in.

518
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,990
I never expected you to be this devious

519
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,030
when you're this young.

520
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,310
Madam Yi.

521
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,310
I know that I'm indebted to you.

522
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,360
But this is a huge deal.

523
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,310
I cannot hide the truth.

524
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,200
Mr. Zhu, Madam Zhu,

525
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,360
just now, I was performing

526
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,160
on Miss Fei's behalf.

527
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,230
Everyone witnessed it.

528
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,990
How could I possibly

529
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,200
bring Madam Yi here?

530
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,270
That's right.

531
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,270
She was dancing

532
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,400
when I left my seat.

533
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,750
How could it be her?

534
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:38,880
Jiang Yi,

535
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,270
you shameless wretch.

536
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,470
To think that I believed you

537
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,510
to be a rule-abiding person

538
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,310
and that you would never
do such a despicable deed.

539
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,880
I was truly blind.

540
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,400
Since it has come to this,

541
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,030
what else do you
have to say for yourself?

542
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,360
You've ruined the reputation

543
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,960
of the Zhu family!

544
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,640
Mother!

545
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
That's not true!

546
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,310
You must trust me!

547
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,230
I didn't do it!

548
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,550
Be careful.

549
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,750
Qing'er,

550
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,120
although I don't know

551
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,550
how you misdirected us,

552
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,960
you have to remember this.

553
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,960
If you ruin my sister's reputation,

554
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,600
it'll ruin her life.

555
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,200
You should know fully well

556
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,310
how nice my sister treated you.

557
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,510
If you still have a conscience,

558
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,440
you should tell us

559
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,470
the truth.

560
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,790
If you still dare to tell blatant lies

561
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,600
and slander her,

562
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,200
I'll report you to the authorities.

563
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,200
If the authorities in Lingshui
cannot handle it,

564
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,840
I'll report you to Ling'an City.

565
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,510
What?

566
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,360
Your sister has already committed

567
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,440
such a shameful deed.

568
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,750
You intend to report her
to the authorities?

569
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,070
Have you lost your mind?

570
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,750
Madam Zhu,

571
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,550
Yi already said

572
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,200
that she didn't do it.

573
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,200
That means she didn't.
Don't you understand?

574
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:43,710
You...

575
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,550
Miss Si.

576
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,750
Do you need to resort to this?

577
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,750
Well...

578
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,600
No matter what Yi has done,

579
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,120
she'll always be Yan's mother.

580
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,750
She's my wife.

581
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,470
Let's settle this

582
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,680
behind closed doors.

583
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,640
Don't spread the word.

584
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,600
Seriously?

585
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,880
Ziyu, listen.

586
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,120
My sister has said

587
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,470
that she didn't do it.

588
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,790
That means she didn't.

589
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,400
Do you understand?

590
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,270
Fine.

591
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,270
She said she didn't do it

592
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,680
and that Qing'er lured her here.

593
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,840
But Qing'er

594
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,310
was performing during that moment.

595
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,440
Does she have the ability
to split herself?

596
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,790
Naturally, that's not the case.

597
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,480
[Yu'er]

598
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,270
Wait...

599
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,200
Why are there two Qing'ers?

600
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,310
It's because she's the one on the stage.

601
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,400
Now, I understand.

602
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,600
These two are twin sisters.

603
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,070
Madam Zhu,

604
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,680
I'm sure you understand now.

605
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,680
One of them was performing
the dance on Feiniang's behalf.

606
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,470
The other

607
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,640
lured my sister here.

608
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
Their goal was to leave my sister

609
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,840
with no way to defend herself.

610
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,070
What a vicious plot.

611
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,680
Mr. Yu,

612
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,070
please send these two individuals

613
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,120
to the authorities.

614
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,270
And this person.

615
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,160
No!

616
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,230
Long Dan.

617
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,880
Not me!

618
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,790
It was her! She gave me the letter!

619
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,680
I didn't see

620
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,360
Madam Yi's face clearly.

621
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,120
She impersonated Madam Yi.

622
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,030
It was their fault!

623
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,550
It has nothing to do with me!

624
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,790
I can see why you're an actor.

625
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,750
You can act on the spot.

626
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,360
Qing'er,

627
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,640
now, all the blame

628
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,030
has been shifted to you and your sister.

629
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,920
Do you not wish to defend yourself?

630
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,310
Seems like my wife and I

631
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,470
were tricked by them.

632
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,600
You tried

633
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,030
to get close to me
for the past few days.

634
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,440
I already told you

635
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,710
to drop the thought.

636
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,710
Yi was the only one I loved.

637
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,200
But you tried to harm her

638
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,600
with such a vicious plot.

639
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,790
At this point,

640
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,710
what else do you
have to say for yourself?

641
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,510
It was my wishful thinking!

642
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,160
I came up with the plot myself!

643
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,600
It has nothing to do with other people!

644
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,600
It's the same for my sister!

645
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,550
She was kept in the dark!

646
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,600
She merely performed a dance

647
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,840
under my instruction!

648
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,200
It's all my fault!

649
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,160
Feiniang!

650
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,360
I'm begging you! Please!

651
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,310
I'll break your legs if you dare to step

652
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,230
into the Caiyun Troupe again!

653
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,120
Miss Fei! Yanniang!

654
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,750
It's just a stupid troupe.

655
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,270
You think I want to stay here?

656
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,230
If they don't welcome me,

657
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,310
I'll find my own place.

658
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,840
[Dressing Room, the hour of Hai]
First, the lip balm was mixed

659
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,510
[Jiang Yi]
with Chinese yam extract.

660
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,510
After that,

661
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,160
my dance shoes
were slathered with pork lard.

662
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,550
When I gave it some thought,

663
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,200
I knew that I was their target.

664
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,750
That would make Meng Nan
the prime suspect.

665
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,680
Indeed.

666
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,640
I found this note

667
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,600
in the multi-compartment box

668
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,960
he brought.

669
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,270
But the content of the note

670
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,230
doesn't prove anything.

671
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,160
That's why

672
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,960
I didn't take it out just now.

673
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,360
Someone else
was pulling the strings indeed.

674
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:03,920
Miss Fei,

675
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,920
there's one thing I don't understand.

676
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,440
I heard

677
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,070
that you always cared
about your reputation.

678
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,680
But you made a fake confession
saying that you were

679
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,470
supposed to meet Meng Nan in private

680
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,680
in order to help my sister out.

681
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,400
Why did you do so?

682
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,790
I do care about reputation.

683
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,920
But my concerns extend beyond myself.

684
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
I also care
about the Caiyun Troupe's reputation.

685
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,510
Meng Nan was a member
of the Caiyun Troupe.

686
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,680
If I allowed him to get his way

687
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,270
and ruin your sister's future,

688
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,710
Caiyun Troupe

689
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,920
would end up as a laughing stock.

690
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,200
It'll be hard for us to perform again.

691
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,750
Miss Fei, thank you
for your righteousness.

692
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,310
Yi.

693
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,640
Are you okay?

694
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,750
I'm fine.

695
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,510
Let's return.

696
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
Yan is at home.

697
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,880
I'm afraid

698
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,230
she won't sleep until she sees me.

699
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,030
Yi.

700
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,070
Yi, you're smoothing things over

701
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,960
for Yan's sake, am I right?

702
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,030
It's nothing major anyway.

703
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,360
It's good enough

704
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,400
as long as we send
that troublemaker Qing'er

705
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,400
to the authorities.

706
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,070
Yi,

707
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,750
do you truly think

708
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,310
that the plot tonight

709
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
was hatched

710
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,510
by a lass we found in the mountains?

711
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,880
Although Madam Zhu

712
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,400
has a grudge against you,

713
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
she believed

714
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,640
that you would never

715
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,550
commit such a deed.

716
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
But Zhu Ziyu?

717
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:47,510
It appeared

718
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,200
he was on your side, defending you.

719
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,550
But really,

720
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,230
he was just making things worse
with everything he said.

721
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,200
First, he angered Madam Zhu

722
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,960
and requested her to get changed.

723
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,030
His true goal

724
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,920
was to head to the wardrobe

725
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,160
and see if anyone was hiding inside.

726
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,160
Next,

727
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,680
although Feiniang already confessed

728
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,640
that she was
meeting Meng Nan in private,

729
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,030
he insisted on waiting
for Meng Nan to wake up

730
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,880
so that he could question him.

731
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,120
Lastly, when we tried to send

732
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,440
Qing'er and her sister
to the authorities,

733
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,750
he tried his best to stop us...

734
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,270
Si.

735
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,400
That's enough.

736
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,960
Yi, I have to tell you the truth.

737
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,030
I know

738
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,070
that you understand everything.

739
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,070
But you're just not willing to admit it.

740
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,600
First, our carriage
almost fell off the cliff.

741
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,990
Today, you were maligned
for meeting a performer in private.

742
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,640
Who knows

743
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,400
what kind of despicable means

744
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,470
he'll resort to next?

745
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,270
I was wondering

746
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,640
if he would blackmail you

747
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,880
using Yan after this.

748
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,600
We've been married for seven years.

749
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,470
How could he disregard

750
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,310
our marital bond just like that?

751
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,400
Why is he doing this to me?

752
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,400
What exactly have I done wrong?

753
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,510
Yi,

754
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,470
how could this be your fault?

755
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,200
The villains are the ones at fault

756
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,790
for committing evil deeds.

757
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,840
Do not find faults

758
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,990
with yourself.

759
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,440
Zhu Ziyu

760
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,710
is too good at pretending.

761
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,960
I'm sure

762
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,470
you were just getting by

763
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,710
without pursuing responsibilities.

764
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,160
That's why you don't even know

765
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,750
why he tried to harm you.

766
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,990
Therefore, there's one thing

767
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,310
we need
to get to the bottom of by tonight.

768
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
We need to make you see

769
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,750
the kind of person

770
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,990
you've gotten married to.

771
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,710
Zhu Ziyu met up with a woman.

772
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,030
Did you see what she looked like?

773
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,230
No.

774
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,310
She had bodyguards.

775
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,550
I didn't want to alert them
to our presence.

776
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,960
That's why I came back
to notify you all.

777
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,510
But

778
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,640
the getup of her maids

779
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,640
looked more posh

780
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,400
than noble ladies.

781
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,790
Therefore, that woman

782
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,920
is either rich or noble.

783
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,880
Could it be that Zhu Ziyu

784
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,360
has associated himself
with a noble lady?

785
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,360
Perhaps he risked everything

786
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,360
to harm my sister

787
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,840
so that he could make the noble lady

788
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,440
his official wife.

789
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,880
Zhu Ziyu

790
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
is an educated individual,

791
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,360
yet he committed such despicable deeds.

792
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,030
They've been married for seven years.

793
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,470
How could he do this to her?

794
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,990
Commandant Xie, calm down.

795
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,750
It's just an assumption.

796
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:38,960
Sir.

797
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,750
Meng Nan is spreading rumors

798
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:41,920
that the young madam of the Zhu family

799
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,710
had an affair with him.

800
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,550
That animal!

801
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,360
Don't worry.

802
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,640
I'll capture him right away!

803
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,440
Let's go!

804
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,030
Yinlou

805
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,510
has a short temper, huh?

806
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,030
This is simple.

807
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,270
Just capture him.

808
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,200
He'll confess
if you press a sword against his neck.

809
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,920
Did you forget
that you're the Commandant

810
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,640
of the Capital Administration Office?

811
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:05,920
How could an official like you

812
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,120
act so recklessly?

813
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,640
Right now,

814
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,550
I'm just your bodyguard.

815
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,070
Give me the order,

816
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
and I'll execute it.

817
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,230
Is there a way

818
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,600
to bait both of these lurking dangers

819
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,510
into revealing themselves

820
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,030
at the same time?

821
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,270
Meng Nan

822
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,840
doesn't know the woman's identity.

823
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,030
He's an abandoned pawn too.

824
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,790
You want to lure her out by using him?

825
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,230
It's difficult.

826
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,550
But Zhu Ziyu

827
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,710
is hiding himself so well.

828
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,710
They have

829
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,310
an informant,

830
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,470
without a doubt.

831
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,580
[Zhu Mansion]

832
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,400
Here.

833
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,030
Qing'er, sit down.

834
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:11,989
What are you up to?

835
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,070
Don't worry.

836
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,320
I came here

837
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,400
because I have a question.

838
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,239
Did you do everything

839
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,960
under

840
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:20,840
Zhu Ziyu's instructions?

841
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:22,960
I told you already.

842
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,760
I did everything myself.

843
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,190
I don't expect you
to rat him out anyway.

844
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,469
I just want to know

845
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,360
why he did so.

846
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,280
I have your indenture with me.

847
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,320
If you're willing to tell us

848
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,360
why Zhu Ziyu did all those things,

849
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,150
I'll return it to you.

850
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,760
You don't want your indenture, huh?

851
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
I'll tell you this, then.

852
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,670
I have another indenture with me.

853
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,960
It's your sister's.

854
00:34:59,320 --> 00:34:59,880
What?

855
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,150
Why would you have

856
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,150
my sister's indenture?

857
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,800
My prediction was right.

858
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,240
Zhu Ziyu was using your sister

859
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,800
to blackmail you, right?

860
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:07,800
I know.

861
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,990
Your sister was a dancer

862
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,510
bought by Zhu Ziyu from elsewhere.

863
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,150
You two have been separated

864
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,070
for many years.

865
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,030
Both of you only acknowledged
each other last month.

866
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,630
To my knowledge,

867
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,590
she's

868
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,630
your only kin.

869
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,150
You intend

870
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:21,990
to shoulder all of the blame.

871
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,240
But have you considered this?

872
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,320
Do you truly think
Zhu Ziyu will let you off?

873
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,440
Do you think
you can see your sister after this?

874
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,720
You're doing this
for your sister's sake.

875
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,070
Me too.

876
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,110
Your sister was abused by Zhu Ziyu.

877
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,470
My sister suffered the same thing.

878
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,190
We're the same.

879
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,720
We're trying to rescue our kin here.

880
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,720
Isn't your sister doing well?

881
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,150
She's well-fed and well-dressed.

882
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,030
Is she?

883
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,440
You two framed her

884
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,840
when we were at Yunshui House.

885
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,510
Her life was almost ruined.

886
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,510
Only you and your sister know

887
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,320
about Zhu Ziyu's secrets.

888
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,720
You might know him better than me.

889
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,400
Think about this.

890
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,840
Do you think he'll keep you

891
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,440
or your sister alive

892
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,110
if he wants to ensure his safety?

893
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,960
My sister is his official wife.

894
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,960
Even so,

895
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,280
she's worthless to him.

896
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,720
What about you?

897
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,110
Do you think

898
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,070
he'll pay any regard to you?

899
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,840
You and your sister

900
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,070
have finally reunited after so long.

901
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,840
You two have suffered a lot.

902
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,110
Now, you two are reunited.

903
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,360
Is it worth it for you two to die here

904
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,470
after putting in so much effort?

905
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,470
Qing'er, I don't expect anything else.

906
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,880
I just hope

907
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,840
that you can think about

908
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,960
what I've said today.

909
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,670
Did she truly say that?

910
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,070
Yes.

911
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,440
Qing'er said it was her fault

912
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,840
from the start until the end.

913
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,550
She may not have confessed today.

914
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,720
But what if Jiang Si questions her
every day?

915
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,590
We

916
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,440
cannot keep Qing'er alive.

917
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,670
Is this how you run the household?

918
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,110
How could you

919
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,630
let Qing'er escape?

920
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,920
You're useless.

921
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,070
And,

922
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,760
do you know that Meng fellow

923
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,240
has been spouting nonsense about you?

924
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:23,840
Now,

925
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,360
the whole city is saying
that you're unfaithful

926
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,670
as you've had an affair with him.

927
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,760
You've utterly embarrassed

928
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,630
our family!

929
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,150
It's my fault.

930
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,150
Yi, what has this got to do with you?

931
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,590
Madam Zhu, you know this too.

932
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,110
Yi was framed.

933
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:39,920
Meng Nan is the one

934
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,150
spreading rumors out there.

935
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,510
How could you blame my sister

936
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,990
for the rumors?

937
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,800
Indeed. I shouldn't blame her for them.

938
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,320
I should blame you instead.

939
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,240
I didn't chase you out

940
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
on account of my in-laws.

941
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,150
Yi,

942
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,280
look at the amount of trouble
your sister had caused

943
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,400
after she started to live with us.

944
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,920
I heard that she had done

945
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,550
a lot of brazen deeds

946
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,590
when she was in Ling'an.

947
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,190
As long as she's here,

948
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,030
our family can never obtain peace.

949
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,360
You have to go by today.

950
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,360
You're not welcome here!

951
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,320
Mother.

952
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,990
You can insult or scold me

953
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,110
how you like.

954
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,280
As your daughter-in-law,
I accept my fate.

955
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,510
But my sister has come from afar.

956
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,320
No matter what,

957
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,670
you shouldn't speak of her this way,

958
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,630
let alone reprimand her.

959
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,920
I would've fallen off

960
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,840
a cliff and died

961
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,030
or been maligned to death
at Yunshui House

962
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,360
had she not come to my rescue.

963
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,470
Do you detest my sister

964
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,510
because she rescued me?

965
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,110
Thus, you're unable to get your way

966
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,630
and make my husband marry another woman.

967
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:41,880
If so, you cannot pick

968
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,240
a girl who suits your every preference

969
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,110
and can deliver a male offspring
for the Zhu family, right?

970
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,720
You!

971
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,400
So, you were just pretending

972
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,880
to be subservient and virtuous.

973
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,320
You're the same as your sister.

974
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,360
You two are equally defiant!

975
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:55,800
Fine.

976
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,990
Today, both of you

977
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,920
will get out of my house!

978
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,150
I'm the official wife

979
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,720
who's properly married into your family.

980
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,920
If you wish to chase me out,

981
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,760
you have to make my husband divorce me.

982
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,240
I've been married into the family
for many years.

983
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,590
I prioritized my husband's
and his parents' interests.

984
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,630
I have never fallen short in virtue,
speech, demeanor, or duty.

985
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,360
Although I haven't given birth to a son,

986
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,280
I've given birth to a daughter.

987
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,630
I'm not without any descendants.

988
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,840
Under the Seven Grounds for Divorce,

989
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,150
which rule have I broken?

990
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:22,840
You...

991
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,510
The law of Zhou

992
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,960
punishes divorce
without violating the Seven Grounds

993
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,240
with eighteen months in prison.

994
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,070
Madam Zhu,

995
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,400
if the Zhu family

996
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,990
dares to divorce my sister
without any valid reasons,

997
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,990
our family will surely

998
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,630
report you to the authorities.

999
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,240
This isn't our first time
doing it anyway.

1000
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,800
By then, I assume your son

1001
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,240
will be sent to prison

1002
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,990
with his future ruined.

1003
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,470
I suggest you weigh the pros and cons.

1004
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,280
You don't get to divorce

1005
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,190
your daughter-in-law as per your will.

1006
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:51,760
You!

1007
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,030
You two, get out.

1008
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,960
Scram!

1009
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,240
Yi, let's go.

1010
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,720
Mr. Xie.

1011
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,190
If you wish to live,

1012
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,720
you better follow my instructions.

1013
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:26,550
I got it.

1014
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,320
Yan, come on!

1015
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,110
Yan, do you like this?

1016
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,990
I used to tell myself

1017
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,960
to endure everything
for the sake of harmony.

1018
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,590
But only now do I realize

1019
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,470
that lifting my restraint
is actually liberating.

1020
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,110
Yi.

1021
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,280
Thank you.

1022
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:55,920
Silly girl,

1023
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,510
everyone has limits,

1024
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,110
regardless of what they can bear.

1025
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,720
You are mine.

1026
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,240
Yan as well.

1027
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,150
Mother!

1028
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,360
Mother!

1029
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,840
I'm here!

1030
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,150
Come and play with us!

1031
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,030
Let's continue.

1032
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:13,720
Come on, Yan.

1033
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,360
Here.

1034
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,510
Mother,

1035
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:28,880
please don't be angry.

1036
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,990
It was wrong of me to ask you

1037
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,920
to bring up this matter.

1038
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,150
Ziyu.

1039
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,030
They're sisters.

1040
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,800
Naturally, they share the same bond.

1041
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,760
You and I are the closest.

1042
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,240
We have to stay united

1043
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,810
so that we can keep them

1044
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:47,610
in check.

1045
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,510
Yi promised

1046
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,920
that she would send her sister back

1047
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,070
after the Water Festival.

1048
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,470
But now, she's acting out of character.

1049
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,880
She even talked back to you

1050
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,880
for her sister's sake.

1051
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,190
Do I

1052
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,110
have to divorce her for real?

1053
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,880
Who told you to divorce her?

1054
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,440
Weren't you the one

1055
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,670
who kept telling me to divorce her?

1056
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,470
Silly man.

1057
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,510
I was just saying.
How could you take it to heart?

1058
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,880
I was once a daughter-in-law myself.

1059
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,720
I'll be honest with you.

1060
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,470
Apart from being sonless,

1061
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,670
there really isn't any fault

1062
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,550
to be found with Yi.

1063
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:21,880
You can't find

1064
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,720
another daughter-in-law

1065
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:24,880
in Lingshui

1066
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,150
who's as capable as her.

1067
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,590
If so, Mother, why did you

1068
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,630
still pick on her?

1069
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,960
What's wrong with that?

1070
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,960
Your grandmother passed away
not long ago.

1071
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,030
I've finally become

1072
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,920
a mother-in-law myself.

1073
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,550
Can't I show off

1074
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,760
my authority for once?

1075
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,360
Sometimes,

1076
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,800
I'm just angry at you.

1077
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,360
Who told you to always take her side?
