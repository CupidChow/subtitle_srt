We should make it a grand celebration.

189
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,840
Your Majesty flatters us.

190
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,520
Your Majesty,

191
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,560
is that the flower arrangement
from the Floral Banquet?

192
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,080
Yes.

193
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,680
I found this arrangement delightful,

194
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,320
so I had Nanny Duo

195
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,800
bring this "Spring's Rebirth"

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,200
back to Changning Palace

197
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,320
for good luck.

198
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,960
Princess Fuqing has arrived.

199
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,240
Your Highness, slow down.
Mind the threshold.

200
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,000
Nanny Hua,

201
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,560
you don't have to remind me every time.

202
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,800
I've stepped over this threshold

203
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,000
countless times.

204
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,600
Fuqing.

205
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Your seventh brother

206
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,320
and his future wife are here.

207
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,760
Greet them.

208
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,400
Fuqing.

209
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,320
I, Jiang Si, greet Princess Fuqing.

210
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,960
Jin.

211
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,920
Si.

212
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,560
Si has prepared

213
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,800
a fragrance just for you.

214
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,360
We hope it's to your liking.

215
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,520
Please try it, Your Highness.

216
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,760
It smells lovely!

217
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,080
Thank you, Si.

218
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,440
I wish you and Jin
a lifetime of happiness and harmony.

219
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,200
You're too kind.

220
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,520
Come on.

221
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,200
Your Majesty,

222
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,000
Her Highness' eyes…

223
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,480
Miss Jiang, you may not be aware.

224
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,960
When Fuqing was a child,

225
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,280
she watched the fireworks
with His Majesty.

226
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,120
The sky lanterns' brightness
hurt her eyes.

227
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,640
May Zhou be blessed

228
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,880
with peace and prosperity.

229
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,240
- May Zhou be blessed
- May Zhou be blessed

230
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,760
- with peace and prosperity.
- with peace and prosperity.

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,280
After setting off the lanterns,

232
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
I woke up the next day

233
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,960
and suddenly

234
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,480
lost my eyesight.

235
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,280
Your Majesty,

236
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,880
I have a request.

237
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,880
What is it?

238
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,000
I come from Count of Dongping's Mansion

239
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,280
and am unfamiliar

240
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,120
with palace etiquette.

241
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,480
I humbly request
Your Majesty's permission

242
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,120
to study under you

243
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,520
at Changning Palace.

244
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,440
So that I will not embarrass myself

245
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,120
at the wedding.

246
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,000
Absolutely not.

247
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,640
Mother.

248
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,480
Jin is the son
of Imperial Concubine Xian.

249
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,000
By custom and propriety,

250
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,560
Si should go to Imperial Concubine Xian

251
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,520
to learn palace etiquette.

252
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,520
Actually,

253
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,080
I had a disagreement
with Imperial Concubine Xian

254
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,080
yesterday

255
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,320
at Jinhua Hall.

256
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,840
I doubt Her Highness

257
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,160
would be willing to teach me.

258
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,920
Your Majesty is the head
of the six palaces,

259
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,400
the official mother of all princes.

260
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,760
If I can study under you

261
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,920
at Changning Palace,

262
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,560
even Imperial Concubine Xian

263
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,760
will have nothing to object to.

264
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,240
I only need three days.

265
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,520
Three days will do.

266
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,800
I sincerely ask
for Your Majesty's permission.

267
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,560
Mother, Imperial Concubine Xian
has always been arrogant and willful.

268
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,560
I fear…

269
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,120
Fuqing.

270
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,720
Miss Jiang has come to me
with this request.

271
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,720
I shall grant her this favor.

272
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,080
Consider it a wedding gift for them.

273
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,760
Miss Jiang.

274
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,360
I allow you to study etiquette
at Changning Palace

275
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,560
for three days.

276
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

277
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,840
Slow down.

278
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,960
Why do you suddenly want

279
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
to learn palace etiquette?

280
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,640
It was a spur-of-the-moment decision.

281
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,800
I didn't have time
to discuss it with you.

282
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,960
Then

283
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,720
tell me now.

284
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,200
Princess Fuqing's eye condition

285
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,400
is likely caused
by Nanwu's venomous insect.

286
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,160
Are you certain?

287
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,000
Almost.

288
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,240
If we follow

289
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,080
the trail

290
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,200
of Princess Fuqing's blindness,

291
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,120
we might be able

292
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,040
to find the Nanwu woman

293
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,760
hidden in the palace.

294
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,640
His Majesty has always been biased

295
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,720
toward Princess Royal.

296
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,280
The only way we can truly be safe is

297
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,720
by gathering evidence
that proves Princess Royal is colluding

298
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,280
with Nanwu.

299
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,440
Princess Fuqing

300
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,320
is clearly

301
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,480
a kind and reasonable young lady.

302
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
To be blind in her prime…

303
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,520
If we can cure her,

304
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,280
we will be doing a good deed

305
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,000
as well.

306
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,840
It'll be fine.

307
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,880
It's just three days. Please?

308
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,600
All right.

309
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,800
I'll pick you up in three days.

310
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,760
Your Majesty,

311
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,320
was the mole at the corner
of Princess Fuqing's eye there

312
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,160
since birth,

313
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
or did it only appear

314
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,640
after she lost her sight?

315
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,440
Fuqing was born without a mole

316
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,520
at the corner of her eye.

317
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,400
Now that I think about it,

318
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
that mole only appeared

319
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,640
after she developed

320
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
her eye condition.

321
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,680
Has the color of this mole

322
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,200
gradually darkened

323
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,240
over the years?

324
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,240
Yes.

325
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
But isn't that normal?

326
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,640
That's precisely why

327
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,920
such a small mole

328
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,960
wouldn't arouse suspicion.

329
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,680
Leave us.

330
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,960
What are you suggesting?

331
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Is Fuqing's mole

332
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,720
related to her blindness?

333
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,800
I once read about it

334
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,000
in an ancient text.

335
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,680
It's an insect known as the "Blind Bug."

336
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,400
It can reside in the human eye,

337
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,000
blocking the meridians

338
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
and shutting the eye's sensory pathways,

339
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,400
causing permanent blindness.

340
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,160
Your Highness's "mole"

341
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,160
is not actually a mole.

342
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
It's an insect infestation.

343
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,600
Really?

344
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,600
Are you saying

345
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,240
that my daughter's blindness

346
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,040
was not caused
by the brightness of the sky lanterns?

347
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,320
Could the bug

348
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,320
have entered Fuqing's eye

349
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,320
on its own?

350
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,440
This type of bug

351
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,840
must be carefully cultivated

352
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,840
before it can survive in the human eye.

353
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,000
You're telling me

354
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,880
someone deliberately plotted

355
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,240
to make Fuqing blind?

356
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,280
Yes.

357
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,560
Since joining the palace,

358
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,000
I have never felt jealousy
or resentment.

359
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,080
I have never made enemies
among the concubines,

360
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
nor have I treated

361
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,520
any of the palace maids
or eunuchs harshly.

362
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,040
I have done everything I could
to be kind.

363
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,040
Why would someone still want

364
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,400
to harm my daughter?

365
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,840
She is just a princess.

366
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,880
She has no power or claim to the throne.

367
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,520
Who would do something so cruel?

368
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:16,920
Your Majesty,

369
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,000
we must find

370
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,600
the one responsible.

371
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,160
If we find the culprit,

372
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,880
there is a chance
Her Highness' eyesight

373
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,680
can be restored.

374
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,680
Your Highness.

375
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,400
Jiang Si was punished when she visited

376
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,640
Imperial Concubine Xian yesterday.

377
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,680
Today, she accompanied Prince Yan

378
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,480
to visit Empress Di

379
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,400
and even stayed
to learn palace etiquette.

380
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,560
Well, she's certainly adaptive.

381
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,120
She knows Imperial Concubine Xian
won't support her,

382
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,880
so she's now trying
to curry the Empress's favor.

383
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,520
What a pity.

384
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,280
She chose the wrong person to rely on.

385
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,640
Return to the palace
and deliver a message.

386
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,080
Tell the Nanwu woman
to take care of her as soon as possible.

387
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,400
Yes.

388
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,880
Forgive me for asking this,
Your Majesty.

389
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,760
Before you became the Empress,

390
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,440
did all your former palace maids

391
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,640
also move

392
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,800
to Changning Palace with you?

393
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,920
Are you suggesting

394
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,400
that the one who planted the bug

395
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,600
is one of my old attendants?

396
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,480
This bug is difficult
to sustain in the human eye.

397
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,200
It requires careful nurturing

398
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
over time.

399
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,800
Princess Fuqing

400
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,400
lost her sight

401
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,200
shortly before Your Majesty
became the Empress.

402
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,720
So, I believe

403
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,320
the culprit must have come

404
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,280
to Changning Palace as well.

405
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,600
Back then,

406
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,880
no one in the six palaces

407
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,600
would have guessed

408
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,200
that I would become Empress.

409
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,560
I had no sons,

410
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,360
my family held no power,

411
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,960
and I was not favored by His Majesty.

412
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,120
I only had five personal attendants.

413
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,680
The only ones left from that time

414
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,600
are Nanny Hua and Nanny Duo.

415
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,440
Are you saying…?

416
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,599
Your Majesty,
please don't jump to conclusions.

417
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,359
This is merely my speculation.

418
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,520
It couldn't be them.

419
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,079
Nanny Hua has cared

420
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,319
for Fuqing

421
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,839
since she was a child.

422
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,000
She's always been extremely fond of her.

423
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,079
Nanny Duo, though ill-tempered,

424
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,160
has always defended me

425
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,319
when I was neglected and mistreated.

426
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,480
Your Majesty, it's time for your meal.

427
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,920
Nanny Hua, what's going on?

428
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,520
Your Highness.

429
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,680
The kite is stuck on the roof.

430
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,960
Is it broken?

431
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,360
Can we retrieve it?

432
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,440
Don't worry, Your Highness.

433
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,120
I'll get someone to fetch a ladder.

434
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,080
Princess Fuqing.

435
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,520
Si.

436
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,680
Your Highness.

437
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,720
I saw the kite land on the roof.

438
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,160
Yes.

439
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,320
I'll try to knock it down.

440
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,600
That would be great!

441
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,200
But Nanny Hua said

442
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,840
it's stuck quite high up.

443
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,320
Can you get it?

444
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,480
It is quite high.

445
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,920
Let me give it a try.

446
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,120
I got it!

447
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,120
I got the kite down. Look.

448
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,200
Is it damaged?

449
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,760
No, it's fine.

450
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,920
Only the string snapped.

451
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,400
Your Highness, please hold it.

452
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,680
I'll tie the string

453
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,800
back together.

454
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,360
Did you fix it?

455
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,680
Yes, it's reattached.

456
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,120
That's good.

457
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,360
If only everything in this world

458
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,040
could be mended as easily

459
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,600
as a broken kite string.

460
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,760
What are your thoughts
on the four candidates

461
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
recommended by Yu Jin?

462
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,560
Your Majesty.

463
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,360
Commandant Xie from Lingshui
is highly respected.

464
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,520
His division's annual assessments

465
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,240
are consistently ranked excellent.

466
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,680
However, I do think

467
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,720
there is one issue.

468
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,280
What is it?

469
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,520
I've heard that Commandant Xie

470
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,240
intends to marry

471
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,640
the eldest daughter
of Count of Dongping's Mansion.

472
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,520
That would make him

473
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,880
Prince Yan's brother-in-law.

474
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,000
Would that not be
an instance of favoritism?

475
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,520
You truly are rigid in your thinking.

476
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,720
Favoritism applies

477
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,120
when the person in question
is incompetent.

478
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,960
When it comes to true talent,

479
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,840
one must appoint the worthy
without avoiding personal ties.

480
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,240
Your Majesty.

481
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,320
Prince Yan emerged as a top candidate

482
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,240
through the Field Examination

483
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
and was appointed

484
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,520
as the Commandant
of the Capital Administration Office.

485
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,040
The people fully accepted
and respected his selection.

486
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,080
That is why I believe

487
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,720
the Capital Administration Office
is different

488
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,760
from other prefectures and offices.

489
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,960
Its role is crucial
to Ling'an's stability

490
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,240
and the people's trust…

491
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,160
Stop.

492
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,920
I didn't summon you to the palace

493
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,080
to listen to all this.

494
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,800
I misunderstood.

495
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,120
May I ask why Your Majesty

496
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,840
summoned me today?

497
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,800
Minister Zhen.

498
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,120
Look over there.

499
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,040
Who is the one flying the kite?

500
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,360
Is Your Majesty referring
to Miss Jiang Si?

501
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,760
Not her.

502
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,600
The one standing beside her.

503
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,080
Princess Fuqing?

504
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,320
Minister Zhen.

505
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,600
I appointed you as her tutor,

506
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,680
and you have been teaching her
for some time now.

507
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,600
How has it been?

508
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,160
I am honored by Your Majesty's trust.

509
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,240
I have had the privilege
of teaching Princess Fuqing.

510
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,560
Her Highness is highly intelligent,

511
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
diligent, and eager to learn.

512
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,080
And?

513
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,040
Her Highness is swift

514
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,280
in grasping the content

515
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,800
of the texts I teach.

516
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,440
She even extrapolates from them

517
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,080
and offers her unique insights.

518
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Her wit is admirable.

519
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,960
Think again.

520
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,440
Beyond academics,

521
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,080
do you have any other thoughts?

522
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:35,720
Yes.

523
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,880
Despite her noble status,

524
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,040
Her Highness has no airs of arrogance.

525
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,560
She treats the palace servants

526
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,880
with kindness and generosity.

527
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,560
She possesses a benevolent heart.

528
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,600
Is that all?

529
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:48,800
Yes.

530
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,840
The kite is flying!

531
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,600
It's up in the air!

532
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,040
Slow down!

533
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,680
Princess Fuqing!

534
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,120
Are you all right?

535
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,040
I'm fine.

536
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,600
Your Majesty, I lost my composure.

537
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,120
Fuqing is my beloved daughter.

538
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,360
She is also the most gentle

539
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,800
and well-mannered princess in Zhou.

540
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,600
I have always wished to find her

541
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,280
a principled and dependable husband.

542
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,600
Minister Zhen,

543
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,680
what do you think?

544
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,800
Your Majesty.

545
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,200
I do not have a suitable suitor

546
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,000
in mind to suggest right now.

547
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,120
But I will certainly keep an eye out.

548
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,680
You are a hopeless case.

549
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,600
What I mean is,

550
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,280
what are your thoughts about Fuqing?

551
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,080
Your Majesty,

552
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,480
Her Highness is of the noblest status.

553
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,920
I am merely a humble scholar.

554
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,920
I dare not have any improper thoughts.

555
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,560
So you're saying

556
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,800
you don't want to marry Fuqing?

557
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,000
I have always regarded Princess Fuqing

558
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,240
as my disciple.

559
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,280
Nothing more.

560
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,760
Mr. Zhen is unwilling?

561
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,040
I don't believe it.

562
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,400
Why would I lie to you?

563
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,240
I heard it with my own ears
in the Imperial Garden.

564
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,840
Her Highness is delightful.

565
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,080
Any man who marries her

566
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,240
would be the luckiest alive!

567
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,800
Everyone says

568
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,240
Mr. Zhen has a keen eye
for solving cases.

569
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,160
But if you ask me,

570
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,640
he is as good as blind.

571
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,400
Princess Fuqing is kind-hearted

572
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,240
and gentle.

573
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,040
Not to mention,
she is the daughter of Empress Di.

574
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,040
By rights,

575
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,240
the line of suitors for her

576
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,880
should stretch from Changning Palace
to Zhengyang Gate.

577
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,200
What are you two whispering about?

578
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,600
Nanny Duo.

579
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,400
- Please forgive us, Nanny Duo!
- We're wrong, Nanny Duo!

580
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,880
How dare you gossip

581
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,160
behind Her Highness' back?

582
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,400
- We're to blame, Nanny Duo!
- It's our fault!

583
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,560
[Nanny Duo]

584
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,040
Your Highness.

585
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
I failed to discipline them properly.

586
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,400
These two have spoken disrespectfully

587
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,160
and violated palace rules.

588
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,840
They should have their tongues cut out
and be sent to the Yeting Palace.

589
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,080
We won't do it again.

590
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,400
Please have mercy, Your Highness.

591
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,440
Her Majesty has always

592
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,120
governed the six palaces with kindness.

593
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,520
She disapproves of harsh punishments.

594
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,280
I think

595
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,160
they should be fined one month's wage

596
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,520
as a warning.

597
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,160
That is unacceptable.

598
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,480
If such a light punishment is given,

599
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,200
the servants of Changning Palace

600
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,280
will all follow suit

601
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,360
and gossip about their masters
without fear.

602
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,280
Where will order be then?

603
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,880
They were not gossiping maliciously.

604
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,480
There is no need to punish them.

605
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,480
Your Highness…

606
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,840
You are dismissed.

607
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,920
- Thank you, Your Highness!
- I appreciate it, Your Highness!

608
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,360
Your Highness.

609
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,600
Do not take their words

610
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,640
to heart.

611
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,280
I don't blame them.

612
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,240
Mr. Zhen did nothing wrong.

613
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,040
Who would want

614
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,280
to marry a blind woman?

615
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,680
Either way, I never intended to marry.

616
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,880
I want to stay

617
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,560
by my mother's side.

618
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,160
Your Highness, have you ever considered

619
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,040
that perhaps Mr. Zhen

620
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,920
does not mind

621
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,200
your blindness?

622
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,080
Rather, it is you

623
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,000
who is overly concerned about it.

624
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,960
Over time, this has become

625
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,040
a burden in your heart.

626
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,720
You are right.

627
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,880
It is indeed my own burden.

628
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,600
When I speak to others,

629
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,600
I cannot see their eyes.

630
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,240
How can I tell

631
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,640
if they are being sincere?

632
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,720
Perhaps, one day,

633
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,800
Your Highness's eyes will be healed.

634
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,160
When that time comes,

635
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,440
you can see Mr. Zhen for yourself

636
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,880
and ask him the truth.

637
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,120
Si.

638
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,160
Can you describe to me

639
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,400
what the sky looks like

640
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,520
right now?

641
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,920
The sunset
is especially beautiful today.

642
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,280
It's a deep red, like a glowing orb.

643
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,680
It's descending, little by little.

644
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,840
The clouds at the horizon are aflame.

645
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,920
A mix of orange, pink,
and purple.

646
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,200
I can imagine

647
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,280
how helpless you must feel,

648
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,440
living in a world

649
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,760
of darkness.

650
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,960
Jiang Si,

651
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,720
it is so lonely in this palace.

652
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,720
Other than Mother,

653
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,240
I have no one

654
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,960
to confide in.

655
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,280
No one has ever spoken

656
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,360
to me

657
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,120
the way you have today.

658
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,080
Don't worry.

659
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,080
From now on,

660
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,200
we'll have endless conversations.

661
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:13,760
I mean,

662
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,840
my brother and sister are older than me.

663
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,240
But I'm without a younger sister.

664
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,200
You are Prince Yan's sister,

665
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,000
which means you are my sister too.

666
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,440
I'll visit often to keep you company.

667
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,440
We'll share many secrets together.

668
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,240
I didn't see anything.

669
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,440
Aunt, I didn't see anything!

670
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,320
Really, Aunt!

671
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,240
I didn't.

672
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,280
I swear!

673
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,760
I saw absolutely nothing!

674
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,520
Your Highness!

675
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,760
It's me, Si.

676
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,800
Don't be afraid.

677
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,240
Did you have a nightmare?

678
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,880
Everything's all right.

679
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,560
It's me, Si.

680
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,920
You were saying

681
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,360
you didn't see anything?

682
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,120
Yes.

683
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,960
What could frighten you so much?

684
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,800
It's the Princess Royal, isn't it?

685
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,720
I said I didn't see anything!

686
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,080
Stop asking!

687
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,000
I saw nothing.

688
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,360
I can't tell anyone.

689
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,480
All right. Everything's fine, Fuqing.

690
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,200
Don't worry.

691
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,360
We will do

692
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,400
everything we can

693
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,440
to heal your eyes.

694
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,080
Don't be afraid.

695
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,560
There, there.

696
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,160
I'm here.

697
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,800
I'm right here.

698
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,080
Why so many dishes?

699
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,360
I doubt I'd go hungry

700
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,440
in Changning Palace.

701
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,760
I haven't been with you

702
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,960
these past few days.

703
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,600
I wouldn't want you to miss me too much.

704
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,120
Well? Any progress?

705
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,000
I've been observing these past two days.

706
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,080
Every time Her Majesty

707
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,080
mentions Princess Royal,

708
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,240
her reaction confirms

709
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,320
that their relationship is strained.

710
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,480
In fact, Her Majesty seems

711
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,800
to fear Princess Royal.

712
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,080
Princess Royal has conflicts

713
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,440
with many in the imperial palace.

714
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,200
The fact that she supported
Her Majesty's ascension

715
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,280
may not mean much.

716
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,520
Her Majesty could've just been easier
for her to manipulate.

717
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,360
Empress Di has no sons.

718
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,840
Her family holds no power.

719
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
And

720
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,880
she was never

721
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
greatly favored.

722
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,480
To Princess Royal,

723
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,320
these shortcomings might actually

724
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,960
be advantages.

725
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,960
They make Her Majesty

726
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,280
easier to control.

727
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,240
There's another thing.

728
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,480
Last night,

729
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,800
Princess Fuqing had a nightmare.

730
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,520
In her sleep, she kept calling out

731
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,480
"Aunt."

732
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,000
Then she kept repeating

733
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,080
she saw nothing.

734
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,200
The more she insists on it,

735
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,120
the more likely it is
she saw something important.

736
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,160
I suspect

737
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:02,960
it must be

738
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,120
a terrifying secret.

739
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,400
Fuqing was so terrified,

740
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,640
so she dared not speak,

741
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,440
fearing the Princess Royal's revenge,

742
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,720
and the potential harm to Empress Di.

743
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,920
Do you think Fuqing's blindness

744
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,440
has anything to do with this?

745
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,200
If the Princess Royal

746
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,640
placed a Nanwu spy

747
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,040
within Changning Palace,

748
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,160
that person could both

749
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,400
gather intelligence on state affairs

750
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,520
and ensure that Fuqing

751
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,840
never reveals the secret.

752
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,120
Should we

753
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,920
report this

754
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,160
to Her Majesty?

755
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,600
Do you think she would push Fuqing

756
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,000
to speak up?

757
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,200
Princess Fuqing
has kept this secret from her

758
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,560
for so many years.

759
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,080
The weight of it

760
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,440
must be unbearable.

761
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,840
We cannot

762
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,080
reveal it

763
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,240
to Her Majesty

764
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,200
without her consent.

765
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:51,960
Indeed.

766
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,680
For now,

767
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,320
the most important thing is

768
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,720
to find

769
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,800
the spy in Changning Palace.

770
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,480
We cannot let them continue

771
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,440
to terrorize the palace.

772
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,040
But Changning Palace

773
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,480
has many palace maids.

774
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,920
We'll need to go through
the palace registry.

775
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,480
From my observations,

776
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,000
I suspect two people.

777
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,600
Who?

778
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
Nanny Duo

779
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,320
and Nanny Hua.

780
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,680
These two have spoken disrespectfully

781
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,400
and violated palace rules.

782
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,120
They should have their tongues cut out
and be sent to the Yeting Palace.

783
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,040
Her Majesty has always

784
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,560
governed the six palaces with kindness.

785
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,640
She disapproves of harsh punishments.

786
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,680
Nanny Duo's family

787
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,360
once ran a martial arts academy.

788
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,840
She has some combat skills.

789
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,240
She rarely speaks,

790
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,720
is decisive in action,

791
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,600
and shows no hesitation

792
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,720
when disciplining maids.

793
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,160
Nanny Hua is an orphan.

794
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,360
She is kind

795
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,680
and always wears a smile.

796
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,240
She has never quarreled with anyone.

797
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,680
But Nanny Hua

798
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,400
only handles daily chores.

799
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,120
She has no reason to leave the palace.

800
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,880
On the other hand,

801
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,520
Nanny Duo works directly
for Her Majesty.

802
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,360
She has many opportunities
to come and go.

803
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,880
Not leaving the palace

804
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:52,960
doesn't mean

805
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
there's no way to pass information.

806
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,000
Carrier pigeons can do that.

807
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,400
Is that so?

808
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,040
I noticed scars

809
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,400
on Nanny Hua's fingers.

810
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,840
They look like scratches
from a pigeon's claws.

811
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,880
That makes sense.

812
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,240
Could Nanny Hua

813
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,320
really be the spy?

814
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,120
We must act quickly.

815
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,360
Let's go to Her Majesty at once.

816
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,200
Prince Yan,
you wish to learn etiquette too?

817
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,440
Yes.

818
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,120
Jiang Si grew up
in the Count of Dongping's Mansion.

819
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,040
Her manners
are far more refined than mine.

820
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,000
If she makes no mistakes

821
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,400
at the wedding but I do,

822
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,960
that'd be embarrassing for me.

823
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,360
But I can't stay in the palace

824
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,800
to study these things.

825
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,560
So, I'd like to borrow Nanny Hua

826
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,640
from you.

827
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,320
Nanny Hua?

828
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,240
What are you two up to?

829
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,640
I simply want to learn

830
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,040
proper etiquette.

831
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,800
I'll allow it, then.

832
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,840
Your Majesty, I don't wish to go.

833
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,400
Prince Yan has requested you, so go.

834
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,200
Your Majesty…

835
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,320
Prepare your things and go.

836
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,880
Understood.

837
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

838
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,680
Prince Yan.

839
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,480
Can I trust you

840
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,600
and Jiang Si?

841
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,800
Since my return,

842
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,000
you're the only one in the palace

843
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,640
who's shown me kindness.

844
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,160
You are a good child.

845
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,360
So is Jiang Si.

846
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,470
[Prince Yan's Mansion]

847
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,200
Nanny Hua.

848
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,280
We're here. Come out.

849
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,120
You gave plenty of excuses

850
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,640
before leaving the palace.

851
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,440
We've arrived at my mansion.

852
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,160
Stop hiding in the carriage.

853
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,040
Prince Yan, you misunderstand.

854
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,679
It's not that I'm unwilling.

855
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,080
I entered the palace at 13.

856
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,199
I haven't stepped outside

857
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,600
even once.

858
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,080
The world outside has changed.

859
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,400
I fear it is no longer

860
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,239
the place I once knew.

861
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,920
That's what troubles you?

862
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,480
Yes. Your Highness wouldn't understand.

863
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:29,920
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

864
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,080
Wait.

865
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,520
Your Highness,
the flowers in your residence.

866
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,040
They were common in my hometown.

867
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,880
Seeing them again
feels oddly comforting.

868
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,840
It seems Your Highness
has a deep connection

869
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,920
to Lingshui.

870
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,560
Where?

871
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,679
Lingshui?

872
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,520
Miss Jiang.

873
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,880
It's you.

874
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,280
Did you place the Blind Bug

875
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,160
on Princess Fuqing?

876
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,360
Yes, it was me.

877
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,480
How does

878
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,720
a Zhou noble lady like you

879
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,360
know so much

880
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,160
about Nanwu's Blind Bug?

881
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,440
How did you figure it out?

882
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,160
I see.

883
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,360
You have learned

884
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,680
too much.

885
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,840
I have no choice but to deal with you!

886
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,150
[Eternal Joy and Serenity]

887
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,520
Where is Miss Jiang?

888
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,480
She is in the back garden

889
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,360
with Nanny Duo.

890
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,440
Let her go!

891
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,200
I'm fine.

892
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,200
She is the Nanwu spy.

893
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,320
She can save Princess Fuqing.

894
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,960
She may be from Nanwu,

895
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,960
but I've confirmed that she was the one

896
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,320
who placed the bug

897
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,280
causing

898
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,480
Princess Fuqing's blindness.

899
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,920
Which means she has a cure.

900
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,040
What is the cure?

901
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,160
I was only helping Princess Royal

902
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,120
eliminate obstacles.

903
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,880
Nanny Duo.

904
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,400
I am the Saintess.

905
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,840
Do you serve me

906
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,200
or Princess Royal?

907
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,440
You decide.

908
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,000
My respects to you, Saintess.

909
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,400
Please forgive me.

910
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,440
I will obey your orders.

911
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,560
Now tell us

912
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,920
how to remove the bug.

913
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,840
It only requires a few medicinal herbs

914
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,840
from the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

915
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,360
That's all?

916
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,080
Yes.

917
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,080
Good. I'll take you
to fetch them immediately.

918
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,680
The extraction method is simple.

919
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,360
Wrap realgar powder in a blue cloth,

920
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,400
mix it with powdered pangolin scales
and snake gall juice,

921
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,880
dip it in heated liquor,

922
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,960
and repeatedly rub the acupoints
around the eyes.

923
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,560
The Blind Bug won't endure it

924
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,680
and will leave.

925
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,640
Miss Jiang.

926
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,360
Your Highness, I'm about to begin.

927
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,680
Remember this.

928
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
No matter how painful it gets,

929
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,960
you must keep your eyes shut

930
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,040
until I tell you to open them.

931
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,000
All right?

932
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,920
OK.

933
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:42,960
- Mother!
- Fuqing!

934
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,320
Fuqing, bear with it.

935
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,400
I know it hurts.

936
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,320
Hold on.

937
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,000
Fuqing!

938
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:48,800
Nanny Duo!

939
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:49,960
Fuqing!

940
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,920
Mother!

941
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,720
Fuqing.

942
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,400
Your Majesty.

943
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,480
Princess Consort Yan has begun

944
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,840
removing the bug.

945
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,920
Father.

946
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Stay strong!

947
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,080
Your Highness, we're almost there!

948
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,440
Nanny Duo, hurry!

949
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,000
Father.

950
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,560
The treatment is underway.

951
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,880
You shouldn't go in.

952
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,800
She's just a young girl.

953
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,160
Why must she endure such pain?

954
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,360
Jin.

955
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,240
The wounds you suffered
at the Southern Frontier.

956
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,600
Did they hurt this much too?

957
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,640
Father.

958
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,600
I am a man.

959
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:28,880
I do not fear pain.

960
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,000
It's all my fault.

961
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,200
I made you suffer

962
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,280
so much.

963
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,040
The Blind Bug has a will of its own.

964
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,600
It has lived
in Her Highness's eyes for ten years.

965
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,680
It knows

966
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,280
there is no better host than her.

967
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,880
If it's forcibly removed,

968
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,400
it will resist,

969
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,160
causing excruciating pain,
as if it's devouring flesh and bone.

970
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,680
The Blind Bug or Her Highness.

971
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,920
Whoever outlasts the other

972
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,160
will win.

973
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,600
Your Highness, it's almost done!

974
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,160
Fuqing, stay strong!

975
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,280
Mother!

976
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,520
Just a little more!

977
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,080
Your Highness, it's almost out!

978
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,960
Hurt!

979
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,040
It hurts.

980
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,360
One last time!

981
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,400
Your Highness, please hold on,

982
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,720
let's do the last time.

983
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,280
Your Highness, it's almost over!

984
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,480
It's out, Your Highness!

985
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,400
It's out!

986
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,400
Your Highness, don't open your eyes yet.

987
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,360
Here.

988
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,440
Fuqing.

989
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,240
Grand Elder. I have found the Saintess.

990
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,680
Your Highness,

991
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,080
you may open your eyes now.

992
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:07,840
Fuqing.

993
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,400
Fuqing.

994
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,760
Mother.

995
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,240
Your eyes.

996
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,320
My daughter, you have suffered so much.

997
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,880
At last, you can see again.

998
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,560
Your Majesty!

999
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,480
Your Majesty!

1000
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,160
Her Highness can see!

1001
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,320
Fuqing.

1002
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,240
Fuqing.

1003
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,720
Can you see me clearly?

1004
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,600
Father.

1005
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,200
You've aged so much.

1006
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,600
I have grown old.

1007
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,800
Way to go, Physician Jiang.

1008
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,480
Jiang Si. Jin.

1009
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,480
You two have rendered great service.

1010
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,000
What reward do you wish for?

1011
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1012
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,080
This is the first time
I have ever received a reward.

1013
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,560
Please allow me some time

1014
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,680
to think it over carefully.

1015
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,840
Very well.

1016
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,520
Let me have another look at you.
