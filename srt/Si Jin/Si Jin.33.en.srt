Impossible.

Why would I lie to you?

398
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,920
Miss Jiang wanted
an audience with His Majesty.

She is willing to share her husband.

400
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,640
She requested His Majesty

401
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,400
to forgive your intrusion.

402

you are a prince.

410

Even if His Majesty is furious
about your action,

411
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,000
he would never really execute you.

Mingyue.

576
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,960
Did you write the agreement?

577
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,040
No! I didn't!

578
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,320
I'd never

579
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,200
do such a thing!

580
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,200
It wasn't me!

581
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,160
Princess,

582
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
sorry to disappoint.

583
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,320
The copy you burned

584
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,520
was fake.

585
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,160
I'd never

586
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,640
let you burn the real copy.

587
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,040
Every word of it

588
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,600
was your affection for me.

589
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,840
I'd keep it with me
until the end of time.

590
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,960
Is the agreement real or not?

591
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,800
It's fake!

592
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,080
He's a liar!

593
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,280
I didn't write it!

594
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,760
It wasn't me!

595
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
Uncle, he's a liar.

596
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,480
Your Majesty.

597
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,920
It's not difficult to verify
the authenticity

598
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,920
of the document.

599
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,640
We only need Her Highness

600
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
to write another letter

601
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,880
and let me compare the two.

602
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:29,800
Very well.

603
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,600
I am Cui Mingyue, courtesy name Yazhi.

604
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,120
I am the first daughter
of Prince Royal Rong Yang.

605
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,560
Born at the third quarter
of the Chou hour,

606
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,680
on the 18th day of the fifth month,
in the 8th year of the Jingming era.

607
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,040
I am deeply in love
with the civil official Zhu Ziyu.

608
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,680
However, he is already a married man.

609
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,680
I should've severed the relationship.

610
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,560
Yet, Mr. Zhu insisted

611
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,560
his wife's actions met
the Seven Grounds for Divorce.

612
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,040
Mr. Zhu had intended to remarry.

613
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,880
Today, I write this letter as proof.

614
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,160
Once he divorces his wife,

615
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,800
he shall marry me.

616
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,650
[Agreement]

617
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,320
Your Majesty, please examine it.

618
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,520
Rong Yang.

619
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,240
Have a look.

620
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,800
See if the handwriting is the same.

621
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,480
It

622
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,000
does look similar.

623
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,240
Your Majesty,

624
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,400
upon examination,

625
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,440
the letters have

626
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,160
the same handwriting
from the same person.

627
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:08,760
Brother.

628
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,880
There are plenty of people

629
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,360
who can forge handwriting

630
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,240
for fraud.

631
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,800
If this letter was real,

632
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,000
why didn't Zhu Ziyu come sooner?

633
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,920
Why must he

634
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,520
interrupt the wedding procession?

635
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,400
We should ask him

636
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,360
who put him up to this.

637
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,720
Your Majesty.

638
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
I wish I could come sooner.

639
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,800
My father was a
Household Registration Officer in Lingshui.

640
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,000
He was framed for bribery.

641
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,480
My whole family was exiled.

642
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,080
On the way,

643
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,320
we were attacked by bandits.

644
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,800
Out of all 83 members in my family,

645
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,040
I alone survived.

646
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,360
How is this

647
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,720
related to your intervention today?

648
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,120
I survived a massacre,

649
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,160
and was devoid of hope.

650
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,960
My only desire
was to join my family in death.

651
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,120
But Princess Mingyue's promise

652
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,200
gave me hope

653
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,360
to live on.

654
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,640
I rushed back to Ling'an
as fast as I could.

655
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,000
But she was getting married.

656
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,440
I was...

657
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,000
Liar!

658
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,160
The Zhu family's tragedy
was months ago.

659
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,840
What took you so long
to get to Ling'an?

660
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,880
Stealing a prince's wife is enough

661
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,800
to get you executed.

662
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,720
Rong Yang.

663
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,160
How do you know

664
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,880
the Zhu family's death was months ago?

665
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,560
Brother...

666
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,200
I only

667
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,760
heard about it before coming here.

668

Zhen Heng.

669
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,560
In your opinion,

670
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,120
how should we proceed?

671
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,440
Your Majesty,

672
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,120
this agreement is authentic.

673
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,760
By the law,

674
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,640
Princess Mingyue

675
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,760
must carry out her promise

676
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,800
and marry the man.

677
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,560
No, Uncle!

678
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,400
My love for her is undying.

679
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,680
Please give us your blessing.

00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,680

681
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,040
Mother! I can't marry him!

682
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,720

683
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,160
even as the ruler of this realm,

684
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,280
I can't disregard the law.

685
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,440
Besides, upholding a promise

686
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,080
is the way of the royal family.

687
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,040
Since it's real,

688
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,640
Mingyue should uphold the agreement

689
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,320
and marry Zhu Ziyu.

690
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,000
No, Mother!

691
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,000

692
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,160
I don't want to marry him!

693
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,000
I want to marry Yu Jin!

694
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:24,720
Silence!

695
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,160
Had I known

696
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,000
you were engaged to a commoner,

697
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,920
I wouldn't have shamelessly

698
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,280
asked for you to be married to Yu Jin.

699
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,120
This is your doing.

700
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,840
You must bear the consequences.

701

and every family has its rules.

We decided on an auspicious time.

705
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,840
Is it too late for them
to get married now?

706
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,040
Your Majesty,

707
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,640
it's almost the time.

708
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,520
Now is the perfect time
to hold a wedding ceremony.

709
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,160

Princess,

729
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,440
you should apologize

730

to the Princess Royal.

I'm sorry.
