apart from the call

62

also called you. What was that call about?

00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:10,763

00:07:17,256 --> 00:07:19,710
I heard footsteps,

86
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,482
someone rushing out.

87
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,277
It's probably related to the case 7 years ago.

88
00:07:27,977 --> 00:07:31,560
Due to Lee Jin Seok,
the past case is being dug up.

89
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,283
That must be inconvenient for someone, right?

90
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:36,244
What about Dr. Cha Jeong Woo?

91
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:39,010
Lee Jin Seok bringing up the past case again,

92
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,977
doesn't seem like it's
convenient for you either.

93
00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:45,517
Regarding Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's case,
there is something like a secret

94
00:07:45,517 --> 00:07:48,417
that Lee Jin Seok shouldn't reveal?

95
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,044
Due to fingerprints on the murder weapon,

96
00:07:51,044 --> 00:07:53,650
footprints at the crime scene
and bloodstains on clothes and hands

97
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,110
for being at the scene,

98
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,777
Lee Jin Seok's statement about
seeing someone was ignored,

99
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,770
and he served seven years as the perpetrator.

100
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,716
Is Lee Jin Seok the real culprit?

101
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:06,926
I'm not trying to talk
about that case right now…

102
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:10,477
I found him first. There's a grudge.

103
00:08:10,477 --> 00:08:13,844
For that reason, does the trace of someone
I saw also become meaningless?

104
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:16,644
Am I the culprit

105
00:08:16,644 --> 00:08:18,844
of Lee Jin Seok's assault?

106
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:30,021
You were too hasty.

00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,093
I am the lawyer for Cha Jeong Woo.

108
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:37,610
It seems you've completely ruled out
the possibility of another suspect.

109
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,010
The evidence that there was someone else…

110
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,278
was not found yet.

111
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:45,310

114
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:53,077
and someone visited the house at that time.

115
00:08:53,077 --> 00:08:55,744
At the time of that someone's visit,
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo was

116
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:59,097
on the road heading to Lee Jin Seok's house.

117
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:13,010
This is the recording of the call at that time.

<i>You said that new evidence could
be grounds for an appeal, right?</i>

119
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:18,744
<i>What kind of evidence is it?</i>

120
00:09:18,744 --> 00:09:22,977
<i>Evidence that someone else was at that house
where the woman died, not just me.</i>

121
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:27,844
<i>First, you have to prove that the evidence
was at the scene at the time.</i>

122

<i>are you here…</i>

126
00:09:38,877 --> 00:09:42,850
Due to the nature of my job,
I have set up automatic call recording.

127
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,433
This should be enough, right?

128
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:56,144
I have received your report.

129
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:58,244
It seems we were too hasty.

130
00:09:58,244 --> 00:10:01,583
We apologize for the emergency arrest.

131
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,626
Yes.

132
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:07,177
Don't worry too much about

133
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:09,677
what Lee Jin Seok said.

134
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,510
Even the nonsense about evidence or memories

135
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,977
is all just to provoke the victims.

136
00:10:16,977 --> 00:10:19,310
Just ignore it.

137
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,444
Please, go back.

138
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:31,769
Don't turn off your phone

139
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:34,544
and don't go to places
where you can't be contacted.

140
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:36,444
Detective Seo asked me to tell you.

141
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:39,751
So, I'm still a suspect.

142
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:44,784
Yes. So, don't put yourself in danger
trying to investigate it on your own.

143
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:47,284
This is a request from a friend.

144
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:51,544
What is the evidence Lee Jin Seok talked about?

145
00:10:53,216 --> 00:10:56,910
Evidence that there was someone
else at the scene that day.

146
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,024
He didn't say anything else?

147
00:11:00,962 --> 00:11:02,611
Just one question.

148
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:05,011
Not as a friend, but as a lawyer.

149
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:09,304
What do you want to confirm with Lee Jin Seok?

150
00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:13,950
Before, and even today,

151
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,381
you seem very anxious.

152
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,950
My accident 7 years ago

153
00:11:20,744 --> 00:11:23,104
was in front of Hye Jin's house.

154
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:26,111
Not in front of the hospital?

155
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,044
Then…

156
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:32,610
Were you at Hye Jin's house that day too?

157
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,044
<i>I saw someone running out of that house</i>

158
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:38,710
<i>When I went in, someone ran out of that house.</i>

159
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,443
No matter what happens to me in the future,

160
00:11:44,443 --> 00:11:46,970
don't come running like you did today.

161
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,803
I don't want to cause you trouble.

162
00:11:49,803 --> 00:11:51,970
That is my request.

163
00:11:57,977 --> 00:12:00,910
<i>Dr. Cha Jeong Woo's alibi has been confirmed.</i>

164
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,944
<i>It seems like the culprit took the evidence
your brother told you about.</i>

165
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,577
<i>Cha Jeong Woo and I received
phone calls around 8 o'clock.</i>

166
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:14,210
<i>Then come over and I'll make
you remember everything.</i>

167
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,044
<i>Come home right now</i>

168
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:18,377
<i>I'll clearly show you that
Cha Jeong Woo is the culprit.</i>

169
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:22,477
<i>The call with the lawyer was at 20:15.</i>

170
00:12:22,477 --> 00:12:25,877
<i>At that time, someone visited
Lee Jin Seok's house.</i>

171
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:30,489
<i>Why are you here?</i>

172
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:34,744
<i>Then, Cha Jeong Woo arrived around 20:30.</i>

173
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:41,177
<i>Someone attacked Lee Jin Seok</i>

174
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:45,510
<i>during these 15 minutes and left the house.</i>

175
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:56,577
<i>The fact that they didn't bump
into Dr. Cha Jeong Woo means</i>

176
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:59,377
<i>there must be another way…</i>

177
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:08,310
<i>The only way the culprit
could have gone is here.</i>

178
00:13:28,944 --> 00:13:31,277
What are you doing?

179
00:13:35,577 --> 00:13:37,410
Do you not know how dangerous it is

180
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,477
for the prime suspect loitering at the scene?

181
00:13:39,477 --> 00:13:42,010
If I don't want to go from suspect to criminal,

182
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,156
shouldn't I catch the real culprit?

183
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,823
That's our job to do.

184
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:49,530
It's blood.

185
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,840
If the footsteps disappeared from the rooftop,
this is the only way there could have been.

186
00:13:55,444 --> 00:13:58,477
What exactly do you want to confirm?

187
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:07,110
I checked the records of
the accident from 7 years ago.

188
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,210
It was a traffic accident in front
of Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's house.

189
00:14:13,777 --> 00:14:16,677
I found out not long ago myself.

190
00:14:16,677 --> 00:14:19,744
That there's an error in my memory.

191
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:22,970
Do you want to confirm if it's really

192
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,289
the person Lee Jin Seok said he saw?

193
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:29,704
So you rushed here immediately
after receiving Lee Jin Seok's call?

194
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:33,071
The reason you are this anxious right now…

195
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:40,288
Is it because you're worried that you

196
00:14:40,877 --> 00:14:44,444
might be involved in the death
of Ms. Yoon Hye Jin?

197
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:54,169
Once the Lee Jin Seok case is solved,

198
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:56,944
we can talk.

199
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,744
<i>The reason you are this anxious right now…</i>

200
00:15:36,377 --> 00:15:38,344
<i>Is it because you're worried that you</i>

201
00:15:38,344 --> 00:15:42,044
<i>might be involved in the death
of Ms. Yoon Hye Jin?</i>

202
00:15:42,044 --> 00:15:44,010
<i>It's you, isn't it?</i>

203
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,688
<i>The guy who ran out of the house that day.</i>

204
00:16:06,043 --> 00:16:08,943
My face doesn't look like my face.

205
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:12,977
This face looks like mine.

206
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:15,377
Why did you come to think that?

207
00:16:15,377 --> 00:16:17,777
I don't really know the reason either,

208
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,544
I just have a feeling…

209
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,849
Due to a traffic accident last year,

210
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,510
I was injured and had facial surgery.

211
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,844
I have no memory before the accident.

212
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:28,944
But I happened to see this photo

213
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:30,577
and something just came to mind.

214
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:34,848
I feel like my facial injury
wasn't from a car accident.

215
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:40,044
What exactly do you want
to consult with me about?

216
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:42,278
This face seems right as mine, doesn't it?

217
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:45,015
What do you think, doctor?

218
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,444
The consultation I can offer

219
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:25,343
is about the plastic surgery
the patient wants to undergo.

220
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:28,737
For circumstances of facial
trauma or past surgeries,

221
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:31,344
you should talk with your family.

222
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:34,456
As for now, there is nothing I can say.

223
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:08,577
<i>[CCTV on the day of Lee Jin Seok's attack]</i>

224
00:18:08,577 --> 00:18:11,044
Is Mr. Lee Jin Seok okay?

225
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,210
They said he is improving

226
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,177
and expect he'll regain consciousness soon.

227
00:18:17,177 --> 00:18:19,244
That's a relief.

228
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,977
Is there any new development?

229
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,877
No traces on the fire extinguisher,
presumed to be the weapon.

230
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:28,510
And the footprints collected
from the entrance and rooftop railing

231
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,977
don't match Dr. Cha Jeong Woo's.

232
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,310
What about the blood found
in the collection box?

233
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,722
It's not Cha Jeong Woo's.

234
00:18:35,722 --> 00:18:37,707
Regarding the ex-convicts
around Mr. Lee Jin Seok,

235
00:18:37,707 --> 00:18:39,687
we ran a DB check, but all are mismatches.

236
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:41,177
<i>[Forensic report: Genetic bloodstain test
Cha Jeong Woo and 4 others: Mismatch]</i>

237
00:18:41,177 --> 00:18:42,477
Did they find blood?

238
00:18:42,477 --> 00:18:44,706
Yes, along the expected escape route.

239
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,054
But we don't have a comparison sample yet…

240
00:18:50,177 --> 00:18:52,477
Detective Lee, you are out of this case.

241
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:53,910
Investigation involving family…

242
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,510
Don't cause unnecessary gossip.

243
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:00,044
Lee Jin Seok's assault

244
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:03,010
it's clearly connected to
the incident 7 years ago.

245
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,145
I'll look into it.

246
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:08,303
Letting her go is a bit…

247
00:19:08,303 --> 00:19:11,277
Principles are principles.

248
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:12,903
Report right away if anything comes up.

249
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:14,969
Yes.

250
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,439
First, I'll collect all the CCTV
around Mr. Lee Jin Seok's house

251
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:27,137
and check them.

252
00:19:27,137 --> 00:19:29,344
The exact time of leaving the scene is clear.

253
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:33,444
If we thoroughly investigate around that time,
something is bound to come up.

254
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:37,736
Why go to the police station
instead of Bintan, like you were told?

255
00:19:37,736 --> 00:19:40,177
How far are you actually planning to go?

256
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:43,323
What do you mean by attempted murder suspect?

257
00:19:43,323 --> 00:19:45,410
Did you know?

258
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,044
About what?

259
00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:49,510
That my memory regarding the accident

260
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,786
it's flawed?

261
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,311
I didn't know.

262
00:19:58,444 --> 00:20:00,977
Anyway, what are we going to do now?

263
00:20:00,977 --> 00:20:03,850
The fact that Lee Jin Seok,
who denied the crime, was attacked

264
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,877
suggests that there might be
a different perpetrator for the incident.

265
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:12,210
We need to find who attacked Lee Jin Seok.

266
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,777
Anyway, what did Han Woo Jin do yesterday?

267
00:20:15,777 --> 00:20:18,910
Why Woo Jin? Now what, huh?

268
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:24,344
I was busy running around getting
a lawyer for Jeong Woo on the case.

269
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:27,810
I asked you to keep an eye on him,
so he wouldn't get into trouble.

270
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,430
Why?

271
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,444
Should we stick together
and monitor 24/7 or what?

272
00:20:34,444 --> 00:20:35,456
Can you move away?

273
00:20:35,456 --> 00:20:37,927
Yeah, it's a hassle for me too.

274
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,244
What is this?

275
00:20:41,244 --> 00:20:43,029
I thought it was a photo
from our middle school days.

276
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:44,937
Weren't our uniforms similar to this?

277
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:47,703
It's something a counseling
patient left behind.

278
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,462
Ah, it brings back old memories.

279
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:54,472
I received a call in the first year of middle
school, and that's when we found out.

280
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,210
I didn't know back then,

281
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,277
that my friend Cha Jeong Woo would
become an attempted murder suspect.

282
00:21:01,277 --> 00:21:03,636
Would they have known?

283
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,409
I have a consultation.

284
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:10,561
Let's go. Go.

285
00:21:22,344 --> 00:21:25,670
You also didn't know
about Jeong Woo's accident?

286
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:29,204
I was in Singapore for a conference that day.

287
00:21:30,244 --> 00:21:32,273
Uh… You returned the next day, right?

288
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:38,509
Did you hear anything in particular
from Professor Yoon?

289
00:21:40,536 --> 00:21:43,843
How about asking her directly?

290
00:21:43,843 --> 00:21:46,377
<i>[Madam]</i>

291
00:21:46,377 --> 00:21:49,210
- That's enough.
- Answer the phone.

292
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,450
Stay by his side for now and

293
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,579
take care of him, so he can't
think of anything else.

294
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:04,777
Jeong Woo's condition is really okay,

295
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:07,510
so don't worry too much, Madam.

296
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,709
Also, he is not the real suspect.

297
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:11,177
It just happened that way.

298
00:22:11,177 --> 00:22:13,044
<i>Right, let's talk again later.</i>

299
00:22:13,044 --> 00:22:15,610
Excuse me, please wait.

300
00:22:16,497 --> 00:22:19,484
I have something I'm curious about.

301
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:21,857
About Jeong Woo's accident…

302
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:24,077
Why did you hide it?

303
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:27,322
<i>That accident that happened
in front of Ms. Hye Jin's house.</i>

304
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,456
What good would come from being involved
with a dead person's affairs?

305
00:22:31,456 --> 00:22:34,523
I just wanted to forget about it quickly.

306
00:22:35,044 --> 00:22:37,310
Take care.

307
00:23:02,677 --> 00:23:04,677
<i>Because I need to know</i>

308
00:23:04,677 --> 00:23:07,644
<i>why you even manipulated it.</i>

<i>Ah, yes. But, why did you call?</i>

319
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:12,410
It's about the accident record
of Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's partner.

320
00:24:12,943 --> 00:24:17,383
Who did you pass it to
in the investigative team at that time?

<i>Detective Lee, you are out of this case.</i>

326

You must be very concerned.

for the inadequate investigation.

00:40:24,274 --> 00:40:28,244
it would have been the best choice
to get it done by the same medical team.

526
00:40:28,244 --> 00:40:30,766
Without any particular
abnormalities or problems,

527
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:34,408
we cannot perform surgery
for emotional reasons alone.

528
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:44,673
Doctor, there's a family member of the patient,

529
00:40:44,673 --> 00:40:47,699
who asked to stop the consultation.

530
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:50,033
What are you doing here?

531
00:40:55,473 --> 00:40:57,231
I'm sorry.

532
00:40:57,231 --> 00:40:58,566

Excuse me.

535
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,640
Let's talk outside.

536
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,800
What talk?

537
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,611
You're not even answering my questions.

538
00:41:11,926 --> 00:41:14,659
Let's go out for now, okay?

539
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:16,243
I'm going to have surgery.

540
00:41:16,243 --> 00:41:17,643
You never know.

541
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:19,076
If I get my original face back,

542
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,309
I might remember why I became like this.

543
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:22,576

544
00:41:22,576 --> 00:41:24,376

the face to its original state"?</i>

545
00:41:24,376 --> 00:41:27,309
<i>Excuse me, both of you, please
step outside for now, okay?</i>

546
00:41:27,309 --> 00:41:28,909
<i>For now, please go outside…</i>

547
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:31,876
Let's do it, the surgery.

548
00:41:36,848 --> 00:41:39,276
Let's do a restoration surgery
to your original face.

549
00:41:39,276 --> 00:41:43,048
Will his memory return if
he gets plastic surgery?

550
00:41:43,048 --> 00:41:44,676
We have to try something,

551
00:41:44,676 --> 00:41:48,209
if the person wants to regain their memory.

552
00:41:50,837 --> 00:41:52,543
If you want to keep this face,

553
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:55,276
we should start by reconstructing
the resected cheekbones.

554
00:41:55,276 --> 00:41:57,352
Just a moment.

555
00:42:06,455 --> 00:42:10,922
Are you curious about why
your face ended up like that?

556
00:42:14,427 --> 00:42:16,308
That was you.

557
00:42:16,308 --> 00:42:19,147
The one who ruined your face like that,

558
00:42:19,147 --> 00:42:20,960
it was you!

559
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,016

00:42:22,016 --> 00:42:23,115

565
00:42:35,143 --> 00:42:38,743
You want to recover the memory that

566
00:42:38,743 --> 00:42:41,332
would have been better left unknown?

567
00:42:50,843 --> 00:42:53,143
It's a perfect betrayal by memory.

568
00:42:53,143 --> 00:42:56,204
Since his personal information was
exposed as a school bully,

569
00:42:56,204 --> 00:42:58,219
since he is going for
reconstructive surgery anyway,

570
00:42:58,219 --> 00:43:00,061
it seems he changed his face
to be different from the original.

571
00:43:00,061 --> 00:43:03,272
Claiming it to be a truth better left unknown,

572
00:43:03,272 --> 00:43:05,413
is it right to hide it from
the person themselves?

573
00:43:05,413 --> 00:43:07,309
If it's family,

574
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:09,876
I think I would cover it up, too.

575
00:43:09,876 --> 00:43:11,822
Even they can't remember,

576
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,976

Hey! What? Restorative surgery?

582
00:43:35,909 --> 00:43:38,843
Wow! That empathy is no joke.

583
00:43:41,043 --> 00:43:43,915
What? Restoring the face to recover memories?

584
00:43:43,915 --> 00:43:46,796
I thought I was watching a sci-fi movie.

585
00:43:48,776 --> 00:43:51,843
What do you think about that patient?

586
00:43:51,843 --> 00:43:54,443
Well, he must be having huge regrets by now.

587
00:43:54,443 --> 00:43:58,309
Better to just be a traffic accident victim,
what is he talking about being a perpetrator?

588
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:04,043
Do you think so, too?

589
00:44:04,043 --> 00:44:06,409
I… might not know

590
00:44:06,409 --> 00:44:09,309
that I killed Hye Jin.

591

592
00:44:12,743 --> 00:44:16,220
Just like that patient,
who was betrayed by memory,

593
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,454
turns out I am the suspect.

594
00:44:18,454 --> 00:44:20,546
Hey!

595
00:44:20,546 --> 00:44:23,143
Hey, make some sense, will you?

596
00:44:23,143 --> 00:44:25,329
Jeong Woo, why you?

597
00:44:33,189 --> 00:44:35,062
Jeong Woo,

598
00:44:35,062 --> 00:44:37,709
just buy your ticket
and leave the country asap.

599
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:40,009
Your mother's also making
a fuss to send you off,

600
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:44,162
and the director is also very troubled
by the delay in your dispatch schedule.

601
00:44:44,162 --> 00:44:47,062
Let's just shake it all off
and forget it, okay?

602
00:44:48,388 --> 00:44:51,821
You should go your own way too, shouldn't you?

603
00:45:16,228 --> 00:45:18,835
I found it.

of Nam Gi Taek's death, and this guy here!

608
00:45:34,743 --> 00:45:36,543
We ran the forensic anthropology
comparison program,

609
00:45:36,543 --> 00:45:38,909
and body proportions match 90 to 95%!

610
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:40,843
It's a perfect match for the same person.

611
00:45:40,843 --> 00:45:42,443
Here,

612
00:45:42,443 --> 00:45:44,943
do you see the zipper pocket near
the shoulder of the outer garment, right?

613
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:46,976
It's the same.

614
00:45:46,976 --> 00:45:48,276
What about the subsequent movements?

615
00:45:48,276 --> 00:45:50,409
Found a few more CCTVs in the vicinity.

616
00:45:50,409 --> 00:45:53,709
We need to scan more, including
the nearby subway stations.

617
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,815
What about the forensic results
on Dr. Cha Jeong Woo's wristwatch?

618
00:45:55,815 --> 00:45:58,876
They said it would come out
by tomorrow morning.

619
00:45:58,876 --> 00:46:00,719
Regardless of the results, Dr. Cha Jeong Woo

620
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:03,476
is likely to be summoned for investigation

621
00:46:03,476 --> 00:46:06,326
because of Team Leader Choi's statement.

622
00:46:07,121 --> 00:46:09,122
We'll know when the results come out.

623
00:46:09,122 --> 00:46:11,622

624
00:46:11,622 --> 00:46:13,632

00:46:30,147 --> 00:46:32,937
Well, I came to check
on the patient's condition.

629
00:46:32,937 --> 00:46:34,071
At this hour?

630
00:46:34,071 --> 00:46:39,322
All because of someone, I can't leave work
at a proper time, worrying over him.

631
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:52,253
I'm still in danger, aren't I?

632
00:46:54,137 --> 00:46:55,976
Every night,

633
00:46:55,976 --> 00:46:58,743
I see you come and go
in front of the door several times.

634
00:46:58,743 --> 00:47:00,943
You don't need to worry about it.

635
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:04,309
As we'll schedule the surgery soon,

636
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:07,343
just take good care of yourself.

637
00:47:31,409 --> 00:47:35,576
This is what they gave me in the
emergency room, when you had the accident.

638
00:47:35,576 --> 00:47:38,443
I thought it had been lost.

639
00:47:39,343 --> 00:47:42,043
Why did you have it?

640
00:47:43,509 --> 00:47:48,272
The reason I kept silent about your accident…

641
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:04,076
There are a few more photos
sent anonymously, similar to this.

00:48:50,343 --> 00:48:51,843
I'm not someone with free time.

655
00:48:51,843 --> 00:48:54,968
Since there's no time,
just briefly touch on the core points.

656
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:01,509
Let's get started.

657
00:49:01,509 --> 00:49:03,909
The traffic accident involving Cha Jeong Woo,
who is the deceased victim's lover,

658
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:05,276
contrary to the investigation
records at the time,

659
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:08,443
was confirmed to have occurred
in front of the victim's house.

660
00:49:08,443 --> 00:49:11,109
And the wristwatch that Cha Jeong Woo
was wearing that day

661
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:13,276
has been confirmed as an
evidence found at the scene.

662
00:49:13,276 --> 00:49:14,609
According to the forensic analysis,

663
00:49:14,609 --> 00:49:16,476
the bloodstains on the wristwatch

664
00:49:16,476 --> 00:49:20,309
were identified as the DNA of both
the victim Yoon Hye Jin and Cha Jeong Woo.

665
00:49:24,243 --> 00:49:26,609
If the case had been verified
properly from the beginning,

666
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:29,543
this trouble wouldn't have happened.

667
00:49:29,543 --> 00:49:31,876
For now, let's start by summoning Cha Jeong Woo

668
00:49:31,876 --> 00:49:34,588
and, if additional evidence comes out,
we'll formalize the reinvestigation then.

669
00:49:34,588 --> 00:49:36,343
However, from that wristwatch, an unidentified

670
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:38,732
male DNA was also detected.

671
00:49:38,732 --> 00:49:41,309
Oh my goodness!

672
00:49:41,309 --> 00:49:42,409
Is there another suspect?

673
00:49:42,409 --> 00:49:44,776
After looking more into the situation,

674
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:46,943
it seems best to decide
on the direction of the investigation.

675
00:49:46,943 --> 00:49:49,176
Specifying the DNA will take quite some time.

676
00:49:49,176 --> 00:49:51,776
I heard that Dr. Cha Jeong Woo
has quit the hospital.

677
00:49:51,776 --> 00:49:54,304
For now, it might be best to start
with a summoning for questioning.

678
00:49:54,304 --> 00:49:57,943
Even if Dr. Cha Jeong Woo was at the scene,
that alone is not evidence of murder.

679
00:49:57,943 --> 00:50:00,076
From fingerprints to footprints,
even theft of items at the scene,

680
00:50:00,076 --> 00:50:02,643
there were many evidences against Lee Jin Seok.

681
00:50:04,109 --> 00:50:05,943
Anyway,

682
00:50:05,943 --> 00:50:10,043
He is a key person who needs
to be interviewed as a reference.

683
00:50:10,043 --> 00:50:11,709
If Cha Jeong Woo disappears
after quitting the hospital,

684
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:13,943
how do you intend to deal with the aftermath?

685
00:50:13,943 --> 00:50:15,936
Don't waste time, just summon him first.

686
00:50:15,936 --> 00:50:18,409
Yes.

687
00:50:54,522 --> 00:50:56,609
What's the progress?
Have you found Dr. Cha Jeong Woo?

688
00:50:56,609 --> 00:50:59,555
<i>No, did he run off after learning
about the forensic results?</i>

689
00:50:59,555 --> 00:51:02,576
We'll look into it more, and if it's
not fruitful, we'll have to issue a warrant.

690
00:51:02,576 --> 00:51:03,843
Just withdraw for now.

691
00:51:03,843 --> 00:51:05,876

00:51:11,209 --> 00:51:12,543

696
00:51:15,148 --> 00:51:16,382
I haven't been able to get in touch with him.

697
00:51:16,382 --> 00:51:20,919
But, please, tell me what the matter is first.

698
00:51:20,919 --> 00:51:22,069
The summoning of a suspect has been issued.

699
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:24,602
Ah, suspect of what?

700
00:51:25,955 --> 00:51:28,589
The murder case of Ms. Yoon Hye Jin.

701
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,076
<i>Go ahead with your trip as scheduled.</i>

702
00:51:42,076 --> 00:51:45,509
<i>Just until this situation is settled.</i>

703
00:52:06,808 --> 00:52:10,069
<i>In that memory, Cha Jeong Woo</i>

704
00:52:10,069 --> 00:52:13,342
<i>doesn't seem like he was running away.</i>

705
00:52:13,342 --> 00:52:15,743
<i>What does that mean?</i>

706
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,509
<i>It's not that he was running away,</i>

707
00:52:19,075 --> 00:52:22,071
<i>it was more like he was chasing after someone.</i>

708
00:52:23,409 --> 00:52:27,029
<i>[Forensic Team Leader Park Kwang Il]</i>

709
00:52:27,029 --> 00:52:30,072
Yes, team leader, have
the DNA forensic results come out?

710
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,676
What about Cha Jeong Woo?

711
00:52:33,676 --> 00:52:35,543
He's not at home or at the hospital.

712
00:52:35,543 --> 00:52:39,162
I think we need to report to the team leader
and issue a search, right?

713
00:52:39,162 --> 00:52:42,896
I'm almost there, so I'll go in and tell you.

714
00:52:53,221 --> 00:52:55,452
Come with me!

715
00:53:03,062 --> 00:53:06,123
What? Isn't that Cha Jeong Woo?

716
00:53:07,515 --> 00:53:11,543
Did you come voluntarily
for a suspect investigation?

717
00:53:11,543 --> 00:53:14,002
Seeing as you blocked that investigation,

718
00:53:14,002 --> 00:53:17,389
you must be confident that I'm not the culprit?

719
00:53:17,389 --> 00:53:19,202
Then could it be…

720
00:53:19,202 --> 00:53:22,765
You were confused that
you might have killed your fiancé?

721
00:53:23,662 --> 00:53:26,495
What about the wristwatch forensics?

722
00:53:29,244 --> 00:53:31,509
The bloodstains on the watch

723
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:34,743
match the DNA of Yoon Hye Jin and yours.

724
00:53:34,743 --> 00:53:36,343
And

725
00:53:36,343 --> 00:53:38,009
another DNA has also come out.

726
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:40,916
That day, you had an accident
while chasing the culprit.

727
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:44,467
You are not a suspect, but a witness.

728
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,479
But, how did you find out about this story?

729
00:53:47,479 --> 00:53:49,602
You told me not to "understand",

730
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:52,762
but to wonder "why me".

731
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,600
There was someone else that day.

732
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,828
The real culprit of that day

733
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:10,475
is on the move again.

734
00:54:14,169 --> 00:54:16,069
Don't worry.

735
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:18,735
I definitely won't miss it this time.

736
00:54:20,422 --> 00:54:24,164
So where are we going now?

737
00:54:28,443 --> 00:54:30,667
To meet the real culprit.

738
00:54:43,008 --> 00:54:46,664
<i>[Face Me]</i>

739
00:55:03,808 --> 00:55:05,209
It's the suspect's evidence.

740
00:55:05,209 --> 00:55:08,083
Let's reinvestigate Yoon Hye Jin's murder case.

741
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:11,042
Cha Jeong Woo is refusing
to remember the criminal.

742
00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:13,030
Does that mean the person is that shocking?

743
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:15,664
If we need to find that reason,
we have to start from here.

744
00:55:15,664 --> 00:55:19,065
I heard there was content that was
not favorable to your son's marriage.

745
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,379
<i>[Last rehearsal! Together with Hyun Seok]</i>
Does anyone have a guess who it might be?

746
00:55:21,379 --> 00:55:24,176
In the end, both in the past
and now, the criminal

747
00:55:24,176 --> 00:55:26,775
is moving around Cha Jeong Woo.

748
00:55:26,775 --> 00:55:29,988
I have to find him, the real culprit.

749
00:55:29,988 --> 00:55:32,762
I think I saw that guy.
