they say a man came out of our house.

123
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:50,267
He was all covered with a hat and a mask,
so they are not sure who it was.

124
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:54,103
We saw that man in the
vehicle's dashcam footage.

125
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:25,220
Comparing this with the apartment's
entrance door and the height of the car,

126
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,631
both sides are approximately 180 centimeters,
plus or minus 5 centimeters tall.

127

The general appearance and attire are similar,

128

cannot be compared.

132
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:48,684
even with the upscaled clarity
improvement, the quality is not good.

133

Therefore, it's impossible to confirm
if it's the same person in the two videos.

134

There's no evidence of homicide, but

143
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:35,485
there are a few doubts, so the
investigation is yet to be concluded.

144

The day Mr. Nam Gi Taek died,

145
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:43,454
is this the person they
say coming out of that house?

146
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:49,795
It hasn't been confirmed yet
whether it's the same person or not.

147
00:14:49,795 --> 00:14:54,216
In fact, people who have surgery at the clinic
also cover their faces with hats and masks.

148
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:57,026
It was not someone who came from our clinic.

149
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:05,707
Then, is there a grudge against someone

150
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:09,697
or anything like that? Has that ever happened?

151
00:15:09,697 --> 00:15:12,134
No.

152
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:14,239
Yes.

153
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:19,397
If it's not suicide, but homicide,

154
00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:23,679
that means someone tried
to harm me intentionally.

00:17:34,273 --> 00:17:37,832
- Director Cha is inside, right?
- Pardon?

Madam, what brings you here at this hour?

179
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:54,938
- Who is she?
- Our hospital's VIP.

180
00:17:54,938 --> 00:17:56,732
- Son.
- Yes, Madam.

181
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:59,067
How could you make me feel so neglected?

182
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:02,279
What have I done to disappoint
you that much, Madam?

183
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:05,908
Do I have to find out the news
about Director Cha through an article?

184
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:08,010
You saw the article.

That's not something
you should worry about at all.

186
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:12,306
How could you say it's not
something to worry about?

187
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:14,750
They say Director Cha
is treating crime victims.

188
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,665
It's just a couple of cases for
hospital promotion, and then we'll be out.

189
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:21,032
Promotion?

190
00:18:22,382 --> 00:18:24,510

Ah, this?

193
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:33,890
It's part of our mission as doctors
to practice sharing and give back to society,

194
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,563
as a meaningful part of our
social contribution activities.

195
00:18:36,563 --> 00:18:39,191
But why specifically crime victims?

196
00:18:39,191 --> 00:18:42,236
Aren't there more than one or two patients
in need of reconstructive surgery?

197
00:18:42,236 --> 00:18:47,574
Well, if it involves crime,
it could also become a different issue.

198
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:51,078
Are you planning to profit
off someone else's son?

199
00:18:51,078 --> 00:18:53,288
Director Cha does have
a certain appeal, in this field.

200
00:18:53,288 --> 00:18:54,468
Exactly!

201
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:57,459
Why misuse your "golden hand"
to make those people write?

202
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:59,384
"Those people"?

203
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:00,963
Why would you do this?

204
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:04,466
Someone who even goes
to volunteer at the prison?

205
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:07,332
Even experts refer to counseling techniques.

206
00:19:07,332 --> 00:19:10,138
Crime victims are the ones who need more care.

207
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:12,030
How can you let Jeong Woo take care of them!

208
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,737
Now that I listen to it,

209
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,840
it's just perfect.

210
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,088
What?

211
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:19,156
No, everything else about Jeong Woo
is fine, but you know that.

212
00:19:19,156 --> 00:19:22,025
The most important thing for Jeong Woo,

213
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:25,821
specially considering the recent incident,

214
00:19:25,821 --> 00:19:27,925
is that he just needs a little… huh?

215
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:31,610
Just a bit more empathy, nothing more.

216
00:19:35,497 --> 00:19:36,957
No…

217
00:19:36,957 --> 00:19:41,086
I heard he was released last
month and had depression.

218
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:43,163
Saying he would perform surgery
on his daughter's facial burn scars.

219
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:46,341
Just had to get involved
with Jeong Woo of all people.

220
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:48,837
He was released?

221
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:52,264
Burn scar surgery?

222
00:19:52,264 --> 00:19:55,108
But, why all of a sudden?

223
00:19:55,108 --> 00:19:58,036
Because he seems like someone I know.

224
00:19:58,036 --> 00:20:00,817

Yes, it was last year.

Fortunately, it's not too deep.
Second-degree dermal burn,

<i>[Chemical Burn]</i>
but it's a chemical burn caused by the acid,

234

so the internal tissue damage
might be more severe than expected.

235
00:20:50,822 --> 00:20:53,009
You should go to the hospital
where you had the procedure

236
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:56,972
to get it checked and monitored.

It's because the job competition
is intense nowadays.

it look like you're smiling,

She is currently waiting in the treatment room.

273
00:23:44,698 --> 00:23:49,454
The injury doesn't seem severe enough to affect
the operated area where the implant is located.

274
00:23:49,454 --> 00:23:52,290
Since there's a possibility
of further infection,

275
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:56,418
it would be best to remove the implant.

276
00:24:00,826 --> 00:24:06,247
So, will it disappear with treatment?

277
00:24:07,472 --> 00:24:10,471

Contaminants should not contact

You said she's susceptible to infection.

291
00:25:01,531 --> 00:25:06,245
If she needs surgery, please
just admit her for inpatient treatment.

Wow! Wouldn't this lead to
quite a few broadcast invitations?

00:25:46,075 --> 00:25:49,075
But will the victim agree to an interview?

302
00:25:49,075 --> 00:25:51,748

A bit what? Why?

Shin Jeong Sook isn't the
type to do such thing.

00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:51,699
She kept earnestly asking
to look into it properly, you know?

326
00:26:51,699 --> 00:26:52,700
What about the CCTV?

327
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,648

While walking in the park,
she just watched the models,

332
00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:07,882
and acted impulsively?

333
00:27:07,882 --> 00:27:10,217
In other words, it was an unprovoked attack.

334
00:27:10,217 --> 00:27:15,058
Even from a forensic perspective, there's
zero evidence that the victim was targeted…

335
00:27:15,704 --> 00:27:19,267
The victim's movements were
exposed, it was a public post.

336
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:23,439

the victim's location and schedule.

348
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:07,916
<i>Bad woman.</i>

349
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,159
She started it first.

350
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:20,620
She started it first!

351
00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:30,691
There is no severe damage
to the internal organs.

352
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:33,610
There's no deformation of the implant either.

353
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:40,929
First, we'll suture and
then start the burn treatment.

354
00:28:47,732 --> 00:28:51,232
<i>The possible winner of the model audition
show was attacked with acid because…</i>

355
00:28:51,232 --> 00:28:52,361
<i>[K-Infidelity Model]</i>

356
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:55,264
<i>of the revenge by a jealous legitimate
wife over an extramarital affair.</i>

357
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:57,641
<i>Really, who is more extreme in this melodrama?</i>

358
00:28:57,641 --> 00:29:00,351
<i>Let's vote for it in a moment.</i>

359
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:30,741
<i>[To Ms. Jung Hee Young]</i>

360
00:29:31,435 --> 00:29:33,519
It's not true at all.

361
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:36,280
I've never had an affair.

362
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,876
That's why

363
00:29:38,876 --> 00:29:40,741
I'm just asking.

364
00:29:40,741 --> 00:29:44,744
I'm just making sure
there are no false accusations.

365
00:29:50,596 --> 00:29:53,672
You seem to take a lot of photos usually.

366
00:29:53,672 --> 00:29:58,509
Could you please show me all the photos
you took in the park yesterday?

367
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:01,853
Not the ones posted on social media.

368
00:30:01,853 --> 00:30:04,731
Why my photos?

369
00:30:04,731 --> 00:30:07,149
Just a moment.

370
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:12,566
- Speak.
- We've reached Shin Jeong Sook's husband.

371
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:16,600
But he's asking us to go see him.

372
00:30:24,652 --> 00:30:28,656
I was out on a photo shoot for a few days.

373
00:30:28,656 --> 00:30:31,451
I knew something like this
would happen someday.

374
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,200
According to Mrs. Shin Jeong Sook,
this person was your love affair…

375
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,261
This woman was in an affair with me?

376
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:43,105
Wow! It would be nice
to even meet a woman like this.

377
00:30:43,105 --> 00:30:45,057
Please be careful with your words.

378
00:30:45,057 --> 00:30:47,889
- Anyway, it has nothing to do with me.
- Are you sure?

379
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:51,521
I mean, it's awkward for me to say this but,

380
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:54,199
the women I meet…

381
00:30:59,688 --> 00:31:02,695
Could it be that the victim was mistaken
for the husband's mistress?

382
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:05,183
My wife knows Seong Hee's face too.

383
00:31:05,183 --> 00:31:08,669
She's seen her a couple of times
while following her secretly.

384
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:11,542
Maybe she did it out of spite
due to depression?

385
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:14,837
Depression? There were no psychiatric records.

386
00:31:14,837 --> 00:31:17,547
She has been on medication for quite a while.

387
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:24,510
Why is it like this?

388
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:30,349
In my heyday, I even went
to the Miss Korea local preliminaries.

389
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:33,423
I became like this because of someone.

390
00:31:35,149 --> 00:31:38,277
<i>If there's no record, she might
have gone under a friend's name.</i>

391
00:31:38,277 --> 00:31:41,447
<i>She may not have used her name, as psychiatric
records can be disadvantageous in a divorce.</i>

392
00:31:41,447 --> 00:31:44,370
<i>She wouldn't have used her own name.</i>

393
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:47,304
<i>They say it's revenge by a jealous
legitimate wife over an extramarital affair.</i>

394
00:31:47,304 --> 00:31:49,608
<i>Really, who is more extreme in this melodrama?</i>

395
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:52,243
<i>Let's vote for it in a moment.</i>

396
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:59,893
Oppa.

397
00:31:59,893 --> 00:32:02,661
The face of a model…

398
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,205
I saw the article.

399
00:32:16,785 --> 00:32:18,971
Is it true?

400
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:20,402
Oppa.

401
00:32:20,402 --> 00:32:22,652
Who is that person?

402
00:32:23,813 --> 00:32:26,223
Oppa, don't you trust me?

403
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:30,810
No, I can't trust you.

404
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:34,854
It's either filming or a business trip,

405
00:32:34,854 --> 00:32:36,330
not answering calls half of the month.

406
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,523
You say you are going for a local shoot,

407
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,199
and end up getting photographed in a club

408
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:41,590
or a man answers the calls
in the middle of the night.

409
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,634
I said the staff was just playing around.

410
00:32:43,634 --> 00:32:47,376
How would I know if it's a staff
member or someone else?

411
00:32:50,088 --> 00:32:52,214
Get lost!

412
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:56,513
- What?
- I said get lost.

413
00:32:59,384 --> 00:33:01,089
Why?

414
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:03,149
You can't leave because you feel wronged?

415
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:07,283
Because you got stabbed in the back, you can't
leave because you're upset and angry, you punk!

416
00:33:07,283 --> 00:33:11,119
- Hey, Jung Hee Young!
- Get out of here right now!

417
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,295
Patient, please calm down.

418
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:21,922
We need to reconnect the line.
I'll bring the IV line.

419
00:33:23,888 --> 00:33:27,833
We're going to dress the wound.
Will you stay here?

420
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,531
What are you doing?

421
00:33:55,222 --> 00:33:56,874
If there's necrosis in the wound…

422
00:33:56,874 --> 00:33:59,183
Then what?

423
00:34:00,615 --> 00:34:03,024
It's all the same anyway.

424
00:34:03,024 --> 00:34:06,423
I can't get my face back to what it was.

425
00:34:06,423 --> 00:34:07,551
Go ahead with the dressing.

426
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:10,476
What's the use of that, anyway.

427
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,085
Losing dreams,

428
00:34:16,015 --> 00:34:18,552
losing a lover,

429
00:34:19,406 --> 00:34:22,522
and now being called an adulteress.

430
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:27,698
Everyone curses me, saying I deserved it.

431
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:32,063
What's the point of dressing the wound?

432
00:34:32,063 --> 00:34:33,786
First, get the treatment you can--

433
00:34:33,786 --> 00:34:37,705
I don't need it. I don't need any of this crap!

434
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:44,359
Then, nothing will ever change.

435
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:50,868
Have you forgotten? As a victim,

436
00:34:50,868 --> 00:34:54,799
she might be mentally unstable.

437
00:34:56,563 --> 00:34:59,609
Considering the victim's emotional state,
could you please speak more kindly--

438
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:00,978
Have you forgotten?

439
00:35:00,978 --> 00:35:03,362
This is a cosmetic surgery clinic.

440
00:35:03,362 --> 00:35:06,115
If you want to provide emotional
care for the patient,

441
00:35:06,115 --> 00:35:08,978
then transfer them to another hospital.

442
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,595
When he deeply considers the victim's
feelings, why is he acting like this again?

443
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:21,297
Right, I thought it was too good to be true.

444
00:35:21,297 --> 00:35:25,259
I've been feeling uneasy ever since they said
we'd have a dedicated doctor for victims.

445
00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:27,302
Why?

446
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:31,182
Because he didn't want to pour his emotions
into patients who were dying or living.

447
00:35:31,182 --> 00:35:33,434
That's why he switched to plastic surgery.

448
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:38,475
But I fully anticipated
this kind of discord today.

449
00:35:52,829 --> 00:35:56,332
What? Is that for real?

450
00:35:56,332 --> 00:36:01,087
So, you're saying you took on the
defense of the acid attack perpetrator?

451
00:36:01,087 --> 00:36:02,672
How did it happen?

452
00:36:02,672 --> 00:36:05,119
Well, it's just something
the company asked me to do.

453
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,387
Wow! It's a very small world, indeed.

454
00:36:09,387 --> 00:36:12,539
So? What happens with this?

455
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:14,851
- Is this a noncustodial case?
- Enough.

456
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:16,906
What about Jeong Woo? Is he okay

457
00:36:16,906 --> 00:36:19,897
after the victim's reconstructive surgery?

458
00:36:19,897 --> 00:36:22,147
Could he possibly be okay?

459
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:25,945
This was supposed to be the last one,
but it all blew up at the end.

460
00:36:25,945 --> 00:36:30,714
He's probably busy operating right now.

461
00:36:56,763 --> 00:37:00,518
<i>Please help, my girlfriend is alone at home.</i>

462
00:37:03,443 --> 00:37:06,090
<i>Oppa,</i>

463
00:37:06,945 --> 00:37:09,530
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

464
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,530
<i>I should have told you earlier.</i>

465
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:37,289
Depression, delusional disorder.

466
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:40,502
First-time offender with diminished capacity.

467
00:37:40,502 --> 00:37:43,677
And an unhappy family history, too.

468
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:48,605
Besides, the lawyer's not a public defender, but
from the specialized criminal firm Good-n-Good.

469
00:37:49,975 --> 00:37:51,784
You can tell at a glance it's
a noncustodial case, can't you?

470
00:37:51,784 --> 00:37:54,146
The change in attitude is quite dramatic.

471
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:57,448
From a random victim to a wounded wife.

472
00:37:57,448 --> 00:38:00,652
I have a feeling she's leading us
in the direction she wants us to go.

473
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:02,696
Could she have been coached by a lawyer?

474
00:38:02,696 --> 00:38:05,667
The husband story came up
at exactly the right timing.

475
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:07,701
And without even asking.

476
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:12,289
Actively revealing the motive
for the crime means

477
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,598
that the real, undisclosed motive

478
00:38:14,598 --> 00:38:19,432
is being hidden?

479
00:38:21,192 --> 00:38:27,037
Then what could the real hidden motive be?

480
00:38:27,662 --> 00:38:31,373
What could it be, to go to such lengths…

481
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:34,005
Last year, there was a case with a
woman in her twenties as the victim

482
00:38:34,005 --> 00:38:37,522
of an acid attack.

483
00:38:37,522 --> 00:38:38,774
Yes.

484
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,820
Because of a complaint, a resident
threw acid at a district office worker.

485
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,320
Is it that the case?

486
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,447
Look up a photo of the victim of that case.

487
00:38:45,447 --> 00:38:47,240
Why bring up that case all of a sudden?

488
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,201
We need to find

489
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,119
the real motive, don't we?

490
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,607
<i>The pre-trial detention warrant for the
suspect in the acid attack on a model</i>

491
00:38:55,607 --> 00:38:58,710
<i>[Pre-trial Detention Warrant Rejected]
has been rejected.</i>

492
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,547
<i>After interrogation, the judge decided that,
since the suspect has a fixed residence,</i>

493
00:39:02,547 --> 00:39:07,885
<i>it is difficult to see a risk of flight,
and therefore rejected the detention warrant.</i>

494
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:12,080
Miss Shin Jeong Sook, please come out.

495
00:39:26,091 --> 00:39:28,350
Let's go.

496
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:39,802
You're not being detained, are you?

497
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,254
It's not over yet.

498
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,569
There's still the prosecutor's
investigation, indictment, and trial.

499
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:45,841
I'm sorry.

500
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,471
That's something you should say to the victim,

501
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:50,193
after ruining her model's face like this.

502
00:39:50,193 --> 00:39:52,973
What are you going to do with this?

503
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,850
Is this woman the victim?

504
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,154
Please refrain from any speech
or behavior that might provoke our client.

505
00:39:58,154 --> 00:40:01,030
- Do not respond.
- Yes.

506
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:07,032
Yes, team leader. The victim?

507
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:10,782
She is still at KSH Cosmetic Surgery.

508
00:40:10,782 --> 00:40:13,835
Yes, I will check it out.

509
00:40:18,853 --> 00:40:21,774
- Please get in.
- No, I'm fine.

510
00:40:21,774 --> 00:40:23,855
I have some places to go.

511
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:25,437
- Is that so?
- Yes.

512
00:40:25,437 --> 00:40:28,679
Anyway, do not do anything
until the trial, and stay quiet.

513
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:31,353
Especially near the victim,
you can't approach her at all.

514
00:40:31,353 --> 00:40:35,023
- Yes. Bye.
- Go ahead.

515
00:41:14,175 --> 00:41:15,738
Yes, she arrived home now.

516
00:41:15,738 --> 00:41:17,780
<i>Stay put, she is going to move.</i>

517
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,073
Yes, understood.

518
00:41:25,477 --> 00:41:29,105
- Director, I'm going home.
- You've worked hard.

519
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:28,998
<i>[Jung Hee Young]</i>

520
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:28,434
What is it?

521
00:43:28,434 --> 00:43:31,603
Didn't you hear we got investigative
cooperation from the hospital?

522
00:43:31,603 --> 00:43:34,085
We are currently tracking the suspect.

523
00:43:34,085 --> 00:43:36,547
The suspect…

524
00:43:37,121 --> 00:43:39,486
After the pre-trial
arrest warrant was rejected,

525
00:43:39,486 --> 00:43:43,323
I checked in advance that the suspect
was coming towards the hospital.

526
00:43:44,996 --> 00:43:49,375
Jung Hee Young is safe, so do not worry.

527
00:43:50,702 --> 00:43:52,456
But still, to put the victim in the same space…

528
00:43:52,456 --> 00:43:55,794
You're worried about Jung Hee Young, right?

529
00:43:55,794 --> 00:43:57,095
Yes, I am quite concerned.

530
00:43:57,095 --> 00:44:02,133
Thanks to the obstinate detective.

531
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:05,471
I am not that obstinate.

532
00:44:05,471 --> 00:44:08,807
I've been watching everything.

533
00:44:08,807 --> 00:44:11,482
You see the gun over there?

534
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:17,098
Do not make a mess at the hospital.

535
00:44:17,745 --> 00:44:20,190
Please leave in a bit.

536
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,779
For now, anticipate Hyunnam-dong and follow.

537
00:44:46,779 --> 00:44:47,943
Hyunnam-dong?

538
00:44:47,943 --> 00:44:51,602
- Keep an eye on the front.
- Got it!

539
00:45:12,186 --> 00:45:14,710
The investigation will be over soon
and will be resolved well,

540
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,940
so do not worry.

541
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:31,925
Are you doing well?

542
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:37,936
How is it?

543
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:39,702
<i>[Model Jung Hee Young's Waiting Room]</i>

544
00:46:39,702 --> 00:46:42,202
Is it comfortable there?

545
00:47:08,449 --> 00:47:11,589
<i>[Shin Jeong Sook]</i>

546
00:47:25,762 --> 00:47:28,939
Is she really entering Hyunnam-dong?

547
00:47:28,939 --> 00:47:31,732
Could it be this case…

548
00:47:38,654 --> 00:47:40,354
Where did Jung Hee Young go?

549
00:47:40,354 --> 00:47:41,900
What?

550
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,217
Huh?

551
00:49:32,384 --> 00:49:35,910
<i>[Face Me]</i>

552
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,717
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo?

553
00:49:54,717 --> 00:49:57,274
Jeong Woo, was there another
problem at the hospital?

554
00:49:57,274 --> 00:49:59,009
The thing you did,

555
00:49:59,009 --> 00:50:00,882
you're going to receive a proper punishment.

556
00:50:00,882 --> 00:50:05,702
The madam is as beautiful as Jung Hee Young.

557
00:50:07,912 --> 00:50:09,821
Is there anyone who got caught?

558
00:50:09,821 --> 00:50:11,310
I don't know.

559
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:12,856
But it feels somehow familiar.

560
00:50:12,856 --> 00:50:15,028
Lee Min Hyeong,

561
00:50:15,028 --> 00:50:16,595
it's been a long time.

562
00:50:16,595 --> 00:50:18,682
If the two persons are the same individual,

563
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,707
and if it's someone who
holds a grudge against you,

564
00:50:20,707 --> 00:50:23,585
they might appear around you again.

565
00:50:25,016 --> 00:50:27,334
Who are you?

566
00:50:28,143 --> 00:50:32,271
Director Cha is a victim of crime, too.

567
00:50:32,271 --> 00:50:36,479
