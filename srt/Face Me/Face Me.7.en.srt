on the wrist and the thigh, two places.

26
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:26,051
And it seems the artery
in the wrist is damaged.

181
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:01,578
The fuss he's making because he's in pain.

182
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:05,551
If he's in pain, he needs surgery or treatment.

183
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:07,884
Do you think it'll work out
just by covering it up?

184
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:16,684
It won't be a problem that
he can't forget the deceased.

185
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,284
What's the reason?

186
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:23,555
The real reason for him to want to escape.

187
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,043
Not being able to forget the dead,

188
00:15:31,923 --> 00:15:34,473
that's the real problem.

189
00:16:18,384 --> 00:16:21,318

completing the forensic examination

of a miniature camera being attached.

That's possible.

213

to ask for an emergency arrest,
because his phone

215
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:46,751
was located nearby,
at the time of the incident?

216

he is involved in the death of Mr. Nam Gi Taek

223
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:11,203

towards Mr. Cha Jeong Woo,

224

directly from the crime scene?

again, by any chance?

You said you were drinking.

234
00:19:58,551 --> 00:20:01,684
Suddenly there's surgery,
and you told me to come back, right?

235
00:20:01,684 --> 00:20:05,611
I can't just be cool like
someone else, it's difficult…

236
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:13,453

- What about Lee Jin Seok?

237
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:16,019

So are you saying Lee Jin Seok is the one
who did that to Ms. Nam Hyo Ju?

We don't know.

but the reason he's doing this to you

248

00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:01,287
why is he going around
causing trouble to others?

352
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:05,853
There was a physical altercation with Dr. Cha
during the transfer process, 7 years ago.

353
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,787
And, at that time, his face and
personal information were all revealed…

354
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:08,920
Ah, that's right.

355
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,953
There were explosive
news articles about it then,

356
00:28:10,953 --> 00:28:12,561
and it was a huge issue
as he was labeled a national murderer.

357
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:14,828
I didn't ask you.

358
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,687

359

362
00:28:33,853 --> 00:28:35,314
With the team leader's
promotion review coming up,

363
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:37,453
it's a sensitive time
to be caught in this trouble.

364
00:28:37,453 --> 00:28:38,673
Entering the headquarters,
as the new Senior Superintendent,

365
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:41,287
is his dream come true.

366
00:28:48,753 --> 00:28:51,253
Did you find any evidence connecting

367
00:28:51,253 --> 00:28:53,553
Lee Jin Seok to Nam Gi Taek's death?

368
00:28:53,553 --> 00:28:55,620
We secured CCTV footage
from near Nam Gi Taek's house

369
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,146
around the estimated time of death.

370
00:29:00,146 --> 00:29:03,092
But there's no evidence yet
that he entered inside.

371
00:29:03,092 --> 00:29:04,753
What about the evidence
of the attack on Nam Hyo Ju?

372
00:29:04,753 --> 00:29:07,855
At the time of the incident, the phone's
location was confirmed to be nearby.

373
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:09,946
At that time,

374
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:13,633
everyone who had a phone
in the vicinity would be a suspect?

375
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:15,254
Considering his connection with Nam Gi Taek…

376

377
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:18,692

your career stained,

I understand you want
to get rid of your criminal brother.

381

But, is it okay to use public authority
to settle your personal feelings like that?

382
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:37,787
It is true that it was a sensitive matter,

383
00:29:37,787 --> 00:29:42,620
but I can't just cover up the circumstances
and doubts simply because it's family.

the prosthesis becomes damaged,

505
00:39:02,453 --> 00:39:05,986
causing the prosthesis to shift
to the side or downwards.

existing scar to adjust the prosthesis,

00:39:18,887 --> 00:39:22,053

underneath the gluteal muscles.

we open and examine it, but

517
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:49,553

about my condition.

518

00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:12,710
I'm leaving now.

525
00:40:15,866 --> 00:40:18,944
I'm not sure who is obsessed with whom.

526
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,853
- He's a skilled guy, right?
- Of course.

527
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:23,834
Well, how was it? The
surgery isn't complicated, right?

528
00:40:23,834 --> 00:40:25,353
[Subfascial - below the fascia]
The prosthesis in the subfascial position

529
00:40:25,353 --> 00:40:27,485
[Submuscular - beneath the muscle]
needs to be moved to the submuscular position.

530
00:40:27,485 --> 00:40:28,819
If properly sutured, it should be fine.

531
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:31,229
So, there won't be any additional scarring?

532
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:33,053
Since it's a reopening of the area
that was already incised,

533
00:40:33,053 --> 00:40:35,359
there's less concern about the scarring.

534
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,007
So, how do we proceed with the surgery?

535
00:40:38,007 --> 00:40:40,140
What does our Eun Ah have to say?

536
00:40:42,187 --> 00:40:44,853
You should ask her.

537
00:40:44,853 --> 00:40:46,744
Where are you going?

538
00:40:48,187 --> 00:40:50,820
Aren't you going to operate?
After everything's been checked.

539
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,087
Would it be okay to do it here?

540
00:40:52,087 --> 00:40:53,920
Then, what would we do?

541
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,831
Are you telling me to open up elsewhere again?

542
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:57,087
Right. You are right.

543
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:59,253
Please, I ask you to handle it well.

544
00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:01,487
I'm not sure if she is prepared for surgery.

545
00:41:01,487 --> 00:41:02,953
I've been fasting today.

546
00:41:02,953 --> 00:41:06,294
- Isn't fasting enough?
- Yes.

547
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,187
I'm not sure how much it will cost.

548
00:41:22,425 --> 00:41:24,487
Let's talk about it first.

549
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:26,720
Back then…

550
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,380
although I was out of my mind
on drugs, it wasn't me.

551
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:33,680
I did enter the house,
but I did not kill anyone.

552
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,687
Feeling wronged cannot be a
reason for requesting a retrial.

553
00:41:37,687 --> 00:41:41,687
The law only recognizes
facts that can be proven.

554
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:51,141
What if there is a different culprit?

555
00:41:52,773 --> 00:41:54,820
What do you mean?

556
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,265
That day

557
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,165
I saw someone running out of the house.

558
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,587
I saw it clearly,

559
00:42:14,587 --> 00:42:17,568
the guy frantically escaping from the house.

560
00:42:20,602 --> 00:42:24,953
Do you have any idea who it could be?

561
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:31,667
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Good job today.

out of the woman's house]

565
00:43:04,253 --> 00:43:06,073
I'll go over there.

566
00:43:06,073 --> 00:43:08,106
There's no need to.

567
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,620
What do you mean?

568
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,253
That's what those people say.

569
00:43:12,253 --> 00:43:14,353
"It's unfair, I've been framed,
it's because of you."

570
00:43:14,353 --> 00:43:16,187
Why listen to such talk, only to upset you?

571
00:43:16,187 --> 00:43:18,295
Don't change the subject.

572
00:43:20,186 --> 00:43:23,153
What do you want to confirm with Lee Jin Seok?

573
00:43:23,153 --> 00:43:26,553
It seems like it's not just anger towards you.

574
00:43:26,553 --> 00:43:30,621
So he… talked about me?

575
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:33,557
Chae Kyung.

576
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:40,153
He said he saw someone
running out of the house.

577
00:43:40,153 --> 00:43:43,187
Seems like similar statements
were made seven years ago.

578
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,847
Because he was on drugs,

579
00:43:44,847 --> 00:43:47,826
the statement was not accepted.

580
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:52,193
Who… did he say it was?

581
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,053
I don't know. He said he doesn't know!

582
00:44:08,653 --> 00:44:12,846
Do you have any idea who it could be?

583
00:44:12,846 --> 00:44:15,679
Wouldn't it be the person
closest to that woman?

584
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,657
Like a lover, perhaps…

585
00:44:20,687 --> 00:44:22,787
From what I saw in prison,

586
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:26,520
the biggest motive
for murder cases was jealousy.

587
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,820
It takes a while for the
anesthesia to wear off, right?

588
00:44:41,253 --> 00:44:44,199

700
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:07,015
The guy who ran out of the house that day.

701
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:12,653
Those who killed their girlfriends
and wives, it was all out of jealousy.

702
00:52:12,653 --> 00:52:16,619
Why? Did your lover cheat on you?

703
00:53:25,507 --> 00:53:27,776
[Face Me]

704
00:53:31,379 --> 00:53:35,282
♫ I can't forget the day we first met ♫

705
00:53:35,282 --> 00:53:39,008
♫ The wind was so cold ♫

706
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:43,264
♫ Your awkward greeting ♫

707
00:53:43,264 --> 00:53:46,393
♫ Frozen, you were all I can see ♫

708
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:47,763
That's the rat.

709
00:53:47,763 --> 00:53:49,887
That's why he came to me on his own accord.

710
00:53:49,887 --> 00:53:52,087
The one who ran out of that house
looked exactly like him.

711
00:53:52,087 --> 00:53:53,753
You mean Cha Jeong Woo?

712
00:53:53,753 --> 00:53:55,736
Do you know nothing about my accident?

713
00:53:55,736 --> 00:53:56,953
But one question remained.

714
00:53:56,953 --> 00:54:00,087
You're saying there was no investigation on
the victim's partner's movements on that day?

715
00:54:00,087 --> 00:54:04,456
There was no accident
in front of the hospital that day?

716
00:54:04,456 --> 00:54:06,306
What on earth did you do in that house?

717
00:54:06,306 --> 00:54:07,487
What does that mean?

718
00:54:07,487 --> 00:54:08,768
You don't remember?

719
00:54:08,768 --> 00:54:11,287
Then come over and I'll make
you remember everything.

720
00:54:11,287 --> 00:54:13,293
Lee Jin…

721
00:54:13,293 --> 00:54:17,105
♫ I saw you ♫

722
00:54:17,105 --> 00:54:20,147
♫ Looking back for a long time ♫
