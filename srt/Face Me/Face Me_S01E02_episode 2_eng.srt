1
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:13,625
   

2
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:20,661
   

3
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,502
   

4
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:37,053
   

5
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:51,930



6
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,020
   

7
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:13,842
   
 A plastic surgeon in Gangnam, Seoul has 

8
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:16,502
 rescued a woman who was his patient from being kidnapped 

9
00:01:16,502 --> 00:01:19,472
 and has become a topic of discussion. 

10
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:23,430
 The doctor had previously seen the victim being assaulted by her ex-boyfriend 

11
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,187
 in the parking lot of the plastic surgery clinic, 
   

12
00:01:25,187 --> 00:01:28,574
 After seeing this happen and saving her from the assault, 

13
00:01:28,574 --> 00:01:31,855
 he performed emergency surgery. 

14
00:01:31,855 --> 00:01:36,068
 This time, as the man forced the discharged woman into a vehicle and fled, 

15
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:39,963
 the doctor immediately followed and rescued her quickly. 

16
00:01:39,963 --> 00:01:44,275
 It is known that the woman's life is not in danger. 

17
00:02:07,382 --> 00:02:10,730
 Jeong Woo, give me your hand. 

18
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,901
 Hold on, I am a doctor. 

19
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:17,168
 I've found it, the bleeding point. 

20
00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:20,250
 I will keep his condition stable until we reach the operating room. 

21
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:22,756
 Senior. 
   

22
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,834
 Oppa. 

23
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:27,858
 What's wrong? Is something wrong? 

24
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:30,285
 I'm sorry, I should have told you earlier. 

25
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:34,702
 What do you mean by that? What's wrong? 

26
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:36,872
 Hye Jin. 

27
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:38,281
 Hye Jin. 

28
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:42,072
 Please help. My girlfriend is alone at home, but— 

29
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:50,307
 Are you okay? Please say something. 

30
00:02:50,307 --> 00:02:52,299
 Are you okay? 

31
00:02:56,563 --> 00:02:58,563
 Hye Jin. 

32
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,420
 ­  

33
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:22,021
It's dangerous over there.

34
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:23,997
Have you already found something?

35
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,322
Around the balcony railing and the windows,

36
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:29,172
there are no fingerprints or other signs of any intruders.

37
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:30,866
And the inside of the house is clean too,

38
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:34,059
with no signs of bloodstains.

39
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,796
Please contact me when the additional forensic results come out.

40
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:39,428
Okay.

41
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:58,049
   

42
00:04:58,049 --> 00:05:00,725
South Seoul?

43
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:03,346
   

44
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:06,987
     

45
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:09,644
   

46
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:12,105
Joy Water?

47
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:14,599
     

48
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:24,250
How long will it take?

49
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:28,691
Can't you just stop and leave?

50
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:32,037
Excuse me, Officer Kim,

51
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:35,087
please set up the line and have people stay behind it.

52
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:36,808
 Yes, Ma'am. 

53
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:39,713
 Miss, please clear the area. 

54
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:44,707
Were the memos on the calendar written by your father?

55
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:55,621
Have you heard anything about that hospital?

56
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,933
Do you know when it was written?

57
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:02,141
It's probably suicide.

58
00:06:02,141 --> 00:06:04,464
Just finish it quickly, please.

59
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:27,219
Polished shoes.

60
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:34,827
Dry-cleaned jacket.

61
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,533
 Jeong Woo, where are you? 

62
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:04,325
I'm going out now. Why?

63
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:06,279
 Have you not seen the article yet? 

64
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,119
 The father of a patient who was refused treatment 

65
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:10,490
 at a famous plastic surgery clinic in Gangnam, 

66
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,726
 has been discovered to have committed suicide by jumping off of his balcony. 

67
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:16,546
 Amidst assumptions of an extreme choice, 

68
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:19,006
 a suicide note with criticism towards the doctor 

69
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:22,275
 has reportedly been found. 

70
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,038
I told the director not to come to the hospital for now.

71
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:29,925
We'll have to watch the situation.

72
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:32,061
Director Cha has a full surgery schedule today.

73
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:34,600
How could he perform surgeries right now?

74
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,501
No matter how much I think about it,

75
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:38,242
it doesn't seem like it's the director's fault.

76
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:40,145
The news seems a bit exaggerated.

77
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:43,215
How did the suicide note get released?

78
00:07:43,215 --> 00:07:47,000
There's nothing journalists wouldn't find for clickbait.

79
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,504
What do we do now?

80
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:51,097
The news is everywhere.

81
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:52,731
What?

82
00:07:55,196 --> 00:07:57,353
Did you have a fight with the guardian?

83
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:58,685
Why did you refuse to treat her?

84
00:07:58,685 --> 00:08:00,146
Your name was mentioned in the suicide note,

85
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,858
do you think there's moral responsibility?

86
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:04,168
- Do you acknowledge the responsibility? 
 - Please say something.

87
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:07,587
- Please clarify your position.
 - We request a statement.

88
00:08:16,043 --> 00:08:18,431
Why aren't you answering your phone?

89
00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:29,705
Jeong Woo, it's not an issue where legal responsibility can be attributed to you,

90
00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:32,192
but I don't know how the bereaved family will react.

91
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:35,290
Is it really a good idea to stir public opinion about the plastic surgery issue?

92
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,838
It's not a matter of just sitting back and taking it easy.

93
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:39,386
You need to have a response strategy ready.

94
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,701
I know a senior who's well-versed in medical law…

95
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:42,207
You didn't button up properly.

96
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:43,808
Huh?

97
00:08:45,715 --> 00:08:48,262
Hey, Cha Jeong Woo, now is not the time to worry about this.

98
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,969
It's been a while since I've seen you like this.

99
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:54,806
Did you rush out because Woo Jin contacted you?

100
00:08:54,806 --> 00:08:56,788
You should have at least answered the phone.

101
00:08:56,788 --> 00:08:58,599
You said there's no legal issue.

102
00:08:58,599 --> 00:09:01,080
Are you okay...

103
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,621
emotionally?

104
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:07,564
As you can see.

105
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:11,150
With the strong backing of a lawyer, what's there to worry about?

106
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,720
Let's get going. I have a surgery to perform.

107
00:09:16,796 --> 00:09:18,737
Don't worry too much.

108
00:09:18,737 --> 00:09:20,889
It's not your fault.

109
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,590
 ­  

110
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,467
We can move the end of the chin to the right.

111
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:30,053
While taking care of the liposuction and buccal fat removal,

112
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:32,937
we can try to slim your profile down a bit.

113
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:36,911
See you in the operating room.

114
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:39,029
   

115
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:41,183
You can follow me, Ma'am.

116
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:44,479
Excuse me…

117
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:48,740
The doctor mentioned, is it this doctor?

118
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,652
Is it true that it's the director, Dr. Cha?

119
00:09:51,652 --> 00:09:53,395
Let's go out and I'll explain.

120
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:56,180
- Are you sure this is that doctor? 
 - You're right.

121
00:09:56,845 --> 00:10:00,803
If you don't trust us, you can cancel the surgery.

122
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:13,162
The beauty center and resort aims to provide

123
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:15,933
the best service to customers.

124
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:18,061
However there were issues raised about Director Cha Jeong Woo's

125
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:20,609
patient response method.

126
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:24,441
The plan to invite him as a partner doctor is temporarily on hold.

127
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:27,441
   

128
00:10:49,251 --> 00:10:51,292
Reporter Kim?

129
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:55,674
This is Director Kim, from KSH Cosmetic Surgery.

130
00:10:57,287 --> 00:11:00,347
Did you see anyone coming in and out of your neighbor's house yesterday evening?

131
00:11:00,347 --> 00:11:01,988
I haven't seen anything.

132
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:04,856
Then what about any strange noises or—

133
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:09,635
Have you found anything out?

134
00:11:10,398 --> 00:11:13,008
There are no witnesses. There is nothing on the CCTV at the front of the building,

135
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:15,284
so it's hard to check who came in.

136
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:19,251
It seems that there is no clear sign of a crime at the scene.

137
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,837
It's just too clean.

138
00:11:24,837 --> 00:11:27,337
And they say it's not the first time.

139
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:28,930
What do you mean?

140
00:11:29,785 --> 00:11:31,199
You have a daughter.

141
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,610
What? I don't even have a girlfriend. What are you talking about?

142
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:38,069
But that daughter is sick.

143
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:39,617
You really want her to have surgery.

144
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:43,721
So you keep looking for hospitals, and when you go, they say they can't do the surgery.

145
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:45,842
So you look up another hospital from home again.

146
00:11:45,842 --> 00:11:47,834
But then, why…

147
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:54,552
Why did he commit suicide after looking up all these hospitals?

148
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:56,434
That's true.

149
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:03,197
We need to check the reservation details with the hospitals.

150
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:05,735
They said they couldn't give out patient information over the phone.

151
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:07,115
You should go check it out in person.

152
00:12:07,115 --> 00:12:08,263
Check the date when he made the inquiry call.

153
00:12:08,263 --> 00:12:10,611
Cross-check Mr. Nam Gi Taek's mobile phone call history.

154
00:12:10,611 --> 00:12:12,190
Yes, Ma'am.

155
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:15,360
But that Doctor Cha Jeong Woo, really

156
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,576
went between heaven and hell overnight.

157
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:20,977
From a righteous doctor who saved a patient,

158
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:24,114
to a doctor mentioned in a dead person's suicide note.

159
00:12:24,114 --> 00:12:27,133
It's really hard to understand humans.

160
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:30,109
You seem really at ease.

161
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:32,977
Collect all the vehicles' black-box recordings.

162
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:36,834
- Alone? 
 - Yes.

163
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:40,820
You really just say these things like it's so easy.

164
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,961
You want me to cooperate?

165
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:45,930
Jeong Woo, the patient you refused

166
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,998
because the surgery was not profitable.

167
00:12:48,998 --> 00:12:51,387
The materialistic doctor who caused that father's death.

168
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:53,099
We have to shake off that bad reputation as soon as we can.

169
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:56,856
That's how you save yourself, me, and the Bintan Project.

170
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:59,341
Provisional hold means provisional hold, doesn't it?

171
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:01,290
So, what kind of cooperation are you asking for?

172
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,252
You just stand quietly next to me and I'll take care of everything.

173
00:13:04,252 --> 00:13:06,554
So, tell me, what exactly do you plan to do?

174
00:13:06,554 --> 00:13:08,409
Uh, hello?

175
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:10,351
Director Han?

176
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:11,792
Hello? Hello?

177
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,507
Anyway, I've definitely just told you what to do.

178
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:16,212
Understand?

179
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:19,221
Hey, are you there?

180
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,830
Don't say anything else!

181
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,580
Why isn't he answering the phone?

182
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,950
  ­ 

183
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:59,449
Hi!

184
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:02,458
You must have some good news.

185
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:06,111
It seems like some good news has just come up.

186
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:09,333
Excuse me.

187
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:13,044
I'd like to ask for a drink that suits this lady.

188
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,071
You could have a perfect face...

189
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:21,136
if only your double eyelids were symmetrical.

190
00:14:21,136 --> 00:14:21,907
Pardon?

191
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:26,308
I don't say this to just anyone.

192
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:30,310
Oh my! Director at KSH?

193
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:35,442
What about my double eyelids?

194
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:38,474
   

195
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:52,544
The direct cause of death

196
00:14:52,544 --> 00:14:53,727
is multiple bone fractures leading to significant organ damage.

197
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,000
Intoxication and antidepressant consumption at the time of death.

198
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,246
There's nothing else, is there?

199
00:14:57,246 --> 00:14:58,507
I still have some questions…

200
00:14:58,507 --> 00:15:00,200
It was lung cancer.

201
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,961
I found it while organizing his personal items.

202
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:05,197
    
 He tried to get surgery for his daughter before dying.

203
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,908
He jumped out of anger because they had a dispute.

204
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,909
Close the internal investigation as a natural death case.

205
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:15,737
W-Wait a moment.

206
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:19,695
Ms. Hyo Joo

207
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:32,303
He must have wanted the surgery done by any means necessary.

208
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:37,684
Because that would lessen his guilt.

209
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:41,569
My face.

210
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:45,086
It's because of my dad.

211
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:54,179
It was a hard time because of my mom who left home.

212
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:57,090
It was a mistake he made while drunk.

213
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:01,071
He even apologized profusely to me.

214
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:05,622
What good does an apology do?

215
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:16,143
My life is already ruined like this.

216
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:19,521
What happened to my face to make him do that?

217
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:22,900
What kind of surgery was he denied that led him to suicide?

218
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,765
Now it seems like all my personal information is going to be revealed.

219
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:31,860
Please…

220
00:16:32,472 --> 00:16:35,120
Just stop it, please.

221
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:40,225
Because I don't want a criminal like my dad to hold my life back.

222
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,173
Because you want to forget quickly,

223
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,300
you just want the investigation or whatever to end quickly.

224
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:53,357
I know you want that.

225
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,818
But I'll pretend not to know that for a while.

226
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:00,418
Until all my doubts are cleared.

227
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:14,117
 - Just let go! 
 - Stay still. 

228
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:17,779
 I'm not like that... I'm not! 

229
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:21,902
 You rat, stay still! Request support from the narcotics team. 

230
00:17:21,902 --> 00:17:26,660
 Because I don't want a criminal like my dad to hold my life back. 

231
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,763
 - I'm not like that! 
 - Be quiet. 

232
00:17:29,763 --> 00:17:32,751
 - What are you looking at? 
 - Be quiet. 

233
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,990
  Stay still!­ 

234
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:47,558
Come here quickly.

235
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:50,429
Ah, really, what's the big deal?

236
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:51,947
What are you doing? Look at this.

237
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:53,794
What kind of cooperation are you asking for?

238
00:17:53,794 --> 00:17:56,501
Jeong Woo, hurry.

239
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:05,429
- What are you doing? 
 - Oh, come on…

240
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:10,011
Let's maintain this position.

241
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,662
What is it now?

242
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,794
Doctor first.

243
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:29,318
Our hospital also feels morally responsible for his death,

244
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,762
and we intend to take this as an opportunity to reflect.

245
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:34,208
Recently, our director, Cha Jeong Woo, dealt with a crime

246
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,880
by performing plastic surgery on a victim,

247
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,604
personally demonstrating the public value and significance of plastic surgery.

248
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:45,331
And we plan to continue our social contributions.

249
00:18:46,023 --> 00:18:50,130
Are you saying that Director Cha Jeong Woo will be conducting plastic surgery on victims of crimes himself?

250
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,366
- Ah— 
 - Yes, of course.

251
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:56,004
Providing medical support to victims for free,

252
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:57,502
that is our plan. For free.

253
00:18:57,502 --> 00:18:58,947
In cooperation with the police.

254
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:01,964
Everything has been settled with the police station.

255
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,878
   

256
00:19:15,006 --> 00:19:17,261
Yes, this is the violent crimes division.

257
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:19,643
A PC room?

258
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:23,063
Yes, I'm about to leave, so please send me the report details and the location right away.

259
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:25,190
Yes.

260
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,157
I have to go to a scene.

261
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:28,195
What's the case about?

262
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:31,613
It's a suspected sexual offense at a nearby PC room.

263
00:19:31,613 --> 00:19:34,408
- I'll get the car. Contact the forensics first. 
 - Yes.

264
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:37,828
If you need a consultation with that plastic surgery clinic, contact them. Okay?

265
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:41,806
We have a partnership with a hospital that provides medical support to victims!

266
00:19:49,663 --> 00:19:52,776
Well, since we decided to do it, let's think of it as donating our talent.

267
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,820
Only up to three cases.

268
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,614
Case number one is already done. And I'll take on just two more cases.

269
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:58,912
Don't say anything else.

270
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:00,351
Three should be enough.

271
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:02,577
It doesn't make sense financially, and I don't like it either.

272
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:05,414
Interviews are absolutely out of the question.

273
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,181
You're being quite the star.

274
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:08,709
Take your hand out of your pocket.

275
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,210
Hey. Hey!

276
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:20,840
I said take your hand out.

277
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,100
Hurry.

278
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,436
   

279
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:29,354
   

280
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,598
   

281
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,740
Please take good care of us.

282
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:47,381
Look here. We'll take a commemorative photo.

283
00:20:49,785 --> 00:20:52,829
This isn't an interview.

284
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,457
You have to go to Bintan.

285
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,642
Smile.

286
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:01,740
Let's smile.

287
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:06,598
Okay, I'll take the picture now. One, two, three.

288
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:13,148
The victim is a man in his twenties, and he allegedly attempted to sexually assault her in the bathroom.

289
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:16,608
Is it true that the perpetrator was wounded by a knife wielded by the victim?

290
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:22,649
Is he the victim? Is he badly injured?

291
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:25,660
The injuries to the face are severe.

292
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,210
- First, he needs to go to the hospital. 
 - Yes.

293
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:31,156
I'll contact you from the hospital.

294
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:41,243
Can't we go to a plastic surgery clinic?

295
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:44,678
- First, go to the nearby emergency room— 
 - But it's the face.

296
00:21:45,699 --> 00:21:48,471
It's not just anything, it's the face…

297
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,151
   

298
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,398
   

299
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:24,246
It's okay. Don't worry.

300
00:22:24,246 --> 00:22:27,387
Nothing will happen. It's all right.

301
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,934
- Are there any injuries? 
 - No.

302
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:35,236
She is a bit traumatized, so she said she will come out later.

303
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:43,071
I am Detective Lee Min Hyeong from the Southern Station Violent Crimes Division.

304
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,823
First, we need to move you to a different spot for you to give your statement…

305
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:47,117
That rat touched my girlfriend.

306
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:48,114
He is the one who reported it.

307
00:22:48,114 --> 00:22:51,279
He said his girlfriend was sexually harassed.

308
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,463
He's a complete pervert.

309
00:22:53,463 --> 00:22:55,734
It was that part-timer.

310
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,552
He was weird from the start.

311
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:09,421
Pretending to clean, he kept stealing glances at Soo Bin's legs.

312
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,729
I just thought it was nothing and ignored it.

313
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:36,751
 You, there. 

314
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:38,461
 You can clean up a bit later, can't you? 

315
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:40,570
 If you leave it, it gets sticky. 

316
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,340
 Just don't. 

317
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,639
 I'm sorry. 

318
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:48,441
 - I need to use the bathroom. 
 - Okay. 

319
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:04,244
   

320
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,860
   

321
00:24:18,817 --> 00:24:21,798
I felt something was off, so I followed her.

322
00:24:37,536 --> 00:24:39,985
Luckily, she had a self-defense pocket knife or something.

323
00:24:39,985 --> 00:24:43,001
If she didn't have that, really…

324
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,927
Do you always carry a knife with you?

325
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:48,597
Yes, for self-defense.

326
00:24:48,597 --> 00:24:53,034
Anyway, you should go to the hospital for a check-up and to secure evidence.

327
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,464
Are you okay to move?

328
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:10,985
The symmetry is good, and the function is perfect.

329
00:25:10,985 --> 00:25:13,595
Good.

330
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:18,557
You seem to have some good news.

331
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:21,354
I just got some.

332
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:23,006
So, when is the surgery?

333
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:25,175
The manager will sort that out.

334
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:28,978
- I'll see you that day. 
 - Yes, take care.

335
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:34,701
Director Han, you've worked hard.

336
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,395
Hard work? Well, everyone works hard.

337
00:25:37,395 --> 00:25:39,296
Is Director Cha doing okay?

338
00:25:39,296 --> 00:25:40,482
Are there still surgery cancellations?

339
00:25:40,482 --> 00:25:45,018
Luckily, there are no additional cancellations, but…

340
00:25:45,862 --> 00:25:50,033
The Bintan partner doctor position is on temporary hold.

341
00:25:50,033 --> 00:25:51,868
What does that mean?

342
00:25:51,868 --> 00:25:53,292
Haven't you seen the article yet?

343
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:56,285
Article? What article?

344
00:25:57,135 --> 00:25:59,619
- Director Cha is inside now, right? 
 - Yes.

345
00:26:04,503 --> 00:26:05,926
Hey, Cha Jeong Woo, you…

346
00:26:05,926 --> 00:26:07,882
Is this for real?

347
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:09,135
The article came out.

348
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:10,993
Is this someone else's business?

349
00:26:10,993 --> 00:26:13,390
This is about you.

350
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,850
It's the chief director's issue.

351
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,644
So, are you going to do as you're told?

352
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:19,089
Cha Jeong Woo, you?

353
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:21,272
A victim of a crime, a traumatized patient?

354
00:26:21,272 --> 00:26:23,053
They say to cover it up, what can I do?

355
00:26:23,053 --> 00:26:25,235
Cha Jeong Woo, victims of crime...

356
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:27,862
They absolutely need that consolation and empathy.

357
00:26:27,862 --> 00:26:30,215
But you, who threw away all those feelings and came here to treat them,

358
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,495
are like a time bomb.

359
00:26:32,495 --> 00:26:35,704
What's the difference from lighting the fuse?

360
00:26:35,704 --> 00:26:38,759
Apart from empathy and consolation,

361
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,019
I said I would do the surgery.

362
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:46,698
It's going to explode soon. It'll explode.

363
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:50,343
Hello?

364
00:26:50,343 --> 00:26:53,179
 Come on up, a patient has arrived. 

365
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,321
What patient?

366
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,853
A 12CM laceration from the cheekbone to the chin. 
    

367
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:01,993
Judging by the controlled bleeding, 
    

368
00:27:01,993 --> 00:27:04,399
the artery and nerve seem to be fine. 
    

369
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:07,944
It's said he followed a woman to the bathroom.

370
00:27:07,944 --> 00:27:10,613
It's unclear whether he is the perpetrator or the victim.

371
00:27:10,613 --> 00:27:12,574
Let's start with the treatment, anyway.

372
00:27:12,574 --> 00:27:15,844
And then we can consider the second case as completed?

373
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,463
Yes.

374
00:27:18,413 --> 00:27:21,207
If it's a simple suture, wouldn't that be a non-issue?

375
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:23,168
Are you saying you're going to select patients now?

376
00:27:23,168 --> 00:27:25,712
No, it's not necessarily that; however,

377
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:28,506
if possible, something that could become an issue that would make the news...

378
00:27:28,506 --> 00:27:30,264
Do we have to wait longer?

379
00:27:30,264 --> 00:27:32,010
We need to stitch him up quickly and start the investigation.

380
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,853
Yes.

381
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:46,107
Mr. Yoon Min Soo.

382
00:27:46,107 --> 00:27:49,028
Please sit down, let me take a look.

383
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:53,490
Aren't you going to receive treatment?

384
00:27:58,992 --> 00:28:02,624
Will there be scars?

385
00:28:02,624 --> 00:28:05,246
There's no way to avoid some scarring.

386
00:28:05,246 --> 00:28:06,902
This is not it.

387
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:08,963
Doctor, this can't be real, can it?

388
00:28:08,963 --> 00:28:10,757
Mr. Yoon Min Soo, please calm down.

389
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:12,111
Please, fix my face.

390
00:28:12,111 --> 00:28:14,010
I really didn't do anything.

391
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,845
Calm down and let's start with the medical treatment.

392
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:19,732
Yes? If you get treated, something can surely be done.

393
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:38,718
   

394
00:28:41,593 --> 00:28:43,056
Shall we get off?

395
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:44,492
Well…

396
00:28:44,492 --> 00:28:47,212
I'm not really hurt.

397
00:28:47,212 --> 00:28:49,934
Do I really have to go?

398
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,831
There's a Sunflower Center next to the emergency center.

399
00:28:53,831 --> 00:28:57,642
It's a place with only female doctors, so you can feel safe.

400
00:28:58,238 --> 00:28:59,826
For the treatment of sexual assault victims

401
00:28:59,826 --> 00:29:01,074
or for the collection of evidence—

402
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:05,306
That's what I'm saying. It's not like I was sexually assaulted,

403
00:29:05,972 --> 00:29:08,717
I just don't want to be misunderstood for no reason.

404
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,655
It's okay to talk about it here. Right?

405
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:22,248
Yes.

406
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,933
I'm going to start recording.

407
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:29,831
Inside the PC room, your boyfriend, Mr. Park Dong Geon,

408
00:29:29,831 --> 00:29:31,980
had a fight with the suspect, and

409
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,784
after that, he said you went to the restroom.

410
00:29:35,784 --> 00:29:37,251
Yes.

411
00:29:37,251 --> 00:29:40,559
When I came out of the restroom, right in front of the door…

412
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:48,972
 What are you doing? 

413
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,507
 Why are you doing this? 

414
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,474
 Move aside! 

415
00:29:57,474 --> 00:30:00,322
 I said move! 

416
00:30:00,322 --> 00:30:02,327
 Move aside! 

417
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:06,085
I was so shocked that, at the moment, I—

418
00:30:06,085 --> 00:30:08,520
You swung the knife without knowing.

419
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,544
And then your boyfriend Park Dong Geon came in?

420
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:13,270
Yes.

421
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,900
   

422
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,498
This is self-defense, right?

423
00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:30,037
It seems so, given the circumstances.

424
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,961
But, for now, let's move to the center to collect evidence.

425
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:39,173
What evidence?

426
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:44,285
I didn't really have any direct physical contact.

427
00:30:44,285 --> 00:30:46,800
Besides physical contact, traces on the victim's clothes or

428
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,821
belongings can also be taken as evidence.

429
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:59,089
The starting point is quite deep.

430
00:31:01,784 --> 00:31:04,524
If you feel any discomfort, let me know.

431
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:08,450
There's nothing like that.

432
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,009
If we need any additional statements, I'll contact you.

433
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:32,618
Yes.

434
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,924
Are you done? Are you okay?

435
00:31:37,924 --> 00:31:39,476
I'm okay.

436
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:42,375
Can we go now?

437
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,320
Just a moment.

438
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:49,566
Ah, it looks like it splashed from the restroom floor.

439
00:31:49,566 --> 00:31:53,007
It seems like it could be useful evidence for reconstructing the scene.

440
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:54,918
Would you mind taking them off?

441
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:56,938
How am I supposed to go without my shoes?

442
00:31:56,938 --> 00:31:58,651
Yes, this is Officer Lee Min Hyeong.

443
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:01,192
You have spare shoes at the center, right?

444
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:10,379
Yes?

445
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:11,898
I'll take the statement from the accused.

446
00:32:11,898 --> 00:32:14,314
You go to the PC room and investigate the area.

447
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:17,001
Where is the hospital? Give me the location.

448
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:19,450
What?

449
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,511
Doctor Cha Jeong Woo?

450
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:26,492
Min Soo is so taciturn.

451
00:32:26,492 --> 00:32:28,041
He is always just drawing,

452
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:30,574
and he's a bit peculiar.

453
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,784
However, I'm not sure if this is related…

454
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:35,139
You can tell me.

455
00:32:35,139 --> 00:32:37,664
Recently, a female customer in the restroom

456
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,834
complained about someone lurking around,

457
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,980
- so I checked the CCTV. 
 - Then what?

458
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,132
But it's not like he entered a place with people around,

459
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:48,248
nor did he install something like a camera,

460
00:32:48,248 --> 00:32:50,499
so we just let it slide.

461
00:33:01,324 --> 00:33:02,824
Cut.

462
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,540
The suturing is all done.

463
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,107
Please give me a mirror.

464
00:33:36,498 --> 00:33:38,818
- Mr. Yoon Min Soo's treatment— 
  - Please wait outside.

465
00:33:38,818 --> 00:33:41,323
What? The suturing is all done—

466
00:33:41,323 --> 00:33:44,017
This is a hospital and I am the doctor.

467
00:33:44,017 --> 00:33:47,354
Will you take responsibility if something goes wrong with the patient?

468
00:33:53,728 --> 00:33:56,048
I can't give you much time.

469
00:34:00,635 --> 00:34:04,591
When was the surgery done?

470
00:34:25,986 --> 00:34:28,168
Just a moment.

471
00:34:32,198 --> 00:34:33,564
What happened?

472
00:34:33,564 --> 00:34:36,097
Move him to the operating room as soon as the ultrasound is done.

473
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:36,920
Yes.

474
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,100
You said the operating room?

475
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,071
Yoon Min Soo will be going into surgery immediately.

476
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:46,424
What? What kind of surgery?

477
00:34:51,728 --> 00:34:54,593
Starting the removal surgery

478
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,523
of patient Yoon Min Soo's breast implants.

479
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:06,926
Bovie.

480
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:18,904
After being diagnosed with gender dysphoria, she received hormone therapy

481
00:35:18,904 --> 00:35:21,974
and had breast surgery three weeks ago.

482
00:35:21,974 --> 00:35:24,840
The surgical site is severely inflamed.

483
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,974
There's a risk of sepsis, and the patient has agreed to have the implants removed.

484
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,187
A patient in a critical state due to surgical complications

485
00:35:41,187 --> 00:35:43,918
attempted sexual assault?

486
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:46,724
And that too, a patient with gender dysphoria?

487
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,929
 Yoon Min Soo 

488
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:56,013
 was previously seen lurking around the women's restroom, 

489
00:35:56,013 --> 00:35:58,042
 and they got complaints. 

490
00:35:58,042 --> 00:36:01,434
 Yoon Min Soo, who identifies as a woman, 

491
00:36:01,434 --> 00:36:04,527
 needed the women's restroom, 

492
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:06,190
 and was worried about being misunderstood because of how she presents. 

493
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:09,187
 So, she was checking to see if there was anyone around. 

494
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:12,479
 It wouldn't be easy to speak about that fact. 

495
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:15,659
 This is self-defense, right? 

496
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:17,465
 What evidence? 

497
00:36:17,465 --> 00:36:21,122
 I didn't have any direct physical contact. 

498
00:36:21,994 --> 00:36:23,494
 In that case, 

499
00:36:23,494 --> 00:36:25,862
 we need something else. 

500
00:36:25,862 --> 00:36:28,634
- Is the surgery over? 
 - Yes.

501
00:36:28,634 --> 00:36:31,257
- Yoon Min Soo's surgery record— 
 - You can't get it.

502
00:36:31,257 --> 00:36:34,026
The patient won't consent to it either.

503
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,636
If consent were given to disclose all medical records,

504
00:36:37,636 --> 00:36:39,784
you'd have already talked to the police. Right?

505
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:41,961
There is still a possibility of your patient being the perpetrator,

506
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:44,223
since it's all only circumstantial, the evidence is barely convincing.

507
00:36:44,223 --> 00:36:48,110
Someone just being transgender can't be the basis of a crime.

508
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:55,909
This means that we should look for another angle now.

509
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,980
It's difficult to clear Yoon Min Soo of the assault charges

510
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,387
merely with the surgery records.

511
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:03,292
We need to look for another method.

512
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:04,866
In other words,

513
00:37:04,866 --> 00:37:06,417
even the doctor in charge of the victim

514
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:10,196
might think that Yoon Min Soo may not be the assailant.

515
00:37:10,196 --> 00:37:12,683
Is my opinion important?

516
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,823
Suspicion needs to accumulate momentum.

517
00:37:16,823 --> 00:37:18,733
Thank you for your efforts.

518
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,001
May I ask just one thing?

519
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:29,163
Why do this? Victim medical support.

520
00:37:30,224 --> 00:37:33,208
As someone who doesn't like to interfere with patient affairs,

521
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:37,824
why particularly treat a crime victim's case?

522
00:37:40,072 --> 00:37:43,720
You don't seem the type to be told to do it.

523
00:37:44,408 --> 00:37:46,969
Maybe sincerity?

524
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,696
Just do the investigation.

525
00:38:05,343 --> 00:38:08,222
 This isn't real, is it? 

526
00:38:08,222 --> 00:38:10,315
 Please fix my face! I beg you, do something! 

527
00:38:10,315 --> 00:38:13,292
 I really didn't do anything! 

528
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:21,593
   

529
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,595
 Why do this? Victim medical support. 

530
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:47,859
 It was confirmed through the CCTV that he was lurking around the locker room. 

531
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:51,115
 But at that time, as there wasn't any criminal activity, I just let it go. 

532
00:38:51,115 --> 00:38:53,559
 But now they say a sexual harassment case has occurred in the same place. 

533
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:56,715
 Isn't he a repeat offender? Despicable guy. 

534
00:38:56,715 --> 00:39:01,473
 This scum needs chemical castration or just needs to be physically castrated. 

535
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,184
What about the person who was stabbed?

536
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:15,187
He's still hospitalized.

537
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:16,984
Why is he still in the hospital?

538
00:39:16,984 --> 00:39:20,673
The sutured area is quite large, it needs treatment for inflammation.

539
00:39:20,673 --> 00:39:23,339
Is there anything to brag about that the victim went to a plastic surgery clinic?

540
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:24,790
Bring the stabbing victim here right now.

541
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:27,190
There's something I need to check before that.

542
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,090
What is it?

543
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:31,635
I'll report back after checking.

544
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:38,455
Then I'll also…

545
00:39:38,455 --> 00:39:40,849
Ah, hey!

546
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:42,642
You go and bring the suspect.

547
00:39:42,642 --> 00:39:44,043
What's the big deal about a few stitches on the face?

548
00:39:44,043 --> 00:39:46,743
Are you hiding them at the hospital?

549
00:39:46,743 --> 00:39:48,876
Go!

550
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:51,587
The reconstructive surgery went well.

551
00:39:54,865 --> 00:39:57,325
Everyone must be talking about me.

552
00:39:57,325 --> 00:39:58,369
If it becomes known that I had surgery…

553
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:01,443
I don't disclose surgical records without my patient's consent.

554
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:05,402
He lied that his girlfriend did it in self-defense.

555
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:07,774
They'll probably blame me even more.

556
00:40:07,774 --> 00:40:11,390
Saying that kind of guy deserves it for having gender reassignment surgery.

557
00:40:12,651 --> 00:40:14,967
Self-defense?

558
00:40:15,654 --> 00:40:18,659
Because it's the only way they can get away with it.

559
00:40:22,455 --> 00:40:24,712
Director, the police are asking

560
00:40:24,712 --> 00:40:27,172
if patient Yoon Min Soo can be discharged.

561
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:28,912
Saying that he has to go in for questioning.

562
00:40:28,912 --> 00:40:31,664
Yes, everything's done here.

563
00:40:59,384 --> 00:41:01,510
What's the matter?

564
00:41:02,555 --> 00:41:05,433
   

565
00:41:25,747 --> 00:41:28,333
I am Detective Seo Gang Ho from the Southern Precinct's violent crimes team.

566
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,352
What brings you here?

567
00:41:30,352 --> 00:41:32,204
I have something to discuss with you.

568
00:41:32,204 --> 00:41:33,520
What about Mr. Park Dong Geon?

569
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,900
Is he inside?

570
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,404
He had something to do, so he stepped out.

571
00:41:41,595 --> 00:41:44,566
Do you want to come in?

572
00:41:44,566 --> 00:41:46,492
Please.

573
00:41:48,518 --> 00:41:50,243
He said he might not be able to come today

574
00:41:50,243 --> 00:41:53,145
since he went to the countryside.

575
00:41:53,145 --> 00:41:55,990
 No. Leave.­ 

576
00:42:14,644 --> 00:42:16,545
Stop!

577
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,415
Try to get away, you rat.

578
00:42:42,918 --> 00:42:44,980
Hey, are you okay?

579
00:42:47,096 --> 00:42:48,610
What is it?

580
00:42:49,307 --> 00:42:51,871
How did you know about this place?

581
00:42:51,871 --> 00:42:54,731
Hey, Mr. Park Dong Geon.

582
00:42:54,731 --> 00:42:57,187
Let's go together.

583
00:42:58,067 --> 00:43:00,826
Let's just go together.

584
00:43:18,533 --> 00:43:19,686
Darn!

585
00:43:19,686 --> 00:43:22,596
- Hi! 
 - You startled me.

586
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,829
Oh, you came?

587
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:36,217
Yes.

588
00:43:36,217 --> 00:43:37,757
Geez!

589
00:43:37,757 --> 00:43:40,933
Ah, let's go together.

590
00:43:41,713 --> 00:43:43,860
Let's go.

591
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,764
Huh? Let's go.

592
00:43:46,764 --> 00:43:49,250
Let's go quietly.

593
00:43:54,053 --> 00:43:55,434
Now, Mr. Park Dong Geon, you are

594
00:43:55,434 --> 00:43:57,150
under arrest for assault

595
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,991
and false accusations against Yoon Min Soo, as well as obstruction of justice.

596
00:44:00,991 --> 00:44:03,550
Hey, are you all right?

597
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,396
Seems like I've sprained my ankle,

598
00:44:05,396 --> 00:44:07,287
but it will get better.

599
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:08,507
However, what happened?

600
00:44:08,507 --> 00:44:09,556
Why are you here, of all places?

601
00:44:09,556 --> 00:44:11,976
Because of Dr. Cha Jeong Woo.

602
00:44:11,976 --> 00:44:14,018
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo?

603
00:44:19,092 --> 00:44:21,167
 What's the matter? 

604
00:44:22,157 --> 00:44:25,688
 How tall is the woman who cut her face? 

605
00:44:25,688 --> 00:44:27,541
 Excuse me? 

606
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:29,529
 Why do you ask? 

607
00:44:31,948 --> 00:44:34,172
 The depth of the wound at the starting point, the cheekbone area, 

608
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,658
 is more than twice as deep as the end. 

609
00:44:35,658 --> 00:44:37,970
 The direction of the wound is also from top to bottom. 

610
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:41,036
 If the shoulder height of the person wielding the weapon had been lower, 

611
00:44:41,036 --> 00:44:43,433
 the direction of the wound would have gone from bottom to top, 

612
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:44,736
 and at the starting point of the wound, the cheekbone, 

613
00:44:44,736 --> 00:44:48,356
 it wouldn't have been possible to apply enough force to scratch the bone. 

614
00:44:48,356 --> 00:44:53,094
    
 So, the perpetrator must be taller.

615
00:44:57,318 --> 00:44:59,737
Why did you miss it?

616
00:44:59,737 --> 00:45:01,424
Yoon Min Soo went straight to the hospital,

617
00:45:01,424 --> 00:45:03,562
so there was no time to examine the wound.

618
00:45:03,562 --> 00:45:05,469
It was also covered with a dressing.

619
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:08,315
Did Dr. Cha Jeong Woo tell you this when they took Yoon Min Soo away?

620
00:45:08,315 --> 00:45:11,609
Yes, very unexpectedly.

621
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,990
It is like a subtle consideration out of concern for secondary harm to the victim?

622
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:21,341
- What are you talking about? 
 - There is such a thing.

623
00:45:21,341 --> 00:45:25,536
By the way, why did you go after Park Dong Geon?

624
00:45:27,251 --> 00:45:29,583
Solid evidence came out.

625
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:31,416
What is it?

626
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:35,373
 Upon hearing Ms. Lee Soo Bin's scream and rushing to the bathroom, 

627
00:45:35,373 --> 00:45:39,379
 Yoon Min Soo was already covered in blood. 

628
00:45:41,938 --> 00:45:44,350
 That's what you stated? 

629
00:45:45,101 --> 00:45:48,179
 Yes. Why do you ask? 

630
00:45:53,534 --> 00:45:57,011
 But your sneakers show that was not the case. 

631
00:45:58,342 --> 00:46:02,421
 Do you see the tail-like pattern at the end of the elliptical bloodstain? 

632
00:46:02,421 --> 00:46:04,854
 This is called a cast-off bloodstain. 

633
00:46:04,854 --> 00:46:06,608
 When a moving object stops, 

634
00:46:06,608 --> 00:46:10,674
 blood drips off, leaving this kind of pattern. 

635
00:46:10,674 --> 00:46:15,041
 Typically, when the weapon is swung quickly and then stopped, 

636
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:19,098
 the blood on the weapon flies off and creates such stains… 

637
00:46:19,098 --> 00:46:21,410
 The pattern of the splashed blood is here 

638
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,887
 on your sneakers. 

639
00:46:23,887 --> 00:46:27,248
 Which means it was you, Mr. Park Dong Geon, 

640
00:46:27,248 --> 00:46:29,980
 at the scene at the time of the attack! 

641
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:59,667
 Darn it. 

642
00:47:03,173 --> 00:47:04,791
 You, there. 

643
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:06,643
 You can clean up a bit later, can't you? 

644
00:47:06,643 --> 00:47:08,837
 You can't bring alcohol in here. 

645
00:47:08,837 --> 00:47:11,715
 Just stop it, will you? 

646
00:47:11,715 --> 00:47:13,872
 I'm sorry. 

647
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,932
 I need to use the restroom. 

648
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:27,490
   

649
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:55,516
 Hey, I told you to clean up later! 

650
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,858
 Hey! Are you crazy? 

651
00:48:03,858 --> 00:48:07,497
 Darn it, I lost a round because of this guy! 

652
00:48:12,029 --> 00:48:15,536
 Did you just do this because of that stupid game? 

653
00:48:21,224 --> 00:48:24,751
 Where are you going? How can you just leave? 

654
00:48:24,751 --> 00:48:27,582
 Figure it out yourself, you lunatic. 

655
00:48:27,582 --> 00:48:30,063
 Hey, help me out. 

656
00:48:30,063 --> 00:48:31,313
 I'll do better from now on. 

657
00:48:31,313 --> 00:48:33,782
 Help you with what? 

658
00:48:39,929 --> 00:48:42,803
He was the one who started it.

659
00:48:45,761 --> 00:48:48,389
I'm saying he picked the fight!

660
00:48:48,389 --> 00:48:50,473
Damn it.

661
00:48:53,421 --> 00:48:56,263
As of now, your status is changing from victim to suspect

662
00:48:56,263 --> 00:48:59,332
of special assault and false accusation.

663
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,514
Damn it!

664
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:39,017
Thank you.

665
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,470
For not disclosing my surgery records

666
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,513
and helping…

667
00:49:44,513 --> 00:49:47,580
Don't worry about it. I did what I had to.

668
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,260
Have a good day.

669
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,472
If you want scar care,

670
00:49:50,472 --> 00:49:51,962
come back in about two weeks.

671
00:49:51,962 --> 00:49:53,774
Um…

672
00:49:55,582 --> 00:49:58,371
This is nothing much, but

673
00:49:58,371 --> 00:50:01,567
it's a drawing I made.

674
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:09,602
I dream of being a painter like Lili Elbe.

675
00:50:09,602 --> 00:50:11,810
Out of my sincerity…

676
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,940
Just!

677
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:18,555
I'm also asking for a revision surgery.

678
00:50:21,648 --> 00:50:24,426
I am not asking for free service.

679
00:50:24,426 --> 00:50:29,221
Because I think I can trust you as a doctor.

680
00:50:32,406 --> 00:50:35,066
The surgery cost is not insignificant.

681
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:36,814
Excuse me?

682
00:50:36,814 --> 00:50:39,058
Well, it seems fine.

683
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:42,403
If you fulfill your dream later,

684
00:50:42,403 --> 00:50:45,090
this painting alone should suffice.

685
00:50:46,569 --> 00:50:49,741
Jeong Woo, the new bar next door… Oh sorry! You were in consultation.

686
00:50:49,741 --> 00:50:52,151
Sorry, please continue.

687
00:50:52,151 --> 00:50:54,113
I'll come back later.

688
00:50:56,581 --> 00:50:58,624
Thank you.

689
00:51:08,234 --> 00:51:11,116
Thank you? What's that?

690
00:51:11,116 --> 00:51:12,651
What's with this warm atmosphere?

691
00:51:12,651 --> 00:51:13,998
What now?

692
00:51:13,998 --> 00:51:15,071
Can you handle it?

693
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,104
Handle what?

694
00:51:16,104 --> 00:51:19,564
Reconstructing trauma, finding the truth of the case,

695
00:51:19,564 --> 00:51:20,618
and even a thanks offering out of emotion.

696
00:51:20,618 --> 00:51:22,304
It's nice to see.

697
00:51:22,304 --> 00:51:23,405
If you're jealous, do you want to do it?

698
00:51:23,405 --> 00:51:25,928
- Should I tell our senior about— 
 - Hey!

699
00:51:26,797 --> 00:51:32,047
I'll just become the god of those girls pursuing beauty.

700
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,539
Let's go to the newly opened bar next door.

701
00:51:34,539 --> 00:51:36,182
This is a painting I haven't seen before.

702
00:51:36,182 --> 00:51:37,900
It's not you, right?

703
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,119
It doesn't resemble you, man.

704
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:13,359
Cha Jeong Woo was originally an emergency medical doctor.

705
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,927
The plastic surgery and emergency departments were in one place.

706
00:52:15,927 --> 00:52:18,123
He was assigned to take care of victims who needed his care.

707
00:52:18,123 --> 00:52:20,720
Why did he transfer from emergency medicine to plastic surgery?

708
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,311
In the emergency room, doctors need to be armed with a sense of mission.

709
00:52:23,311 --> 00:52:24,863
How tiring must that be?

710
00:52:24,863 --> 00:52:27,457
Plastic surgery, of course, follows the money, too.

711
00:52:27,457 --> 00:52:29,920
And he doesn't have to get deeply involved with patients' situations.

712
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,501
It would fit right in with his personality, wouldn't it?

713
00:52:35,733 --> 00:52:39,688
Someone who doesn't like to get involved with patients' affairs…

714
00:52:44,052 --> 00:52:46,760
 This is a hospital and I am the doctor. 

715
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,240
 Will you take responsibility if something goes wrong with the patient? 

716
00:52:53,723 --> 00:52:56,047
If that were the case, would he really have been a dedicated doctor for the victim?

717
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,247
He's doing this out of necessity due to Mr. Nam Gi Taek's death.

718
00:52:58,247 --> 00:53:00,934
It doesn't seem like he does something just because he's told.

719
00:53:00,934 --> 00:53:05,296
It's about restoring his tarnished honor. There's nothing he wouldn't do.

720
00:53:06,515 --> 00:53:10,256
The thing about Mr. Nam Gi Taek, did you check on it?

721
00:53:11,774 --> 00:53:13,973
Of course.

722
00:53:13,973 --> 00:53:16,163
In Nam Gi Taek's records from two days before his death,

723
00:53:16,163 --> 00:53:19,641
there were calls with those hospitals written on the memo.

724
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:22,246
And the warrant has been requested.

725
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,670
He probably made an appointment…

726
00:53:35,223 --> 00:53:37,950
   

727
00:53:41,304 --> 00:53:43,651
Nothing from the dash cams?

728
00:53:43,651 --> 00:53:46,585
There is a vehicle owner who said they would contact us after checking the footage,

729
00:53:46,585 --> 00:53:48,574
but they still haven't contacted—

730
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:52,429
No contact?

731
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:55,143
- I am about to make the call now. 
 - Now?

732
00:53:55,143 --> 00:53:56,890
Right now.

733
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:03,688
Yes, this is Lee Min Hyeong from Seoul Southern Police Station.

734
00:54:04,524 --> 00:54:06,522
Yes, that's correct.

735
00:54:08,759 --> 00:54:11,008
Nam Hyo Joo?

736
00:54:21,279 --> 00:54:24,278
The day he died…

737
00:54:24,946 --> 00:54:28,524
I saw someone passing by.

738
00:54:28,524 --> 00:54:31,555
When I went to investigate, they said they saw nothing.

739
00:54:31,555 --> 00:54:35,338
I was a bit drunk that day, too.

740
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:39,333
I only caught a glimpse of the person's back,

741
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:45,354
but the shoes were a bit strange.

742
00:54:48,902 --> 00:54:50,415
They were black sneakers, but

743
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:53,956
it seemed like something was taped to the bottom.

744
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:57,264
There were no footprints at the time?

745
00:54:57,264 --> 00:55:00,476
It might have been intentional, taping the shoes in advance.

746
00:55:00,476 --> 00:55:02,954
Then, my dad…

747
00:55:02,954 --> 00:55:05,612
It wasn't a suicide?

748
00:55:07,715 --> 00:55:09,803
We can't say that yet.

749
00:55:09,803 --> 00:55:11,809
While we look into it more,

750
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,660
let's keep today's discussion to ourselves for now.

751
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:17,297
At least for the protection of the informant.

752
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:21,427
I'll investigate and contact you again.

753
00:55:23,415 --> 00:55:25,958
I didn't know.

754
00:55:26,459 --> 00:55:30,971
I asked you to finish the investigation quickly.

755
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:46,736
Don't worry about it.

756
00:55:46,736 --> 00:55:49,688
Even though you asked me to wrap it up,

757
00:55:49,688 --> 00:55:52,789
I never considered doing it or concluding the investigation.

758
00:56:33,044 --> 00:56:35,058
If the man captured on the dash cam

759
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,981
is related to Mr. Nam Gi Taek's death,

760
00:56:39,495 --> 00:56:43,704
why would they deliberately involve Dr. Cha Jeong Woo?

761
00:56:56,912 --> 00:57:02,218
Well, if it's someone with a grudge, it's not impossible.

762
00:57:30,249 --> 00:57:34,513
Then, isn't Mr. Cha Jeong Woo in danger?

763
00:57:57,588 --> 00:58:00,360
   

764
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:14,900



765
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,350
♫  Hello, hi there, are you there  ♫

766
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:22,235
 She was a victim of a sulfuric acid attack. 

767
00:58:22,235 --> 00:58:23,390
 This is a cosmetic surgery clinic. 

768
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:25,414
 If you want to provide emotional care for the patient, 

769
00:58:25,414 --> 00:58:27,184
 then transfer them to another hospital. 

770
00:58:27,184 --> 00:58:29,246
 The person who killed my father. 

771
00:58:29,246 --> 00:58:31,745
 They said he might be someone with a grudge against you. 

772
00:58:31,745 --> 00:58:33,320
 He needs just a little. 

773
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,755
 If he just had a tiny bit of empathy, nothing more. 

774
00:58:35,755 --> 00:58:37,181
 Enough worrying about others, 

775
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:38,794
 just put the fat back in there. 

776
00:58:38,794 --> 00:58:40,898
 How did he catch on to that so quickly? 

777
00:58:40,898 --> 00:58:42,749
 The day Mr. Nam Gi Taek died, 

778
00:58:42,749 --> 00:58:44,894
 the person who came out of that house. 

779
00:58:44,894 --> 00:58:47,124
 Is this the person? 

780
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:52,900
♫   I've been missing you and waiting for you here  ♫
