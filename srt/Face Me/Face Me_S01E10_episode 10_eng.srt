00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:02,010
   

7
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:18,664
 The door opens. 

8
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:21,715
 Someone comes running out. 

9
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:28,764
 It's Cha Jeong Woo in a tuxedo, 

10
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:30,575
 and… 

11
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:34,490
 and then, another person, 

12
00:02:35,844 --> 00:02:39,892
 running from the one chasing after him. 

13
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:43,864
There are two, two of them...

14
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:47,964
that came out of that house.

15
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:57,178
What about the person who left first? Did you see his face?

16
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:02,898
No.

17
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:08,020
I didn't see it.

18
00:03:14,364 --> 00:03:17,000
It matches your memory.

19
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:22,031
That there was someone else at Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's place.

20
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:23,797
Perhaps after hearing what I said…

21
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:26,731
No, he mentioned it first.

22
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:30,197
He said it seemed like you were chasing someone.

23
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:35,981
He requested a hypnotic investigation himself.

24
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:42,097
What did you mean when you said the real culprit is on the move?

25
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,630
It's about the Nam Hyo Joo case.

26
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,864
The DNA of the culprit found under Nam Hyo Joo's fingernails,

27
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:52,831
and the other DNA taken from the watch match.

28
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:54,797
Then, the case of Hye Jin and Nam Hyo Joo—

29
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:57,364
Have the same perpetrator.

30
00:03:57,364 --> 00:04:01,137
 The person who murdered Nam Gi Taek and staged it as a suicide, 

31
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:07,715
 and the criminal who attacked Nam Hyo Joo in an attempt to eliminate a witness, 

32
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:11,997
 is the same person who murdered Ms.Yoon Hye Jin seven years ago. 

33
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:16,564
In the end,

34
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:18,664
both in the past and now,

35
00:04:18,664 --> 00:04:22,064
the criminal is still moving around you.

36
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,190
 Hye Jin! 

37
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:18,390
 Hye Jin! Hye Jin! 

38
00:05:19,064 --> 00:05:20,997
 Hye Jin! 

39
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,498
 There's someone in the room. 

40
00:05:37,064 --> 00:05:39,264
Can you see the face?

41
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:41,988
Do you know who it is?

42
00:05:57,218 --> 00:05:59,225
 Who are you? 

43
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:27,186
Did you see the face?

44
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:35,151
 Do you know the person? 

45
00:06:58,964 --> 00:06:59,964
- Yes, talk— 
  - Senior, 

46
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:01,731
 you're with Dr. Cha Jeong Woo, aren't you? 

47
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:03,397
 The team leader is in a frenzy right now. 

48
00:07:03,397 --> 00:07:05,667
I'll go back and explain.

49
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:20,664
 It seems like he saw the culprit, but... 

50
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:22,364
 for some reason that I can't discern, 

51
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:25,337
 he is denying the memory himself. 

52
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:28,564
Are you okay?

53
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:30,551
In the end,

54
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,231
we didn't catch the real culprit.

55
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:35,897
But we confirmed that there is a real perpetrator.

56
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:38,278
It will take time.

57
00:07:41,517 --> 00:07:45,498
I'm still the prime suspect, aren't I?

58
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:50,364
It's because we haven't received the forensic report yet.

59
00:07:50,364 --> 00:07:54,531
I intended to report after the hypnosis investigation if things became clearer.

60
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:57,185
Let's go.

61
00:07:58,597 --> 00:07:59,664
Where to?

62
00:07:59,664 --> 00:08:02,697
We need to meet the real culprit.

63
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:06,745
It's not the present me who's denying the memory,

64
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:09,228
but the me from seven years ago.

65
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:23,531
You lost the suspect in front of the police station?

66
00:08:23,531 --> 00:08:25,397
No, it's not that we lost him, but with Detective Min Hyeong—

67
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:26,464
Don't make excuses!

68
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,450
You failed to catch them, which means they got away!

69
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,097
Their identity is confirmed. They couldn't possibly run away, right?

70
00:08:31,097 --> 00:08:33,916
An active police officer concealed a murder case.

71
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,964
Who knows what the repercussions will be if this becomes an issue?

72
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:39,842
Higher-ups are in a frenzy to get it resolved quickly,

73
00:08:41,764 --> 00:08:44,230
and you lost the suspect?

74
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,631
Go out and find them immediately!

75
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:48,727
- Yes! 
- Yes!

76
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:55,457
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo has voluntarily appeared.

77
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:05,164
What's this?

78
00:09:05,164 --> 00:09:07,664
It's the suspect's evidence.

79
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:11,931
Please reinvestigate Yoon Hye Jin's murder case.

80
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,070
   

81
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:26,157
I thought it was lost during the accident seven years ago,

82
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:28,903
but my mother had it.

83
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:31,397
What about this photo?

84
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:34,331
It was received without a caller ID,

85
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:37,631
and a few other similar photos came through.

86
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:43,430
Hye Jin and I,

87
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:48,220
we weren't in a relationship to care about such pictures.

88
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:52,197
Does anyone have any guesses as to who it might be?

89
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:53,931
We'll have to check.

90
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:58,364
I can't let anyone else get hurt because of me.

91
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:01,731
Cha Jeong Woo is not the suspect,

92
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:03,531
but a witness to the case.

93
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:05,331
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo, at the time of the Yoon Hye Jin case,

94
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:08,264
is assumed to have had a physical altercation with the criminal at the scene.

95
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:11,031
After that, while chasing the fleeing criminal,

96
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:12,997
it seems he was involved in a traffic accident.

97
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:16,197
Lee Jin Seok's statement during the hypnosis investigation is similar.

98
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:19,797
However, the real culprit who killed Yoon Hye Jin,

99
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:24,300
and the criminal in the Nam Gi Taek and Nam Hyo Joo cases are the same person?

100
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:26,031
What's the evidence?

101
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:28,531
The criminal's DNA from Yoon Hye Jin's case scene and

102
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:32,064
the criminal's DNA from the Nam Hyo Joo case scene match.

103
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,264
And the criminal who staged Nam Gi Taek's murder as a suicide is

104
00:10:35,264 --> 00:10:38,331
the one who attacked Nam Hyo Joo to eliminate a witness.

105
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:41,564
The point is that the three incidents involve the same culprit

106
00:10:41,564 --> 00:10:45,531
and that the criminal is an acquaintance of Cha Jeong Woo.

107
00:10:45,531 --> 00:10:48,556
Make a list by investigating the people around him,

108
00:10:48,556 --> 00:10:51,680
and then compare it with the criminal's DNA found under Nam Hyo Joo's fingernails.

109
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,884
Is there no other evidence to narrow down the suspects?

110
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:56,731
The keyring.

111
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:58,394
Keyring?

112
00:11:01,264 --> 00:11:03,697
It was found on the balcony where Mr. Nam Gi Taek fell,

113
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,200
and it's presumed to belong to the criminal.

114
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,431
- It's a limited edition. 
 - Limited edition?

115
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:13,764
Ah, it's a commemorative keyring from a medical volunteer program at Cheongsoo Prison.

116
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:16,664
Then,

117
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:19,531
among the inmates who participated in that volunteer program,

118
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:23,064
if we investigate any connection between Dr. Cha and Nam Gi Taek, we might find the answer.

119
00:11:23,064 --> 00:11:24,331
Go ahead.

120
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:25,764
Also, get ahold of yourselves!

121
00:11:25,764 --> 00:11:28,464
We have neither time nor a valid reason.

122
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:30,764
If Lee Jin Seok files for a retrial and the case resurfaces,

123
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:32,564
then all of us are done for, got it?

124
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:34,531
- Yes! 
  - Yes! 

125
00:11:41,231 --> 00:11:43,364
What about the cell phone pictures?

126
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:47,990
We'll have to find out who sent them and why.

127
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:50,700
   

128
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:53,297
Senior,

129
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:56,597
could this be a crime of passion?

130
00:11:57,231 --> 00:12:01,053
Perhaps, during a fight with the jealous lover, the victim fell back.

131
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,931
As the victim died,

132
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,008
he stabbed the body to disguise it as a robbery.

133
00:12:07,231 --> 00:12:09,597
 Judging by the extent of the injuries, 

134
00:12:09,597 --> 00:12:12,945
it's not fatal.

135
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,931
   
   

136
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,300
 Then Hye Jin's and Nam Hyo Joo's cases… 

137
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,264
 Have the same perpetrator. 

138
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:32,097
 Ultimately, 

139
00:12:32,097 --> 00:12:34,264
 both in the past, and now, 

140
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:37,504
 the criminal is still operating around you. 

141
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:40,371
 All of this is happening because of me… 

142
00:12:50,197 --> 00:12:51,697
   

143
00:12:51,697 --> 00:12:54,364
   

144
00:12:54,364 --> 00:12:59,097
   

145
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:06,630
 Jeong Woo! 

146
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:10,997
 Ah, I really did remember today. 

147
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:13,019
 - Really. 
 - Senior. 

148
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,131
 You worked hard today. 

149
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:15,331
 - Good work! 
 - Good work! 

150
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:17,497
 Go on in. 

151
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,597
 I know. 

152
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:22,380
 You must've saved another person again. 

153
00:13:23,064 --> 00:13:26,897
 - Are you angry? 
 - No, I'm in a really good mood. 

154
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:28,550
 Why? 

155
00:13:29,664 --> 00:13:34,131
 The people you saved are now saving you. 

156
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:39,684
 Are you saying the people I saved are saving me? 

157
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:41,757
 What do you mean? 

158
00:13:41,757 --> 00:13:43,543
 There's something like that. 

159
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:46,340
 - Huh? 
 - Let's just take a commemorative photo. 

160
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,840
 Here. 

161
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,237
 Here. 

162
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,405
 - Smile. 
 - Yes. 

163
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:56,097
   

164
00:13:56,097 --> 00:13:57,897
 Does anyone have a guess who it might be? 

165
00:13:57,897 --> 00:14:00,197
   

166
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,240
 ­  

167
00:14:14,564 --> 00:14:18,264
 - You've worked hard today. 
 - Good job. 

168
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:26,551
   

169
00:14:45,397 --> 00:14:47,450
Ms. Hyo Joo.

170
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,331
- How's your condition? Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

171
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:52,497
We're planning to schedule the skin grafting and

172
00:14:52,497 --> 00:14:55,138
reconstructive surgery for next week.

173
00:14:55,138 --> 00:14:58,769
Ah… Yes.

174
00:15:00,797 --> 00:15:03,264
It's not a difficult surgery.

175
00:15:03,264 --> 00:15:05,164
It's the period after surgery

176
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:07,656
that is more problematic.

177
00:15:08,597 --> 00:15:11,764
You can be discharged 2 to 3 days after the surgery.

178
00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:14,160
What are your plans?

179
00:15:14,577 --> 00:15:18,477
I plan to go home.

180
00:15:20,964 --> 00:15:23,697
Once a temporary residence is arranged, after talking with the police,

181
00:15:23,697 --> 00:15:27,497
I'll fix the surgery schedule.

182
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,902
I'm sure I saw him.

183
00:15:36,997 --> 00:15:39,597
But I can't remember.

184
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:46,278
It's not your fault, Ms. Hyo Joo.

185
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:48,487
Being a victim of a crime,

186
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:51,197
as well as not remembering what happened that day.

187
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,564
Please get the pre-surgery examinations done in advance.

188
00:15:59,564 --> 00:16:01,097
Yes.

189
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:16,229
Hello?

190
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:20,764
Oh, I see.

191
00:16:20,764 --> 00:16:23,664
Thank you for your cooperation. Yes.

192
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:25,697
   

193
00:16:29,064 --> 00:16:30,864
Among those who received keyrings,

194
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,264
excluding those who are serving sentences,

195
00:16:32,264 --> 00:16:36,331
we are locating the rest and securing their alibis.

196
00:16:36,331 --> 00:16:38,364
There are too many.

197
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:43,719
 Yes, that's the souvenir from the volunteer service at Cheongsoo Prison last year. 

198
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,397
 But, if you take the fingerprints from this, 

199
00:16:45,397 --> 00:16:47,831
 you can quickly find out who it is. Right? 

200
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:49,831
 Ah, I was also part of the volunteer group. 

201
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:55,172
If Yoon Hye Jin and Nam Gi Taek were killed by the same person,

202
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:57,632
Cha Jeong Woo, Yoon Hye Jin and Nam Gi Taek

203
00:16:57,632 --> 00:16:59,564
must have had a connection between them.

204
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:02,197
Right? However, among the prisoners,

205
00:17:02,197 --> 00:17:05,864
it's not easy to find a connection with Dr. Cha Jeong Woo.

206
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:10,464
That keyring.

207
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:15,197
Did only the prisoners receive it?

208
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:17,869
Then who else would have received it?

209
00:17:20,864 --> 00:17:23,375
 The medical staff? 

210
00:17:24,064 --> 00:17:25,997
Ah, but the motive for the murder…

211
00:17:25,997 --> 00:17:28,564
Moreover, if it's the same perpetrator as in the Yoon Hye Jin case,

212
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:30,997
there should be a motive for killing Yoon Hye Jin as well.

213
00:17:30,997 --> 00:17:32,677
Ah, these people…

214
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:37,031
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo is denying his memory of the criminal.

215
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:39,664
Does that mean the person is that shocking?

216
00:17:39,664 --> 00:17:42,031
Whether it's a shocking reason or not,

217
00:17:42,031 --> 00:17:44,696
if we need to find that reason,

218
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:48,031
we'll have to start from here.

219
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,864
Is the surgery for patient Nam Hyo Joo scheduled for the day after tomorrow?

220
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:58,397
Yes, we've scheduled it to match Director Cha's schedule.

221
00:17:58,397 --> 00:18:02,531
Let's not postpone it any further and just go with the scheduled plan.

222
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,564
Ah, we're short on hospital rooms, too.

223
00:18:08,564 --> 00:18:11,971
It's better to perform the surgery quickly and discharge the patient.

224
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:13,770
Hey, Director.

225
00:18:14,904 --> 00:18:18,197
Has the surgery schedule been set for Ms. Nam Hyo Joo?

226
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,147
We were just discussing that.

227
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:22,631
You'll be informed once it's scheduled.

228
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:24,964
Why is there so much interest?

229
00:18:24,964 --> 00:18:26,901
Well, I mean…

230
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,097
Ah, Madam.

231
00:18:29,097 --> 00:18:31,997
What surgery is Director Cha performing again?

232
00:18:31,997 --> 00:18:35,631
What happened to Bintan? They say Jeong Woo hasn't departed yet?

233
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:50,497
   

234
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:51,864
   

235
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,331
We didn't know when he came to our hospital.

236
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:56,697
I didn't realize he was someone I saw while volunteering...

237
00:18:56,697 --> 00:18:59,131
I found out a bit after his death.

238
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:01,230
Mother told me.

239
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,564
Pardon?

240
00:19:02,564 --> 00:19:03,997
Ah, Jeong Woo's mother.

241
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:06,296
I mean Yoon Seo Hui.

242
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:08,797
She's a friend's mother, but you two seem to be very close. Right?

243
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:09,931
Yes.

244
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:13,097
She's like a real mother to me.

245
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:16,697
According to the investigation records at the time,

246
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:20,936
It says you were not favorable to your son's marriage.

247
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:23,197
Are you reinvestigating that case?

248
00:19:23,197 --> 00:19:25,131
As you know,

249
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:28,199
the investigation at that time was flawed.

250
00:19:30,564 --> 00:19:33,731
There was a cover-up of Dr. Cha Jeong Woo's accident

251
00:19:33,731 --> 00:19:36,708
and a cellphone that wasn't submitted.

252
00:19:37,864 --> 00:19:40,964
Do you know something regarding the photos

253
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:43,464
that were on the cellphone?

254
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:45,597
No, I don't.

255
00:19:47,797 --> 00:19:52,897
I heard you've known Dr. Cha Jeong Woo for quite some time.

256
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:55,731
Ah, yes.

257
00:19:55,731 --> 00:19:58,724
Director Cha's mother and I were college classmates.

258
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:00,764
Well, I've known him since he was young.

259
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:04,297
Then, you must be acquainted with Ms. Yoon Hye Jin as well?

260
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:09,431
I saw her a few times when their marriage came up.

261
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:13,764
I've heard there was strong opposition to Dr. Cha Jeong Woo's marriage.

262
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:15,764
From me?

263
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:18,297
From Dr. Cha Jeong Woo's mother.

264
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:22,839
However, why are you suddenly asking about such things?

265
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,815
Yoon Hye Jin's case's perpetrator

266
00:20:24,815 --> 00:20:26,764
is the same as Nam Gi Taek and Nam Hyo Joo's cases?

267
00:20:26,764 --> 00:20:29,871
You seem to have a lot of interest in the investigation.

268
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:34,431
Because it involves Director Cha, whom I care about.

269
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,923
Do you remember where you were on the day of Mr. Nam Gi Taek's death?

270
00:20:38,923 --> 00:20:41,697
What? You mean me?

271
00:20:41,697 --> 00:20:44,142
It's a formal question.

272
00:20:45,264 --> 00:20:47,764
I drank at a bar I often go to.

273
00:20:47,764 --> 00:20:49,197
You remember it clearly.

274
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:50,364
Yes.

275
00:20:50,364 --> 00:20:52,764
The next day, I was struggling with a hangover,

276
00:20:52,764 --> 00:20:55,897
but seeing the article about Mr. Nam Gi Taek snapped me out of it.

277
00:20:55,897 --> 00:20:58,864
Ah, that day was also plastered with articles about Director Cha.

278
00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:01,160
You must be quite close to Director Cha.

279
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,951
Of course, we are like brothers.

280
00:21:03,951 --> 00:21:07,231
But last week, you came to our hospital

281
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:09,871
and mentioned investigating Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's case, didn't you?

282
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:11,810
Well… yes, I did.

283
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,964
Then, why are you suddenly asking about Mr. Nam Gi Taek?

284
00:21:14,964 --> 00:21:18,764
Ah! Does it have something to do with Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's case?

285
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:25,931
Do you happen to have a keyring?

286
00:21:28,131 --> 00:21:30,631
This is also a formal, I mean…

287
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:32,431
It is not a formal question.

288
00:21:32,431 --> 00:21:35,083
Please answer precisely.

289
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:42,867
Well, I…

290
00:21:44,297 --> 00:21:46,393
Of course…

291
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,664
I don't have it.

292
00:21:49,664 --> 00:21:51,903
I lost it.

293
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:58,731
But the only doctor likely to have it would be our director.

294
00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:01,331
After our director finishes his volunteer work,

295
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:05,697
he likes to collect items for certification.

296
00:22:07,731 --> 00:22:11,831
It was displayed in the hospital's showcase,

297
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,059
but someone took it.

298
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,552
It suddenly disappeared.

299
00:22:18,097 --> 00:22:20,197
When was that?

300
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:23,097
Ah, this is tricky.

301
00:22:23,097 --> 00:22:25,437
I'm not sure.

302
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:28,734
However, is the owner of this keyring

303
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:31,974
the criminal of Nam Gi Taek and Nam Hyo Joo's cases?

304
00:22:33,697 --> 00:22:36,975
You have the keyring that was a souvenir

305
00:22:36,975 --> 00:22:38,231
at that time, don't you?

306
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:41,564
No, I don't have it.

307
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:45,731
Weren't you the one who organized it?

308
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,397
Then, at least a souvenir—

309
00:22:47,397 --> 00:22:50,431
It wasn't really something to commemorate,

310
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:52,931
since it's something I do often.

311
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:55,464
The day Mr. Nam Gi Taek died,

312
00:22:55,464 --> 00:22:58,364
do you remember where you were and what you were doing?

313
00:22:58,364 --> 00:23:01,064
Well, I must have been at home, right?

314
00:23:01,064 --> 00:23:04,770
I usually spend time alone quietly after work.

315
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,237
Were you at home with someone?

316
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:11,303
I'm a middle-aged person living alone.

317
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:12,412
Excuse me?

318
00:23:12,412 --> 00:23:14,564
I…

319
00:23:14,564 --> 00:23:18,264
I'm a middle-aged person who lives alone.

320
00:23:20,564 --> 00:23:22,397
Then, during the Nam Hyo Joo case, too?

321
00:23:22,397 --> 00:23:25,497
Well… I must have been at home.

322
00:23:25,497 --> 00:23:27,531
Perhaps…

323
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,331
You didn't take or send

324
00:23:30,331 --> 00:23:34,931
the photos that were on the phone, did you?

325
00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:37,431
I don't remember doing that.

326
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:45,197
Hey, do you really not know anything at all?

327
00:23:45,197 --> 00:23:46,464
Seriously!

328
00:23:46,464 --> 00:23:50,331
I'm just dying, trying to do surgery or drinking like crazy.

329
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:53,997
Then, did our idle director hear anything?

330
00:23:53,997 --> 00:23:55,331
Ah, darn it…

331
00:23:55,331 --> 00:23:57,331
Don't you know me at all?

332
00:23:57,331 --> 00:24:00,597
Do I look like the kind of person who just knows things? Like who?

333
00:24:00,597 --> 00:24:02,350
Madam, are you finished?

334
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,384
Yes.

335
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:05,031
You came out earlier than I thought.

336
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:06,650
What's there to talk about for so long?

337
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,510
Mother, do you perhaps know something…

338
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,984
Jeez, this coffee tastes awful.

339
00:24:15,244 --> 00:24:17,810
What kind of situation is this, really?

340
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,231
 According to the investigation records at the time, 

341
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:31,364
 there was content suggesting your disapproval of your son's marriage. 

342
00:24:31,364 --> 00:24:33,197
 You didn't take or send 

343
00:24:33,197 --> 00:24:38,064
 the photos that were on the phone, did you? 

344
00:24:40,931 --> 00:24:42,997
   
   

345
00:25:04,864 --> 00:25:08,096
 Due to the incident seven years ago, he suddenly quit. 

346
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:11,053
 I do have the address where he used to live, 

347
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:13,111
 but it's been a long time… 

348
00:25:39,697 --> 00:25:40,897
   

349
00:25:40,897 --> 00:25:42,864
   

350
00:25:42,864 --> 00:25:45,310
Is there something wrong?

351
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,631
Just checking if there's anything that could be wrong, you know.

352
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:51,631
How are Nam Hyo Joo's case suspect movements being tracked?

353
00:25:51,631 --> 00:25:53,531
We tracked down to the subway station,

354
00:25:53,531 --> 00:25:56,564
but he just jumped over the ticket gates.

355
00:25:57,031 --> 00:26:00,997
We need to check all the subway CCTV footage, obviously.

356
00:26:00,997 --> 00:26:02,866
Keep following him.

357
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:07,555
We need to confirm the final movements to match with the people investigated so we can try to match them.

358
00:26:07,555 --> 00:26:12,531
But Dr. Cha Jeong Woo's mother, isn't she a bit strange?

359
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:13,683
In what way?

360
00:26:13,683 --> 00:26:15,931
The fact that she said she doesn't remember when asked about the photo.

361
00:26:15,931 --> 00:26:18,964
There's no way she couldn't remember something like that.

362
00:26:18,964 --> 00:26:20,291
Maybe,

363
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:24,615
she hired someone to separate Cha Jeong Woo and Yoon Hye Jin.

364
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:27,937
We don't know the person, after all.

365
00:26:27,937 --> 00:26:30,124
   
   

366
00:26:34,797 --> 00:26:38,597
They said you quit all of a sudden.

367
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,864
Am I being misunderstood right now?

368
00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:44,197
Depends on your answer.

369
00:26:45,997 --> 00:26:48,144
You're just as I've heard.

370
00:26:48,144 --> 00:26:50,617
I don't mean it in a bad way.

371
00:26:50,617 --> 00:26:53,897
"Honest, unpretentious. That's his charm."

372
00:26:53,897 --> 00:26:56,897
Ms. Hye Jin talked so much about you.

373
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:02,131
Me quitting dancing

374
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:06,764
isn't completely unrelated to Hye Jin.

375
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,631
She supported me a lot,

376
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:12,664
but it didn't go well without her.

377
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:15,931
And that incident.

378
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:20,964
It was quite a shock for me, too.

379
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:28,597
Around that time, is there anything

380
00:27:28,597 --> 00:27:31,204
you might have known about Hye Jin?

381
00:27:31,204 --> 00:27:34,837
But… why come to me now?

382
00:27:39,802 --> 00:27:42,369
This belongs to her.

383
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:45,729
I thought you'd come to find it right away.

384
00:27:48,629 --> 00:27:50,735
Ah, and about that photo,

385
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:54,435
Hye Jin had it on her phone, too.

386
00:27:55,569 --> 00:27:59,942
Ms. Hye Jin's reaction was a bit unusual at that time,

387
00:27:59,942 --> 00:28:01,310
so it stuck in my memory.

388
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,080
♫  Ain't gonna lie I really wish they would like a cabin ♫

389
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,840
♫  I ain't do no fronting get my money on the back end ♫

390
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,810
♫  Yesterday's price ain't today, now we taxin' ♫

391
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,120
♫  Way out the fee, ain't no way out for me ♫

392
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,060
♫  They always told me I’m the wave like I'm way out in the sea ♫

393
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,990
♫  I knew some real turned state it, ain't no I could be  ♫

394
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,910
♫  Out living like a villain only way up for me ♫

395
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,890
♫  Moving out the perjurers, I give time if it was worth it ♫

396
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,160
♫  If coming at the fam then you know I take it personal ♫

397
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,010
 Huh? That's me, right? 

398
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,077
 Yes, it's you. 

399
00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:37,402
 Wow… this is just perfect for misunderstanding, isn't it? 

400
00:28:37,402 --> 00:28:39,641
 Ms. Hye Jin, who took this? Your boyfriend? 

401
00:28:39,641 --> 00:28:42,069
 Eh? Jeong Woo isn't that kind of person. 

402
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:43,371
 Then who was it? 

403
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:45,919
 Why do you care? I don't even care. 

404
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,901
 But I'm involved too… 

405
00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:50,202
 Did you report it? 

406
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:51,635
 Geez, who is it? 

407
00:28:51,635 --> 00:28:52,914
 Do you know this person? 

408
00:28:52,914 --> 00:28:55,634
 Come on, let's start over. 

409
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:58,102
 There were a few more pictures with a similar vibe. 

410
00:28:58,102 --> 00:28:59,835
 But she didn't pay much attention to them. 

411
00:28:59,835 --> 00:29:01,694
 Similar pictures, you say? 

412
00:29:01,694 --> 00:29:03,969
 It looked like she was alone with another man, 

413
00:29:03,969 --> 00:29:06,635
 as if it was intentionally made to feel that way. 

414
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:10,169
 Maybe someone harbored ill will towards Hye Jin, 

415
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:13,202
 and wanted to break up your marriage? 

416
00:29:17,635 --> 00:29:19,269
   

417
00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:27,834
   

418
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:28,938
   

419
00:29:44,068 --> 00:29:46,069
It seems the Nam Gi Taek and Hye Jin cases

420
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:48,735
might be related.

421
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:52,249
I heard something came up during Nam Hyo Joo's case.

422
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:53,983
Really?

423
00:29:56,635 --> 00:29:59,629
Since evidence has emerged, they'll find it soon enough.

424
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:01,896
Do you want another can?

425
00:30:04,209 --> 00:30:07,320
I don't know why I lived like that.

426
00:30:07,948 --> 00:30:10,716
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

427
00:30:10,716 --> 00:30:15,275
I don't really know anything about Hye Jin.

428
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:18,869
What was going on around her,

429
00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:21,603
why she was struggling…

430
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,755
It's not like you to blame yourself.

431
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:32,562
Having lived with no feelings or plans,

432
00:30:34,675 --> 00:30:37,735
meeting Hye Jin changed everything.

433
00:30:38,347 --> 00:30:41,728
My work, my emotions, my plans.

434
00:30:41,728 --> 00:30:45,128
I said so many things,

435
00:30:45,128 --> 00:30:47,049
but I…

436
00:30:49,728 --> 00:30:52,516
I know nothing about Hye Jin.

437
00:30:57,702 --> 00:31:00,029
So what?

438
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:02,186
What are you going to do now?

439
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:07,269
I have to find him, somehow.

440
00:31:08,175 --> 00:31:10,309
The real culprit.

441
00:31:11,668 --> 00:31:14,396
I think I saw that guy.

442
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:32,932
Jeong Woo,

443
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,394
have you thought about it?

444
00:31:37,408 --> 00:31:40,465
What do you want to do when you find him?

445
00:31:41,469 --> 00:31:44,569
You said everything changed when you met Hye Jin.

446
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:48,701
If you meet that guy,

447
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:51,801
everything might change again.

448
00:32:29,994 --> 00:32:32,115
 Please do the surgery, 

449
00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:34,786
 like the face in the picture. 

450
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:41,935
Then, cheekbone contouring surgery,

451
00:32:41,935 --> 00:32:44,669
raising the bridge of the nose,

452
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:48,910
and nostril reduction must also be included,

453
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,169
up to the lower eyelid tailoring…

454
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:54,635
I'll do it. I'll just do it.

455
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:03,186
To make an accurate diagnosis,

456
00:33:03,186 --> 00:33:05,537
we need your surgical history.

457
00:33:05,537 --> 00:33:08,535
If you've had plastic surgery before…

458
00:33:08,535 --> 00:33:12,355
Last year, I had it done with ear cartilage, but

459
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:16,249
it didn't seem high enough, so I redid it with silicone.

460
00:33:16,249 --> 00:33:18,636
Did you also do the tip of your nose?

461
00:33:18,636 --> 00:33:20,772
Yes, but...

462
00:33:20,772 --> 00:33:24,984
it still seems a bit low, so I'm considering raising it a bit more.

463
00:33:24,984 --> 00:33:29,324
Then, by any chance, have you ever had contouring surgery?

464
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:31,069
Well… two years ago,

465
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:34,189
but there was hardly any difference.

466
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:37,169
As for whether surgery is possible,

467
00:33:37,169 --> 00:33:40,869
it seems like you'll have to consult with our director first.

468
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:45,535
These days, many people bring retouched photos, you know.

469
00:33:45,535 --> 00:33:48,730
Even so, it's more realistic than bringing in celebrity photos

470
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,469
and asking for surgery to look like them.

471
00:33:51,469 --> 00:33:54,135
But the problem is when it's excessive.

472
00:33:54,135 --> 00:33:58,101
Plastic surgery isn't as simple as retouching with an app, is it?

473
00:33:58,101 --> 00:34:01,840
There must be a reason they call it "Snapchat dysmorphia," right?

474
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,592
I guess. 
    

475
00:34:02,592 --> 00:34:03,592
   

476
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:04,635
   

477
00:34:04,635 --> 00:34:07,545
If only I could just come out looking like the photos.

478
00:34:08,403 --> 00:34:09,902
Me too?

479
00:34:09,902 --> 00:34:13,269
During the last surgery, the silicone was inserted a bit too high,

480
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:16,892
and it's not fitting snugly, plus the skin has thinned out.

481
00:34:16,892 --> 00:34:19,894
Rather than replacing it with a higher silicone piece,

482
00:34:19,894 --> 00:34:23,869
I would recommend removing the implant.

483
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:26,046
What about the contour?

484
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:31,821
To make it like the photo, a significant amount needs to be reduced,

485
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:34,588
and quite a forward movement of the chin tip would be necessary.

486
00:34:38,191 --> 00:34:39,691
Your own chin,

487
00:34:39,691 --> 00:34:41,912
wouldn't see a great effect from a contouring surgery,

488
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:44,058
given the shape of your face.

489
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:45,391
Then what about the eyes?

490
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:48,463
It's impossible to increase the size of the eyes to match the photo.

491
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:52,006
Can't you just… do it somewhat like this?

492
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,056
It's not like I'm asking you to make me into someone else's face.

493
00:34:55,056 --> 00:34:59,322
After all, this face is still my face.

494
00:35:00,091 --> 00:35:02,311
But to my eyes, it looks like someone else's.

495
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:03,624
No, doctor.

496
00:35:03,624 --> 00:35:05,024
This is definitely my face.

497
00:35:05,024 --> 00:35:08,224
I took the photo myself.

498
00:35:08,224 --> 00:35:11,358
Yes, it is indeed you.

499
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:14,178
But you've overly retouched it.

500
00:35:25,758 --> 00:35:28,758
I really need the surgery…

501
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,924
What's the matter? Are you okay?

502
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:35,224
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

503
00:35:35,224 --> 00:35:37,158
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

504
00:35:37,158 --> 00:35:39,991
You're a doctor too, aren't you?

505
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:42,011
Yes, well, as you can see.

506
00:35:42,011 --> 00:35:43,937
Then, could I

507
00:35:43,937 --> 00:35:46,777
get a consultation from you?

508
00:35:47,324 --> 00:35:50,624
- Pardon? 
 - Because of someone,

509
00:35:50,624 --> 00:35:54,924
I live as a suspect of having killed someone.

510
00:35:54,924 --> 00:35:56,991
Thank you, Director.

511
00:35:56,991 --> 00:36:00,691
What? Why are you being so scary?

512
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,824
Are you throwing a preemptive strike in case I say something to you?

513
00:36:03,824 --> 00:36:06,058
Both my mother and I

514
00:36:06,058 --> 00:36:07,689
know that you're looking out for us.

515
00:36:07,689 --> 00:36:09,258
This guy…

516
00:36:09,258 --> 00:36:11,802
If you know, then do well.

517
00:36:13,424 --> 00:36:16,803
Then, Nam Hyo Joo's surgery,

518
00:36:16,803 --> 00:36:18,558
are you doing it with Woo Jin?

519
00:36:18,558 --> 00:36:23,758
Skin grafting and reconstructing around the eyes, you can cover it alone.

520
00:36:23,758 --> 00:36:25,130
It's easier to do it together.

521
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,658
Is that your idea or Woo Jin's?

522
00:36:27,658 --> 00:36:30,524
Why does it matter whose idea it is?

523
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,824
It's about paying more attention.

524
00:36:35,824 --> 00:36:38,284
Are you doing this because you think it's your fault?

525
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:40,564
It's not a surgery that takes a lot of time.

526
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:42,631
I'll adjust the schedule.

527
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,460
 ­  

528
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:07,391
People around Dr. Cha Jeong Woo,

529
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,358
in the past and present, too.

530
00:37:11,858 --> 00:37:14,990
 I don't remember doing that. 

531
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:18,558
 Because it involves Director Cha, whom I care about. 

532
00:37:18,558 --> 00:37:20,124
 You must be quite close to Director Cha. 

533
00:37:20,124 --> 00:37:23,058
 Of course, we are like brothers. 

534
00:37:24,037 --> 00:37:28,058
 A person so shocking that he'd reject the memory. 

535
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:29,491
 Isn't that a bit strange? 

536
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:32,449
 No matter how close, do you call a friend's mother "Mom"? 

537
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:34,416
 Detective Lee? 

538
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:39,758
 A person who wishes never to return 

539
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:43,027
 to Cha Jeong Woo's memory. 

540
00:37:53,003 --> 00:37:55,858
We can just reset the password,

541
00:37:55,858 --> 00:37:58,597
but I can't guarantee the preservation of the memory.

542
00:37:58,597 --> 00:38:01,483
Is there no other way?

543
00:38:01,483 --> 00:38:05,716
If resetting is not possible, you have to do it manually.

544
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:09,391
It seems like a few have been pressed often.

545
00:38:09,391 --> 00:38:12,289
Zero, 2, 7.

546
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:47,991
I will apply for a retrial of Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's murder case.

547
00:38:47,991 --> 00:38:50,858
Please write your name at the end and sign it.

548
00:38:50,858 --> 00:38:53,391
   

549
00:38:56,724 --> 00:38:59,677
If someone had looked a little closer,

550
00:38:59,677 --> 00:39:01,424
they would have known something was wrong.

551
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:05,217
Who am I to blame now? It's all my fault.

552
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,791
Life is just…

553
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:09,944
It's my fault for living recklessly.

554
00:39:09,944 --> 00:39:12,084
It's everyone's fault.

555
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:16,187
I will scrutinize each mistake, so it won't be easy.

556
00:39:16,758 --> 00:39:19,491
Ah, just because the retrial petition is accepted,

557
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:24,391
it doesn't immediately mean Mr. Lee Jin Seok is innocent.

558
00:39:25,758 --> 00:39:27,558
If the real culprit is not caught,

559
00:39:27,558 --> 00:39:29,834
can I not be found not guilty?

560
00:39:30,991 --> 00:39:32,452
Don't worry,

561
00:39:32,452 --> 00:39:33,991
that won't happen.

562
00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:37,191
- Did you find something? 
 - Did something come out?

563
00:39:41,668 --> 00:39:43,624
Regarding that,

564
00:39:43,624 --> 00:39:46,523
could I also receive some counseling?

565
00:39:50,624 --> 00:39:53,891
The relationship between Han Woo Jin and Cha Jeong Woo?

566
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:56,224
What's the reason for asking?

567
00:39:56,224 --> 00:40:00,124
The two seem very different.

568
00:40:00,124 --> 00:40:03,370
How did they become friends?

569
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:08,326
- Actually… 
 - Their personalities and environments are different, too.

570
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:12,458
I know it was when Woo Jin was in middle school.

571
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:15,291
The reason Woo Jin could study for medical school steadily was

572
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,958
thanks to Jeong Woo's mother's guardianship.

573
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:22,758
Since Woo Jin is so sociable, he befriended Jeong Woo too.

574
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:37,824
 Anyway, Woo Jin 

575
00:40:37,824 --> 00:40:41,524
 had a hard time between Jeong Woo and his mother. 

576
00:40:49,183 --> 00:40:50,851
 It seems like a few have been pressed often. 

577
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:53,618
 Zero, 2, 7. 

578
00:41:01,951 --> 00:41:04,836
 The day I first met Hye Jin… 

579
00:41:04,836 --> 00:41:06,565
 July 25. 

580
00:41:15,691 --> 00:41:18,824
   

581
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:35,758
   

582
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:42,558
   

583
00:41:50,957 --> 00:41:54,490
Director, we're ready for patient Nam Hyo Joo's surgery.

584
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:56,490
Okay.

585
00:42:02,863 --> 00:42:07,391
 Proactively dealing with Cha Jeong Woo's affairs. 

586
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,391
 Right, I thought it was too good to be true. 

587
00:42:09,391 --> 00:42:12,058
 Always looking interested… 

588
00:42:12,058 --> 00:42:15,158
 Because he didn't want to pour his emotions into patients who were dying or living. 

589
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:16,724
 That's why he switched to plastic surgery. 

590
00:42:16,724 --> 00:42:19,491
 The reason Woo Jin could study for medical school steadily was 

591
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:21,224
 thanks to Jeong Woo's mother's guardianship. 

592
00:42:21,224 --> 00:42:25,391
 Just for that reason, did they become friends? 

593
00:42:25,391 --> 00:42:27,924
 Something's a bit… 

594
00:42:28,943 --> 00:42:31,758
 seemingly one-sided, though. 

595
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:36,109
 If, not as friends… 

596
00:42:52,391 --> 00:42:55,024
- I'll go in first. 
 - Okay.

597
00:42:55,024 --> 00:42:58,091
 If it was an action to survive… 

598
00:43:02,732 --> 00:43:04,024
 On the day of the incident, 

599
00:43:04,024 --> 00:43:08,258
 no alibi and similar physical appearance. 

600
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:24,624
Let's start anesthesia.

601
00:43:24,624 --> 00:43:27,017
Yes, starting anesthesia.

602
00:43:27,017 --> 00:43:29,817
Administering the anesthetic.

603
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:31,809
Patient,

604
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,709
you will start to feel sleepy soon.

605
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:47,624
Please pull from the other side.

606
00:44:04,758 --> 00:44:06,875
Is it okay?

607
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:09,624
It's slightly elevated, but it's fine.

608
00:44:09,624 --> 00:44:11,791
Please begin.

609
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:21,258
   

610
00:44:22,724 --> 00:44:26,058
 The movements of the guy with the hat, the assailant of Nam Hyo Joo. 

611
00:44:26,058 --> 00:44:28,958
Oh, has the final route been confirmed?

612
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,224
 Ah, it's not the final one. 

613
00:44:30,224 --> 00:44:32,658
 The exit where he got off the subway… 

614
00:44:32,658 --> 00:44:34,324
Which exit?

615
00:44:34,324 --> 00:44:36,058
 That… 

616
00:44:36,058 --> 00:44:38,158
Perhaps,

617
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:41,524
is it towards KSH Cosmetic Surgery?

618
00:44:53,563 --> 00:44:56,391
 He had heard Nam Gi Taek's address that day and knew it. 

619
00:44:56,391 --> 00:44:59,158
 You need to tell me the address. 

620
00:44:59,158 --> 00:45:01,791
 She said she saw the perpetrator on the day of the incident, right? 

621
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:03,025
 I'll leave right away. Yes. 

622
00:45:03,025 --> 00:45:06,833
 And he knew there was a witness. 

623
00:45:08,624 --> 00:45:12,242
The day when Nam Hyo Joo was attacked…

624
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:15,124
If that day…

625
00:45:15,124 --> 00:45:19,243
   
   

626
00:45:19,243 --> 00:45:22,310
 If he had followed me that day… 

627
00:45:31,158 --> 00:45:32,802
Cut.

628
00:45:54,391 --> 00:45:57,337
   

629
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:01,437
I'd like to check my vehicle that was passing...

630
00:46:02,091 --> 00:46:05,558
near Junhwa-dong intersection between 20:30 and 21:00 (8:30–9:00 p.m.) on May 3rd.

631
00:46:05,558 --> 00:46:07,424
Is it your own vehicle, officer?

632
00:46:07,424 --> 00:46:09,033
Yes.

633
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:29,258
Thank you for your hard work.

634
00:46:29,258 --> 00:46:31,225
You've done well.

635
00:46:37,729 --> 00:46:39,783
Thank you.

636
00:46:46,778 --> 00:46:49,391
Please call me when the patient's anesthesia wears off.

637
00:46:49,391 --> 00:46:51,201
Yes.

638
00:47:47,678 --> 00:47:49,126
   

639
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:03,684
Ah, here it is.

640
00:48:03,684 --> 00:48:07,447
5526, this is your vehicle, officer. Right?

641
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:14,550
Please play from here again, slowly.

642
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:16,924
So, who's tailing you?

643
00:48:16,924 --> 00:48:19,111
I'll check it out.

644
00:48:22,124 --> 00:48:24,258
Stop there.

645
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:48,291
   

646
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:52,176
 7837? Is it someone you know? 

647
00:48:52,176 --> 00:48:54,244
 Regarding this matter, 

648
00:48:54,244 --> 00:48:57,967
 I'd prefer if you didn't come looking for me again. 

649
00:48:59,104 --> 00:49:02,072
 I'll find out more and get back to you. 

650
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,718
 Knowing that the witness was the woman next door, 

651
00:49:07,718 --> 00:49:10,218
 that very night…

Ms. Hyo Joo!

653
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:27,156
Why would you?

654
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:31,376
Why in the world?

655
00:49:31,376 --> 00:49:34,204
 What do you want to do when you find him? 

656
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:38,010
 If you meet that guy, 

657
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:41,077
 everything could change again. 

658
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:02,124
Ms. Nam Hyo Joo!

659
00:51:04,003 --> 00:51:06,703
Ms. Hyo Joo!

660
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:12,980
   

661
00:51:14,649 --> 00:51:20,749
   

662

00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:22,824
 The Yoon Hye Jin case. 

665
00:54:22,824 --> 00:54:24,858
 Is there anything else I don't know? 

666
00:54:24,858 --> 00:54:26,191
 How could you? 

667
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:28,065
 Han Woo Jin, how could you? You bastard! 

668
00:54:28,065 --> 00:54:31,535
 Are you really unaware, or are just pretending not to know? 

669
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:32,624
 What are you talking about? 

670
00:54:32,624 --> 00:54:37,525
 The real reason your mother tampered with and hid your accident record. 

671
00:54:38,124 --> 00:54:39,803
 The forensic results match. Arrest him immediately! 

672
00:54:39,803 --> 00:54:42,824
 But, Jeong Woo, Woo Jin is dangerous now. 

673
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:44,591
 I've set up tracking on the car and phone. 

674
00:54:44,591 --> 00:54:48,284
 Why is Han Woo Jin talking about my mother? 

675
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:51,817
 Jeong Woo, I'll take your mother with me. 

676
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:57,060
♫   Your lie, my love ♫
