00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:13,922
What kind of favor?

179
00:15:13,922 --> 00:15:16,362
There is someone I need to find,

180
00:15:16,362 --> 00:15:19,695
so I was thinking of getting
some help from the police.

181
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:26,688
Please help here!

182
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:30,522
I am a cop. What's the matter?

183
00:15:30,522 --> 00:15:34,222
The delivery person who just ran
out suddenly came in and…

184
00:15:34,222 --> 00:15:36,422
First, make a report.

185
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:39,322
I'm a doctor. Can you hear me?

186
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:40,607
What should I do?

187
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,889
How is your breathing? Are you okay?

188
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:44,655
Hello? Is this 119?

189
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:48,134
- I need a clean towel.
- Yes.

190
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:50,675
- Please come quickly, with the police.
- Don't move.

191
00:15:50,675 --> 00:15:52,408
This place is…

192
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:55,341
Just stay like this,
until the paramedics arrive.

193
00:16:14,826 --> 00:16:16,622
Why are you doing this?

194
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:18,255
You just delivered to number 902, right?

195
00:16:18,255 --> 00:16:20,509
Where is the helmet?

196
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:22,555
It was dropped at house number 902.

197
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:25,455
No! When I… when I entered…

198
00:16:25,455 --> 00:16:27,822
Ah, you've just admitted the home invasion.

199
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:30,172
- You are under arrest for home invasion.
- Wait a moment.

200
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:31,589
You have the right to appoint an attorney,

201
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:33,589
and remain silent or refuse
to make self-incriminating statements.

202
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:36,283
Ah! Darn it…

203
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:39,022
The pulse and breathing are stable,

204
00:16:39,022 --> 00:16:41,055
but, just in case, please check the vitals.

205
00:16:41,055 --> 00:16:43,920
- Yes.
- Understood.

206
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:47,022
The guardian insists that we consult
with the plastic surgery department,

207
00:16:47,022 --> 00:16:49,556
but, there is no one on duty
at Janghan Hospital right now.

208
00:16:49,556 --> 00:16:51,922
- What about the plastic surgery hospital?
- I'll check.

209
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:54,522
For now, come to our hospital.

210
00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:01,289
There are hardly any general hospitals
with plastic surgery on call

211
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:02,722
at this hour.

<i>[Seoul Southern Police Station]</i>

213
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:12,655
I ordered food and, while
handing over the delivery fee,

214
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:14,961
I accidentally dropped the money.

215
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:17,022
Maybe that got him riled up,

216
00:17:17,022 --> 00:17:20,185
because he just barged in through the door.

217
00:17:21,154 --> 00:17:23,381
<i>Are you being dismissive
because I'm a delivery guy?</i>

218
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:25,355
<i>Are you dismissing me?</i>

219
00:17:25,355 --> 00:17:29,022
Min Jae tried to stop him
and a fight broke out.

220
00:17:44,408 --> 00:17:47,118
And during that, a mirror accidentally broke.

221
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:51,155
What is your relation to Mr. Woo Min Jae?

222
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:54,055
Cousins. Distant cousins.

Kim Seon Yong

224
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:04,722
has a prior record for similar offenses,

225
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:07,422

By the time I entered,
he was already covered in blood.

230
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:16,855
The whole house was splattered with blood,

231
00:18:16,855 --> 00:18:19,355
and they opened the door
to receive delivery food?

232
00:18:19,355 --> 00:18:21,489
They're trying to pin it on me,
that's what this is.

233
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:23,289
It's always the delivery
person's fault, isn't it?

234
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:25,889
You're trying to frame an easy
target, the delivery person.

235
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:27,689
There's a record of similar offenses.

Special residential intrusion
and assault resulting in injury.

237
00:18:30,655 --> 00:18:33,222
You were sentenced to probation 6 months ago,

238
00:18:33,222 --> 00:18:36,501
and you committed the same crime again
before the end of the probation period.

Why does that come up now?

240
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:42,989
Does my being an ex-convict serve
as some sort of evidence?

241
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:46,089
That is why I ran off!

242
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:48,887
Because it's obvious
you'd try to connect me to past incidents.

243
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:51,989
If I had known I'd be tied up
because of my criminal history,

244
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:53,715
I would have been more careful
and acted properly…

245
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,955
What good is it if only I live right?

246
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:59,055
When you all look at me crookedly!

247
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,722
You just ignore and dismiss
what a criminal says, jeez!

248
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:03,855
What do you expect me to do?

249
00:19:03,855 --> 00:19:05,151
What the heck are you doing?

250
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:06,722

00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:12,155
Let go! Let it go!

00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:15,135

<i>Even if I investigate,
it's true you killed her.</i>

257
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,655
<i>Ah, darn! Why would I?</i>

258
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:37,766
<i>Why? Darn it!</i>

259
00:20:13,222 --> 00:20:15,489
Fortunately, it's not too deep.

260
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:18,789
It doesn't seem like there's damage
to any major blood vessels or nerves.

261
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:20,655
The problem is the laceration on the ear.

262
00:20:20,655 --> 00:20:22,822
There's a bit of a defect.

263
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:26,636
We'll schedule reconstructive surgery
when the staff is in tomorrow.

264
00:20:29,322 --> 00:20:31,455
Tomorrow?

265
00:20:31,455 --> 00:20:33,522
Is it that serious?

266
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:36,334
Can't you just stitch it up?

267
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:39,122
Simple suturing won't suffice.

268
00:20:39,122 --> 00:20:43,169
Don't worry too much, it's a simple surgery.

269
00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:10,655
Have there been any other external impacts

270
00:21:10,655 --> 00:21:13,589
after the fragments hurt the jaw area?

271
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:15,555
Why do you ask?

272
00:21:15,555 --> 00:21:19,755
Because the wound near the jaw
is quite deep compared to other areas.

273
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:24,822
I was out of it,

274
00:21:24,822 --> 00:21:27,155
so I don't remember well.

275
00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:38,155
I'll clean the wound and start suturing.

276
00:22:15,189 --> 00:22:16,722
How did it go?

277
00:22:16,722 --> 00:22:18,838
Is Min Jae's face okay?

278
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,355
The facial suturing went well,

279
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:23,289
and we'll operate on the ear
when the staff arrives tomorrow.

280
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:25,822
Is the ear injury that severe?

281
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:27,655
Simple suturing won't do?

282
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:31,866
We need to harvest cartilage
from the other side to fill the defect.

283
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:38,834
Don't worry too much,
it's not a complicated surgery.

284
00:22:38,834 --> 00:22:40,314
Uh, I…

285
00:22:40,314 --> 00:22:43,722
When we were transferring Min Jae,

286
00:22:43,722 --> 00:22:47,022
it seemed like the paramedics
weren't properly immobilizing his face.

287
00:22:47,022 --> 00:22:51,821
Could that have made the wound worse?

288
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:54,455
Did that happen?

289
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:59,355
It would be fortunate
if it hasn't gotten worse…

290

00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:11,428
the criminal from that case 7 years ago.

301
00:24:13,928 --> 00:24:16,922
It's not confirmed, but if he was released,

302
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,855
why would he appear before me,

303
00:24:18,855 --> 00:24:21,432
what he is thinking…

304
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:25,989
Please find him for me.

Yes… at my father's funeral.

308
00:25:04,845 --> 00:25:09,922
I remember him because there weren't
many people who came to pay respects.

309
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:40,622
Who is this person?

310
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:43,655
He was someone in the same prison.

311
00:25:43,655 --> 00:25:45,589
There's something I need to verify.

312
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:47,755

00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:34,689
You've completed the third case,
so you're preparing to leave the country,

320
00:26:34,689 --> 00:26:36,289
why did you bring number 4?

321
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:37,955
It hasn't been approved yet.

322
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:39,589

If the partner's consent
continues to be not granted,

324
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:44,189
will you keep bringing in victims?

325
00:26:44,189 --> 00:26:48,061
It's my neighbor. I brought them
because there were no hospital beds available.

326
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:50,622
Isn't it an emergency room instinct?

327
00:26:50,622 --> 00:26:52,696
That's something from the past.

328
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:54,554
You can't hide the instinct.

329
00:26:54,554 --> 00:26:56,155
Hey, Jeong Woo. Hey, what is it?

330
00:26:56,155 --> 00:26:58,722
I heard another crime victim came to the ward.

331
00:26:58,722 --> 00:27:00,022
Didn't you finish that?

332
00:27:00,022 --> 00:27:03,289
He said number 3 was done, and yet
he personally transferred the patient.

333
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,122
Don't read too much into it.

334
00:27:05,122 --> 00:27:07,961
I brought them thinking
it was just a simple suture case.

335
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:09,089
What does that mean?

336
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:10,901
So, it's not just a simple suture?

337
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:12,507
What is it?

338
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:14,541
Ah, what is it?

339
00:27:16,408 --> 00:27:18,622
Pretending not to be interested,

340
00:27:18,622 --> 00:27:22,151
he's focusing all his attention on the patient.

341
00:27:27,655 --> 00:27:31,589
Am I really going to have abs in two hours?

342
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:33,755
Getting rid of all the useless fat,

343
00:27:33,755 --> 00:27:37,722
if we sculpt the upper layer of fat
under the skin into the ab shape,

344
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:40,657
it will all come out,
so you don't have to worry.

345
00:27:40,657 --> 00:27:42,689
Once the surgery is done,
and you start exercising lightly,

346
00:27:42,689 --> 00:27:44,792
it will settle in more perfectly.

347
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:45,822
And you can get it tighter.

348
00:27:45,822 --> 00:27:47,755
I've already registered at the gym.

349
00:27:47,755 --> 00:27:49,721
Once I get these abs just right,

350
00:27:49,721 --> 00:27:52,589
I'll confidently work out with my shirt off.

351
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,389
I even bought a crop tee.

352
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:56,710
A crop tee is great indeed.

353
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,076
Yes, all done.

354
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:03,789
Alright, now to transform into a real man,

355
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:06,922
shall we try having a fantastic
time of deep sleep?

356
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:57,815
It's good.

357
00:29:04,228 --> 00:29:07,654
We've got a good spot too, let's see…

358
00:29:07,654 --> 00:29:10,807
Okay, good job.

359
00:29:15,991 --> 00:29:18,633
That delivery person suddenly came in…

360
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:19,822
<i>Are you being dismissive
because I'm a delivery guy?</i>

361
00:29:19,822 --> 00:29:22,137
<i>Are you dismissing me?</i>

362
00:29:30,148 --> 00:29:32,281
Just a moment.

363
00:29:37,187 --> 00:29:41,120
Did you get the bruise
on your wrist from the fight?

364
00:29:42,301 --> 00:29:44,542
It seems like it…

365
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:49,989
Things were so hectic…

366
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:55,222
Understood, I'll take additional statements
on the necessary parts again later.

367
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:05,182
Excuse me…

368
00:30:05,182 --> 00:30:07,575
Are you finished?

369
00:30:07,575 --> 00:30:10,055
Yes, I've wrapped up for now,

370
00:30:10,055 --> 00:30:12,955
and have decided to take
additional statements later.

371
00:30:14,422 --> 00:30:19,355
It seems Min Jae is quite shocked.

372
00:30:19,355 --> 00:30:21,936
He will probably have a hard time.

373
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:24,589
That's likely.

374
00:30:25,255 --> 00:30:30,089
What happened to that delivery guy?

375
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:32,033
He is currently under investigation.

376
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:34,159
Why do you ask?

377
00:30:34,822 --> 00:30:37,189
You mentioned a criminal record.

378
00:30:37,189 --> 00:30:40,655
I'm anxious he might come back.

379
00:30:40,655 --> 00:30:41,989
A warrant has been requested,

380
00:30:41,989 --> 00:30:45,195
and it will probably be issued,
so don't worry too much.

381
00:30:45,195 --> 00:30:47,568
Oh, okay.

382
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:04,222
See me for a moment,
I have something to discuss.

383
00:31:12,847 --> 00:31:15,606
Just wrap it up quickly.

384
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:19,389
I have someone in mind.

385
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:21,222
The person who did this to you.

386
00:31:21,222 --> 00:31:22,722
What?

387
00:31:22,722 --> 00:31:25,355
Why are you so surprised?

388
00:31:25,355 --> 00:31:28,955
Ah… because of the pain.

389
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:33,789
If it hurts that much, why did you
refuse treatment yesterday?

390
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:35,989
We talked in front of the house yesterday,

391
00:31:35,989 --> 00:31:38,895
about possibly asking for police assistance.

392
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:43,522
I want to confirm the release of a prisoner,

393
00:31:43,522 --> 00:31:45,992
someone named Lee Jin Seok.

394
00:31:45,992 --> 00:31:49,941
You shouldn't make such
a personal request to the police.

395
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:52,076
You of all people should know.

396
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:01,448
Thank you.

397
00:32:01,448 --> 00:32:04,001
I'll pay the medical fee next time.

398
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:08,417
Don't you have something to ask me?

399
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:12,219
What do you…?

400
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:19,655
Patient Woo Min Jae.

401
00:32:19,655 --> 00:32:22,989
Are you not curious about peculiar observations

402
00:32:22,989 --> 00:32:24,183
during the patient's treatment?

403
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:26,333
Ah, right.

404
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,379
About that.

405
00:32:31,768 --> 00:32:34,955
It's a fragment removed from the chin area.

406
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:37,222
It's especially deep
compared to the other wounds.

407
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:41,122
The other wounds are less
than 1cm, but this one is 3cm.

408
00:32:41,122 --> 00:32:43,555
The depth, shape, and
direction are all different.

409
00:32:43,555 --> 00:32:46,221
The cross-section is also messy.

410
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:47,705
If it's messy…

411
00:32:47,705 --> 00:32:52,215
Unlike the other wounds,
the inside was crushed.

412
00:32:58,388 --> 00:33:00,511
Do you need something?

413
00:33:04,242 --> 00:33:06,655
I wanted to talk with the doctor

414
00:33:06,655 --> 00:33:09,989
about the ear surgery this afternoon…

415
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,355
Please speak.

416
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:14,222
How long will the surgery take?

417
00:33:14,222 --> 00:33:16,142
About two to three hours.

418
00:33:16,142 --> 00:33:19,389
I will arrange for you to receive
proper surgery instructions.

419
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:21,414
Yes.

420
00:33:23,055 --> 00:33:25,101
That…

421
00:33:25,101 --> 00:33:28,268
Was that stuck in me?

422
00:33:31,122 --> 00:33:33,222
In cases of accidents like this,

423
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:36,622
the police receives a medical opinion.

424
00:33:37,495 --> 00:33:39,822
Understood.

425
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:41,919
Then…

426
00:33:50,707 --> 00:33:53,836
So you're saying that wound wasn't made
by a fragment getting stuck as it fell?

427
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:56,155
Judging by the shape of the wound, yes.

428
00:33:56,155 --> 00:33:58,622
It seems like someone stabbed it in.

429
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:03,463
So it's not like the others.

430
00:34:03,463 --> 00:34:05,922
You mean just this one was like that?

431
00:34:05,922 --> 00:34:07,931
Yes.

432
00:34:09,189 --> 00:34:11,889
Understood, I'll look into it.

433
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:13,389
<i>Yes, detective.</i>

434
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:15,322
Did the schedule for Kim Seon Yong's
warrant hearing come out?

435
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:18,155
<i>Yes, it's set for the afternoon,
so I'll be entering the court in a bit.</i>

436
00:35:18,155 --> 00:35:20,255
Why?

437
00:35:20,255 --> 00:35:23,722
Look into the relationship between
Cho Soo Kyung and Woo Min Jae again.

438
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:27,358
<i>Uh… Yes, understood.</i>

439
00:35:38,355 --> 00:35:41,721
We will begin reconstructive surgery
on patient Woo Min Jae.

440
00:35:41,721 --> 00:35:43,731
Scalpel.

441
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,589
But, until when do I
need to keep the blood drain?

442
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:22,755
In principle, it should be for about a week.

443
00:36:22,755 --> 00:36:24,322
If you come back after three days,

444
00:36:24,322 --> 00:36:26,922
- we will check your condition and decide.
- Yes.

445
00:36:26,922 --> 00:36:29,455
You must wear the compression
garment for a month.

446
00:36:29,455 --> 00:36:30,622
Yes, I understand.

447
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:34,289
It helps with recovery if you move
a bit, even though it's difficult.

448
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:35,922
Call us if you need.

449
00:36:35,922 --> 00:36:38,067
Yes.

450
00:37:08,828 --> 00:37:11,328
She was talking with the doctor

451
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:16,222
to get some kind of medical opinion.

452
00:37:16,222 --> 00:37:18,276
What are you doing?

453
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:23,062
Well, it's just that…

454
00:37:24,122 --> 00:37:26,346
Ah, it's nothing.

455
00:37:47,055 --> 00:37:51,488
The defect was not extensive,
so the surgery was relatively easy.

456
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:53,922
More than the reconstructed side,

457
00:37:53,922 --> 00:37:56,736
there may be more pain on the side
from which the cartilage was harvested.

458
00:37:56,736 --> 00:37:57,789
Understood.

459
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:00,489
After discharge, you should
come in every 3 to 4 days,

460
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:02,575
to receive outpatient treatment.

461
00:38:02,575 --> 00:38:04,665
Yes, I understand.

462
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:07,481
Did you submit

463
00:38:07,481 --> 00:38:10,695
the opinion letter to the police?

464
00:38:10,695 --> 00:38:16,560
Since you said you submit an opinion
letter to the police for such cases.

465
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,161
Yes.

466
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:20,361
What did you write?

467
00:38:21,242 --> 00:38:24,009
What are you curious about?

468
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:29,179
Ah, no.

469
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:31,385
Don't worry about it.

470
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:50,089
You're asking to compare this
with these slippers?

471
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:52,768
Yes, as soon as possible.

472
00:39:12,221 --> 00:39:14,255
Hey, what the heck are you doing?

473
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:16,389
It's okay.

474
00:39:18,927 --> 00:39:22,266
You've been investigating me as
the culprit from the start, right?

475
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:25,661
Because I have a prior record.

476
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:29,395
Because you can totally ignore a powerless,
backup-less ex-convict like me!

477
00:39:29,395 --> 00:39:31,719
Come here, you rat!

478
00:39:36,181 --> 00:39:38,537
Do you still think it's me,

479
00:39:38,537 --> 00:39:40,542
really?

480
00:39:41,121 --> 00:39:44,435
<i>Thanks to that rat, I became a national star,</i>

481
00:39:44,435 --> 00:39:47,568
<i>becoming someone
who should be killed right away.</i>

482
00:39:48,894 --> 00:39:53,304
<i>None of the prosecutors, judges,
or lawyers would listen to me.</i>

483
00:39:54,981 --> 00:39:58,730
<i>Enough, I have nothing more to say to you.</i>

484
00:40:07,408 --> 00:40:10,042
What the heck is this?

485
00:40:13,155 --> 00:40:15,222
Here.

486
00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:21,255
Make sure to take your prescription
when you go home.

487
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:24,422
Ah, yes, I'll go down now.

488
00:40:28,822 --> 00:40:30,589
Just wait here for a moment.

489
00:40:30,589 --> 00:40:32,841
I'll go down and come back quickly.

490
00:40:33,495 --> 00:40:34,821
Can't I just go?

491
00:40:34,821 --> 00:40:36,589
It's just a prescription.

492
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:40,261
No need to draw attention
to yourself for no reason.

493
00:40:40,261 --> 00:40:43,449
Don't worry, I'll be back quickly.

494
00:41:01,268 --> 00:41:03,689
Have you looked into Cho Soo Kyung
and Woo Min Jae?

495
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:06,255
I got Woo Min Jae's family
home contact and tried calling,

496
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,322
but they didn't answer.

497
00:41:08,322 --> 00:41:10,089
So I inquired at the academy,

498
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:13,433
and they said it's been a while
since he switched to online classes.

499
00:41:14,122 --> 00:41:15,755
Is that so?

500
00:41:15,755 --> 00:41:18,501
What video is that?

501
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:21,555
So, while inquiring
around Cho Soo Kyung's house,

502
00:41:21,555 --> 00:41:23,555
I checked the elevator CCTV,

503
00:41:23,555 --> 00:41:26,189
but Woo Min Jae has never left the building.

504
00:41:26,189 --> 00:41:28,347
Not a single time in two weeks.

505
00:41:28,347 --> 00:41:32,727
Well, I suppose it could happen, but…

506
00:41:32,727 --> 00:41:34,714
Is there something wrong with them?

507
00:41:34,714 --> 00:41:37,695
Isn't that why you told me to look into it?

508
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:41,395
He's never been out even once?

509
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:49,582
What the…

510
00:41:49,582 --> 00:41:50,855
For real!

511
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:53,137
Ah, even if you're going to use
someone, at least tell them why.

512
00:41:53,137 --> 00:41:55,522
Ah, and keep trying to
contact Woo Min Jae's family.

513
00:41:55,522 --> 00:41:56,889
Ask around the area a bit more.

514
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:57,914
Yes.

515
00:41:57,914 --> 00:42:00,148
But, why?

516
00:42:03,841 --> 00:42:07,218
Conducting the investigation
all by herself, just like that.

517
00:42:07,218 --> 00:42:09,289
Prosecutor Kim Tae Hyung, right?

518
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:10,829
You have a warrant hearing
scheduled for this afternoon.

519
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:12,829
I'm the investigator in charge
of Kim Seon Yong's case.

520
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:15,555
Would it be possible for you to talk now?

521
00:42:15,555 --> 00:42:18,689
Ah, I have something to consult with you.

522
00:42:27,055 --> 00:42:28,692
<i>Is the ear injury that severe?</i>

523
00:42:28,692 --> 00:42:30,026
<i>Simple suturing won't do?</i>

524
00:42:30,026 --> 00:42:32,493
<i>It seemed like the paramedics
weren't properly immobilizing his face.</i>

525
00:42:32,493 --> 00:42:36,927
<i>Could that have made the wound worse?</i>

526
00:42:46,428 --> 00:42:48,465
<i>Do you need something?</i>

527
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,054
<i>I wanted to talk with the doctor</i>

528
00:42:56,054 --> 00:42:59,231
<i>about the ear surgery this afternoon…</i>

529
00:43:28,468 --> 00:43:31,102
What's the matter?

530
00:43:33,716 --> 00:43:36,122
Ah, you're Mr. Woo Min Jae's
father, aren't you?

531
00:43:36,122 --> 00:43:38,289
<i>Yes, that's right. What's the matter?</i>

532
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:40,855
Have you had any recent contact
with Mr. Woo Min Jae?

533
00:43:40,855 --> 00:43:42,855
<i>Pardon?</i>

534
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:45,855
A phone or video call, have you talked?

535
00:43:45,855 --> 00:43:48,589
<i>Ah, he's at a boarding school
where cellphone use isn't allowed.</i>

536
00:43:48,589 --> 00:43:50,355
<i>It's been quite a while
since we last talked, why?</i>

537
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:52,189
Boarding school?

538
00:43:52,189 --> 00:43:55,089
So he's not with a relative in Seoul,
named Cho Soo Kyung,

539
00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:56,489
<i>He doesn't have relatives in Seoul.</i>

540
00:43:56,489 --> 00:43:58,907
<i>I'll call you back later, I'm busy now.</i>

541
00:44:03,296 --> 00:44:05,855
<i>[Detective Lee Min Hyeong]</i>

542
00:44:15,602 --> 00:44:18,155
I hesitated after a brief glance,

543
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,755
but it turned out to be right.

544
00:44:19,755 --> 00:44:21,078
What is your relationship with him?

545
00:44:21,078 --> 00:44:24,814
Min Jae and I are from the same high school.

546
00:44:24,814 --> 00:44:27,255
And that woman, I mean Cho Soo Kyung,

547
00:44:27,255 --> 00:44:30,769
is the woman who came to
our school for teacher training.

548
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:33,668
That… teacher.

549
00:44:33,668 --> 00:44:36,234
Then what about the two of them?

550
00:44:36,234 --> 00:44:38,455
The trainee teacher and

551
00:44:38,455 --> 00:44:40,797
the student…

Yes, this is Seo Gang Ho.

Is patient Woo Min Jae still in the hospital?

556
00:45:39,796 --> 00:45:43,282
Patient Woo Min Jae was discharged
this afternoon. What's the matter?

557
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,422
There's something I need to check.

558
00:45:44,422 --> 00:45:45,489
<i>Understood.</i>

559
00:45:45,489 --> 00:45:47,622
Have you looked into the relationship
between those two people?

560
00:45:47,622 --> 00:45:49,022
I'm in the process of confirming it,
but why do you ask?

561
00:45:49,022 --> 00:45:51,591
Because they are not relatives.

562
00:45:52,595 --> 00:45:54,848
Is that so?

563
00:45:54,848 --> 00:45:57,615
Is Detective Lee Min Hyeong with you right now?

564
00:45:57,615 --> 00:45:59,348
<i>Didn't you see her at the hospital?</i>

565
00:45:59,348 --> 00:46:01,921
<i>She went out to check something
on Cho Soo Kyung and Woo Min Jae.</i>

566
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:03,589
What's the relationship
between the two of them?

567
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:04,625
For now, please tell me.

568
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:09,495
They say they met as student
and teacher at school.

569
00:46:09,495 --> 00:46:12,282
And they tried to bug my room.

570
00:46:12,282 --> 00:46:15,789
They're probably communicating
with each other somehow.

571
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:17,808
Yes, I understand.

00:46:26,662 --> 00:46:29,526
What brings you here?

574
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,889
There are things to explain
regarding victim support,

575
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:37,382
and I was also curious
about Woo Min Jae's condition.

576
00:46:37,382 --> 00:46:39,515
Did you come alone?

577
00:46:43,735 --> 00:46:44,802
That's good, then.

578
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:48,226
I also have something to tell you in private.

579
00:46:48,822 --> 00:46:51,528
Then, please come in.

580
00:47:03,461 --> 00:47:06,728
I'm really sorry…

581
00:47:07,489 --> 00:47:09,889
About saying, I was Min Jae's relative.

582
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:12,253
Let's hear the reason for that.

583
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:17,781
I'm really sorry for not telling you earlier,

584
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:20,028
but I have my reasons too--

585
00:47:20,028 --> 00:47:22,295
Where is Mr. Woo Min Jae?

586
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:25,022
He stepped out for a moment.

587
00:47:25,022 --> 00:47:28,855
We'll locate Mr. Woo Min Jae,
so please let's go.

588
00:47:28,855 --> 00:47:30,224
To where?

589
00:47:30,224 --> 00:47:32,355
Under the circumstances
of a witness's false testimony,

590
00:47:32,355 --> 00:47:34,855
additional investigation is necessary.

591
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:36,389
I request your voluntary accompaniment.

592
00:47:36,389 --> 00:47:38,655
Ah, just a moment.

593
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,555
Please just listen to what
I have to say for a moment.

594
00:47:40,555 --> 00:47:43,200
- Get ready.
- Ah, I also…

595
00:47:45,855 --> 00:47:49,455
I had no choice either.

596
00:47:49,455 --> 00:47:51,952
What does that mean?

597
00:47:57,189 --> 00:48:00,478
There's a video.

598
00:48:06,668 --> 00:48:08,473
<i>Min Jae.</i>

599
00:48:08,473 --> 00:48:11,155
<i>No, Min Jae, don't do this, ok?</i>

600
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:12,355
Min Jae is…

601
00:48:12,355 --> 00:48:13,689
<i>Let go!</i>

602
00:48:13,689 --> 00:48:16,189
I found out during my
training teaching last year.

603
00:48:16,189 --> 00:48:18,272
<i>Shall we stop now?</i>

604
00:48:18,272 --> 00:48:19,616
<i>Okay.</i>

605
00:48:19,616 --> 00:48:21,589
I was sexually assaulted.

606
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:24,122
<i>So, it's okay if this video spreads,
is that what you mean?</i>

607
00:48:24,122 --> 00:48:25,910
I kept being blackmailed with that video.

608
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:28,322
<i>I was wrong, Min Jae, okay?</i>

609
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,624
<i>Please, I won't do it again.</i>

610
00:48:30,624 --> 00:48:31,832
<i>Huh?</i>

611
00:48:31,832 --> 00:48:35,822
<i>If that video gets out,
it's over for both of us.</i>

612
00:48:35,822 --> 00:48:37,674
<i>Let go!</i>

613
00:48:37,674 --> 00:48:38,938
<i>Let go!</i>

614
00:48:38,938 --> 00:48:41,451
<i>Ah, let me go!</i>

615
00:48:46,241 --> 00:48:50,822
Just then, you pinned it all
on the delivery person who arrived.

616
00:48:50,822 --> 00:48:52,989
If he said he was hurt because of me,

617
00:48:52,989 --> 00:48:55,955
I thought it would all come out,
including that video.

618
00:48:55,955 --> 00:48:59,089
I hated the idea of that video
being exposed more than dying.

619
00:48:59,089 --> 00:49:02,789
So, you even gave a false statement
that you were relatives?

620
00:49:04,022 --> 00:49:06,155
I'm facing a public service exam,

621
00:49:06,155 --> 00:49:10,339
if it becomes known that I was harmed
by a student during my student teaching…

622
00:49:11,008 --> 00:49:14,708
No… it would be the end of me.

623
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:39,422
<i>[Seoul Southern Police Station]</i>

624
00:49:42,222 --> 00:49:43,930
<i>It was well-known.</i>

625
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:46,655
<i>No, I mean, to be more precise,</i>

626
00:49:46,655 --> 00:49:48,455
<i>everyone just hushed it up.</i>

627
00:49:48,455 --> 00:49:52,789
<i>There was a rumor that Cho Soo Kyung's
family was quite powerful.</i>

628
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:54,655
<i>So, that Cho Soo Kyung</i>

629
00:49:54,655 --> 00:49:58,055
<i>is a person who's only satisfied
when she gets what she wants,</i>

630
00:49:58,055 --> 00:50:01,622
<i>and her family solves such issues.</i>

631
00:50:02,135 --> 00:50:04,763
<i>But at that moment, exactly,</i>

632
00:50:05,489 --> 00:50:07,850
<i>Min Jae got caught.</i>

633
00:50:27,228 --> 00:50:29,769
To the police station?

634
00:50:29,769 --> 00:50:31,711
Me?

635
00:50:31,711 --> 00:50:32,855
No…

636
00:50:32,855 --> 00:50:34,689
I said I'm the victim.

637
00:50:34,689 --> 00:50:37,555
Yes, but you still have to go.

638
00:50:37,555 --> 00:50:41,489
We need to punish false statements
and prepare an official report.

639
00:50:41,489 --> 00:50:45,659
You can also request an investigation
for the part you just testified about.

640
00:50:47,341 --> 00:50:49,622
I…

641
00:50:49,622 --> 00:50:52,122
I told you,

642
00:50:52,122 --> 00:50:54,389
that I'm the victim.

643
00:50:55,355 --> 00:50:57,563
I said it already,

644
00:50:57,563 --> 00:50:58,970
okay?

645
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:01,689
I'm the victim!

646
00:51:06,868 --> 00:51:08,988
Are you crazy?

647
00:51:08,988 --> 00:51:10,489
What if you do this to the police?

648
00:51:10,489 --> 00:51:12,160
Then what?

649
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,869
She said to go to the police station.

650
00:51:16,468 --> 00:51:19,394
Because of you, really…

651
00:51:19,394 --> 00:51:21,340
What do you want to do now?

652
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,434
Huh?

653
00:51:48,127 --> 00:51:50,131
Take care of it.

When this woman wakes up,

657
00:51:55,689 --> 00:51:58,322
it's the end for you and me.

658
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:03,402
Hurry!

659
00:52:10,122 --> 00:52:12,222
Are you there?

660
00:52:16,108 --> 00:52:18,022
Is there someone inside?

661
00:52:18,022 --> 00:52:21,181
Mr. Lee Min Hyeong, you're in there, right?

662
00:52:21,181 --> 00:52:22,889
Come on, quickly!

663
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,086
How…

664
00:52:26,861 --> 00:52:29,582
Snap out of it, Woo Min Jae!

665
00:52:29,582 --> 00:52:31,595
This isn't our first time.

666
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:33,455
We've done this before.

667
00:52:33,455 --> 00:52:35,518
You can do it, right?

668
00:52:37,256 --> 00:52:38,455
<i>But, at that time,</i>

669
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:42,655
<i>there was someone who went around
blabbering that they were involved.</i>

670
00:52:42,655 --> 00:52:46,835
<i>That person suddenly jumped off
the roof of a building near the school.</i>

671
00:52:46,835 --> 00:52:49,714
<i>That person was not the type to do that.</i>

672
00:52:49,714 --> 00:52:53,389
<i>So, according to some rumors,</i>

673
00:52:53,389 --> 00:52:56,368
<i>Woo Min Jae and Cho Soo Kyung</i>

674
00:52:56,368 --> 00:52:59,578
<i>lured the person to the rooftop,</i>

675
00:53:00,189 --> 00:53:03,238
<i>and then pushed her off.</i>

676
00:53:05,648 --> 00:53:07,621
It's the same this time.

677
00:53:07,621 --> 00:53:09,281
We have to do it.

678
00:53:09,281 --> 00:53:13,717
If we're going to do this
together, we have to do it.

679
00:53:14,718 --> 00:53:15,789
Yes.

680
00:53:15,789 --> 00:53:17,722
It's nothing.

681
00:53:17,722 --> 00:53:21,801
Just like that day on the
rooftop, just for a moment.

682
00:53:21,801 --> 00:53:24,500
You just need to give a little push.

683
00:53:30,695 --> 00:53:32,704
Hurry.

684

688
00:54:18,408 --> 00:54:20,322
Did this come from the corner of the balcony?

689
00:54:20,322 --> 00:54:24,131
It seems they came to volunteer

Why that detective?

693
00:54:30,656 --> 00:54:32,936
Knowing that these two were prison mates,

694
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,549
he even visited the hospital
where your mother was.

695
00:54:34,549 --> 00:54:37,883
She knew about the relationship between them?

696
00:54:39,695 --> 00:54:41,775
Lee Jin Seok!

697
00:54:41,775 --> 00:54:43,422
Looks like you're flustered.

698
00:54:43,422 --> 00:54:45,248
Because it's not the person you were expecting.

699
