1
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:13,625
   

2
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:20,661
   

3
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,402
   

4
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:37,053
   

5
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:52,080



6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,920
   

7
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:16,365
   

8
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:18,727
 Loyalty! 
   

9
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:21,822
 On March 24 of the year 2016, 

10
00:01:21,822 --> 00:01:23,455
 Officer Lee Min Hyeong 

11
00:01:23,455 --> 00:01:27,955
 has accepted the orders to transfer to Gayeon Police Station. Loyalty! 

12
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:35,022
 I heard you volunteered for night duty on your first day? 

13
00:01:35,022 --> 00:01:37,889
 Oh, that's some great enthusiasm! 

14
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,855
 I'm trying to give my best. 

15
00:01:39,855 --> 00:01:41,355
 I ask for your guidance. 

16
00:01:41,355 --> 00:01:43,122
 You should not be asking me 

17
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:45,220
 but those above. 

18
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:51,889
 Still, I heard it's been peaceful and quiet around here, with no major— 

19
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:54,155
 Oh, stop. Stop! 

20
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:57,722
 Don't you know that saying such things is a jinx? 

21
00:01:57,722 --> 00:01:58,989
 "Peaceful" 

22
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:00,555
 "Quiet," okay? 

23
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:03,922
 Those are taboo words in this line of work. Taboo words! 

24
00:02:03,922 --> 00:02:07,022
 Yes, I will correct myself. 

25
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,420
 ­Code 0; CH D1 

26
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:16,871
 Patrol car number 11. 

27
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,955
 A murder has occurred at Gayeon-dong Rose Villa. 

28
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:21,455
 Requesting reinforcement. Reinforcements needed. 

29
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,750
 ­  

30
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:01,315
 Let go! 

31
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:04,122
 Hey, this punk's high on drugs. 

32
00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:05,989
 - Request support from the narcotics team! 
 - Stay still! 

33
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:07,722
 I said I didn't do it! 

34
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:09,989
 Did you see me doing it? 

35
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:23,289
 At a villa in Gayeon-dong, Seoul, 

36
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:25,722
 a man in his 20s was arrested as a suspect 

37
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:29,989
 in the murder of a bride-to-be residing next door. 

38
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:33,122
 The arrested, Mr. Lee had a history of drug use and assault. 

39
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:35,522
 After taking drugs, he entered the house 

40
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:38,255
 and brandished a weapon at Ms. Yoon, a woman in her 20s, 

41
00:03:38,255 --> 00:03:41,141
 and is now under suspicion of her murder. 

42
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:45,155
 Ah, darn it! This is driving me crazy, really! 

43
00:03:45,155 --> 00:03:46,951
 Hey, you should 

44
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:48,355
 find out the truth. Okay? 

45
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:50,643
 Did I really kill her? 

46
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:54,718
 What's with those eyes? 

47
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:58,975
 Did I kill her? Huh? 

48
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:00,970
 That woman… 

49
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:05,090
 I killed her, right? 

50
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:13,289
 Your fingerprints were found on the door of the house, and on the victim's body, 

51
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:14,789
 and on the weapon with the victim's blood. 

52
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:17,955
 Your fingerprints were perfectly all over it. 

53
00:04:17,955 --> 00:04:21,055
 Hair, urine, and blood. 

54
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:23,522
 All tested positive in the drug tests. 

55
00:04:23,522 --> 00:04:26,859
 Moreover, you have a previous conviction for theft and violence. 

56
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:29,289
 Even if I investigate, it's true you killed her. 

57
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:30,955
 Ah, shit! Why would I? 

58
00:04:30,955 --> 00:04:33,389
 Why would I? Why? Why? Why? Damn it! 

59
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,822
 So why? 

60
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:39,320
 Why? 

61
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:43,189
 Why steal? Why fight? 

62
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:44,722
 Why? 

63
00:04:44,722 --> 00:04:47,584
 Why on earth did you kill her? 

64
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:52,315
 Brother, why did you do that 

65
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:54,695
 to our mom 

66
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,028
 and to me? 

67
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,807
 Hey! 

68
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:07,902
 Damn it! 

69
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:12,589
 - Huh? He is coming out! 
 - He's out! 

70
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:15,089
 - He's coming out! 
 - He's out! 

71
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,201
 Please, say something! 

72
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:30,262
 Hey, block him! 

73
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:33,355
 Why? Why did you do it? 

74
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:35,935
 Why did you do that? Why? 

75
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,290
   

76
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,722
Your eyes are still the same.

77
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:23,062
Why are you here?

78
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:27,895
Why? Why are you hovering around the victim?

79
00:06:31,127 --> 00:06:33,918
I wanted to see how

80
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:35,428
that rat Cha Jeong Woo was living.

81
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,028
Are you crazy?

82
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:38,589
Why are you doing that?

83
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:42,689
Shouldn't I bring my life back that rat ruined?

84
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:49,655
Say something that makes sense.

85
00:06:49,655 --> 00:06:51,889
Who is blaming whom right now?

86
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:55,334
Thanks to that rat, I became a national star,

87
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:58,834
becoming someone who should be killed right away.

88
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:04,883
None of the prosecutors, judges, or lawyers would listen to me.

89
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:11,025
Enough! I have nothing more to say to you.

90
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:13,563
Appearing after being released and threatening the victim.

91
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:16,168
That's enough reason for an emergency arrest.

92
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:19,889
Wait a moment. Okay?

93
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:22,851
Because I have something prepared as well.

94
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:49,012
You couldn't even avoid that, like a dummy!

95
00:07:56,461 --> 00:07:58,381
Ms. Lee Min Hyeong!

96
00:07:58,381 --> 00:08:00,481
Ms. Lee Min Hyeong!

97
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:03,355
Are you okay?

98
00:08:13,655 --> 00:08:15,794
I'm okay.

99
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:19,622
He's been watching me from the hospital parking lot.

100
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:21,755
He looked suspicious enough.

101
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:24,555
Did you see him? His face?

102
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,555
Are you hurt?

103
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:35,082
Ah, I'm fine.

104
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,115
I'm okay.

105
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,560
   

106
00:08:55,249 --> 00:08:58,722
It's not serious enough to need stitches, but if left like that, the recovery will be slow.

107
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:00,189
Go up and receive treatment before leaving.

108
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:02,955
To a detective, this much is nothing to worry about. I'm okay.

109
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:06,198
It's not okay. You are not.

110
00:09:07,521 --> 00:09:09,855
I said I'm okay.

111
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:17,327
Cha Jeong Woo!

112
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:24,588
It was Detective Lee Min Hyeong, right?

113
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,789
- What's the matter? 
 - It's nothing.

114
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:30,022
What brings you here at this hour?

115
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:31,289
Woo Jin wanted to have a drink.

116
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:32,769
Hey!

117
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:35,155
You should have called when you arrived. What are you doing here?

118
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:37,755
Well, he looked pretty serious with Detective Lee,

119
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:39,351
so I was wondering what was going on.

120
00:09:39,351 --> 00:09:40,889
Detective Lee?

121
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:43,822
While you were having a serious conversation with Detective Lee,

122
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:46,227
why would you have taken her clothes off?

123
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:49,022
- Hey, you! Please! 
 - No…

124
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,989
No, look at this. Look! Isn't that Detective Lee's jacket?

125
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:53,022
Director Cha, are you okay?

126
00:09:53,022 --> 00:09:54,289
Did you report it?

127
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:56,412
I think that person earlier had a knife on him.

128
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:57,889
A knife?

129
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,742
Who?

130
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,889
   

131
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:06,689
This is more serious than I thought.

132
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,622
This is not something to just let go.

133
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:10,722
Report it officially to the police and—

134
00:10:10,722 --> 00:10:13,436
Detective Lee Min Hyeong will look into it.

135
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:17,089
Hey, Jeong Woo,

136
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:20,505
do you have any idea who it might be after watching this?

137
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:24,838
Not sure…

138
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:29,589
- I'm going. 
 - Huh?

139
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:32,621
- Hey! 
 - Hey, Jeong Woo.

140
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:35,215
How can he be so nonchalant about it?

141
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:37,881
It's got me all worried.

142
00:10:43,055 --> 00:10:45,455
Who on earth are you?

143
00:10:58,854 --> 00:11:00,461
 Then, 

144
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:05,895
 could there be someone who might hold a grudge against you or anything like that? 

145
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:36,089
   

146
00:11:42,222 --> 00:11:44,822
 The day after Lee Jin Seok's release, 

147
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:46,489
 Nam Gi Taek died. 

148
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:47,789
   

149
00:12:01,468 --> 00:12:03,655
Whether a prisoner was released or not?

150
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:07,399
I'd like to check if he had been released recently.

151
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:11,622
Are you the crime victim?

152
00:12:11,622 --> 00:12:14,067
I am not the concerned party.

153
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,422
Then, regarding the release of a convict,

154
00:12:17,422 --> 00:12:19,455
either the victim or the victim's attorney

155
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:22,889
needs to inquire with the Prosecutor's Office's victim support department.

156
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:26,215
- The victim herself? 
 - Yes.

157
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:29,648
We can't disclose information unless it's the victim herself.

158
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,360
   

159
00:13:07,372 --> 00:13:08,155
Yes?

160
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,689
 Yes, this is Lee Min Hyeong. 

161
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,584
Ah, if you're at the hospital,

162
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,489
just leave the phone in front of the door—

163
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:16,520
 I've clocked out. 

164
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:21,130
Then perhaps by quick delivery service…

165
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:25,089
Please come here.

166
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:27,478
 - Pardon?  
 - I'll tell you the address.

167
00:13:27,478 --> 00:13:29,689
No, wait. Just a moment.

168
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:32,870
   

169
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:07,397
You just let them be like that, you idiot?

170
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:10,168
Hey, wait a second.

171
00:14:10,168 --> 00:14:12,535
Darn, it got disconnected.

172
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,455
Yeah.

173
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:22,222
If they don't pay the delivery fee for being late, you should trample them down.

174
00:14:22,222 --> 00:14:24,622
If it were me, I would have half-killed them.

175
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:26,141
Huh?

176
00:14:42,155 --> 00:14:44,455
Is anyone there?

177
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:46,489
Delivery!

178
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,289
Delivery!

179
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:00,368
Are you okay? Your injuries…

180
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:02,768
Yes, I'm fine.

181
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:06,589
That arm…

182
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:10,441
I'm considering asking for a favor in exchange for providing free medical treatment.

183
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:13,822
What kind of favor?

184
00:15:13,822 --> 00:15:16,262
There is someone I need to find out about,

185
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:19,695
so I was thinking of getting some help from the police.

186
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:26,688
Please help!

187
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:30,522
I am a police officer. What's the matter?

188
00:15:30,522 --> 00:15:34,122
The delivery person who just ran out suddenly barged in and…

189
00:15:34,122 --> 00:15:36,422
First, make a report.

190
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:39,322
I'm a doctor. Can you hear me?

191
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:40,507
What should I do?

192
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:41,889
How is your breathing? Are you okay?

193
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:44,555
Hello? Is this 119?

194
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:48,134
- I need a clean towel. 
 - Okay.

195
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:50,675
- Please come quickly, with the police. 
 - Don't move.

196
00:15:50,675 --> 00:15:52,408
This place is…

197
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:55,041
Just stay like this, until the paramedics arrive.

198
00:16:14,826 --> 00:16:16,622
Why are you doing this?

199
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:18,255
You just delivered to number 902, right?

200
00:16:18,255 --> 00:16:20,509
Where is the helmet?

201
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:22,555
It was dropped at house number 902.

202
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:25,355
No! When I… When I entered…

203
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:27,722
Ah, you've just admitted the home invasion.

204
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:30,172
- You are under arrest for trespassing. 
 - Wait a moment.

205
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:31,589
You have the right to appoint an attorney,

206
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:33,589
and remain silent or refuse to make self-incriminating statements.

207
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:36,283
Ah! Darn it…

208
00:16:37,155 --> 00:16:39,022
His pulse and breathing are stable,

209
00:16:39,022 --> 00:16:41,055
but, just in case, please check his vitals.

210
00:16:41,055 --> 00:16:43,920
- Yes. 
 - Understood.

211
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:46,922
The guardian insists that we consult with the plastic surgery department,

212
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,556
but there is no one on duty at Janghan Hospital right now.

213
00:16:49,556 --> 00:16:51,922
- What about the plastic surgery hospital? 
 - I'll check.

214
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:54,422
For now, come to our hospital.

215
00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:01,289
There are hardly any general hospitals with plastic surgery on-call

216
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:02,822
at this hour.

217
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,789
   

218
00:17:08,768 --> 00:17:12,555
I ordered food and while handing over the delivery fee,

219
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:14,961
I accidentally dropped the money.

220
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:17,022
 Maybe that got him riled up, 

221
00:17:17,022 --> 00:17:20,385
 because he just barged in through the door. 

222
00:17:21,154 --> 00:17:23,381
 Are you looking down on me because I'm a delivery guy? 

223
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:25,355
 Are you dismissing me? 

224
00:17:25,355 --> 00:17:28,922
 Min Jae tried to stop him and a fight broke out. 

225
00:17:44,408 --> 00:17:47,218
 And during that, a mirror accidentally broke. 

226
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:51,055
What is your relation to Mr. Woo Min Jae?

227
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:54,055
Cousins. Distant cousins.

228
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:02,089
Kim Seon Yong

229
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:04,722
has a prior record for similar offenses,

230
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:07,422
and he's still on probation.

231
00:18:07,422 --> 00:18:08,469
   

232
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:10,322
   

233
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,855
What are you talking about?

234
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:14,989
By the time I entered, he was already covered in blood.

235
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:16,755
The whole house was splattered with blood,

236
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:19,255
and they opened the door to receive food delivery?

237
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:21,389
They're trying to pin it on me. That's what this is.

238
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:23,189
It's always the delivery person's fault, isn't it?

239
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:25,789
They're trying to frame an easy target, the delivery person.

240
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:27,589
There's a record of similar offenses.

241
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:30,555
Special residential intrusion and assault resulting in injury.

242
00:18:30,555 --> 00:18:33,122
You were sentenced to probation six months ago,

243
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:36,801
and you committed the same crime again before the end of the probation period.

244
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:39,922
Why does that come up now?

245
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:42,889
Does my being an ex-convict serve as some sort of evidence?

246
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,989
This is why I ran off!

247
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:48,787
Because it was obvious you'd try to connect me to past incidents.

248
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:51,889
If you had known you'd be tied up because of your criminal history,

249
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:53,615
you should have been more careful and acted properly—

250
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:55,855
What good is it if I only live properly?

251
00:18:55,855 --> 00:18:58,955
When you all look at me crookedly!

252
00:18:58,955 --> 00:19:02,622
You just ignore and dismiss what an ex-convict says, jeez!

253
00:19:02,622 --> 00:19:03,755
What do you expect me to do?

254
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:05,051
What the heck are you doing?

255
00:19:05,051 --> 00:19:06,622
What am I supposed to do?

256
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:09,128
Ah! Damn it!

257
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:12,155
Let go! Let me go!

258
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:15,135
Apply for a pre-arrest warrant.

259
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,012
 I said I didn't do that. 

260
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:31,155
 Did you see me doing it? 

261
00:19:31,155 --> 00:19:32,781
 Even if I investigate, it's true you killed her. 

262
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:34,555
 Ah, damn! Why would I? 

263
00:19:34,555 --> 00:19:37,766
 Why would I? Why? Why? Why? Damn it! 

264
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:15,389
Fortunately, it's not too deep.

265
00:20:15,389 --> 00:20:18,689
It doesn't seem like there's damage to any major blood vessels or nerves.

266
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:20,555
The problem is the laceration on the ear.

267
00:20:20,555 --> 00:20:22,722
There's a bit of a defect.

268
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,636
We'll schedule reconstructive surgery when the staff is in tomorrow.

269
00:20:29,222 --> 00:20:31,355
Tomorrow?

270
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,422
Is it that serious?

271
00:20:33,422 --> 00:20:36,234
Can't you just stitch it up?

272
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:39,022
Simple suturing won't suffice.

273
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:43,269
Don't worry too much, it's a simple surgery.

274
00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:10,555
Have there been any other external impacts

275
00:21:10,555 --> 00:21:13,689
after the fragments entered the jaw area?

276
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:15,455
Why do you ask?

277
00:21:15,455 --> 00:21:19,755
Because the wound near the jaw is quite deeper compared to other areas.

278
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:24,722
I was out of it,

279
00:21:24,722 --> 00:21:27,355
so I don't remember well.

280
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:38,155
I'll clean the wound and start suturing.

281
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:16,622
How did it go?

282
00:22:16,622 --> 00:22:18,738
Is Min Jae's face okay?

283
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:20,255
The facial suturing went well,

284
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,189
and we'll operate on the ear when the staff arrives tomorrow.

285
00:22:23,189 --> 00:22:25,722
Is the ear injury that severe?

286
00:22:25,722 --> 00:22:27,555
Simple suturing won't do?

287
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:31,866
We need to harvest cartilage from the other side to fill the defect.

288
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:38,734
It's not a complicated surgery, so don't worry too much.

289
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:40,214
Uh, I…

290
00:22:40,214 --> 00:22:43,622
When they were transferring Min Jae,

291
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:46,922
it seemed like the paramedics weren't properly immobilizing his face.

292
00:22:46,922 --> 00:22:51,721
Could that have made the wound worse?

293
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:53,620
Did that happen?

294
00:22:54,955 --> 00:22:59,155
It will be fortunate if it hasn't gotten worse.

295
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:06,161
Anyway, thank you for your hard work.

296
00:23:19,995 --> 00:23:24,800
   

297
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,960
   

298
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,322
I was just about to call you.

299
00:23:45,322 --> 00:23:49,722
It can't be good news this early in the morning.

300
00:23:49,722 --> 00:23:54,455
And it's even less likely that you just came for delivery this early in the morning.

301
00:23:55,488 --> 00:23:57,789
This person here, yesterday.

302
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:00,400
He was filming you.

303
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:04,551
So, you know who he is then.

304
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:07,162
Lee Jin Seok.

305
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:11,628
The criminal from that case seven years ago.

306
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:16,822
It's not confirmed, but if he was released,

307
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,755
why he would appear before me,

308
00:24:18,755 --> 00:24:21,232
what he is thinking...

309
00:24:23,322 --> 00:24:25,789
Please find him for me.

310
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,674
Have you seen

311
00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:58,702
this person before?

312
00:24:59,508 --> 00:25:02,775
Yes, at my father's funeral.

313
00:25:04,745 --> 00:25:09,922
I remember him because there weren't many people who came to pay their respects.

314
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:40,622
Who is this person?

315
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:43,555
He was someone in the same prison.

316
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:45,489
There's something I need to verify.

317
00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:47,755
Does it have to do with my father's death?

318
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,222
It's not certain yet.

319
00:25:49,222 --> 00:25:51,355
I need to find out more.

320
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:11,622
 The team leader asked to upload the investigation file 

321
00:26:11,622 --> 00:26:13,222
 because of the victim's statement. 

322
00:26:13,222 --> 00:26:16,117
I'm going to the hospital to get the statement, and then I'll head back.

323
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,022
Okay.

324
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:34,689
Since you've completed the third case, I heard you're preparing to leave the country.

325
00:26:34,689 --> 00:26:36,189
So then why did you bring number 4?

326
00:26:36,189 --> 00:26:37,855
It hasn't been approved yet.

327
00:26:37,855 --> 00:26:39,489
So…

328
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:41,989
If the partner continues not to grant consent,

329
00:26:41,989 --> 00:26:44,089
will you keep bringing in victims?

330
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:47,961
It's my neighbor. I brought them because there were no hospital beds available.

331
00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:50,522
Are emergency rooms instinct?

332
00:26:50,522 --> 00:26:52,596
That was a long time ago.

333
00:26:52,596 --> 00:26:54,454
You can't hide your instincts.

334
00:26:54,454 --> 00:26:56,055
Hey, Jeong Woo. Hey, what is it?

335
00:26:56,055 --> 00:26:58,622
I heard another crime victim came to the ward.

336
00:26:58,622 --> 00:26:59,922
Didn't you finish that?

337
00:26:59,922 --> 00:27:03,189
He said number 3 was done, and yet he personally transferred the patient.

338
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:05,022
Don't read too much into it.

339
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:07,961
I brought him thinking it was just a simple suture case.

340
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:08,989
What does that mean?

341
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:10,801
So, it's not just a simple suture?

342
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:12,407
What is it? What?

343
00:27:12,407 --> 00:27:14,141
Ah, what is it?

344
00:27:16,308 --> 00:27:18,522
Pretending not to be interested,

345
00:27:18,522 --> 00:27:22,251
he's focusing all his attention on the patient.

346
00:27:27,655 --> 00:27:31,489
Am I really going to have abs in two hours?

347
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:33,655
After getting rid of all the useless fat,

348
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:37,622
and if we sculpt the upper layer of fat under the skin into the ab shape,

349
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:40,557
it will all come out, so you don't have to worry.

350
00:27:40,557 --> 00:27:42,589
Once the surgery is done, and you start exercising lightly,

351
00:27:42,589 --> 00:27:44,692
it will settle in more perfectly.

352
00:27:44,692 --> 00:27:45,722
Nice and tight!

353
00:27:45,722 --> 00:27:47,655
I've already registered at the gym.

354
00:27:47,655 --> 00:27:49,621
Once I get these abs just right,

355
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:52,489
I'll confidently work out with my shirt off.

356
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:55,289
I even bought a crop tee.

357
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:56,610
A crop tee is great, indeed.

358
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,076
Yes, all done.

359
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:03,689
All right, now to transform into a real man,

360
00:28:03,689 --> 00:28:07,022
shall we try having a fantastic time of deep sleep?

361
00:28:54,981 --> 00:28:57,815
It's good.

362
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,554
It's settled in well. Let's see…

363
00:29:07,554 --> 00:29:10,807
Okay, good job.

364
00:29:15,891 --> 00:29:18,533
That delivery person suddenly barged in…

365
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:19,722
 Are you looking down on me because I'm a delivery guy? 

366
00:29:19,722 --> 00:29:21,937
 Are you dismissing me? 

367
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:32,181
Just a moment.

368
00:29:37,087 --> 00:29:41,120
Did you get the bruise on your wrist from the fight?

369
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:44,442
It seems like it…

370
00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:49,989
Things were so hectic.

371
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:55,322
Understood. I'll take additional statements on the necessary parts again later.

372
00:30:02,508 --> 00:30:04,360
Excuse me…

373
00:30:05,082 --> 00:30:07,475
Are you finished?

374
00:30:07,475 --> 00:30:09,955
Yes, I've wrapped up for now,

375
00:30:09,955 --> 00:30:12,755
and have decided to take additional statements later.

376
00:30:14,322 --> 00:30:19,255
It seems Min Jae is quite shocked.

377
00:30:19,255 --> 00:30:21,936
He will probably have a hard time.

378
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:24,489
That's likely.

379
00:30:25,155 --> 00:30:29,989
What happened to that delivery guy?

380
00:30:29,989 --> 00:30:31,933
He is currently under investigation.

381
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:34,059
Why do you ask?

382
00:30:34,722 --> 00:30:37,089
You mentioned a criminal record.

383
00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:40,555
I'm anxious he might come back.

384
00:30:40,555 --> 00:30:41,889
A warrant has been requested,

385
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:45,095
and it will probably be issued, so don't worry too much.

386
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:47,568
Oh, okay.

387
00:31:00,655 --> 00:31:04,122
Can you come see me for a moment? I have something to discuss.

388
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:15,606
Just wrap it up quickly.

389
00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:19,289
I have someone in mind.

390
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:21,122
The person who did this to you.

391
00:31:21,122 --> 00:31:22,622
What?

392
00:31:22,622 --> 00:31:25,080
Why are you so surprised?

393
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,955
Because of the pain.

394
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:33,689
If it hurts that much, why did you refuse treatment yesterday?

395
00:31:33,689 --> 00:31:35,889
We talked in front of the house yesterday

396
00:31:35,889 --> 00:31:38,895
about possibly asking for police assistance.

397
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:43,422
I want to confirm the release of a prisoner,

398
00:31:43,422 --> 00:31:45,892
someone named Lee Jin Seok.

399
00:31:45,892 --> 00:31:49,841
You shouldn't make such a personal request to the police.

400
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,076
You of all people should know.

401
00:31:59,821 --> 00:32:01,348
Thank you.

402
00:32:01,348 --> 00:32:03,901
I'll pay the medical fee next time.

403
00:32:03,901 --> 00:32:08,417
Don't you have anything to talk to me about?

404
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:12,219
What do you…?

405
00:32:17,444 --> 00:32:19,555
Patient Woo Min Jae.

406
00:32:19,555 --> 00:32:22,889
Aren't you curious about his condition or any peculiar observations

407
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:24,083
during the patient's treatment?

408
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:26,233
Ah, right.

409
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:28,079
That's what you are talking about.

410
00:32:31,668 --> 00:32:34,855
It's a fragment removed from the chin area.

411
00:32:34,855 --> 00:32:37,122
It's especially deep compared to the other wounds.

412
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,022
The other wounds were less than 1 cm, but only this one was 3 cm.

413
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:43,455
The depth, shape, and direction are all different.

414
00:32:43,455 --> 00:32:46,121
The cross-section is also messy.

415
00:32:46,121 --> 00:32:47,605
If it's messy…

416
00:32:47,605 --> 00:32:52,315
Unlike the other wounds, the inside was crushed.

417
00:32:58,288 --> 00:33:00,511
Do you need something?

418
00:33:04,142 --> 00:33:06,555
I wanted to talk with the doctor

419
00:33:06,555 --> 00:33:09,889
about the ear surgery this afternoon.

420
00:33:09,889 --> 00:33:11,355
Please speak.

421
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:14,222
How long will the surgery take?

422
00:33:14,222 --> 00:33:16,142
About two to three hours.

423
00:33:16,142 --> 00:33:19,289
I will arrange for you to receive proper surgery instructions.

424
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,014
Yes.

425
00:33:22,955 --> 00:33:25,001
That…

426
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:28,068
Was that stuck in me?

427
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:33,122
In cases of accidents like this,

428
00:33:33,122 --> 00:33:36,622
the police receive a medical opinion.

429
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:39,722
Understood.

430
00:33:39,722 --> 00:33:41,519
Then…

431
00:33:50,607 --> 00:33:53,736
So, are you saying the wound wasn't caused by a falling fragment embedding itself?

432
00:33:53,736 --> 00:33:56,055
Judging only by the shape of the wound, that's correct.

433
00:33:56,055 --> 00:33:58,622
It seems like someone stabbed it in.

434
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:03,363
So it's not like the others.

435
00:34:03,363 --> 00:34:05,822
You mean just this one was like that?

436
00:34:05,822 --> 00:34:07,631
Yes.

437
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:12,089
Understood, I'll look into it.

438
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:13,289
 Yes, Senior. 

439
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:15,222
Did the schedule for Kim Seon Yong's warrant hearing come out?

440
00:35:15,222 --> 00:35:18,055
 Yes, it's set for the afternoon, so I'll be entering court in a bit. 

441
00:35:18,055 --> 00:35:19,620
 Why? 

442
00:35:20,255 --> 00:35:23,760
Look into the relationship between Cho Soo Kyeong and Woo Min Jae again.

443
00:35:25,322 --> 00:35:27,358
 Yes, understood. 

444
00:35:38,355 --> 00:35:41,621
We will begin reconstructive surgery on patient Woo Min Jae.

445
00:35:41,621 --> 00:35:43,431
Scalpel.

446
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,489
However, until when do I need to keep the blood drain?

447
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:22,655
In principle, it should be for about a week.

448
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:24,222
If you come back after three days,

449
00:36:24,222 --> 00:36:26,822
- we will check your condition and decide. 
 - Yes.

450
00:36:26,822 --> 00:36:29,355
You must wear the compression garment for a month.

451
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:30,522
Yes, I understand.

452
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:34,189
It helps with recovery if you move a bit, even though it's difficult.

453
00:36:34,189 --> 00:36:35,822
Call us if you need to.

454
00:36:35,822 --> 00:36:37,767
Yes, got it!

455
00:37:08,828 --> 00:37:11,328
 She was talking with the doctor... 

456
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:16,122
 to get some kind of medical opinion. 

457
00:37:16,122 --> 00:37:18,276
What's going on?

458
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:23,062
Well, it's just that…

459
00:37:24,022 --> 00:37:26,446
Ah, it's nothing.

460
00:37:46,955 --> 00:37:51,488
The defect was not extensive, so the surgery was relatively easy.

461
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:53,822
More than the reconstructed side,

462
00:37:53,822 --> 00:37:57,136
there may be more pain on the side from which the cartilage was harvested.

463
00:37:57,136 --> 00:37:59,589
- Understood. 
 - After discharge, you should

464
00:37:59,589 --> 00:38:02,489
come in every 3 to 4 days to receive outpatient treatment.

465
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,465
Yes, I understand.

466
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:07,381
Did you submit

467
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:10,595
the opinion letter to the police?

468
00:38:10,595 --> 00:38:16,460
Since you said you submitted opinion letters to the police for such cases.

469
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,061
Yes.

470
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:20,361
What did you write?

471
00:38:21,142 --> 00:38:23,909
What are you curious about?

472
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:29,079
Ah, nothing.

473
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:31,485
Don't worry about it.

474
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:49,989
You're asking to compare this with these slippers?

475
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:52,968
Yes, as soon as possible.

476
00:39:12,221 --> 00:39:14,155
What the heck is this jerk doing?

477
00:39:14,155 --> 00:39:16,089
It's okay.

478
00:39:18,827 --> 00:39:22,266
You've been investigating, assuming I was the culprit from the beginning, haven't you?

479
00:39:23,022 --> 00:39:25,070
Because I have a prior record.

480
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:29,295
Because you can totally ignore a powerless, backup-less ex-convict like me!

481
00:39:29,295 --> 00:39:31,519
Come here, you rat!

482
00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:38,437
Do you still think it's me?

483
00:39:38,437 --> 00:39:40,342
Really?

484
00:39:41,021 --> 00:39:44,335
 Thanks to that rat, I became a national star, 

485
00:39:44,335 --> 00:39:47,668
 becoming someone who should be killed right away. 

486
00:39:48,794 --> 00:39:53,104
 None of the prosecutors, judges, or lawyers would listen to me. 

487
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:58,830
 Enough! I have nothing more to say to you. 

488
00:40:07,308 --> 00:40:09,942
What the heck is this?

489
00:40:13,055 --> 00:40:14,722
Here.

490
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:21,155
Make sure to take your prescription when you go home.

491
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:24,522
Ah, yes, I'll go down now.

492
00:40:28,722 --> 00:40:30,489
Just wait here for a moment.

493
00:40:30,489 --> 00:40:32,741
I'll go down and come back quickly.

494
00:40:33,395 --> 00:40:34,721
Can't we just leave?

495
00:40:34,721 --> 00:40:36,489
It's just a prescription.

496
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:40,161
No need to draw attention to yourself for no reason.

497
00:40:40,161 --> 00:40:43,449
Don't worry, I'll be back quickly.

498
00:41:01,268 --> 00:41:03,589
Have you looked into Cho Soo Kyeong and Woo Min Jae?

499
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:06,155
I got Woo Min Jae's family home contact and tried calling,

500
00:41:06,155 --> 00:41:08,222
but they didn't answer.

501
00:41:08,222 --> 00:41:09,989
So I inquired at the academy,

502
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:13,233
and they said it's been a while since he switched to online classes.

503
00:41:14,022 --> 00:41:15,655
Is that so?

504
00:41:15,655 --> 00:41:18,401
What video is that?

505
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:21,455
So, while inquiring around Cho Soo Kyeong's house,

506
00:41:21,455 --> 00:41:23,455
I checked the elevator CCTV,

507
00:41:23,455 --> 00:41:26,089
but Woo Min Jae has never left the building.

508
00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:28,247
Not a single time in two weeks.

509
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:32,627
Well, I suppose it could happen, but…

510
00:41:32,627 --> 00:41:34,614
There's something going on with these two, isn't there?

511
00:41:34,614 --> 00:41:37,595
Isn't that why you told me to look into it?

512
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:41,395
He's never been out even once?

513
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:49,482
What the…

514
00:41:49,482 --> 00:41:50,755
For real!

515
00:41:50,755 --> 00:41:53,037
Even as a slave driver, at least tell me what I'm working so hard for!

516
00:41:53,037 --> 00:41:55,422
Ah, and keep trying to contact Woo Min Jae's family,

517
00:41:55,422 --> 00:41:56,789
and ask around the area a bit more.

518
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:57,814
Yes, Ma'am!

519
00:41:57,814 --> 00:41:59,948
But why?

520
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:07,118
Conducting the investigation all by herself, just like that.

521
00:42:07,118 --> 00:42:09,189
Prosecutor Kim Tae Hyeong, right?

522
00:42:09,189 --> 00:42:10,729
You have a warrant hearing scheduled for this afternoon.

523
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:12,729
I'm the investigator in charge of Kim Seon Yong's case.

524
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:15,455
Would it be possible for you to talk now?

525
00:42:15,455 --> 00:42:18,689
Ah, I have something to consult with you about.

526
00:42:26,955 --> 00:42:28,592
 Is the ear injury that severe? 

527
00:42:28,592 --> 00:42:29,926
 Simple suturing won't do? 

528
00:42:29,926 --> 00:42:32,393
 It seemed like the paramedics weren't properly immobilizing his face. 

529
00:42:32,393 --> 00:42:36,927
 Could that have made the wound worse? 

530
00:42:46,428 --> 00:42:48,465
 Do you need something? 

531
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,954
 I wanted to talk with the doctor 

532
00:42:55,954 --> 00:42:59,431
 about the ear surgery this afternoon. 

533
00:43:28,368 --> 00:43:31,102
What's the matter?

534
00:43:33,616 --> 00:43:36,022
Ah, you're Mr. Woo Min Jae's father, aren't you?

535
00:43:36,022 --> 00:43:38,189
 Yes, that's right. What's the matter? 

536
00:43:38,189 --> 00:43:40,755
Have you had any recent contact with Mr. Woo Min Jae?

537
00:43:40,755 --> 00:43:42,655
 Pardon? 

538
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:45,755
A phone or video call, have you talked?

539
00:43:45,755 --> 00:43:48,489
 Ah, he's at a boarding school where cellphone use isn't allowed. 

540
00:43:48,489 --> 00:43:50,255
 It's been quite a while since we last talked, why? 

541
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:52,089
Boarding school?

542
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:54,989
So he's not with a relative in Seoul, named Cho Soo Kyeong,

543
00:43:54,989 --> 00:43:56,389
 He doesn't have relatives in Seoul. 

544
00:43:56,389 --> 00:43:59,007
 I'll call you back later, I'm busy now. 

545
00:44:03,296 --> 00:44:04,955
   

546
00:44:15,502 --> 00:44:18,055
I hesitated after a brief glance,

547
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,655
but it turned out to be right.

548
00:44:19,655 --> 00:44:20,978
What is your relationship with them?

549
00:44:20,978 --> 00:44:24,714
Min Jae and I are from the same high school.

550
00:44:24,714 --> 00:44:27,155
And that woman, I mean Cho Soo Kyeong,

551
00:44:27,155 --> 00:44:30,669
is the woman who came to our school for teacher training.

552
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:33,568
So, she is our teacher.

553
00:44:33,568 --> 00:44:36,134
Then, what about the two of them?

554
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:38,355
The trainee teacher and

555
00:44:38,355 --> 00:44:40,897
the student…

556
00:45:17,245 --> 00:45:20,255
   

557
00:45:23,502 --> 00:45:27,840
 The line is busy. Please leave a message after… 

558
00:45:36,758 --> 00:45:37,955
Yes, this is Seo Gang Ho.

559
00:45:37,955 --> 00:45:39,696
Is patient Woo Min Jae still in the hospital?

560
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:43,182
Patient Woo Min Jae was discharged this afternoon. What's the matter?

561
00:45:43,182 --> 00:45:44,322
There's something I need to check.

562
00:45:44,322 --> 00:45:45,389
 Understood. 

563
00:45:45,389 --> 00:45:47,522
Have you looked into the relationship between those two people?

564
00:45:47,522 --> 00:45:48,922
I'm in the process of confirming it, but why do you ask?

565
00:45:48,922 --> 00:45:51,591
Because they are not relatives.

566
00:45:52,595 --> 00:45:54,748
Then, what are they?

567
00:45:54,748 --> 00:45:57,515
Is Detective Lee Min Hyeong with you now?

568
00:45:57,515 --> 00:45:59,248
 Didn't you see her at the hospital? 

569
00:45:59,248 --> 00:46:01,821
 She went out to check something on Cho Soo Kyeong and Woo Min Jae. 

570
00:46:01,821 --> 00:46:03,489
What's the relationship between the two of them?

571
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:04,625
For now, please tell me.

572
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:09,495
They say they met as student and teacher at school.

573
00:46:09,495 --> 00:46:12,182
And they tried to bug my room.

574
00:46:12,182 --> 00:46:15,689
They're probably communicating with each other somehow.

575
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,608
Yes, I understand.

576
00:46:21,922 --> 00:46:23,722
   

577
00:46:26,562 --> 00:46:29,526
What brings you here?

578
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:34,789
There are things to explain regarding victim support,

579
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:37,282
and I was also curious about Woo Min Jae's condition.

580
00:46:37,282 --> 00:46:39,615
Did you come alone?

581
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:44,702
That's good, then.

582
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:48,226
I also have something to tell you in private.

583
00:46:49,522 --> 00:46:51,528
Then, please come in.

584
00:47:03,361 --> 00:47:06,528
I'm really sorry…

585
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:09,789
About saying, I was Min Jae's relative.

586
00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:12,253
Let's hear the reason for that.

587
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:17,781
I'm really sorry for not telling you earlier,

588
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:19,928
but I have my reasons too—

589
00:47:19,928 --> 00:47:22,295
Where is Mr. Woo Min Jae?

590
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:24,922
He stepped out for a moment.

591
00:47:24,922 --> 00:47:28,755
We'll locate Mr. Woo Min Jae, so please let's go.

592
00:47:28,755 --> 00:47:30,124
To where?

593
00:47:30,124 --> 00:47:32,255
Under the circumstances of a witness's false testimony,

594
00:47:32,255 --> 00:47:34,755
additional investigation is necessary.

595
00:47:34,755 --> 00:47:36,289
I request your voluntary accompaniment.

596
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:38,555
Ah, just a moment.

597
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,455
Please just listen to what I have to say for a moment.

598
00:47:40,455 --> 00:47:43,200
- Get ready. 
 - Ah, I also…

599
00:47:45,755 --> 00:47:48,750
I had no choice either.

600
00:47:49,455 --> 00:47:51,952
What does that mean?

601
00:47:57,089 --> 00:48:00,478
There's a video.

602
00:48:06,568 --> 00:48:08,373
 Min Jae. 

603
00:48:08,373 --> 00:48:11,055
 No, Min Jae, don't do this. Okay? 

604
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:12,255
Min Jae is…

605
00:48:12,255 --> 00:48:13,589
 Let go! 

606
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:16,089
...someone I met during my training teaching last year.

607
00:48:16,089 --> 00:48:18,572
 Shall we stop now? 

608
00:48:18,572 --> 00:48:19,516
 Okay. 

609
00:48:19,516 --> 00:48:21,489
I was sexually assaulted.

610
00:48:21,489 --> 00:48:23,922
 So, it's okay if this video spreads. Is that it? 

611
00:48:23,922 --> 00:48:25,810
I kept being blackmailed with that video.

612
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:28,222
 I was wrong, Min Jae. Okay? 

613
00:48:28,222 --> 00:48:30,524
 Please, I won't do it again. 

614
00:48:30,524 --> 00:48:31,732
 Huh? 

615
00:48:31,732 --> 00:48:35,722
 If that video gets out, it's over for both of us. 

616
00:48:35,722 --> 00:48:37,574
 Let go! 

617
00:48:37,574 --> 00:48:38,838
 Let go! 

618
00:48:38,838 --> 00:48:41,551
 Ah, let me go! 

619
00:48:46,141 --> 00:48:50,722
You pinned it all on the delivery guy who just happened to arrive.

620
00:48:50,722 --> 00:48:52,889
If he said he was hurt because of me,

621
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:55,855
I thought it would all come out, including that video.

622
00:48:55,855 --> 00:48:58,989
I hated the idea of that video being exposed more than dying.

623
00:48:58,989 --> 00:49:02,789
So, you even gave a false statement that you were relatives?

624
00:49:03,922 --> 00:49:06,055
I'm facing a public service exam,

625
00:49:06,055 --> 00:49:10,039
if it becomes known that I was harmed by a student during my student teaching…

626
00:49:10,908 --> 00:49:14,708
No… it would be the end of me.

627
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,422
   

628
00:49:42,222 --> 00:49:43,830
 It was well-known. 

629
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:46,555
 No, I mean, to be more precise, 

630
00:49:46,555 --> 00:49:48,355
 everyone just hushed it up. 

631
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:52,689
 There was a rumor that Cho Soo Kyeong's family was quite powerful. 

632
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:54,555
 So, that Cho Soo Kyeong 

633
00:49:54,555 --> 00:49:57,955
 is a person who's only satisfied when she gets whatever she wants, 

634
00:49:57,955 --> 00:50:01,422
 and her family solves such issues. 

635
00:50:02,035 --> 00:50:04,763
 But at that moment, exactly, 

636
00:50:05,389 --> 00:50:07,750
 Min Jae got caught. 

637
00:50:27,128 --> 00:50:29,669
To the police station?

638
00:50:29,669 --> 00:50:31,611
Me?

639
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,755
No…

640
00:50:32,755 --> 00:50:34,589
I said I'm the victim.

641
00:50:34,589 --> 00:50:37,455
Yes, but you still have to go.

642
00:50:37,455 --> 00:50:41,389
We need to punish false statements and prepare an official report.

643
00:50:41,389 --> 00:50:45,759
You can also request an investigation for the part you just testified about.

644
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:49,522
I…

645
00:50:49,522 --> 00:50:52,022
I told you...

646
00:50:52,022 --> 00:50:54,289
that I'm the victim.

647
00:50:55,255 --> 00:50:57,463
I said it already.

648
00:50:57,463 --> 00:50:58,870
Okay?

649
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:01,589
I'm the victim!

650
00:51:06,868 --> 00:51:08,888
Are you crazy?

651
00:51:08,888 --> 00:51:10,389
How can you do this to the police?

652
00:51:10,389 --> 00:51:12,060
Then what?

653
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,869
She said to go to the police station.

654
00:51:16,368 --> 00:51:19,294
Because of you, really…

655
00:51:19,294 --> 00:51:21,240
What do you want to do now?

656
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,134
Huh?

657
00:51:48,027 --> 00:51:50,031
Take care of it.

658
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:51,322
Teacher…

659
00:51:51,322 --> 00:51:54,128
Since you started it, you finish it.

660
00:51:54,128 --> 00:51:55,589
When this woman wakes up,

661
00:51:55,589 --> 00:51:58,422
it's the end for you and me.

662
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:03,202
Hurry!

663
00:52:10,022 --> 00:52:11,922
Are you there?

664
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:17,922
Is there someone inside?

665
00:52:17,922 --> 00:52:21,081
Mr. Lee Min Hyeong, you're in there, right?

666
00:52:21,081 --> 00:52:22,789
Come on, quickly!

667
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:25,186
How…

668
00:52:26,761 --> 00:52:29,482
Snap out of it, Woo Min Jae!

669
00:52:29,482 --> 00:52:31,495
This isn't our first time.

670
00:52:31,495 --> 00:52:33,355
We've done this before.

671
00:52:33,355 --> 00:52:35,518
You can do it, right?

672
00:52:37,256 --> 00:52:38,355
 However, at that time, 

673
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:42,555
 there was someone who went around blabbering that they were involved. 

674
00:52:42,555 --> 00:52:46,735
 That person suddenly jumped off the roof of a building near the school. 

675
00:52:46,735 --> 00:52:49,714
 That person was not the type to do that. 

676
00:52:49,714 --> 00:52:53,389
 So, according to some rumors, 

677
00:52:53,389 --> 00:52:56,268
 Woo Min Jae and Cho Soo Kyeong 

678
00:52:56,268 --> 00:52:59,578
 lured the person to the rooftop... 

679
00:53:00,189 --> 00:53:03,138
 and then pushed him off. 

680
00:53:05,548 --> 00:53:07,521
It's the same this time.

681
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:09,181
We have to do it.

682
00:53:09,181 --> 00:53:13,617
If we're going to be together, you have to do it.

683
00:53:14,718 --> 00:53:15,689
Yes.

684
00:53:15,689 --> 00:53:17,622
It's nothing.

685
00:53:17,622 --> 00:53:21,701
Just like that day on the rooftop, just for a moment.

686
00:53:21,701 --> 00:53:24,500
You just need to give a little push.

687
00:53:30,695 --> 00:53:32,504
Hurry.

688
00:53:53,672 --> 00:53:56,360
   

689
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:06,860



690
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:12,756
♫  I can see it in your eyes  ♫

691
00:54:14,571 --> 00:54:16,022
 Lee Jin Seok was released, right? 

692
00:54:16,022 --> 00:54:18,308
 I need to catch that rat first. 

693
00:54:18,308 --> 00:54:20,222
 You found this in the corner of the balcony? 

694
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:24,231
 It seems they came to volunteer at the prison where my father was. 

695
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:27,862
 Hey, Director Cha. 

696
00:54:27,862 --> 00:54:29,363
 Oh, I met Detective Lee. 

697
00:54:29,363 --> 00:54:30,556
 Why that detective? 

698
00:54:30,556 --> 00:54:32,836
 Knowing that these two were prison mates, 

699
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:34,449
 she even came to your mother's hospital. 

700
00:54:34,449 --> 00:54:37,883
 She knew about the relationship between them? 

701
00:54:39,695 --> 00:54:41,675
 Lee Jin Seok! 

702
00:54:41,675 --> 00:54:43,322
 You seem flustered. 

703
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,148
 Because it's not the person you were expecting. 

704
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:46,908
 How long were you planning to deceive me? 

705
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:53,752
♫  I know you, I'm falling for you  ♫
