1
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:13,625
   

2
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:20,561
   

3
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,402
   

4
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:37,053
   

5
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:51,890



6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,090
   

7
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:16,336
Ms. Nam Hyo Joo!

8
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:23,374
Doctor.

9
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,507
What's the matter?

10
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,756
It's nothing. 
    

11
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:44,264
- Yes? 
  - Where are you? Aren't you taking care of a patient? 

12
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:47,272
 You said you have a surgery. 

13
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:50,542
Yes, I'm on my way.

14
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:26,584
What's the matter, miss?

15
00:06:36,594 --> 00:06:39,694
 The DNA of the culprit found under Nam Hyo Joo's fingernails, 

16
00:06:39,694 --> 00:06:42,675
 and the other DNA taken from the watch match. 

17
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:44,642
 Then, the cases of Hye Jin and Nam Hyo Joo… 

18
00:06:44,642 --> 00:06:46,354
 Have the same perpetrator. 

19
00:06:46,354 --> 00:06:48,896
Isn't he a doctor?

20
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:52,933
Doctors are supposed to save lives.

21
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:55,900
How could a doctor…

22
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,240
 ­  

23
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:20,620
   

24
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,999
You're with Ms. Hyo Joo, right?

25
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:59,708
Ah, what's the situation with Lee Joo Yeong's surgery?

26
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,354
 Yes, Director Han. 

27
00:08:01,354 --> 00:08:02,954
The surgery preparation is done.

28
00:08:02,954 --> 00:08:06,254
She's in operating room number 2. Yes.

29
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:13,575
What's going on, Director?

30
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:16,635
Why did you suddenly cancel the surgery?

31
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:21,598
No, why lie?

32
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:25,862
There are some reasons…

33
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:27,882
Anyway…

34
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,975
Cancel all the remaining surgeries.

35
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,701
Let's just call it a day as it is.

36
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:37,433
What's going on with Director Han?

37
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:59,648
Ms. Hyo Joo!

38
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,584
I'm sorry, I was too late.

39
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,692
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo.

40
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:15,987
Wait, without doing anything.

41
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:20,275
I'll be there shortly.

42
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:37,588
I know you must be shocked,

43
00:09:37,588 --> 00:09:40,220
but I'll listen to your statement first.

44
00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:43,495
It's an urgent situation right now.

45
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:57,942
Is something wrong?

46
00:09:57,942 --> 00:09:59,609
No, why do you ask?

47
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:01,052
Huh?

48
00:10:01,052 --> 00:10:04,075
All the surgeries were canceled today.

49
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:07,758
The director canceled them.

50
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:11,354
- The director did? 
 - Yes.

51
00:10:11,354 --> 00:10:13,754
Thanks to that, I get to rest.

52
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:39,000
 Hello. 

53
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,986
 - Hello. 
 - Hello. 

54
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:43,317
 - Welcome. 
 - Hello. 

55
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:45,842
 - Hello. 
 - Get up. 

56
00:10:45,842 --> 00:10:47,342
 You're here? 

57
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:49,375
 It seems you've come to pick up Hye Jin. 

58
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,242
 - So cool. 
 - I'm envious. 

59
00:10:52,242 --> 00:10:53,608
 I heard you two are getting married. 

60
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:54,775
 - Congratulations! 
 - Congratulations. 

61
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:56,775
 Thank you. 

62
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:00,542
 I saw Woo Jin on my way in. 

63
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:02,342
 - Woo Jin? 
 - Yes. 

64
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:04,429
 He said he was meeting someone and left right away. 

65
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:06,601
 Didn't you see him inside? 

66
00:11:07,713 --> 00:11:11,007
 Ah… Well… 

67
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:13,807
 She knew it all along. 

68
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,480
 Jeong Woo… 

69
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:23,382
 I'm sorry. I should have told you earlier. 

70
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:43,540
 It came to my mind during the surgery. 

71
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:47,464
Just when the anesthesia was taking effect.

72
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,612
Just like that day,

73
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:54,522
the two eyes that appeared above the mask.

74
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,942
It's this person, isn't it?

75
00:11:57,942 --> 00:11:59,514
We are investigating now.

76
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:01,975
Why did he do it?

77
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:03,670
Why?

78
00:12:04,461 --> 00:12:07,158
Why did he kill my father?

79
00:12:07,742 --> 00:12:10,442
Because he was a criminal?

80
00:12:10,442 --> 00:12:12,342
Because he was poor?

81
00:12:13,342 --> 00:12:16,608
Or because he looked easy to him?

82
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:22,111
What on earth did we do to deserve this?

83
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,408
Go to the hospital, secure Han Woo Jin's location, and prepare for arrest.

84
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:53,308
The DNA comparison results will be out soon.

85
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:55,331
I'll contact you as soon as the results are in.

86
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:57,376
Yes, I understand.

87
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:07,408
 Dr. Han Woo Jin was not registered on the list of attendees at the conference 

88
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:10,842
 in Singapore on March 24, 2016. 

89
00:13:13,981 --> 00:13:17,029
 You also didn't know about Jeong Woo's accident? 

90
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:21,300
 I was in Singapore for a conference that day. 

91
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:46,147
How much do you know so far?

92
00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:57,001
On the day of Yoon Hye Jin's death,

93
00:13:57,001 --> 00:14:00,108
you were officially in Singapore.

94
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:02,542
But when I checked,

95
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,910
you didn't attend the conference.

96
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:16,075
 Jeong Woo! Jeong Woo! 

97
00:14:16,075 --> 00:14:18,142
 - You woke up? 
 - Jeong Woo! 

98
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:20,157
 What about Hye Jin? 

99
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:24,208
 While checking out dresses… 

100
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,267
 Hye Jin must be worried. 

101
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,996
You seem to know everything.

102
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:51,817
Why... Why on earth would you do that?

103
00:15:54,048 --> 00:15:56,108
You're a doctor.

104
00:15:56,108 --> 00:15:59,880
How did you live your life, in order to become a doctor?

105
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,923
I know all that! Why on earth did you do it?

106
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:05,842
As someone who knows so well,

107
00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:07,942
why did you stop my surgery?

108
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:10,208
Woo Jin, you!

109
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,935
Is it because I'm not Cha Jeong Woo?

110
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:19,428
You can't possibly…

111
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:23,282
Hey, man!

112
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:28,142
Jeong Woo is Jeong Woo, and you're Han Woo Jin.

113
00:16:28,142 --> 00:16:30,973
Have you only looked at Jeong Woo all this time?

114
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:32,435
Why do you compare yourself with Jeong Woo?

115
00:16:32,435 --> 00:16:34,342
Hyeong!

116
00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:38,068
It wasn't me who compared myself with Jeong Woo, it was you guys.

117
00:16:38,068 --> 00:16:40,808
Both at school and in the hospital.

118
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:42,788
Jeong Woo's mother,

119
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:49,523
and even you did, too.

120
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:52,907
Isn't that right?

121
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:07,226
Hyeong,

122
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:11,592
I really need to perform surgeries.

123
00:17:13,587 --> 00:17:15,995
If I don't do the surgery,

124
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:21,048
I really am a useless person.

125
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:24,371
You know it.

126
00:17:25,148 --> 00:17:27,221
This guy.

127
00:17:27,221 --> 00:17:29,554
Hey, Woo Jin!

128
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,955
I'm sorry.

129
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:46,608
No, Director Han even did the design for me in the operation room.

130
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,694
Why is the surgery suddenly not possible?

131
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,162
Where did the doctor go?

132
00:17:51,162 --> 00:17:52,462
Didn't he go into another surgery?

133
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:54,142
No, that's definitely not it.

134
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:55,475
We will schedule it again.

135
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,042
Where is Director Han?

136
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,641
It was you, wasn't it? The one who stopped my surgery.

137
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:02,342
Can I really not undergo surgery?

138
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:04,175
That's not it. Please calm down.

139
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:05,808
I will reschedule it for you.

140
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:08,275
- First, calm down… 
  - Director! 

141
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,753
Jeong Woo.

142
00:18:24,318 --> 00:18:25,408
Hey, hey…

143
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:27,708
Hey, Jeong Woo!

144
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:34,142
   

145
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:36,008
Yes, Chief, do you have the results?

146
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:37,242
Yes, it's a match.

147
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,775
 The DNA from the paper cup and 

148
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:41,108
 the DNA under Nam Hyo Joo's fingernails match perfectly. 

149
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:44,175
Understood. Please send me the report.

150
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:47,475
   

151
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:53,836
The forensic results match. Arrest him immediately.

152
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:18,971
Where is Mr. Han Woo Jin?

153
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:20,142
What's the meaning of this?

154
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:22,194
Director Han…

155
00:19:24,881 --> 00:19:27,514
is not in the hospital.

156
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,925
 Han Woo Jin is not at the hospital. 

157
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:36,208
I've set up tracking on Han Woo Jin's car and phone.

158
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,255
We'll find him soon.

159
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:40,608
It seems Cha Jeong Woo followed Han Woo Jin.

160
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:41,742
Cha Jeong Woo did?

161
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:45,542
Now that he knows who the perpetrator is, he won't just let it be.

162
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:49,308
Inform me as soon as you know anything. I'll contact you.

163
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:03,708
 Hye Jin… 

164
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,608
 I keep thinking of her last moments. 

165
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:11,320
 You saw Hye Jin's crime scene photo in front of the police station that day. 

166
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:13,408
 Could it be because of that? 

167
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:16,274
 Do you think so, too? 

168
00:20:16,274 --> 00:20:18,568
 That I might have... 

169
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:20,194
 killed Hye Jin. 

170
00:20:20,194 --> 00:20:22,808
 Hey, make some sense, will you? 

171
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:24,308
 Jeong Woo, why would you? 

172
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:27,108
 What do you want to do when you find him? 

173
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:30,208
 You said everything changed when you met Hye Jin. 

174
00:20:30,975 --> 00:20:33,708
 If you meet that guy, 

175
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,708
 everything might change again. 

176
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,390
  ­ 

177
00:20:56,742 --> 00:20:58,875
Director.

178
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,475
What in the world happened?

179
00:21:02,475 --> 00:21:04,961
The police just barged in, looking for Director Han.

180
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:08,696
Director, is this related to patient Nam Hyo Joo?

181
00:21:08,696 --> 00:21:13,075
As you know, the police are currently investigating.

182
00:21:13,075 --> 00:21:14,620
Let's wait and see the results.

183
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,842
Don't tell me, Director Han…

184
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,408
- Manager Yang. 
 - Yes.

185
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:20,475
Please manage the hospital.

186
00:21:20,475 --> 00:21:24,100
Start by calling to cancel the scheduled appointments for tomorrow.

187
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,100
Yes, understood.

188
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:46,855
It was all Woo Jin's doing.

189
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:50,200
Nam Gi Taek's daughter,

190
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,945
Nam Gi Taek, and even Yoon Hye Jin.

191
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,508
About Yoon Hye Jin's case,

192
00:22:00,508 --> 00:22:02,908
there is something else I don't know, isn't there?

193
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:06,208
You always hoped

194
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,908
their marriage wouldn't work out.

195
00:22:10,008 --> 00:22:12,775
Anything to do with Jeong Woo,

196
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:15,175
you shared it all with Woo Jin.

197
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:17,675
So,

198
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:21,275
you think I might have told Woo Jin, and he did something

199
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:23,142
to that Yoon Hye Jin?

200
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:25,037
Seo Hui,

201
00:22:25,842 --> 00:22:28,442
I am asking if that is the case.

202
00:22:46,242 --> 00:22:50,108
   

203
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,042
 Sir, please calm down for now. 

204
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:18,001
 Next time you come to the hospital, I'll perform the surgery. 

205
00:23:18,575 --> 00:23:21,375
 Who asked you to do it? Huh? 

206
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,642
 They said Cha Jeong Woo is the best! 

207
00:23:23,642 --> 00:23:27,108
 So instead of a big hospital, I came here. 

208
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:30,108
 While being assaulted by her ex-boyfriend in the parking lot of the plastic surgery clinic, 

209
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:34,408
 he witnessed it on-site, rescued her, and performed emergency surgery. 

210
00:23:34,408 --> 00:23:36,675
 - Hyo Joo… 
 - This time, the man forced... 

211
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:41,587
 - Who is it? 
 - ...the discharged woman into a vehicle and fled. 

212
00:23:43,908 --> 00:23:46,734
 You remember Cheongsu Prison last year, right? 
   

213
00:23:46,734 --> 00:23:49,908
 Yes, but what brings you here? 

214
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:52,642
 I thought you might be a little upset because of Director Cha. 

215
00:23:52,642 --> 00:23:54,175
 I thought it might help you feel better. 

216
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:55,842
 Why? Huh? 

217
00:23:55,842 --> 00:23:58,542
 Did Cha Jeong Woo say he would perform the surgery now? 

218
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:01,708
 Or if you're going to say you'll do it again, 

219
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:04,775
 just get out right now! 

220
00:24:05,642 --> 00:24:07,246
 What? 

221
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:14,708
 What are you doing right now? Huh? 

222
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,808
 What are you doing? 

223
00:24:45,142 --> 00:24:47,808
 It's all because of Cha Jeong Woo. 

224
00:24:48,727 --> 00:24:50,902
 Hye Jin, too. 

225
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:24,662
Jeong Woo…

226
00:25:24,662 --> 00:25:25,942
It was all an accident.

227
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:29,308
I couldn't help it, either. I said it was an accident, you punk.

228
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,375
Crazy bastard!

229
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,842
How could you…

230
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,748
Han Woo Jin, how could you? You bastard!

231
00:25:45,748 --> 00:25:47,848
Your mother…

232
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:52,075
I went there because of your mother.

233
00:25:52,075 --> 00:25:53,890
What are you talking about?

234
00:25:54,742 --> 00:25:57,108
Why are you asking me that?

235
00:25:57,108 --> 00:25:58,308
What?

236
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:01,342
Your mother, you fool!

237
00:26:03,641 --> 00:26:06,564
 I really hate that Yoon Hye Jin. 

238
00:26:08,168 --> 00:26:10,494
 I won't sit and watch it. 

239
00:26:10,494 --> 00:26:14,294
 I'm going to stop her from being with Jeong Woo. 

240
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:28,389
Yeah.

241
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:30,761
This is Cha Jeong Woo.

242
00:26:32,442 --> 00:26:34,475
I was curious

243
00:26:34,475 --> 00:26:36,842
whether you were really unaware,

244
00:26:36,842 --> 00:26:39,975
or were just pretending not to know.

245
00:26:42,608 --> 00:26:46,542
Do you really not know what your mother

246
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:48,775
was trying to do to Hye Jin?

247
00:26:52,342 --> 00:26:57,348
The real reason your mother tampered with and hid your accident records, man.

248
00:26:57,348 --> 00:26:59,370
The real reason...

249
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:03,375
you blocked your own memory.

250
00:27:17,175 --> 00:27:19,618
It's all because of you.

251
00:27:22,175 --> 00:27:25,708
Hye Jin died and I became a murderer,

252
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:29,778
all because of you.

253
00:28:22,142 --> 00:28:24,153
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo,

254
00:28:25,242 --> 00:28:27,372
are you okay?

255
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:30,755
What about Han Woo Jin?

256
00:28:30,755 --> 00:28:33,021
I'll contact you.

257
00:28:37,742 --> 00:28:39,809
Don't go!

258
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:45,342
Don't think about putting yourself in danger.

259
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:48,409
Are you telling me to just stay put again?

260
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:50,620
Like seven years ago?

261
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:07,042
   

262
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:09,175
 Jeong Woo, where are you? 

263
00:29:09,175 --> 00:29:11,628
What happened that day?

264
00:29:11,628 --> 00:29:15,709
Why is Han Woo Jin talking about you?

265
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:18,075
 Did you meet Woo Jin? 

266
00:29:18,075 --> 00:29:20,442
Tell me everything you know.

267
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,309
 I don't know what's going on right now, but… 

268
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:24,509
You know it all, so please speak up now.

269
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:26,442
 I'll talk. 

270
00:29:26,442 --> 00:29:28,430
But, Jeong Woo,

271
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:30,609
Woo Jin is dangerous now.

272
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:32,500
 What are you talking about? 

273
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:35,275
He's in a serious cognitive dissonance state.

274
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:39,075
You never know what he might say or do to rationalize himself.

275
00:29:39,075 --> 00:29:40,409
 Just come here first. 

276
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:43,409
 Um… I'll tell you everything. So just come and talk. Okay? 

277
00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:44,842
I'll call you.

278
00:29:44,842 --> 00:29:46,721
Jeong Woo!

279
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,475
What about these photos?

280
00:30:16,475 --> 00:30:19,075
Hye Jin's last moments…

281
00:30:19,075 --> 00:30:21,001
I've never seen it properly.

282
00:30:21,001 --> 00:30:25,142
- Jeong Woo. 
 - I thought it was inevitable.

283
00:30:25,142 --> 00:30:29,309
Something that I could never change no matter what I do.

284
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:32,696
So, I never thought of reconsidering anything.

285
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:39,049
There was no movement when she was stabbed.

286
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:41,200
After her death,

287
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:44,875
she must have been stabbed to make it look like a robbery.

288
00:30:45,841 --> 00:30:47,872
Due to a blow to the head…

289
00:30:47,872 --> 00:30:49,294
The head injury wasn't a hemorrhage,

290
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:50,977
or severe enough

291
00:30:50,977 --> 00:30:54,656
to cause a complete loss of consciousness.

292
00:30:55,342 --> 00:30:57,275
What do you mean?

293
00:30:57,275 --> 00:31:02,655
Between when her head was hit and when she was stabbed,

294
00:31:02,655 --> 00:31:05,275
there was another situation.

295
00:31:05,275 --> 00:31:07,429
 It was an accident, you punk! 

296
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:10,162
It means it was not an accidental death.

297
00:31:19,635 --> 00:31:21,369
Look at this.

298
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:28,142
Han Woo Jin's car is headed toward the airport. 
    

299
00:31:28,142 --> 00:31:29,842
Looks like he might be attempting to leave the country.

300
00:31:29,842 --> 00:31:31,842
 Leaving the country? 

301
00:31:31,842 --> 00:31:35,535
 - Keep tracking it for now.  
 - All right.

302
00:31:35,535 --> 00:31:38,329
He's leaving the country?

303
00:31:40,742 --> 00:31:42,575
   

304
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:49,209
Lawyer Park, I am currently working…

305
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:51,009
 Jeong Woo came here. 

306
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:54,242
Is there anything about Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's cause of death that wasn't revealed before?

307
00:31:54,242 --> 00:31:55,375
What do you mean?

308
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:57,609
He left after looking at the photos of Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's murder scene.

309
00:31:57,609 --> 00:31:59,909
Especially one particular photo.

310
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:03,542
 Something looked quite unusual… 

311
00:33:00,242 --> 00:33:02,909
There seems to be something faintly visible under this bloodstain.

312
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:06,209
It appears similarly on the opposite side.

313
00:33:08,948 --> 00:33:10,298
This side is a bit more noticeable.

314
00:33:10,298 --> 00:33:12,642
Could this be

315
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:15,575
traces of pressure?

316
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:19,775
It seems she had no consciousness at the time of the stabbing.

317
00:33:19,775 --> 00:33:23,709
The occipital trauma wasn't fatal enough.

318
00:33:24,942 --> 00:33:25,942
After the occipital trauma,

319
00:33:25,942 --> 00:33:29,675
someone killed her by strangulation and then stabbed her with a knife?

320
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:32,709
I am wondering about that possibility.

321
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,575
If there was carotid artery damage, as well as stab wounds all over,

322
00:33:38,575 --> 00:33:41,541
it's not impossible that strangulation was overlooked.

323
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:45,609
The perpetrator might have intentionally stabbed around the carotid artery for that very reason.

324
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:48,709
No fingerprints were found? It's unlikely they didn't collect them, right?

325
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:52,942
There were some issues with the investigation process at the time.

326
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,453
It's overkill.

327
00:33:58,101 --> 00:34:00,334
If it's overkill,

328
00:34:01,702 --> 00:34:04,309
the person the perpetrator really wanted to kill…

329
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:06,375
Must be someone else.

330
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:11,154
His anger towards that person was transferred to the victim.

331
00:34:13,695 --> 00:34:16,175
 Cha Jeong Woo, that bastard! 

332
00:34:16,175 --> 00:34:20,375
 How dare you call yourself a friend while disregarding others? 

333
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:23,009
Another person…

334
00:34:23,009 --> 00:34:26,642
 Ah, Jeong Woo's mother, Ms. Yoon Seo Hee. 

335
00:34:32,642 --> 00:34:36,735
Han Woo Jin, you are arrested for the attempted murder of Nam Hyo Joo…

336
00:34:36,735 --> 00:34:39,342
Huh? I am the designated driver.

337
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:43,013
I went to the location after getting a call… 
    

338
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,756
Well…

339
00:34:55,342 --> 00:34:58,415
   

340
00:34:58,415 --> 00:35:00,842
 Han Woo Jin hasn't gone to the airport, right? 

341
00:35:00,842 --> 00:35:01,875
How did you know?

342
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:04,275
 He diverted attention by sending a substitute driver. 

343
00:35:04,275 --> 00:35:06,609
Diverting attention on purpose means

344
00:35:06,609 --> 00:35:08,240
there is a specific target in mind.

345
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,375
Where?

346
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:11,809
 Cha Jeong Woo and Cha Jeong Woo's mother. 

347
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,542
What? Dr. Yoon Seo Hui?

348
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:17,475
- Track the locations of them both right now! 
  - Okay. 

349
00:35:17,475 --> 00:35:21,342
   

350
00:35:21,342 --> 00:35:24,509
 What happened that day? 

351
00:35:24,509 --> 00:35:28,719
 Why is Han Woo Jin talking about you? 

352
00:35:37,662 --> 00:35:39,468
 I'm so anxious… 

353
00:35:39,468 --> 00:35:42,935
 I'm worried he might find Woo Jin and cause trouble. 

354
00:35:48,141 --> 00:35:49,342
Oh!

355
00:35:49,342 --> 00:35:51,642
Jeong Woo, where are you? Are you okay?

356
00:35:51,642 --> 00:35:53,142
Where are you? Are you at the hospital?

357
00:35:53,142 --> 00:35:56,309
 I'm just heading out now. What about you? 

358
00:35:56,309 --> 00:35:58,722
Woo Jin will go there.

359
00:35:58,722 --> 00:35:59,875
What?

360
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:02,809
I'm on my way now, so please go inside the hospital for now.

361
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:06,047
Don't leave until I get there.

362
00:36:07,908 --> 00:36:10,342
 Hello? 

363
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:12,195
 Mother. 

364
00:36:29,342 --> 00:36:31,244
 Jeong Woo, 

365
00:36:31,244 --> 00:36:34,042
 I will take your mother with me. 

366
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,875
 Come to the hospital. 

367
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:47,642
   

368
00:36:47,642 --> 00:36:49,142
 Don't go! 

369
00:36:49,142 --> 00:36:52,409
 Don't think about putting yourself in danger. 

370
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,810
   

371
00:37:45,502 --> 00:37:47,498
Woo Jin.

372
00:37:49,489 --> 00:37:53,609
You don't care about who caused Hye Jin's death, right?

373
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:56,642
All that mattered was for her to disappear forever from Jeong Woo's side.

374
00:37:57,342 --> 00:37:59,175
Woo Jin…

375
00:37:59,175 --> 00:38:02,709
But what were you planning to do by hiring those people?

376
00:38:02,709 --> 00:38:05,149
Hiring people?

377
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,375
It seems like there's some misunderstanding.

378
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:09,219
Misunderstanding?

379
00:38:10,642 --> 00:38:12,516
Then, what did I see?

380
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:15,349
What exactly do you think you saw?

381
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:21,175
You! Is that what you told Jeong Woo?

382
00:38:29,242 --> 00:38:31,942
But why did you keep me by Jeong Woo's side?

383
00:38:32,695 --> 00:38:35,295
Am I just a souvenir?

384
00:38:36,742 --> 00:38:40,209
Just to showcase the superiority of Cha Jeong Woo and you?

385
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:43,142
Like a living souvenir?

386
00:38:43,142 --> 00:38:45,176
What do you mean by that?

387
00:38:45,176 --> 00:38:47,709
Why did you…

388
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:50,975
To me, you were more like a son than Jeong Woo.

389
00:38:50,975 --> 00:38:54,837
Smart like Jeong Woo, diligent like Jeong Woo.

390
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:01,575
But, unlike Jeong Woo,

391
00:39:01,575 --> 00:39:05,472
you were affable and listened to me well.

392
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,482
Woo Jin.

393
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:15,595
Woo Jin! Woo Jin! Stop calling my name!

394
00:39:15,595 --> 00:39:18,929
What's the point of calling me, when in your heart, there is only Jeong Woo?

395
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:23,262
First, let's talk calmly.

396
00:39:26,075 --> 00:39:28,442
It's all because of you.

397
00:39:29,509 --> 00:39:31,975
The reason Jeong Woo grew distant from you

398
00:39:31,975 --> 00:39:34,471
and the reason I ended up like this,

399
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:39,319
it's all because of you.

400
00:40:07,275 --> 00:40:09,840
Both you and Cha Jeong Woo,

401
00:40:10,495 --> 00:40:13,628
are just as human as I am.

402
00:40:16,242 --> 00:40:18,742
I will show you.

403
00:40:30,175 --> 00:40:33,309
   

404
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:34,675
 We located Cha Jeong Woo's car. 

405
00:40:34,675 --> 00:40:37,309
 It's near KSH Cosmetic Surgery. 

406
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:30,202
Where is my mother?

407
00:41:30,975 --> 00:41:33,709
What are you more curious about?

408
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:35,601
Mother?

409
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:38,877
Hye Jin?

410
00:41:40,275 --> 00:41:42,298
Speak.

411
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,784
Where is she?

412
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:53,101
Do you also not care about how Hye Jin died?

413
00:41:53,101 --> 00:41:56,535
Or is it more important to find out if you mother is dead?

414
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:00,109
You also know

415
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:03,520
what your mom was capable of doing to Hye Jin.

416
00:42:05,262 --> 00:42:07,242
What the heck did you do, you beast?

417
00:42:07,242 --> 00:42:08,542
Where is my mother?

418
00:42:08,542 --> 00:42:11,415
That's not the correct order!

419
00:42:11,415 --> 00:42:14,315
Hye Jin comes first.

420
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:17,875
Don't even mention that name.

421
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:20,095
How dare you!

422
00:42:20,095 --> 00:42:22,179
I went to save Hye Jin that day.

423
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:23,609
Do you expect me to believe that nonsense?

424
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:25,836
You know from the pictures.

425
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:28,675
Your mother had someone tail Hye Jin.

426
00:42:28,675 --> 00:42:32,709
Hye Jin is dead not because of me, but because of your mom, you rat!

427
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:34,575
You killed her with your own hands!

428
00:42:34,575 --> 00:42:36,642
With those hands that should have saved lives.

429
00:42:36,642 --> 00:42:39,163
The person I loved…

430
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:47,142
I couldn't let her be brutally killed by strangers, could I?

431
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,616
Your mother

432
00:42:49,616 --> 00:42:52,860
was determined to get rid of Hye Jin.

433
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,857
   

434
00:43:48,942 --> 00:43:51,130
 It's my problem. I'll take care of it. 

435
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,975
 Hye Jin, please believe me. Please! 

436
00:43:54,975 --> 00:43:56,842
 I'm trying to help you, Hye Jin. 

437
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,098
 It's dangerous for you to be here. You need to go somewhere else. 

438
00:43:59,098 --> 00:44:00,675
 Why don't you believe me? 

439
00:44:00,675 --> 00:44:02,575
 I have to tell Jeong Woo first. 

440
00:44:02,575 --> 00:44:03,644
 - Hye Jin! 
 - Let go. 

441
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:05,275
 What do you think Jeong Woo can do right now? 

442
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:07,009
 Jeong Woo can't do anything, right? Please! 

443
00:44:07,009 --> 00:44:08,842
 No, Woo Jin, let this go. 

444
00:44:08,842 --> 00:44:11,642
 - Let go, Woo Jin! 
 - Hye Jin, please! 

445
00:44:22,488 --> 00:44:25,421
 Hye-Hye-Hye Jin… 

446
00:45:24,642 --> 00:45:27,594
 Oh, Hye Jin, sorry. I'm just heading out. 

447
00:45:27,594 --> 00:45:29,535
 Jeong Woo… 

448
00:45:29,535 --> 00:45:32,402
 What's wrong? Is something wrong? 

449
00:45:33,542 --> 00:45:35,875
 Hello? Hye Jin? 

450
00:45:41,275 --> 00:45:43,842
 I'm sorry… 

451
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:47,209
 I should have told you sooner… 

452
00:45:49,775 --> 00:45:52,755
 What are you talking about? 

453
00:45:52,755 --> 00:45:54,884
 What's wrong? 

454
00:46:05,862 --> 00:46:08,579
It was really an accident that day.

455
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:14,542
I couldn't help it either, okay?

456
00:46:32,242 --> 00:46:35,975
Jeong Woo, just a second! Jeong Woo!

457
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:15,329
What to do?

458
00:47:15,856 --> 00:47:18,675
Whether what I'm saying is nonsense or not,

459
00:47:18,675 --> 00:47:21,604
you can't even ask your mom.

460
00:47:56,542 --> 00:47:58,675
Cha Jeong Woo and Han Woo Jin are both in the plastic surgery clinic.

461
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:01,719
Request support now and contact 119.

462
00:48:43,508 --> 00:48:45,656
 Hye Jin! 

463
00:48:52,082 --> 00:48:55,375
 Hye Jin! Hye Jin! 

464
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:57,503
 Hye Jin! 

465
00:48:57,503 --> 00:48:59,636
 Hye Jin! 

466
00:49:00,748 --> 00:49:04,042
 Hye Jin! Hye Jin! 

467
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:06,242
 Hye Jin… 

468
00:49:31,075 --> 00:49:33,109
 Who are you? 

469
00:49:50,915 --> 00:49:53,048
 Who are you? 

470
00:50:04,955 --> 00:50:07,088
 Han Woo Jin? 

471
00:50:12,742 --> 00:50:15,842
Will you pretend not to know and just forget this time, too?

472
00:50:16,521 --> 00:50:20,034
You've always lived turning a blind eye.

473
00:50:23,315 --> 00:50:25,188
Haven't you?

474
00:50:26,241 --> 00:50:29,908
Are you different from that classless woman?

475
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:34,595
Shut up!

476
00:50:38,728 --> 00:50:42,175
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

477
00:50:42,175 --> 00:50:45,875
I got rid of that trashy woman

478
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:48,475
clinging to you, didn't I?

479
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:55,642
Jeong Woo,

480
00:50:56,575 --> 00:50:59,618
you should take off the mask now, too.

481
00:51:01,209 --> 00:51:05,161
You're no different from me, right?

482
00:51:38,768 --> 00:51:40,568
Jeong Woo,

483
00:51:42,962 --> 00:51:45,302
let's end this now.

484
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:51,116
End it with your own hands, you bastard!

485
00:51:51,116 --> 00:51:53,243
No!

486
00:52:29,763 --> 00:52:32,676
   

487
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:48,970



488
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,775
 Compression marks were found on the victim's neck. 

489
00:52:52,775 --> 00:52:53,842
 I didn't know about it. 

490
00:52:53,842 --> 00:52:56,709
 But you must have compared them with Lee Jin Seok's fingerprints. 

491
00:52:56,709 --> 00:53:00,044
 I submit the appraisal report about the fingerprints found 

492
00:53:00,044 --> 00:53:02,775
 on the victim's neck at the time, which match Han Woo Jin's fingerprints. 

493
00:53:02,775 --> 00:53:05,275
 I'm really sorry for being seven years late. 

494
00:53:05,275 --> 00:53:08,575
 I felt it was because of my mean heart that Hye Jin ended up like that. 

495
00:53:08,575 --> 00:53:12,242
 I had hoped for both Jeong Woo and I to quickly escape from her death. 

496
00:53:12,242 --> 00:53:13,717
 I was ignorant, 
   

497
00:53:13,717 --> 00:53:17,117
 as a doctor and as a mother.
