1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,630
   

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,580
   

3
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,480
   

4
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,970
   

5
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:51,890



6
00:00:55,533 --> 00:01:02,133
   

7
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,667
 What is beauty? 

8
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:15,833
 Its definition has continually changed over time. 

9
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,700
 The traditional beauty in our country 

10
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,500
 required a broad forehead,
slender eyes, and a small mouth. 

11
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,800
 However, as Westernization progressed, 

12
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,733
 large eyes, a high nose, distinct facial features, 

13
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:32,367
 and a sensual silhouette became the sought-after features for beauty. 

14
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:36,933
 Moving past the 80s, which favored round and prominent double eyelids and lovely faces, 

15
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,633
 in the 2000s, 

16
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:44,133
 clear, deer-like eyes and a V-line's innocent looks were the trend. 

17
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:45,867
 So, 

18
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:49,400
 what is today's beauty? 

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,467
 It is diversity. 

20
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:54,633
 Not uniform beauty standards, 

21
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:58,633
 but pursuing one's own aesthetic standards. 

22
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:04,833
 We now live in an era where one can choose beauty through plastic surgery. 

23
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,600
 According to one's own standards and personality, 

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,933
 you can now create your own new version of beauty. 

25
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:19,533
 Without being tied to someone else's standards, 

26
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:23,800
 your natural beauty can be further nurtured. 

27
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,100
 KSH Cosmetic Surgery 

28
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,733
 will provide you with the highest level of plastic surgery services. 

29
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,200
With this philosophy,

30
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,400
KSH Cosmetic Surgery, which has been leading the new standards of beauty,

31
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,100
moves beyond Korea to pursue global beauty.

32
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,533
With Senianan, a global resort company, providing utmost convenience

33
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:56,900
and the fantastic collaboration of KSH Cosmetic Surgery's high-quality medical skills,

34
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,900
it's none other than

35
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,933
Bintan Beauty Center, ladies and gentlemen.

36
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:04,867
   

37
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:09,067
It has truly made its mark in K Cosmetic's overseas expansion.

38
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:12,400
Then, the doctor in charge of local treatments is...

39
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,500
Could he be that person?

40
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:18,533
Yes, that's correct.

41
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:21,067
The ace of our hospital,

42
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,600
Director Cha Jeong Woo.

43
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:38,233
 Kim Yoon Bin, 30-year-old female patient, 

44
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,067
 an actress by profession. 

45
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:41,767
 Due to a newly selected advertisement, 

46
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:45,136
 she desires surgery, from breast augmentation to eyes, nose, and even facial contouring. 

47
00:03:45,136 --> 00:03:46,900
   
 Since the shooting schedule is already set,  

48
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,433
 a quick recovery is needed. 

49
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:51,467
 It's possible, right? Director Cha? 

50
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:54,233
We're beginning the surgery.

51
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,467
   

52
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,900
Scalpel.

53
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:13,000
   

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,700
The 300cc H-type implant has been confirmed.

55
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,733
Let me examine the shape.

56
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,900
It's done. I'll close.

57
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,433
Cut.

58
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,867
- Good work. 
 - Good work.

59
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:31,133
Good job.

60
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:43,333
   

61
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:47,933
You've become perfect now.

62
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,867
 A beauty that outshines actors, who is a suave talker; 

63
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,733
 a man dressed in designer clothes for high-end clubs 

64
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:21,267
 is the perfect target. 

65
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:29,533
The previous hospital sent a written confirmation…

66
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:31,900
 By feigning romantic relationships, 

67
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,800
 the amount scammed from 5 male victims under the pretense of borrowing money alone 

68
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,467
 is a whopping 450 million ($450k). 

69
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:41,167
Target secured.

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,767
Still looking fabulous!

71
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,500
We've met before.

72
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:01,267
You don't remember?

73
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,267
This.

74
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:09,433
You touched it properly, right?

75
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:18,833
Okay, found it.

76
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:24,733
She has gone under construction for her face since last year.

77
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:27,300
 That's why she's a plastic surgery beauty swindler. 

78
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,400
Since she's a woman with a temper, don't provoke her first,

79
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,167
Just secure the on-site condition and the position for her to be taken away.

80
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:34,200
Who doesn't have a temper?

81
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,333
Just come over quickly.

82
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:39,900
I'm feeling anxious again.

83
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,267
Hey, baby.

84
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:44,633
How did you come alone?

85
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:47,367
Wow! You're a rare natural beauty these days.

86
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:50,600
I'm not interested. Could you please go away?

87
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:56,167
I didn't touch this, did I?

88
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,467
When did you get your cheekbones done?

89
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,500
I got them shaved a few months ago. Why?

90
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,633
You should visit the hospital where you had the surgery. It seems like the pain will be severe.

91
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:09,967
How did you know?

92
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,767
You should consult with the surgeon.

93
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:18,000
When someone is speaking, you should respond while looking into their eyes. Right?

94
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,333
Where are you going like that?

95
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,667
Once I'm interested, it's hard to turn off my feelings.

96
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:25,233
I said move out of the way.

97
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:35,200
Park Mi Soon!

98
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,633
Hospital! Hospital!

99
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,933
I'm a patient.

100
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:42,333
Let's go to the station and talk.

101
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:46,400
Huh? That doctor! That doctor told me to go to the hospital right away.

102
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,900
Excuse me, Doctor!

103
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,600
Can you please tell them that I'm a patient?

104
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,533
Didn't you say my cheekbones were messed up?

105
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,500
Excuse me! Wait! Hey! Hey!

106
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,000
Excuse me, Doctor!

107
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,867
Hey! You!

108
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:01,167
Detective Oppa* (older brother/boyfriend),

109
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:04,267
could I go to that doctor, and get a quick consultation?

110
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:06,667
When he touched my face,

111
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,667
he knew right away that my bone had come off.

112
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,300
He totally has x-ray vision!

113
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,533
Let's go quietly,

114
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,733
or should I adjust your jaw for you?

115
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:17,533
Excuse me!

116
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,433
It hurts!

117
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:22,733
- I'll wait at the station. 
 - Okay.

118
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:25,033
See you later.

119
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:26,933
I've confirmed with the victim who reported it.

120
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,100
They said it was Park Mi Soon.

121
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,133
What about the other victims? Did you contact them?

122
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:32,033
What can we do at this hour?

123
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:35,300
Go in and list all the victims.

124
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:38,500
What happened?

125
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:43,300
No, I wanted to catch her elegantly today as well.

126
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,700
 Let's just go, Miss Park Mi Soon. 

127
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,833
 My legs hurt. 

128
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:50,633
But what should I have done?

129
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,400
Park Mi Soon wasn't cooperating.

130
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,100
Should I have played baseball?

131
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,933
It was a perfect throw.

132
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,967
 I debuted this skirt today. 

133
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:19,833
You know what happens after.

134
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:33,300
There was pushing and pulling.

135
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,233
We bickered a bit.

136
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,033
 Ugh, hey! 

137
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:50,533
 Ouch, my jaw! My jaw is dislocated! 

138
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:53,700
 My jaw's really dislocated! 

139
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,633
But it's not because of me that her jaw was dislocated.

140
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:57,570
It's really not.

141
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:00,967
Why are you using the pain relief spray like perfume…

142
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:02,500
And if you are dressed

143
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,300
like you're going somewhere nice, please have a personality to match.

144
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,333
Dressed like this?

145
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,667
Put it back.

146
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:20,267
And you should have come quickly.

147
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:51,133
   

148
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:53,533
   
   

149
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:55,150
Gosh.

150
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,633
She says she doesn't want to go out of the house

151
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,867
because she is painting something.

152
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:03,560
I think it's because of the scar.

153
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:09,467
While showering, hot water suddenly came out and she got a little scalded.

154
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:12,167
You were scalded while showering?

155
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,400
But your hands are fine.

156
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,867
If the hot water that could cause a second-degree burn touched your face,

157
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:34,633
your hands would have reacted first.

158
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:40,533
So, and what?

159
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:43,367
Is the surgery possible or not?

160
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:45,933
This is a specialized cosmetic surgery hospital for beauty.

161
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,467
We do not do reconstructive surgery.

162
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,167
What?

163
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:52,867
Hey, Hyo Joo!

164
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:55,100
Hey, Kang Hyo Joo!

165
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,900
What kind of hospital is this?!

166
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,067
- Jeez! 
 - Sir.

167
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:00,100
Hey!

168
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,433
If you're a doctor, is it okay to disregard people like this?

169
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:03,800
I'm sorry.

170
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,133
I should have informed you when you registered.

171
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:09,033
To drive away someone who came for treatment because they are feeling ill…

172
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:12,033
What kind of hospital is this?

173
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:13,933
- Oh dear, sir. 
 - What is it?

174
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:16,300
Are you going to damage property?

175
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,367
That would put you in a very difficult position.

176
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:22,200
We'll file a report, undergo an investigation, and enter a compensation claim. Right?

177
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,300
Would you be okay with that?

178
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,567
I'm not sure what has made you so angry.

179
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,767
- If you tell me— 
 - Hey!

180
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:35,933
You guys ignore a sick person

181
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:39,333
and just take money while massaging breasts. Is that what a doctor does?

182
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,733
Do you think anyone wearing a gown is a doctor?

183
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,833
If we weren't going to take the money,

184
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:47,933
we wouldn't be smiling at rowdy customers, either.

185
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,300
Go back safely.

186
00:13:58,133 --> 00:13:59,133
Are you okay?

187
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:01,867
Maybe I shouldn't have made an appointment for him.

188
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:05,033
Honestly, it's not a surgery that our hospital should handle.

189
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:06,933
What kind of consultation was it?

190
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,433
It's for burn reconstruction.

191
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:09,767
He asked Director Cha for that?

192
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:13,733
They pleaded so much just to get a consultation once.

193
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:16,633
Please do better patient filtering.

194
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,700
Reconstructive surgery is not our field of treatment.

195
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,633
Of course.

196
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:28,067
If there are any new consultations coming up, don't give them to Director Cha, got it?

197
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,767
Don't schedule any. The director has to prepare for departure.

198
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:32,533
Let's help him out. Okay?

199
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:36,300
Director Cha is really leaving.

200
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,500
However, are you okay?

201
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,667
Originally, you were the one who prepared the Bintan partner doctor.

202
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:44,333
What are you talking about? It's good for me.

203
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:48,833
Isn't Professor Cha going to suffer abroad on my behalf?

204
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:54,267
I'll just establish myself as the ace doctor of these K-girls.

205
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:56,600
Cheer up and go buy a cup of coffee.

206
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,600
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

207
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:16,767
We came after receiving a report.

208
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:17,933
Where is Oh Ji Eun?

209
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,167
What's the matter?

210
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,400
What is this?

211
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,533
This is a surgical accident, right?

212
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:25,867
Accident? It seems there might be some misunderstanding.

213
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:27,700
I asked, where is Oh Ji Eun?

214
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,967
Yes, she's currently in surgery, but what's the issue?

215
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:30,967
Surgery?

216
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:32,400
Excuse me!

217
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,300
Just a moment.

218
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,633
   

219
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:40,467
Starting Oh Ji Eun's facial contouring surgery.

220
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:44,100
Please insert the army retractor number 15.

221
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,367
 Oh Ji Eun! 

222
00:15:57,933 --> 00:16:00,033
Ji Eun!

223
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,933
Please check the surgery consent form here.

224
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:04,967
Oh Ji Eun is currently undergoing surgery.

225
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:08,000
It seems there was a problem during the surgery. Did you check it properly?

226
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,100
Of course.

227
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,300
The patient signed it herself, and we proceeded according to the procedure.

228
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,133
It seems like the guardian might be under some kind of misunderstanding now.

229
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:16,167
No, this surgery can't go on. Stop it right now.

230
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:19,633
Ji Eun!

231
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:21,367
What are you doing?  Why didn't you set the retractor?

232
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:23,633
It seems like the patient's guardian is outside.

233
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:25,833
Shall we find out what's going on?

234
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:26,833
Why?

235
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:31,033
Let's see why the guardian is acting like that, whether to start or to stop after hearing her.

236
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,733
The patient is an adult and has completed the surgical consent.

237
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:37,567
Delaying the surgery while under anesthesia won't benefit the patient, either.

238
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:39,267
Let's proceed according to the procedure.

239
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:42,567
If Director Cha says so, that's what we'll do.

240
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:44,400
Saw.

241
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,733
I will begin the incision.

242
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:57,933
Suction.

243
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:05,700
What? Making a halt request while the daughter is having surgery?

244
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,733
What's the reason?

245
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,500
What?

246
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:16,967
The surgery is over.

247
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:19,500
She will be moved to the ward soon.

248
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:25,467
This…

249
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:27,967
This is the diagnosis form for our child's depression and anxiety.

250
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:29,733
Without properly checking,

251
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:33,500
isn't this pushing a neurotic patient with poor judgment to undergo cosmetic surgery?

252
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,100
There is no obligation to check the psychiatric diagnosis of a patient who'll receive surgery.

253
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,867
Do you know the reason why our child

254
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:43,000
wanted to do cosmetic surgery?

255
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,533
Should I know that?

256
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,533
You're a doctor, after all.

257
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:52,633
As a doctor, you should ensure that the patient can make the right choice.

258
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:54,900
Whether it was the right choice or not,

259
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,700
let's talk after seeing the results.

260
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,867
There wasn't a problem with the surgical procedure or the process, was there?

261
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:02,133
Open the surgical video.

262
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,067
En garde!  (On your guard) 

263
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:19,433
Êtes prêts?  (Are you ready?) 

264
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,333
Allez!  (Let's go!) 

265
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:30,267
En garde!

266
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:31,633
Êtes prêts?

267
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:33,433
Allez!

268
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,167
Halt!

269
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,600
En garde!

270
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,400
Êtes prêts?

271
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,167
Allez!

272
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,910
Time!

273
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,367
All right, you're good!

274
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:02,800
Congratulations.

275
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,100
Since you won, you should happily buy the drinks.

276
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:11,300
Just practice more and win, then I'll buy you drinks.

277
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,200
Even I would struggle at his level.

278
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,500
Don't think about winning, just accept it.

279
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,900
What are you talking about?

280
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,467
He said he'd buy drinks.

281
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:23,233
I'm going to practice all night, so don't stop me.

282
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:25,367
Come in quickly. Let's go again.

283
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,233
   

284
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:10,333
No, it's just that.

285
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,567
It was a misunderstanding that caused the mishap.

286
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:15,733
Yes, hello? Mr. Reporter?

287
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,100
Oh, I really… truly…

288
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,533
Someone even took a picture and uploaded it.

289
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:24,167
Where?

290
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:30,967
Explain the situation to the person in charge and request deletion.

291
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:34,533
Even those who were waiting just left.

292
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:38,067
The remaining procedures for Director Cha have all been canceled.

293
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,067
It's a misunderstanding.

294
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:42,900
It will quiet down with time.

295
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,200
Let's not worry too much and just do our own work.

296
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,267
Excuse me.

297
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:53,367
I would like to get a consultation.

298
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:55,967
Can I see someone right away?

299
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,960
General consultation?

300
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,400
What kind of surgery are you considering?

301
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,233
Eyes and nose,

302
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:14,267
and I want to change the contours of the face...

303
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,070
What needs to be done...

304
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,833
for me to be changed?

305
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:28,030
I want to look completely different, like a different person.

306
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,633
If I get cosmetic surgery,

307
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:35,133
it may turn out that way.

308
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,567
Please think about it a little longer.

309
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:49,230
What?

310
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:53,667
To see if what you truly want is the external change.

311
00:21:55,433 --> 00:21:58,133
If you really need the surgery,

312
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:00,300
come back then.

313
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:05,200
But…

314
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,433
Why do some people get surgery and others don't?

315
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:10,000
What could be the reason?

316
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,400
Perhaps he's considering the patient's mindset?

317
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,500
While he is considering the minds of complete strangers,

318
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,233
why doesn't he understand my anxious heart?

319
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:20,900
Because of this person,

320
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,433
my insides are burning to the point that my face is turning black. Really!

321
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:26,167
Oh, no!

322
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:29,267
Would you like to have a consultation for a whitening treatment?

323
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:31,800
Please have a consultation before you go, Director.

324
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:36,100
You really don't understand my feelings.

325
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,100
Oh dear!

326
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:07,033
Da Hui?

327
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:10,200
Amazing! I met you here!

328
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,000
What brings you here?

329
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,400
Have you been well?

330
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,333
I guess I'm lucky

331
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:18,267
since I've run into you by chance.

332
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:32,267
Stop.

333
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:33,600
What are you doing right now?

334
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,033
Ah, get out!

335
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:36,033
Why?

336
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:38,933
Hey, a patient has arrived.

337
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:45,667
Fortunately, artery or nerve damage was avoided,

338
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:49,333
but the cheekbones and the bones around the eye are somewhat fractured.

339
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:53,267
While trying to save the fragmented bones that can be saved,

340
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:54,767
reconstructive surgery will be necessary.

341
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,800
Let's transfer her to the emergency department of a nearby university hospital.

342
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:02,833
How can an emergency medical doctor leave an emergency patient?

343
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,133
That's a thing of the past.

344
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:06,467
I'm just a local plastic surgeon now.

345
00:24:06,467 --> 00:24:08,033
So, you do it.

346
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:10,267
Me, perform surgery on a trauma patient?

347
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:13,900
It's not a typical facial bone fracture, but an emergency. 
    

348
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,700
The patient has orbicularis muscle paralysis.

349
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,767
The orbicularis muscle is on the fractured bone near the orbital fracture.

350
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:20,533
It seems to be entrapped. 
    

351
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:23,700
You should know better.  It needs immediate surgery.

352
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,300
You are double-board certified in emergency medicine and plastic surgery.

353
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,500
You're the perfect fit as an emergency plastic surgeon.

354
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,133
An emergency surgery at the plastic surgery center in the middle of the night.

355
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:33,733
The headline sounds good, too.

356
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:36,267
Are you suggesting we use the emergency patient to promote the hospital?

357
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:39,033
It's about planning your future

358
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:41,533
with that patient's surgery.

359
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:28,300
The first impact caused a fracture.

360
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,067
After that, the bones were pushed in,

361
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:33,000
and the eye muscles were wedged inside.

362
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,800
Secure the wedged orbital contents first. 
    

363
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,100
While fitting together the broken pieces,

364
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,533
we'll reinforce and fix it.

365
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:46,233
Brown's titanium plate, 
    

366
00:25:46,233 --> 00:25:48,667
and prepare two plates, 'L' and 'I' shaped. 
    

367
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:49,700
What about the saw?

368
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,633
No need for a saw with ORIF. 
    

369
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,700
Please prepare an army retractor.

370
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,767
Number 15.

371
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,467
It fits perfectly.

372
00:26:37,467 --> 00:26:39,800
He is amazing.

373
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:51,867
   

374
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:28,690
What are you talking about?

375
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,800
You say there's no evidence I was assaulted?

376
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,000
The scene of Kim Da Hui being assaulted

377
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,067
was not captured because it was obscured by a car.

378
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:41,700
However, isn't my face evidence enough?

379
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,933
Choi Chang Min has also submitted a medical report,

380
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:51,200
claiming that you were the first to attack.

381
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,500
 Amazing! I met you here! 

382
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,833
 Hey, let's talk for a moment. 

383
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:56,833
 I have nothing to say to you. 

384
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:59,467
 Just a minute, hold on. 

385
00:28:00,267 --> 00:28:02,633
 Hey, Da Hui, just a second. 

386
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:04,767
 Come on, it'll only take a second. 

387
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:05,767
 I don't want to. 

388
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,500
I pushed him away because I was being dragged by force.

389
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:14,200
You're calling that a mutual assault?

390
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,800
After going to the pub in the basement of that building,

391
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,333
since we met by chance,

392
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:22,000
I just wanted to have a quick chat to catch up.

393
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,433
Darn it.

394
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:26,133
Because of a sudden shove…

395
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:38,600
 Are you out of your mind? 

396
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:47,067
So, did you hit the victim's face with a glass bottle?

397
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,767
It was an accident.

398
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:54,133
I really don't know why I did it,

399
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:59,433
because it hurt so much and there was blood everywhere.

400
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,800
I just swung whatever I could grab.

401
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,500
I really didn't know it was a bottle or something else.

402
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:09,733
I wonder why I did that.

403
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:17,900
For now, the verified CCTV footage supports Choi Chang Min's statement.

404
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:30,400
So, it's considered a spontaneous response to Kim Da Hui's act of violence.

405
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,967
You're going to stick to it consistently. Right?

406
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,933
Yes, mutual assault.

407
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:41,700
It's a simple injury.

408
00:29:44,733 --> 00:29:47,200
Excuse me.

409
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,633
What's the matter?

410
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:53,500
I heard you moved Ms. Kim Da Hui to the surgery room from the parking lot yesterday.

411
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,800
I haven't seen anything.

412
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
Do you know me?

413
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:00,867
What do you want to say?

414
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:02,800
Well, someone said that.

415
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,000
The discerning eyes of doctor Cha Jeong Woo

416
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,733
can see things others can't.

417
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:10,600
 After touching my face, he knew right away that my bone had come off. 

418
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,733
 Ah, he totally has x-ray vision! 

419
00:30:13,733 --> 00:30:15,733
I believe the diagnosis has already been issued.

420
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:17,800
I've seen that, too.

421
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,100
I'm talking about an expert opinion on the victim's scars, not the diagnosis.

422
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:26,533
Striking the cheekbone with a glass bottle would have caused a fracture,

423
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:31,000
and then using the broken glass bottle, he hit the fractured area again.

424
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,967
That would seem to be how the scar was formed.

425
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:37,200
That's how you should proceed with the investigation then.

426
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,500
No, I don't have a medical license.

427
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,300
It wasn't a single swing made in a moment of sudden anger,

428
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,000
but that there were at least two attacks—

429
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,033
You want proof of the perpetrator's intent?

430
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:48,233
Yes.

431
00:30:48,233 --> 00:30:52,067
I'm asking for a brief appraisal report on the victim's scars.

432
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:53,833
Yes?

433
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,267
Bring a warrant.

434
00:30:57,267 --> 00:31:00,533
I don't disclose patient medical information that carelessly.

435
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:03,200
Yes, you're right.

436
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,367
 Hey! 

437
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:08,367
Are you really a doctor after all this?

438
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:12,367
What kind of doctor are you, only fixing women's faces?

439
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:14,267
No, I'm not here for that.

440
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:17,933
After she came here, my kid left home.

441
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:20,900
Seeing how the doctor was dismissive,

442
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,467
she said she doesn't need a father like me and left the house.

443
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:26,100
Sir, please calm down for now.

444
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:31,300
How can I calm down when my child has run away from home? How?

445
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,033
This is all your fault!

446
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:38,433
You're making a fuss because I look like I don't have money.

447
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:40,567
Isn't that why you refused treatment?

448
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:43,267
Sir, just a moment.

449
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:46,933
Sir, let's go outside and talk with me.

450
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:48,133
- Let go! 
 - Please, come out.

451
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:52,133
- Can you ignore a person like that? 
 - Oh dear, talk with me...

452
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:53,633
 Ah, you know me. 

453
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:57,067
 - Let this go. 
 - Ah, please calm down. 

454
00:31:57,067 --> 00:31:59,433
 - Let it go! 
 - Please, calm down. 

455
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:02,333
 Don't overdo it. Sit down. 

456
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,600
Please watch your head.

457
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,533
Sir, I am sorry.

458
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:09,300
You need to tell me the address.

459
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,067
   

460
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,167
   

461
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:21,367
There is no criminal record, and the intent behind the assault has not been proven.

462
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:26,133
If you're not applying for an arrest warrant, we'll be going home for now.

463
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:28,867
Let's go.

464
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,467
Ah, darn it…

465
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,900
Maybe I should be hospitalized, too.

466
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,033
Kim Da Hui keeps lingering in the plastic surgery clinic.

467
00:32:56,033 --> 00:32:59,267
I think I'm at a disadvantage if I don't.

468
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:01,767
Just stay quiet.

469
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:04,600
Quiet?

470
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:14,133
That… just staying quiet would…

471
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:17,800
be taking it easy…

472
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,167
Why are you so noisy?

473
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:27,633
I apologize.

474
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:32,367
Kim Da Hui is putting on an act in the hospital.

475
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:35,367
Am I just supposed to shut up and stay silent?

476
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:39,333
Ah sh**.

477
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,467
With this good thing?

478
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:47,500
Ah, what model is this? It looks totally up-to-date.

479
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,567
You said you went to the pub in the plastic surgery building and met Kim Da Hui by chance?

480
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:54,433
The investigation is over, right? If you need further investigation…

481
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:56,267
I'm a regular there.

482
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,533
You'd know if you investigated.

483
00:33:58,533 --> 00:34:01,700
Yes, turns out you are a regular.

484
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,700
But it seems that you didn't know that day was the regular day off.

485
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,633
I must have forgotten, that's why.

486
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:12,000
Ah, yes, that's fine.

487
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,600
That was a good enough answer.

488
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,967
We will see each other again.

489
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:23,967
Be careful with your body since you're a patient.

490
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:38,200
There's something with that guy. Right?

491
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,500
Print out Choi Chang Min's card usage details and online purchase history right away.

492
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,900
That jerk has a location tracker.

493
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,800
What?

494
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,833
Yes, I'll check it right away.

495
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,133
How about the personal protection request for Ms. Kim Da Hui?

496
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:49,133
It's under review right now.

497
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:50,700
Tell them to process it quickly.

498
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,867
Where are you going alone again?

499
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:55,133
Tell them to hurry up with the processing, as we are short on time.

500
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:12,400
It would be better to come back in about ten days,

501
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,133
to get a CT scan and get checked again.

502
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:19,100
In ten days?

503
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,367
I'm not sure if I'll be alive by then.

504
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:34,267
Thanks to you, I received good treatment.

505
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:42,433
Ms. Kim Da Hui.

506
00:36:12,233 --> 00:36:14,000
What?

507
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:28,133
I'm currently on official duty, so I'll contact you later.

508
00:36:28,133 --> 00:36:29,433
Excuse me.

509
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:31,933
Just a moment, please.

510
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:33,633
What is it?

511
00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:35,233
Let's get going for now.

512
00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:36,867
What are you doing right now?

513
00:36:36,867 --> 00:36:39,567
Ms. Kim Da Hui has been kidnapped.

514
00:36:50,433 --> 00:36:52,500
 Code one: A suspected abduction of a woman has occurred. 

515
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,667
 Blue SUV, license plate number 23-PA-3393. 

516
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:58,067
 Requesting mobilization tracking. 

517
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:01,200
What did you tell the police?

518
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,833
How is that important?

519
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:07,233
You got out safe and sound.

520
00:37:07,233 --> 00:37:10,133
Did you tell them that I was a stalker?

521
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:17,267
To be beaten up like that and were stupid enough not to collect any evidence…

522
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:20,700
Right, I did that.

523
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:24,267
I thought that was the case,

524
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:26,067
but there was evidence.

525
00:37:26,067 --> 00:37:28,100
What?

526
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,500
I said there's evidence.

527
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,233
Where the heck is it?

528
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,667
The place where you first hit me.

529
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:49,700
   

530
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,400
 Found it! The blue SUV 23-PA-3393. 

531
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,100
 It's heading towards the outskirts road in the direction of Ganghwa-do. 

532
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:06,767
Have you confirmed the location?

533
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:09,900
Since Ms. Kim Da Hui might be harmed, contact 119.

534
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,730
Yes.

535
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,500
To Ganghwa-do.

536
00:38:34,467 --> 00:38:37,267
    
 The day we came here for a visit,

537
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:39,900
when I was on the phone with a delivery man,

538
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,100
you suddenly started strangling me, demanding to know who he was.

539
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,300
I should have reported you then.

540
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:54,767
Hey, Da Hui, you're freaking hilarious.

541
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:57,900
Would it have made a difference if you had?

542
00:38:58,533 --> 00:39:02,170
Then or now, I am still me,

543
00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:04,767
and you're just you.

544
00:39:04,767 --> 00:39:06,933
Nothing changes.

545
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,867
You'll see when you go.

546
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:21,167
What's there?

547
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:23,800
What is it?

548
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,133
Where's the evidence?

549
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:28,733
Aren't you going to tell me now?

550
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,100
In your head.

551
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:33,833
What?

552
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:36,967
Look! You remember every single one of them.

553
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:38,967
That's why you came all the way here without me having to say it.

554
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:41,900
Are you kidding me right now?

555
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,000
Darn!

556
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,533
It's all recorded here.

557
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:50,233
Have you really gone crazy?

558
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,900
Found it.

559
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,100
That bastard, seriously!

560
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,633
Why don't I see the reinforcements?

561
00:39:57,633 --> 00:40:00,400
They said they're waiting on the other side.

562
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:03,867
 In ten days? 

563
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:07,167
 I'm not sure if I'll be alive by then. 

564
00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:44,967
 Mr. Choi Chang Min, open the door. 

565
00:40:44,967 --> 00:40:48,067
- I hoped for a change without doing anything. 
  - Mr. Choi Chang Min. 

566
00:40:48,067 --> 00:40:50,967
- Since avoiding wouldn't fix the issue, I should've fought against it earlier. 
  - Open the door! 

567
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:52,433
 Open the door! 

568
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:55,567
I won't live like a fool anymore.

569
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,133
 Ms. Kim Da Hui. 

570
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,833
 I can help with physical changes, but 

571
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:15,533
 other changes, ultimately, 

572
00:41:15,533 --> 00:41:17,933
 you have to make them yourself. 

573
00:41:31,967 --> 00:41:33,733
You!

574
00:41:45,267 --> 00:41:46,567
Mr. Choi Chang Min,

575
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:48,933
you are under arrest for kidnapping, confinement, assault, speeding,

576
00:41:48,933 --> 00:41:52,800
including obstruction of official duties and violation of the Stalking Punishment Law.

577
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,300
Hey! Kim Da Hui!

578
00:42:10,767 --> 00:42:13,033
Ms. Kim Da Hui.

579
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:16,300
Ms. Kim Da Hui, are you okay? Can you recognize me?

580
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:22,367
He's caught red-handed now, isn't he?

581
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:32,733
We will transport the patient.

582
00:42:32,733 --> 00:42:35,100
The patient had surgery for a facial collapse.

583
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,267
Stabilize her face as much as possible while moving her, and monitor her vitals.

584
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:40,667
Yes, understood.

585
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:41,867
I'll move you to the ambulance.

586
00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:44,067
Try to hold onto me.

587
00:42:45,767 --> 00:42:47,067
Are you okay?

588
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:48,633
Did you look into what we discussed?

589
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:51,400
I've confirmed the purchase of a tracker from Choi Chang Min's card history.

590
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,900
The tracker…

591
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,200
We found it.

592
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,033
Yes.

593
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:58,500
- Ah! 
 - Good work!

594
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,600
Chocolate.

595
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:56,667
♫  It's okay, whoever it was  ♫

596
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,167
♫  I don't cry no more  ♫

597
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:02,533
 Jeong Woo, give me your hand. 

598
00:44:03,633 --> 00:44:08,600
♫  This tiresome, dark night too  ♫

599
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,233
 Isn't the suit a bit small? 

600
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:12,833
 The arms are a bit… 

601
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:15,100
 It's not comfortable to move in. 

602
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,467
 It is good, and it fits perfectly. 

603
00:44:17,467 --> 00:44:19,400
 Really? 

604
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,867
 You don't know this, do you? 

605
00:44:22,867 --> 00:44:23,867
 About what? 

606
00:44:23,867 --> 00:44:28,767
 The expression. Keeping a straight face when the curtain opens lasts a lifetime. 

607
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:30,633
 Okay. 

608
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:49,300
 Hold on, I am a doctor. 

609
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:10,300
 BP at 70 over 43. 

610
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,900
 The blood pressure is continuously dropping. 

611
00:45:15,567 --> 00:45:16,967
 How much longer will it take? 

612
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:20,100
 Fastest would be about 7 to 8 minutes. 

613
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,767
 Please give me the gloves. 

614
00:45:21,767 --> 00:45:23,500
 And prepare the gauze. 

615
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,767
 I will switch hands on three. 

616
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:27,900
 One, two, three. 

617
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,700
 I've found it, the bleeding wound. 

618
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,633
 I will maintain this state until we reach the operating room. 

619
00:45:41,633 --> 00:45:43,533
 Yes. 

620
00:45:54,533 --> 00:45:55,667
 Doctor, what's going on? 

621
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:57,767
 I'm doing manual compression on the bleeding area. 

622
00:45:57,767 --> 00:46:00,100
 The vitals seem to have stabilized during the compression. 

623
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,433
 Work up the trauma in other areas. 

624
00:46:01,433 --> 00:46:05,867
 Yes, first let's secure the splenic artery. 

625
00:46:05,867 --> 00:46:08,400
 Oh, stop looking. 

626
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,667
 Thanks to you, the surgery went well; just go back. 

627
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:13,667
 Didn't you come from choosing your wedding suit? 

628
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:17,333
 Good job. What are you going to do with your fiancée? 

629
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:20,500
 You'll have to buy a new one. She will be shocked. Hurry up. 

630
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,500
   

631
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,200
 If you mess up today, it will follow you for life. 

632
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,667
 Oh, Hye Jin, sorry. I'm just on my way out. 

633
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,667
 Oppa. 

634
00:46:30,667 --> 00:46:32,600
 What's wrong? Is something wrong? 

635
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,300
 I'm sorry, I should have told you earlier. 

636
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,400
 What do you mean by that? 

637
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,533
 Why are you acting like this? 

638
00:46:39,533 --> 00:46:41,567
 Hye Jin. 

639
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:43,067
 Hye Jin. 

640
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:46,933
 Please help. My girlfriend is alone at home, but— 

641
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:54,867
 Are you okay? 

642
00:46:54,867 --> 00:46:56,300
 Please say something. 

643
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,500
 Are you okay? 

644
00:47:47,067 --> 00:47:50,467
   

645
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,567
Did you ask Dr. Cha Jeong Woo to send the expert opinion about Ms. Kim Da Hui's case?

646
00:47:57,567 --> 00:47:58,900
What expert opinion?

647
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,233
The first assault case that happened in the underground parking lot.

648
00:48:02,233 --> 00:48:05,700
It's a note that refutes Choi Chang Min's claim of mere injury.

649
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,267
   

650
00:48:11,867 --> 00:48:13,267
He is someone you can never fully understand.

651
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:16,567
 Fortunately, the victim's primary physician followed her in his car 

652
00:48:16,567 --> 00:48:18,700
 and she was rescued quickly. 

653
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,233
He had recently operated on the victim 
    

654
00:48:21,233 --> 00:48:23,533
 in an emergency as a plastic surgeon in Gangnam. 

655
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:26,300
 While leaving work, he saw one of his female patients 

656
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,400
 being assaulted by her ex-boyfriend. 

657
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:34,700
As a doctor, he should know the reason why the patient wanted to have surgery.

658
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,300
Whenever I want to see Ji Seon's face,

659
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:42,100
I'd been holding back while looking at your face.

660
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,300
What should I do now?

661
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,233
He must have understood that...

662
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,833
my face needed to be changed...

663
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,367
for me to be able to live properly.

664
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:11,033
 As long as it's not this face, it's fine. 

665
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:16,167
 It's my twin sister who passed away in an accident. 

666
00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:19,400
While calling

667
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,633
Ji Seon's name,

668
00:49:21,633 --> 00:49:25,533
every time you held me and cried,

669
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:29,533
do you know how I felt?

670
00:49:36,867 --> 00:49:38,700
Mom,

671
00:49:39,533 --> 00:49:45,720
we... should let Ji Seon go now, Mom.

672
00:50:00,933 --> 00:50:02,400
Oh my, what gives? 
    

673
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,867
For someone who detests meddling in others' affairs.

674
00:50:04,867 --> 00:50:08,933
That must be Director Cha's true heart.

675
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,033
Rather than Director Cha's sincerity, it's our director's foresight.

676
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:18,167
What is she talking about?

677
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:20,133
Ah, yes, let's do that.

678
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:25,033
Then I will schedule an interview with Dr. Cha Jeong Woo.

679
00:50:25,033 --> 00:50:27,400
Yes, I will see you soon.

680
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,167
Yes, stay safe.

681
00:50:29,167 --> 00:50:30,333
It's done now.

682
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:33,133
Who are you to decide on the interview?

683
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:35,633
And you.

684
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:37,500
Who are you to rescue a kidnapped patient

685
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,267
by chasing after the abductor and boldly saving her?

686
00:50:42,267 --> 00:50:47,800
Is it common to create a heartwarming story in a cosmetic plastic surgery clinic?

687
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,367
This opportunity should just simply

688
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:53,433
cement the hospital's recognition for sure.

689
00:50:54,367 --> 00:50:56,233
Beautiful.

690
00:50:56,233 --> 00:50:58,700
Beautiful!

691
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:12,300
   

692
00:51:18,233 --> 00:51:20,300
 A plastic surgeon in Gangnam, Seoul has 
    

693
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:24,267
 rescued a woman who was his patient from being kidnapped 

694
00:51:24,267 --> 00:51:25,733
 and has become a topic of discussion. 

695
00:51:25,733 --> 00:51:29,633
 The doctor had previously seen the victim being assaulted 

696
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:32,800
 by her ex-boyfriend in the parking lot of the plastic surgery clinic. 

697
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,800
 After seeing this happen and saving her from the assault, he performed emergency surgery. 

698
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,033
 This time, as the man forced the discharged woman into a vehicle and fled, 

699
00:51:41,033 --> 00:51:45,700
 the doctor immediately followed and rescued her quickly. 

700
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,133
 This is all because of you! 

701
00:53:22,133 --> 00:53:24,500
 You're making a fuss because I look like I don't have money. 

702
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:29,333
 Isn't that why you refused treatment? 

703
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:06,667
   

704
00:54:06,667 --> 00:54:09,567
 Cha Jeong Woo, you bastard! 

705
00:54:10,267 --> 00:54:12,367
 While completely disregarding people, 

706
00:54:12,367 --> 00:54:16,300
 what kind of doctor selectively treats patients? 

707
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:21,933
 Wrapping yourself up as a righteous doctor using patients, 

708
00:54:21,933 --> 00:54:26,567
 trying to gain fame. Your shamelessness makes me shudder! 

709
00:54:28,067 --> 00:54:32,167
 Don't live like that, Cha Jeong Woo, you bastard! 

710
00:54:53,367 --> 00:54:56,000
   

711
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:09,800



712
00:55:14,133 --> 00:55:15,867
 The father of a patient who was refused treatment 

713
00:55:15,867 --> 00:55:18,233
 at a famous plastic surgery clinic in Gangnam 

714
00:55:18,233 --> 00:55:19,567
 committed suicide by jumping from his home. 

715
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:21,800
 - Do you take the responsibility? 
 - Please say something. 

716
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,300
 Doctor Cha Jeong Woo, really 

717
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,500
 went between heaven and hell overnight. 

718
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,000
 From a righteous doctor who saved a patient 

719
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,267
 to a doctor mentioned in a dead person's suicide note. 

720
00:55:30,267 --> 00:55:31,567
 You're telling me to cooperate? 

721
00:55:31,567 --> 00:55:33,667
 Just stand beside me. 

722
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:36,100
 Okay, then I'll take it. One, two. 

723
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,700
 Why are you doing this? Victim medical support. 

724
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:39,933
 As for the victims of crime, 

725
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:42,733
 they absolutely need that consolation and empathy. 

726
00:55:42,733 --> 00:55:44,300
 Can't I go to the plastic surgery clinic? 

727
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,233
 If it is related to Nam Gi Taek's death, 

728
00:55:47,233 --> 00:55:51,200
 why involve Doctor Cha Jeong Woo in that death? 

729
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,580
♫  Don't give up  ♫

730
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:59,210
♫  I want you back; I need you  ♫
