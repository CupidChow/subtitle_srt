00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:20,404
What's with that look?

8
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,409
It is you, isn't it?

9
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,943
The guy who ran out of the house that day.

10
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:36,457
The jerks who kill their girlfriends and wives say they do it because of infidelity.

11
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:40,590
Why? Did your lover cheat on you?

12
00:02:01,949 --> 00:02:03,794
Shit!

13
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:53,056
Mr. Cha Jeong Woo!

14
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,474
Mr. Cha Jeong Woo, wait a moment!

15
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,757
Now, calm down.

16
00:03:05,957 --> 00:03:08,023
Lee Jin Seok,

17
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:10,490
you are under emergency arrest for the attempted murder of Nam Hyo Joo.

18
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,357
- What? What did you say? 
 - Senior!

19
00:03:12,357 --> 00:03:14,890
You have the right to appoint a lawyer and to refuse to make any statements.

20
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,723
What are you talking about? Let go! Let me go!

21
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:18,223
What are you doing?! Come hold him!

22
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:21,723
Damn it! Let go!

23
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:23,557
You can apply for a habeas corpus review.

24
00:03:23,557 --> 00:03:25,190
Lee Min Hyeong, are you out of your mind?

25
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,223
What are you doing?

26
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:29,057
Let go! Let go! Damn it!

27
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,030
  ­ 

28
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:49,509
 It almost looked like she was sleeping. 

29
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:52,657
 But when I went to check, I realized she was all covered in blood. 

30
00:03:52,657 --> 00:03:54,857
 Someone was definitely there. 

31
00:03:54,857 --> 00:03:57,157
 The guy who was in that house is the culprit! 

32
00:03:57,157 --> 00:04:00,190
 Jeong Woo, I'm sorry. 

33
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,723
 I should have told you earlier. 

34
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:06,323
 The jerks who kill their girlfriends and wives say they do it because of infidelity. 

35
00:04:06,323 --> 00:04:08,336
 Why? 

36
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:10,990
  Did your lover cheat on you? 

37
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,957
If the saturation is 90,

38
00:04:32,957 --> 00:04:36,617
it's not respiratory distress due to phlegm or vomit. 
    

39
00:04:38,423 --> 00:04:41,289
It's wheezing. 
    

40
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:43,223
It says no underlying diseases were reported.

41
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:44,557
What?

42
00:04:44,557 --> 00:04:47,810
Patient, can you hear me?

43
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:52,110
Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma?

44
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,957
It's bronchospasm! 
    

45
00:04:57,957 --> 00:05:00,157
Administer 5 milligrams of dexamethasone and bring Ventolin.

46
00:05:00,157 --> 00:05:01,680
Yes, sir.

47
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:05,130
But why did…

48
00:05:16,957 --> 00:05:19,723
Did he provide an alibi?

49
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:21,490
He invoked his right to stay silent.

50
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,150
He asked if what he said would even be believed and then stopped talking.

51
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:52,023
 Hey, get up. 

52
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:55,781
 - Why? 
 - Because I put it in the mailbox. 

53
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:57,960
 Bring it quickly! 

54
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,690
 Quickly! 

55
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,257
 This guy is hilarious. 

56
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:05,960
 Damn it, so annoying. 

57
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:26,610
 Hey! 

58
00:07:27,857 --> 00:07:29,880
 Excuse me! 

59
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,616
 Ah, damn it! 

60
00:07:51,457 --> 00:07:54,269
Even after saying it hundreds of times,

61
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:57,690
that damned evidence made me out to be a murderer.

62
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,190
Someone was there, I'm sure.

63
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,223
He's the one who did this to me.

64
00:08:02,223 --> 00:08:03,757
You mean Cha Jeong Woo?

65
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:06,157
That's why I've been lingering around that guy.

66
00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:08,323
The guy who ran out of that house looked exactly like him.

67
00:08:08,323 --> 00:08:10,143
No—

68
00:08:10,143 --> 00:08:12,080
It's that guy!

69
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:15,057
That's why he came to find me on his own accord.

70
00:08:15,057 --> 00:08:17,730
I'm telling you he must be scared now.

71
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,750
Hey!

72
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,100
Grab that guy and see what you can find, okay?

73
00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:28,123
If we dig into where and what he was doing that day,

74
00:08:28,123 --> 00:08:29,601
something's bound to turn up!

75
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:32,357
There's no use putting emotions first.

76
00:08:32,357 --> 00:08:33,957
Whether it's a retrial or reinvestigation,

77
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:37,657
it's not anger that moves public power, but evidence.

78
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:39,980
Reliable evidence.

79
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,257
Who is there to believe me?

80
00:08:51,956 --> 00:08:55,290
We're investigating Mr. Nam Gi Taek's possible murder.

81
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,920
And in the assault case of Ms. Nam Hyo Joo,

82
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,190
the perpetrator left evidence behind.

83
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:05,370
It'll be revealed once the DNA results come out.

84
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,523
Just say what you have to.

85
00:09:08,523 --> 00:09:10,420
Even just once.

86
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,023
Then there will be

87
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:14,880
someone who believes you.

88
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,690
 That's why I've been lingering around that guy. 

89
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,723
 The guy who ran out of that house looked just like him. 

90
00:09:30,723 --> 00:09:32,496
 No! 

91
00:09:32,496 --> 00:09:34,641
 That's the rat. 

92
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:44,429
With no past medical history or underlying conditions,

93
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:46,366
the patient signed it herself.

94
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:49,023
If they find out the surgeon wasn't present after the surgery,

95
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:51,457
it could be an issue.

96
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:58,358
Still, we fulfilled our duty to administer first aid properly, didn't we?

97
00:09:58,358 --> 00:10:00,923
It's not like there was a problem with the surgery itself.

98
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:02,782
Anyway, the patient is recovering without any complications.

99
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:04,457
That's true but…

100
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:06,563
I trusted and left it to you because you said he performs surgery well…

101
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:09,576
What kind of doctor leaves a patient and vacates their post?

102
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:10,844
I'm sorry it turned out this way.

103
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:13,972
I will give a warning and tell him to contact you separately.

104
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:17,067
Hey, this isn't something that can be made up for with just one call.

105
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:19,657
The nation's actress Choi Eun Ah was at death's door and came back. This is serious.

106
00:10:19,657 --> 00:10:22,290
Indeed, it was almost a disaster.

107
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,257
So before the surgery, the patient must personally check their medical history.

108
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,790
They need to do it very diligently.

109
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,557
If you happen to go to another hospital,

110
00:10:29,557 --> 00:10:32,657
please be sure to mention that she has asthma.

111
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:34,050
That is important.

112
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,757
It's not a big deal. It's just something minor she was diagnosed with a few years ago.

113
00:10:36,757 --> 00:10:40,742
How can someone check on all of those little details?

114
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:45,623
It's not the hospital's fault.

115
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,690
It's my own fault for forgetting, really.

116
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,200
- Thank you for your hard work. 
 - I apologize.

117
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,467
- Thank you for your hard work. 
 - Ah, yes.

118
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:04,290
- Shall we go? 
 - Yes.

119
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,950
- Then… 
 - I am sorry.

120
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,657
Walk slowly.

121
00:11:09,657 --> 00:11:11,239
- Good job. 
 - Ah, yes.

122
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:13,490
- Let's talk next time. 
 - Sorry, go.

123
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,757
Hey, walk slowly. Take it easy.

124
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:20,423
Still, it's a relief.

125
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:22,323
I'm glad it ended without any major issues.

126
00:11:22,323 --> 00:11:25,340
However, this isn't something to just let end.

127
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,157
- Still no contact? 
 - None.

128
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:32,723
What on earth is he so preoccupied with? Really!

129
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:37,330
- Is it Jeong Woo? 
 - No, it's not.

130
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,363
Oh, honey.

131
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:42,269
How is it that this darn hospital can't function without me?

132
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:45,090
We need to keep the hospital in order, for real.

133
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,704
Cha Jeong Woo, you rat!

134
00:11:46,704 --> 00:11:49,930
What are you doing after leaving a mess in the hospital?

135
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:52,180
What?

136
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:54,360
Where?

137
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:15,890
Hello?

138
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,080
What are you doing here?

139
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,570
It's noisy and chaotic.

140
00:12:23,282 --> 00:12:25,863
Just great.

141
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:28,257
What are you saying?

142
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:30,303
Why did you just abandon the patient, and where have you been

143
00:12:30,303 --> 00:12:32,918
to be this out of it mentally?

144
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:37,170
Cha Jeong Woo!

145
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:40,360
What's wrong with you?

146
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:47,032
Hye Jin…

147
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:57,920
I keep thinking of what she looked like at the end.

148
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:01,338
What are you saying? I can hardly hear you. It's so loud it's killing me.

149
00:13:01,338 --> 00:13:04,120
Let's talk outside. Get up.

150
00:13:04,662 --> 00:13:06,500
Get up!

151
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:18,480
 You know, don't you? Who that guy is. 

152
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,567
 You know, right? 

153
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:33,757
There's something about that guy.

154
00:13:33,757 --> 00:13:36,323
There must be something.

155
00:13:41,157 --> 00:13:43,190
 What Hye Jin looked like at the end? 

156
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,123
What are you talking about?

157
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:46,890
That day, you were on the way to Hye Jin's house and had an accident.

158
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,990
You woke up three days later, man.

159
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,307
What kind of nonsense is this?

160
00:13:57,823 --> 00:13:59,670
Jeong Woo,

161
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:02,823
what is this?

162
00:14:02,823 --> 00:14:06,249
The reason Lee Jin Seok appeared before me.

163
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:08,890
Did you meet Lee Jin Seok?

164
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,854
So?

165
00:14:10,854 --> 00:14:13,290
What's the reason?

166
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,820
He said he saw a person...

167
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,760
running out of Hye Jin's apartment that day.

168
00:14:20,957 --> 00:14:22,958
That is…

169
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,010
Who did he say it was?

170
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,423
You told me not to care about what such a punk says.

171
00:14:28,423 --> 00:14:31,520
That's because it's just unbelievable.

172
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:36,550
So, that punk is saying the one who ran away was you?

173
00:14:39,323 --> 00:14:40,820
Yeah.

174
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:46,018
He said it seemed like me.

175
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,890
I have seen all kinds of crazy folks.

176
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,690
What Lee Jin Seok talked about

177
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,220
and the image of Hye Jin in my mind...

178
00:14:57,157 --> 00:14:59,110
are similar.

179
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,410
Jeong Woo,

180
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:06,090
you saw Hye Jin's crime scene photo

181
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,680
in front of the police station that day.

182
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,423
Could it be because of that?

183
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:13,890
Like, this feeling of déjà vu?

184
00:15:15,857 --> 00:15:18,157
Are you seriously being swayed by that rat's words now?

185
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:20,423
Cha Jeong Woo of all people? Huh?

186
00:15:20,423 --> 00:15:23,090
To be swayed by a criminal's word and even neglect a patient…

187
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,860
Woo Jin,

188
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:29,148
do you not know...

189
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:32,957
anything about my accident that day?

190
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:35,750
What would I know about it?

191
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:37,788
I was in Singapore for a conference.

192
00:15:37,788 --> 00:15:40,710
I found out after receiving a call from your mother.

193
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,720
Jeong Woo,

194
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:47,375
you need to speed up your departure

195
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,075
before you get more involved with that Lee Jin Seok.

196
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:04,423
   

197
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:35,392
   

198
00:16:35,392 --> 00:16:38,620
   

199
00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:42,957
   

200
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:45,957
   

201
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:48,457
   

202
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:52,723
   

203
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:55,057
   

204
00:16:57,157 --> 00:16:58,240
   
   

205
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,392
   

206
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:00,480
   

207
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,690
   

208
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,523
   

209
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:07,957
   

210
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,332
   

211
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:17,732
Team Leader Choi?

212
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,300
  ­ 

213
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,290
 ­  

214
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,883
Suddenly, it got approved.

215
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:34,257
It doesn't seem like it would be your doing.

216
00:17:34,257 --> 00:17:36,557
Seems like someone influential intervened.

217
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:40,023
Gosh! Is that really important right now?

218
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:41,823
You have until next week to leave.

219
00:17:41,823 --> 00:17:44,457
Since you can't control your own emotions,

220
00:17:44,457 --> 00:17:47,357
a doctor who endangers the well-being of patients

221
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,290
is not needed in my hospital.

222
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,191
If the patient's side wants compensation, I'll take care of it myself.

223
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:55,690
Who said it's about money?

224
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,123
I mean you!

225
00:17:57,123 --> 00:18:01,047
Have you ever made such a mistake as a doctor before?

226
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,526
Sort it out before you cause more trouble.

227
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,890
  ­ 

228
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,250
  ­ 

229
00:18:34,223 --> 00:18:37,630
Hello, did you have a reservation?

230
00:18:38,423 --> 00:18:40,190
Huh?

231
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:45,658
Dr. Cha has made a comeback, right?

232
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:03,330
I stopped filming to come here.

233
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:07,890
I'm already struggling with panic,

234
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,457
and I keep thinking about yesterday's incident.

235
00:19:10,457 --> 00:19:13,200
So I can't breathe well,

236
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:17,820
and I just can't do my work.

237
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:22,719
If you could tell me specifically what you want…

238
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:31,657
This is the first time for a patient, isn't it?

239
00:19:31,657 --> 00:19:34,990
I read the articles about you chasing after kidnapped patients to save them,

240
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,957
and even helping a model patient make a comeback.

241
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:40,580
I'm asking why you did that yesterday.

242
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,890
Did you not take it seriously because it was a reoperation,

243
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,890
and ignore me because of that?

244
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,490
I'm sorry.

245
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,537
Due to personal reasons…

246
00:19:51,537 --> 00:19:54,057
Personal?

247
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:55,657
Personal rea…

248
00:19:55,657 --> 00:19:58,823
You're not the kind of person who can't separate life from work.

249
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,357
When a patient lies down on the surgery table,

250
00:20:01,357 --> 00:20:05,602
you have to take responsibility until they open their eyes again.

251
00:20:05,602 --> 00:20:07,957
Wow. Hearing this makes it even harder to breathe.

252
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,757
I really can't breathe.

253
00:20:09,757 --> 00:20:11,123
Ah, seriously.

254
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:13,090
How can such a situation even happen?

255
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,190
Ah, I'm sorry.

256
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,023
We should have contacted you first, but I was out—

257
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,190
No, no, that's not it.

258
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,957
Right now, the doctor is neglecting the patient because of personal reasons.

259
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:24,590
Does this even make sense?

260
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,290
This is really absurd!

261
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,717
Oh, I really…

262
00:20:28,717 --> 00:20:30,623
Are you okay? Are you in a lot of pain?

263
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:31,835
- What? 
 - Are you okay?

264
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:34,102
- I don't know. 
 - Are you in a lot of pain? Okay…

265
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:38,503
You're all right, aren't you?

266
00:20:53,963 --> 00:20:59,530
How can a doctor really do this for personal reasons?

267
00:21:08,557 --> 00:21:10,690
Should I have come on more strongly?

268
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,857
It was too weak, wasn't it?

269
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:15,323
I think he may have started to notice something might be off.

270
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:17,857
Don't worry, that's enough.

271
00:21:17,857 --> 00:21:21,757
Even if Director Cha acts tough, on the inside he's quite soft.

272
00:21:21,757 --> 00:21:24,490
By now, he must be thinking he was crazy to act that way

273
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,257
and regretting how he acted.

274
00:21:26,257 --> 00:21:28,390
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

275
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,690
As I was doing it, suddenly I got so angry.

276
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,223
I am really serious about acting!

277
00:21:35,223 --> 00:21:38,065
Ah, yes.

278
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:46,156
   
 I'll finish the appointments as discussed. 

279
00:21:46,156 --> 00:21:50,557
But why did you ask me to act earlier?

280
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:52,303
What do you mean by a request for acting?

281
00:21:52,303 --> 00:21:56,003
Earlier, in front of Director Cha's office…

282
00:21:58,257 --> 00:21:59,956
 Oh, great! Hello! 

283
00:21:59,956 --> 00:22:03,390
 - Hello! 
 - Are you feeling well? 

284
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,023
 You came to see Director Cha, right? 

285
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:08,049
 Yes. 

286
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:11,530
 You look pale… 

287
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:17,457
 If you're going to complain, do it properly. 

288
00:22:17,457 --> 00:22:20,923
 Make it so he can never again think about neglecting a patient  

289
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:24,523
 and stays completely alert. 

290
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:30,423
Didn't you come to complain to Director Cha?

291
00:22:30,423 --> 00:22:33,990
You were going to do it anyway, so…

292
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,090
That's not the case.

293
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,400
I came for a consultation.

294
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:41,423
There's a surgery I'm concerned about.

295
00:22:41,423 --> 00:22:43,290
I thought Director Cha would give me

296
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,057
a proper consultation as a patient, and not as an actress.

297
00:22:46,057 --> 00:22:49,423
Such people are not common.

298
00:22:49,423 --> 00:22:51,790
Ah, yes, of course.

299
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,323
That's right.

300
00:22:53,323 --> 00:22:54,775
After clearing up the misunderstanding,

301
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:57,723
I can get the surgery consultation. Right?

302
00:22:57,723 --> 00:23:03,057
- But, that might be a little difficult. 
 - Why?

303
00:23:03,057 --> 00:23:06,690
Because Director Cha is going to be dispatched to Bintan.

304
00:23:07,723 --> 00:23:09,723
I think I saw it in an article.

305
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,560
The plastic surgery clinic that is opening in that resort.

306
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,957
Ah, yes, I just informed him

307
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:16,490
to wrap up the treatments.

308
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,357
Well… it turned out even better.

309
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:22,023
I just need to go to Bintan, right?

310
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:23,701
I should hurry and make a reservation.

311
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:26,210
I'll be going.

312
00:23:26,956 --> 00:23:30,357
Ah, yes.

313
00:23:30,357 --> 00:23:32,977
Then, take care.

314
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:38,223
Cha Jeong Woo is a tough nut to crack.

315
00:23:44,363 --> 00:23:46,690
Yes, this is Kim Seok Hoon.

316
00:23:47,357 --> 00:23:50,057
But did you look into that?

317
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:54,290
The reason why Doctor Cha Jeong Woo's partnership suddenly got approval…

318
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,857
   

319
00:23:59,756 --> 00:24:01,890
Anyway, he has skills.

320
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,090
What are you talking about?

321
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,290
 He moved the president of the Association of Plastic Surgeons, who was his classmate, 

322
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,490
 and sent his son on all the dispatch duties. 

323
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,803
His son wanted to go.

324
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:14,023
Is there a parent who can win against their child?

325
00:24:14,023 --> 00:24:16,257
 Wow! This side of you scares me a bit. 

326
00:24:16,257 --> 00:24:19,523
Just take care to finish the treatments.

327
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:22,757
I have a consultation. Bye.

328
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:30,300
Is it really right to send him off like this?

329
00:24:31,423 --> 00:24:34,357
Oh, my… Really…

330
00:24:34,357 --> 00:24:37,053
Oh, dear. It's here.

331
00:24:37,053 --> 00:24:39,039
Here it is.

332
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,420
- Give me another one of these, please. 
 - Yes.

333
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,890
No need.

334
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,323
She's not here to eat, just give me a bottle of soju.

335
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:02,190
Are you following me?

336
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,690
Why?

337
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,240
Are you going around doing something suspicious?

338
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:10,040
Did you look into your brother's case

339
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,557
for the first time now?

340
00:25:14,102 --> 00:25:17,423
You could've made a fuss about it in between.

341
00:25:17,423 --> 00:25:18,623
Why didn't you look?

342
00:25:18,623 --> 00:25:21,723
Because I thought it was over.

343
00:25:36,423 --> 00:25:38,550
Keep going.

344
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,557
Back then, the reason Lee Jin Seok's testimony couldn't be trusted,

345
00:25:41,557 --> 00:25:43,123
I understand that.

346
00:25:43,123 --> 00:25:46,490
So the testimony that someone ran out of that house

347
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,669
didn't necessarily have to be checked.

348
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:51,550
I understand that part, too.

349
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:56,370
But one question remained.

350
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,190
What question?

351
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:03,290
That there was no investigation into the victim's partner's movements on that day.

352
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:09,290
He had been unconscious for days due to a traffic accident.

353
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,990
There was a suspect arrested at the scene.

354
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,916
How could I just go after someone

355
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:16,723
who had an accident and lost is fiancée?

356
00:26:16,723 --> 00:26:19,290
I saw it, too.

357
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,890
There was no official document for the traffic accident that occurred that day, right?

358
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,157
If it's a person closely related to the victim,

359
00:26:25,157 --> 00:26:27,823
an official document specifying the accident location or time

360
00:26:27,823 --> 00:26:30,523
is necessary, isn't it?

361
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,623
Lee Jin Seok,

362
00:26:34,623 --> 00:26:38,089
said he saw a guy running out of that house.

363
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:40,108
Upon opening the file,

364
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:42,457
the investigation regarding the victim's lover is empty.

365
00:26:42,457 --> 00:26:45,123
They say there was an accident,

366
00:26:45,123 --> 00:26:48,490
but since there are no documents to confirm it, the suspect is Cha Jeong Woo.

367
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,423
Is this the provisional conclusion of your question?

368
00:26:50,423 --> 00:26:52,278
Having not clearly investigated the accident—

369
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,727
What you're saying right now is quite

370
00:26:54,727 --> 00:26:57,690
risky, you know that?

371
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,857
I have raised an obvious question that a detective is entitled to ask.

372
00:27:05,723 --> 00:27:08,200
Before being a detective,

373
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:11,620
you are the family of the offender.

374
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:16,090
How desperate must one be to hide evidence among family

375
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,606
and even to hide a criminal,

376
00:27:18,606 --> 00:27:20,423
thinking they will be exempted from punishment?

377
00:27:20,423 --> 00:27:24,357
I learned that from my team leader.

378
00:27:24,357 --> 00:27:27,440
Please don't distort the intention.

379
00:27:29,657 --> 00:27:32,423
That day, Doctor Cha Jeong Woo

380
00:27:32,423 --> 00:27:36,323
had an accident on his way to his girlfriend's house.

381
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:38,790
When he woke up, the lover was dead,

382
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,390
and a doctor who saves lives

383
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,823
had let his lover go so vainly.

384
00:27:44,823 --> 00:27:47,876
Imagine how he must have felt.

385
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:50,157
Stop it.

386
00:27:50,157 --> 00:27:52,723
Avoid thoughtlessly touching the victim's wounds.

387
00:27:52,723 --> 00:27:56,423
Lee Min Hyeong, in this case,

388
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:59,023
don't forget that you are the family of the perpetrator,

389
00:27:59,023 --> 00:28:02,311
before being a detective.

390
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:09,309
Not leaving even a speck of doubt

391
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:12,575
is a true investigation for the victim.

392
00:28:14,723 --> 00:28:19,016
I haven't forgotten that you said that.

393
00:28:20,957 --> 00:28:23,309
I apologize in advance.

394
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,970
 ­  

395
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,923
What did you do?

396
00:28:39,923 --> 00:28:43,120
It looks like Jeong Woo is packing his things.

397
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,160
Well, I guess someone who is already on their way out has to leave at some point.

398
00:28:48,557 --> 00:28:50,523
Since Jeong Woo is also leaving,

399
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:53,490
how about discharging patient Nam Hyo Joo?

400
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:57,057
There's nothing more that can be treated at our hospital anyway.

401
00:28:58,423 --> 00:29:01,470
Hasn't that case been resolved yet?

402
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,190
Since there is no memory of the time of the crime,

403
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,823
it seems it's not easy.

404
00:29:09,757 --> 00:29:11,357
Well, for now,

405
00:29:11,357 --> 00:29:16,750
let's keep an eye on the patient until she expresses her desire to be discharged.

406
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,083
Even if Jeong Woo is out, you can take care of her.

407
00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:25,723
I'm soon entering the peak season. I'll be busy.

408
00:29:30,957 --> 00:29:33,457
Try stretching your hand out.

409
00:29:33,457 --> 00:29:35,690
Please try moving it.

410
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,750
Try bending the second finger.

411
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:40,890
The surgery went well.

412
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,790
And the function at the surgical site is good.

413
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,323
I think we might not need to continue with ischemia monitoring.

414
00:29:45,323 --> 00:29:46,920
Yes, sir.

415
00:29:50,057 --> 00:29:52,250
I want to be discharged.

416
00:29:55,357 --> 00:29:56,690
Are you sure you'll be okay?

417
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,395
You said I'd be fine.

418
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:06,090
You mentioned having no memory of that time, right?

419
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:08,450
By any chance…

420
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:16,390
Please inform me when the victim protection measures come out.

421
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,923
I'll issue the discharge order then.

422
00:30:47,076 --> 00:30:50,590
Director, we've decided to have a farewell party together this evening.

423
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,457
Yes.

424
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,390
I'll step out for a bit and come back.

425
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,133
Please sit up straight.

426
00:31:11,523 --> 00:31:12,765
What happened?

427
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:14,790
It's Lee Jin Seok's alibi.

428
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,871
Around the time of the assault on Nam Hyo Joo,

429
00:31:15,871 --> 00:31:17,657
he was running errands at a gambling den

430
00:31:17,657 --> 00:31:19,023
when a fight started.

431
00:31:19,023 --> 00:31:20,723
They were caught in a raid.

432
00:31:20,723 --> 00:31:24,990
We've taken all the statements and secured the CCTV footage as well.

433
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,757
Ah, and also,

434
00:31:26,757 --> 00:31:29,657
    
 the DNA analysis results are out.

435
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:32,190
They don't match Mr. Lee Jin Seok.

436
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:51,209
Mr. Lee Jin Seok,

437
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,409
you can go home.

438
00:32:07,157 --> 00:32:10,023
I just have one question. Dr. Cha Jeong Woo...

439
00:32:10,023 --> 00:32:11,740
Why?

440
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,300
You think I'm going to kill that punk?

441
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:21,629
Cha Jeong Woo was in a traffic accident that day,

442
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:24,190
and woke up a few days later. He couldn't have been there.

443
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,087
That's a perfect alibi right there.

444
00:32:27,087 --> 00:32:28,774
Hey!

445
00:32:28,774 --> 00:32:31,523
When and where did that accident happen?

446
00:32:31,523 --> 00:32:34,328
Before or after that woman died?

447
00:32:35,718 --> 00:32:38,857
Do you have credible evidence you like?

448
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:41,123
 I've seen it, too. 

449
00:32:41,123 --> 00:32:45,723
 There was no official document for the traffic accident that occurred that day, right? 

450
00:32:46,623 --> 00:32:49,757
Forget it! Those damn cops.

451
00:32:49,757 --> 00:32:52,320
I don't believe it anymore.

452
00:32:53,023 --> 00:32:55,990
I'll handle it myself, so stop worrying.

453
00:33:18,683 --> 00:33:21,190
And Lee Jin Seok?

454
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,057
He was just released and returned home.

455
00:33:24,057 --> 00:33:25,890
Nam Hyo Joo's case,

456
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,241
are you sure it's not Lee Jin Seok?

457
00:33:27,241 --> 00:33:32,023
The results of the DNA analysis from under Nam Hyo Joo's fingernails

458
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:33,190
don't match his.

459
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:37,807
Is Nam Gi Taek's death also unrelated to Lee Jin Seok?

460
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,090
There were some suspicious circumstances,

461
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,922
but there's no physical evidence at all.

462
00:33:46,642 --> 00:33:49,757
So he wasn't trying

463
00:33:49,757 --> 00:33:52,157
to take revenge on me, right?

464
00:33:56,023 --> 00:33:59,357
That day, seven years ago,

465
00:33:59,357 --> 00:34:03,390
I have doubts about your accident.

466
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:06,219
What do you mean?

467
00:34:06,219 --> 00:34:08,693
The location of the accident.

468
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:10,726
To be precise,

469
00:34:10,726 --> 00:34:14,533
it's about the timing of the traffic accident.

470
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:22,120
  ­ 

471
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:27,286
   

472
00:34:32,293 --> 00:34:33,595
   

473
00:34:33,595 --> 00:34:35,196
   

474
00:34:35,196 --> 00:34:36,284
   

475
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:37,582
   

476
00:34:37,582 --> 00:34:40,326
   

477
00:34:42,426 --> 00:34:44,993
   

478
00:34:44,993 --> 00:34:47,493
   

479
00:34:52,826 --> 00:34:54,428
 When and where did that accident happen? 

480
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:55,548
   
   

481
00:34:55,548 --> 00:34:58,437
 Was it before or after that woman died? 

482
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:02,326
 The location of the accident. 

483
00:35:02,326 --> 00:35:04,426
 To be precise, 

484
00:35:04,426 --> 00:35:08,393
 it's about the timing of the traffic accident. 

485
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:12,859
Cheers!

486
00:35:17,693 --> 00:35:19,208
Although it was scheduled,

487
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:21,893
it's really sad that Director Cha is actually leaving.

488
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:24,326
- That's right. 
 - I'm truly going to miss him.

489
00:35:24,326 --> 00:35:27,926
It's not just one or two people feeling regretful.

490
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:31,426
The director doesn't seem to be able to keep his composure.

491
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:35,040
What about me?

492
00:35:35,993 --> 00:35:38,659
It's a relief to send off a time bomb, right?

493
00:35:38,659 --> 00:35:40,426
Oh? I don't think that's the case?

494
00:35:40,426 --> 00:35:42,559
That's enough.

495
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:45,526
Geez, the two of you should have a deep connection.

496
00:35:45,526 --> 00:35:48,493
When Director Cha was majoring in emergency medicine,

497
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:50,026
when he said he wanted to learn surgery,

498
00:35:50,026 --> 00:35:52,593
our director personally went to the head of the surgery department,

499
00:35:52,593 --> 00:35:54,493
to arrange for him to receive special guidance.

500
00:35:54,493 --> 00:35:56,793
That's right! He did that at the time.

501
00:35:56,793 --> 00:35:58,726
The affection was too deep.

502
00:35:58,726 --> 00:36:00,993
But the guy who should hear this story,

503
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:04,169
why hasn't he come yet?

504
00:36:04,169 --> 00:36:05,322
Hey!

505
00:36:05,322 --> 00:36:08,159
Hey, tell that story again later.

506
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:11,008
Make sure to choose the right timing.

507
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:19,126
Why are you out here?

508
00:36:19,126 --> 00:36:21,190
Have you arrived?

509
00:36:22,226 --> 00:36:24,293
Before you leave,

510
00:36:24,293 --> 00:36:26,559
I have something I must tell you.

511
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,559
I've been watching all along.

512
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:33,659
I can't miss the timing like seven years ago.

513
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:37,494
What do you mean 7 years ago?

514
00:36:39,026 --> 00:36:42,071
Back then, you...

515
00:36:42,071 --> 00:36:45,159
saved my brother.

516
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:54,126
 Jeong Woo, what's going on? 

517
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:56,288
 I'm doing manual compression for bleeding focus. 

518
00:36:56,288 --> 00:36:57,193
 His vitals… 

519
00:36:57,193 --> 00:37:01,026
It was when I was taking a break from my nursing duties to rest.

520
00:37:01,026 --> 00:37:02,493
I was moved by seeing you.

521
00:37:02,493 --> 00:37:06,759
So, I even applied for the emergency room.

522
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:10,348
I'm only now saying thank you.

523
00:37:10,348 --> 00:37:14,093
I wanted to greet you then, so I went back to the emergency room,

524
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:16,426
but you left in such a hurry,

525
00:37:16,426 --> 00:37:20,526
even jaywalking in front of the hospital.

526
00:37:20,526 --> 00:37:25,008
You saw me in front of the hospital that day?

527
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:33,493
 Answer me, Yoon Hye Jin! 

528
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:34,554
 Please help. 

529
00:37:34,554 --> 00:37:37,354
 My girlfriend is alone at home. 

530
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:47,650
Yes, you were rushing off calling Yoon Hye Jin.

531
00:37:48,459 --> 00:37:50,230
Yes.

532
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:54,193
I really thought there had been an accident then.

533
00:37:54,193 --> 00:37:56,659
Fortunately, there was no accident.

534
00:37:56,659 --> 00:38:00,126
I remember because you were in such a rush.

535
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:05,659
You're saying there was no accident in front of the hospital that day?

536
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,320
Pardon?

537
00:38:08,326 --> 00:38:09,693
Yes.

538
00:38:09,693 --> 00:38:12,193
Are you sure?

539
00:38:12,193 --> 00:38:13,793
Yes.

540
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:17,659
You took a taxi in a hurry that day.

541
00:38:22,493 --> 00:38:23,793
I'll be leaving now.

542
00:38:23,793 --> 00:38:25,126
What? No…

543
00:38:25,126 --> 00:38:27,926
Jeong Woo, everyone's waiting…

544
00:38:33,553 --> 00:38:36,793
Manager Yang, why is the director acting like that?

545
00:38:36,793 --> 00:38:40,293
Well, all of a sudden, in the middle of talking…

546
00:38:40,293 --> 00:38:42,426
What were you talking about?

547
00:38:42,426 --> 00:38:44,559
Ah, it was an old story.

548
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:47,893
   

549
00:38:51,993 --> 00:38:54,059
Senior,

550
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:55,726
why do you need the chart from seven years ago?

551
00:38:55,726 --> 00:38:57,059
I have something to check.

552
00:38:57,059 --> 00:39:00,314
Are you referring to the emergency room chart from March 24, 2016?

553
00:39:00,314 --> 00:39:02,221
Yes.

554
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:08,193
    
 You were the one here when I was transferred, right?

555
00:39:08,193 --> 00:39:09,199
Yes, I was.

556
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:11,526
Don't you remember anything?

557
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:14,659
Anything you heard from the rescue team about the accident location or…

558
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:16,826
No, there was no time to ask such things.

559
00:39:16,826 --> 00:39:20,291
But why? Is something wrong?

560
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,793
This happened so long ago that there might not be any remaining records.

561
00:39:24,793 --> 00:39:26,964
Let's talk about it later.

562
00:39:29,093 --> 00:39:30,834
Okay.

563
00:39:43,726 --> 00:39:45,926
   

564
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:50,159
The victim's fiancée's traffic accident

565
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,493
was only recorded based on the witness's mother's statement.

566
00:39:53,493 --> 00:39:55,293
But the guy who lived next door is the correct culprit.

567
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,293
That's what the evidence indicated.

568
00:39:57,293 --> 00:39:59,426
Yes, that's true.

569
00:39:59,426 --> 00:40:03,026
I need to verify something regarding the victim's significant other's accident.

570
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,335
Ah… about that,

571
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,659
the investigation was a bit sloppy.

572
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:10,293
A few days after hearing the mother's testimony,

573
00:40:10,293 --> 00:40:12,993
I looked up the records of the victim's fiancée's accident,

574
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,926
and it was different from the testimony.

575
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:17,459
I tried to check it again,

576
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:20,959
but at that time, I went on a vacation I had put off for several years,

577
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:22,426
so I stepped away from the investigation.

578
00:40:22,426 --> 00:40:26,959
I did ask the investigation team to check the documents, though.

579
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:30,893
In what ways did the witness's statement differ from the investigation records?

580
00:40:30,893 --> 00:40:33,467
The accident location,

581
00:40:33,467 --> 00:40:36,093
and the time of the accident.

582
00:40:36,093 --> 00:40:37,793
The victim's boyfriend's mother said

583
00:40:37,793 --> 00:40:41,093
that he was in an accident in front of the hospital where her son worked.

584
00:40:41,093 --> 00:40:46,526
But the 119 rescue log had a completely different location recorded.

585
00:40:48,026 --> 00:40:50,359
The accident location…

586
00:40:51,926 --> 00:40:53,226
Where was it?

587
00:40:53,226 --> 00:40:55,593
   

588
00:40:57,226 --> 00:41:00,052
What brings you here so early in the morning?

589
00:41:00,052 --> 00:41:02,893
I'm here for a consultation.

590
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:04,726
I'm a crime victim.

591
00:41:04,726 --> 00:41:09,129
They say my memory of the crime was blocked due to trauma.

592
00:41:11,626 --> 00:41:13,393
Can you help me recover that memory?

593
00:41:13,393 --> 00:41:17,526
Or should I just leave it alone?

594
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,859
Can you really handle

595
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:29,490
digging and confronting those blocked memories?

596
00:41:30,593 --> 00:41:32,986
People who block their own memories,

597
00:41:32,986 --> 00:41:36,193
do so because they can't handle the events from the past.

598
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:40,493
It's like a will to struggle and try to live somehow.

599
00:41:40,493 --> 00:41:44,100
But is there really a need to break that will?

600
00:41:44,759 --> 00:41:47,593
Let them believe what they want,

601
00:41:47,593 --> 00:41:48,913
neglect them?

602
00:41:48,913 --> 00:41:52,480
It's not neglect, it's defense.

603
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:55,400
So,

604
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,620
did you manipulate the accident to defend your son?

605
00:42:15,526 --> 00:42:19,159
 Jeong Woo is at the hospital right now. 

606
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:23,126
 He's verifying the medical records from the accident seven years ago. 

607
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:24,493
 Of course. 

608
00:42:24,493 --> 00:42:27,193
 I definitely won't tell him either. 

609
00:42:27,193 --> 00:42:30,959
Why did you hide the accident records from that day?

610
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:33,459
You forgot it yourself,

611
00:42:33,459 --> 00:42:35,593
I just helped.

612
00:42:35,593 --> 00:42:38,593
I just hoped that you would get over that wound.

613
00:42:38,593 --> 00:42:40,759
Just for that reason alone,

614
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:43,286
you gave a false statement to the police?

615
00:42:43,286 --> 00:42:46,459
Please, stop it!

616
00:42:46,459 --> 00:42:50,059
What's going to change by digging up the past?

617
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:52,826
It's not like the dead person will come back just because of that.

618
00:42:52,826 --> 00:42:54,820
Why on earth are you going to such lengths?

619
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,705
Because I need to know

620
00:42:57,705 --> 00:43:00,930
why the heck you even manipulated it.

621
00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:05,700
What on earth is it that you feel like I can't handle?

622
00:43:08,872 --> 00:43:11,426
It's not what you think.

623
00:43:11,426 --> 00:43:13,659
So please, just stop now.

624
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:15,726
Lee Jin Seok is denying the crime.

625
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:19,802
Isn't it obvious a criminal would say that?

626
00:43:21,493 --> 00:43:23,286
Yes.

627
00:43:23,286 --> 00:43:26,312
I almost thought that way, too.

628
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:30,339
Until I saw you looking so anxious.

629
00:43:33,026 --> 00:43:36,559
I'll ask one more time.

630
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:41,500
Where is the location of the accident?

631
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:46,959
Lee Jin Seok.

632
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:50,060
It's a matter unrelated to that person.

633
00:44:10,026 --> 00:44:11,026
How are you?

634
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:12,074
Dr. Cha,

635
00:44:12,074 --> 00:44:14,159
please write a treatment plan for patient Nam Hyo Joo. Nam Hyo Joo wants to be discharged.

636
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:17,626
please write a treatment plan for patient Nam Hyo Joo. Nam Hyo Joo wants to be discharged.

637
00:44:17,626 --> 00:44:19,778
I'll talk to her.

638
00:44:25,985 --> 00:44:29,352
I'm not putting in a discharge order.

639
00:44:37,872 --> 00:44:40,260
Let's postpone the discharge.

640
00:44:41,026 --> 00:44:45,059
Have the facial surgery before the discharge.

641
00:44:46,259 --> 00:44:48,726
Skin grafting and eye reconstruction surgery.

642
00:44:48,726 --> 00:44:51,459
You wanted to get it, didn't you?

643
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:53,420
You…

644
00:44:54,259 --> 00:44:56,240
and your father, too.

645
00:44:58,693 --> 00:45:02,126
Let's do the surgery before the discharge.

646
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:12,493
That worked out well.

647
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:19,126
Nam Hyo Joo is going to have the surgery?

648
00:45:19,126 --> 00:45:20,226
Why all of a sudden?

649
00:45:20,226 --> 00:45:23,692
Why do you need a reason when a doctor is proposing a treatment for a patient?

650
00:45:23,692 --> 00:45:24,726
I'll take care of the cost.

651
00:45:24,726 --> 00:45:26,117
It's not about the cost.

652
00:45:26,117 --> 00:45:28,426
I'm curious about your intention.

653
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:31,159
Your reason for saying you had something to take care of, and even putting off the Bintan trip.

654
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:33,669
Is it Nam Hyo Joo's surgery?

655
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:38,926
- Yes, you could say that. 
 - Well…

656
00:45:38,926 --> 00:45:41,793
Hey, hey! Hey!

657
00:45:41,793 --> 00:45:46,126
Putting off the scheduled departure for the sudden reconstruction operation of patient Nam Hyo Joo…

658
00:45:46,126 --> 00:45:47,726
Seems like a hasty decision.

659
00:45:47,726 --> 00:45:49,726
That's why it's a mystery.

660
00:45:49,726 --> 00:45:50,919
This isn't even an emergency.

661
00:45:50,919 --> 00:45:52,826
Are you that curious about it?

662
00:45:52,826 --> 00:45:53,926
You could just ask directly.

663
00:45:53,926 --> 00:45:57,226
Dr. Cha is not a person to openly talk about his feelings.

664
00:45:57,226 --> 00:46:00,059
You still don't know what's inside his heart?

665
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:02,359
Aren't you best friends?

666
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,193
Actually, come to think of it,

667
00:46:04,193 --> 00:46:06,793
Dr. Cha started treating crime victims

668
00:46:06,793 --> 00:46:08,793
with Ms. Nam Hyo Joo, right?

669
00:46:08,793 --> 00:46:12,626
Wanting to help her before leaving,

670
00:46:12,626 --> 00:46:14,859
isn't it something like a noble intent?

671
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:18,693
Manager, you're totally like Dr. Cha's commentary book.

672
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:21,377
Oh, right! That's true.

673
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:28,459
I took in some homeless bum and ended up paying a fine because of you!

674
00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:31,826
Hey, if you set foot in here again…

675
00:46:31,826 --> 00:46:35,293
I'm warning you, I might just kill you! F*ck!

676
00:46:37,693 --> 00:46:41,159
What is this? So unlucky!

677
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:01,640
That's right! The watch from back then!

678
00:47:20,479 --> 00:47:22,770
I remember it!

679
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:26,293
I remembered it!

680
00:47:42,005 --> 00:47:45,619
Ms. Nam Hyo Joo, come to your senses.

681
00:47:45,619 --> 00:47:47,512
Ms. Nam Hyo Joo?

682
00:47:47,512 --> 00:47:49,946
Are you okay, Hyo Joo?

683
00:47:49,946 --> 00:47:51,955
Hyo Joo.

684
00:47:54,593 --> 00:47:56,493
Can you hear me?

685
00:47:56,493 --> 00:47:58,972
Breathe, slowly.

686
00:47:58,972 --> 00:48:01,910
It's okay, take it slowly.

687
00:48:02,926 --> 00:48:06,359
It's all right, you're okay now.

688
00:48:13,593 --> 00:48:15,259
Something…

689
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,894
I feel like I saw something.

690
00:48:25,959 --> 00:48:28,159
Since Ms. Nam Hyo Joo has officially given her statement,

691
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,193
send me all the CCTV footage of the suspect.

692
00:48:31,193 --> 00:48:33,210
Okay, got it.

693
00:48:34,193 --> 00:48:37,659
I heard you quit the hospital, but you're still continuing with the treatments?

694
00:48:37,659 --> 00:48:40,759
I heard from Ms. Nam Hyo Joo that you suggested reconstructive surgery.

695
00:48:40,759 --> 00:48:44,093
I should check on the patient's condition.

696
00:48:44,093 --> 00:48:47,093
I'm reviewing Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's

697
00:48:47,093 --> 00:48:49,459
case records again.

698
00:48:52,259 --> 00:48:56,159
The official records relating to your accident seem to be missing.

699
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:58,451
Are you...

700
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:02,892
aware of that, too?

701
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,990
I'm looking into it.

702
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:13,492
Let's discuss it again.

703
00:49:28,356 --> 00:49:29,340
Mom.

704
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,655
What's with your face?

705
00:49:30,655 --> 00:49:33,810
Did you clear out all the stuff that was at the house in Gayeon-dong?

706
00:49:34,526 --> 00:49:36,259
I'm asking where it is!

707
00:49:36,259 --> 00:49:39,093
Looks like we'll have to wait a bit.

708
00:49:41,759 --> 00:49:43,899
Oh? Over there, Director Cha is coming.

709
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:45,614
Senior.

710
00:49:49,026 --> 00:49:53,659
Do you have a moment?

711
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,930
 ­  

712
00:50:38,733 --> 00:50:41,599
I'm sorry, Senior.

713
00:50:43,593 --> 00:50:46,140
So where was...

714
00:50:47,193 --> 00:50:49,293
the accident?

715
00:50:56,259 --> 00:50:57,793
 Senior! 

716
00:50:57,793 --> 00:50:58,959
 Where did the accident happen? 

717
00:50:58,959 --> 00:51:00,926
 It was a pedestrian accident that occurred in Gayeon-dong. 

718
00:51:00,926 --> 00:51:02,526
 According to the driver, someone suddenly jumped out. 

719
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,847
 - Let's go. 
 - Yes. 

720
00:51:09,326 --> 00:51:11,805
 It's you, the one who ran out of that house that day. 

721
00:51:11,805 --> 00:51:13,659
 People who block their own memories, 

722
00:51:13,659 --> 00:51:17,688
 do so because they can't handle the events from the past. 

723
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:33,610
   

724
00:51:34,819 --> 00:51:36,590
You…

725
00:51:37,439 --> 00:51:40,926
What on earth did you do in that house?

726
00:51:40,926 --> 00:51:44,111
 Do you really not know, or are you pretending not to know? 

727
00:51:44,111 --> 00:51:45,636
What do you mean?

728
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:47,268
 You don't remember? 

729
00:51:47,268 --> 00:51:51,181
 Then come over, and I'll make you remember everything. 

730
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,859
   

731
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:06,893
 Come home right now. 

732
00:52:06,893 --> 00:52:09,392
 I'll clearly show you that Cha Jeong Woo is the culprit. 

733
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:11,293
What are you talking about?

734
00:52:11,293 --> 00:52:13,242
Hello?

735
00:52:21,793 --> 00:52:22,826
 Yes, detective. 

736
00:52:22,826 --> 00:52:25,293
Come to Lee Jin Seok's house right away.

737
00:52:25,293 --> 00:52:27,490
 I'm sorry. 

738
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:32,179
 I've told Jeong Woo everything. 

739
00:53:41,378 --> 00:53:43,312
Lee Jin…

740
00:54:02,498 --> 00:54:04,094
Brother...

741
00:54:05,912 --> 00:54:09,340
Brother, can you hear me?

742
00:54:09,993 --> 00:54:11,980
Brother!

743
00:54:12,932 --> 00:54:15,165
Lee Jin Seok!

744
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:31,026
No. This can't be happening.

745
00:54:32,693 --> 00:54:34,620
Detective!

746
00:54:35,477 --> 00:54:37,359
Lee Jin Seok!

747
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,408
Lee Jin Seok, snap out of it!

748
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:52,480

 Lee Jin Seok! 

756

 Did you take personal revenge on the murderer who killed your girlfriend? 

757
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:25,137
 Regarding the case of Ms. Yoon Hye Jin, 

758
00:55:25,137 --> 00:55:27,093
 is there some secret that Lee Jin Seok could disclose? 

759
00:55:27,093 --> 00:55:28,622
 Do you think so, too? 

760
00:55:28,622 --> 00:55:31,559
 I might have killed Hye Jin. 

761
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:34,393
 Why did you hide Jeong Woo's accident? 

762
00:55:34,393 --> 00:55:35,959
 The bloodstain on the wristwatch 

763
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:38,793
 has been identified as the DNA of the victims Yoon Hye Jin and Cha Jeong Woo.

 The reason why you are so anxious right now 

765
00:55:41,293 --> 00:55:45,593
 is because you may be involved in Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's death? 

766
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:48,101
 What, a warrant? For Director Cha? 

767
00:55:48,101 --> 00:55:49,326
 A summons has been issued for the suspect 

768
00:55:49,326 --> 00:55:53,317
 It's about Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's murder case.
