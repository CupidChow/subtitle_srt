00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,567
Lee Jin…

8
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:24,301
Huh?

9
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:29,467
Brother, can you hear me?

10
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:32,314
Brother!

11
00:01:32,314 --> 00:01:34,414
Lee Jin Seok!

12
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:40,564
Senior!

13
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:43,875
What is this…

14
00:01:46,434 --> 00:01:50,047
No, this isn't right.

15
00:01:50,047 --> 00:01:53,214
Lee Jin Seok, wake up!

16
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,440
   

17
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:20,540
 ­  

18
00:02:21,586 --> 00:02:24,986
   

19
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:27,586
   

20
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:34,244
 Even if I investigate, it's true you killed her. 

21
00:02:34,244 --> 00:02:35,670
 Aish! Why would I? 

22
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,604
 Why? 

23
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:41,510
 Why steal? Why fight? 

24
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,010
 Why? 

25
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,810
 Why on earth did you kill her? 

26
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,646
 Brother, why did you 

27
00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:54,743
 do that to me and our mom? 

28
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:04,186
 Whether it's a retrial or a reinvestigation, it's not anger that moves public power, 

29
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:06,410
 but evidence. 

30
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,957
 Believable evidence. 

31
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,977
 Who's there to believe me? 

32
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:15,010
 Lee Jin Seok, 

33
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,844
 you are under emergency arrest for the attempted murder of Nam Hyo Joo. 

34
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:18,344
 Lee Min Hyeong, are you out of your mind? 

35
00:03:18,344 --> 00:03:21,144
 What are you doing? Let go! Let me go! 

36
00:03:21,144 --> 00:03:24,684
 Brother, can you hear me? 

37
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:27,377
 Brother! 

38
00:03:27,377 --> 00:03:29,608
 Lee Jin Seok! 

39
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,597
He will be okay.

40
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:38,166
Your brother will endure it.

41
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,840
  ­ 

42
00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:01,478
Dear God…

43
00:04:03,497 --> 00:04:05,490
Is there anything likely to come out?

44
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,257
Hey, everything's been erased.

45
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:12,109
There are no signs of a break-in

46
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:13,866
and he was attacked with tools found inside the house,

47
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:16,310
suggesting the culprit was an acquaintance.

48
00:04:17,612 --> 00:04:20,918
The one who found the body first is his worst enemy.

49
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:23,510
Was it a personal revenge against

50
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,644
the murderer who killed his lover?

51
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:29,844
A very strong motive for the crime.

52
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,409
   

53
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:41,910
What happened?

54
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,465
Is your brother all right?

55
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:46,543
 He's in surgery. 

56
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:47,910
 Did you find anything at the scene? 

57
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,210
Currently, Cha Jeong Woo is the prime suspect.

58
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,977
 All the circumstances point to him. 

59
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:55,810
There's no direct evidence yet?

60
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,563
 We'll have to wait for the forensic results. 

61
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,477
However,

62
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:02,016
apart from the call with Cha Jeong Woo, Lee Jin Seok

63
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:05,450
also called you. What was that call about?

64
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,983
The case from seven years ago.

65
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:10,763
He said he would prove to me that he didn't do it.

66
00:05:10,763 --> 00:05:13,130
Then, Cha Jeong Woo also…

67
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:16,882
Must have heard something similar.

68
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:31,643
Hold on a moment.

69
00:05:38,544 --> 00:05:41,210
 This is the Seoul Southern Police Station. 

70
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,610
Police station?

71
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,644
 Dr. Cha Jeong Woo is currently under investigation as a suspect. 

72
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:46,744
Suspect?

73
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:48,971
I… Hello?

74
00:05:49,637 --> 00:05:52,610
What do you mean he's a suspect?

75
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:55,058
What?

76
00:06:05,892 --> 00:06:06,777
 Yes? Talk. 

77
00:06:06,777 --> 00:06:11,282
Hey, Chae Kyeong, you need to go to the police station right now, quickly.

78
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,810
 It's you, isn't it? 

79
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,604
 The guy who ran out of the house that day. 

80
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:24,644
 You don't remember? 

81
00:06:24,644 --> 00:06:28,544
 Then, come over and I'll make you remember everything. 

82
00:07:02,184 --> 00:07:04,749
Please share with us

83
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:07,230
what you are thinking now.

84
00:07:09,077 --> 00:07:11,907
Are there no other suspects?

85
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:16,593
What do you mean?

86
00:07:17,156 --> 00:07:19,610
I heard footsteps,

87
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,482
someone rushing out.

88
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:27,277
It's probably related to the case 7 years ago.

89
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:31,560
Due to Lee Jin Seok, the past case is being dug up.

90
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,283
It must be someone who isn't comfortable with it.

91
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:36,144
What about you Dr. Cha Jeong Woo?

92
00:07:36,144 --> 00:07:39,010
Lee Jin Seok bringing up the past case again,

93
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,977
it doesn't seem like it's convenient for you either.

94
00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:45,517
Regarding Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's case, is there some kind of secret

95
00:07:45,517 --> 00:07:48,417
that Lee Jin Seok shouldn't reveal?

96
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:51,044
Fingerprints on the murder weapon,

97
00:07:51,044 --> 00:07:53,650
footprints at the crime scene, and bloodstains on the clothes and hands,

98
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,010
because he was at the scene,

99
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,777
Lee Jin Seok's statement that he saw someone was ignored,

100
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,770
and he served seven years as the criminal.

101
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,716
Is Lee Jin Seok the real culprit?

102
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,026
I'm not trying to talk about that case right now…

103
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:10,477
I found him first. A grudge relationship.

104
00:08:10,477 --> 00:08:13,844
Does that mean that the traces of someone I saw are meaningless?

105
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:16,644
Am I the culprit

106
00:08:16,644 --> 00:08:18,944
of Lee Jin Seok's assault?

107
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:30,121
You were too hasty.

108
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,093
I am Cha Jeong Woo's lawyer.

109
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:37,610
It seems you've completely ruled out the possibility of another suspect.

110
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,910
The evidence that there was someone else there…

111
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,178
has not been found yet.

112
00:08:42,178 --> 00:08:45,410
I will provide that evidence.

113
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:49,027
    
 I had a call with Mr. Lee Jin Seok

114
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:50,777
just before the incident occurred,

115
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:53,077
and someone visited the house at that time.

116
00:08:53,077 --> 00:08:55,644
At the time of that someone's visit, Dr. Cha Jeong Woo was

117
00:08:55,644 --> 00:08:59,297
on the road heading to Lee Jin Seok's house.

118
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:13,010
This is the recording of the call at that time.

119
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,344
 You said that new evidence could be grounds for an appeal, right? 

120
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:18,744
 What kind of evidence is it? 

121
00:09:18,744 --> 00:09:23,177
 Evidence that someone else was at that house where the woman died, not just me. 

122
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:27,844
 First, you have to prove that the evidence was at the scene at the time. 

123
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:29,968
 I'll bring it to you tomorrow. 

124
00:09:31,176 --> 00:09:33,572
 He's here, that rat. 

125
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,700
 What is this? 

126
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,877
 Why are you here… 

127
00:09:38,877 --> 00:09:42,750
Due to the nature of my job, I have set up automatic call recording.

128
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,333
This should be enough, right?

129
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:56,044
I have received your report.

130
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:58,144
It seems we were too hasty.

131
00:09:58,144 --> 00:10:01,483
We apologize for the emergency arrest.

132
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:03,226
Yes.

133
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:07,077
Don't worry too much about

134
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:09,577
what Lee Jin Seok said.

135
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,410
Even the nonsense about evidence or memories

136
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,877
is all just to provoke the victims.

137
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:19,210
Just ignore it.

138
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,244
Bye, then.

139
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,669
Don't turn off your phone

140
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:34,444
and don't go to places where you can't be contacted.

141
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:36,344
Detective Seo asked me to tell you that.

142
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,651
So, I'm still a suspect.

143
00:10:39,651 --> 00:10:44,784
Yes. So, don't put yourself in danger trying to investigate it on your own.

144
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:46,984
I'm requesting that of you as your friend.

145
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:51,544
What is the evidence Lee Jin Seok talked about?

146
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:56,910
About the evidence that there was someone else at the scene that day.

147
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,024
He didn't say anything else?

148
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:02,611
Just one question.

149
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:04,911
Not as a friend, but as a lawyer.

150
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:09,304
What do you want to confirm with Lee Jin Seok?

151
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:13,950
Before and even today,

152
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,181
you seem very anxious.

153
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,750
My accident 7 years ago...

154
00:11:20,644 --> 00:11:23,004
was in front of Hye Jin's house.

155
00:11:23,536 --> 00:11:25,911
Not in front of the hospital?

156
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,310
Then…

157
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:32,510
Were you at Hye Jin's house that day, too?

158
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,944
 I saw someone running out of that house. 

159
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:39,110
 When I went in, someone ran out of that house. 

160
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,343
No matter what happens to me in the future,

161
00:11:44,343 --> 00:11:46,970
don't come running like you did today.

162
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,703
I don't want to cause you trouble.

163
00:11:49,703 --> 00:11:51,670
That is my request.

164
00:11:57,877 --> 00:12:00,910
 Dr. Cha Jeong Woo's alibi has been confirmed. 

165
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,944
 It seems like the culprit took the evidence your brother told you about. 

166
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,577
 Cha Jeong Woo and I received phone calls around 8:00 p.m. 

167
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:14,110
 Then come over and I'll make you remember everything. 

168
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,044
 Come home right now. 

169
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:18,377
 I'll clearly show you that Cha Jeong Woo is the culprit. 

170
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:22,477
 The call with the lawyer was at 8:15 p.m. 

171
00:12:22,477 --> 00:12:26,277
 At that time, someone visited Lee Jin Seok's house. 

172
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:30,489
 Why are you here? 

173
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:34,944
 Then, Cha Jeong Woo arrived around 8:30 p.m. 

174
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:41,177
 Someone attacked Lee Jin Seok 

175
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:45,510
 during these 15 minutes and left the house. 

176
00:12:53,644 --> 00:12:56,577
 The fact that they didn't bump into Dr. Cha Jeong Woo means 

177
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:59,477
 there must be another way… 

178
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:08,410
 The only route the culprit could have gone is here. 

179
00:13:28,844 --> 00:13:30,977
What are you doing?

180
00:13:35,577 --> 00:13:37,410
Do you not know how dangerous it is

181
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,477
for the prime suspect to be loitering at the scene?

182
00:13:39,477 --> 00:13:41,910
If I don't want to change from suspect to criminal,

183
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,156
shouldn't I catch the real culprit?

184
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,923
That's the police department's job.

185
00:13:47,836 --> 00:13:49,530
It's blood.

186
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,840
If the sound of footsteps on the rooftop had disappeared, this would have been the only way.

187
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:58,477
What exactly do you want to confirm?

188
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:06,450
I checked the records of the accident from 7 years ago.

189
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,210
It was a traffic accident in front of Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's house.

190
00:14:13,777 --> 00:14:16,577
I found out not long ago myself.

191
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:19,744
That there's an error in my memory.

192
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:22,970
Do you want to confirm if it's really

193
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,189
the person Lee Jin Seok said he saw?

194
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:29,604
So you rushed here immediately after receiving Lee Jin Seok's call?

195
00:14:29,604 --> 00:14:32,971
The reason you are this anxious right now,

196
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:40,088
is it because you're worried that you...

197
00:14:40,877 --> 00:14:44,144
might be involved in the death of Ms. Yoon Hye Jin?

198
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,969
Once the Lee Jin Seok case is solved,

199
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:56,844
we can talk.

200
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,744
 The reason you are this anxious right now, 

201
00:15:36,277 --> 00:15:38,244
 is it because you're worried that you 

202
00:15:38,244 --> 00:15:41,560
 might be involved in the death of Ms. Yoon Hye Jin? 

203
00:15:42,044 --> 00:15:44,010
 It's you, isn't it? 

204
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,688
 The guy who ran out of the house that day. 

205
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,020
 ­  

206
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,943
My face doesn't look like my face.

207
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:12,877
This face looks like mine.

208
00:16:12,877 --> 00:16:15,277
Why did you come to think that?

209
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:17,677
I don't really know the reason either,

210
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,880
I just have a feeling…

211
00:16:20,444 --> 00:16:22,749
Due to a traffic accident last year,

212
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,510
I was injured and had facial surgery.

213
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,744
I have no memory before the accident.

214
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:28,944
But I happened to see this photo

215
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:30,477
and something just came to mind.

216
00:16:30,477 --> 00:16:34,748
I feel like my facial injury wasn't from a car accident.

217
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:39,944
What exactly do you want to consult with me about?

218
00:16:39,944 --> 00:16:42,278
This face seems like it's mine, doesn't it?

219
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:44,815
What do you think, Doctor?

220
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,344
The consultation I can offer

221
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:25,243
is about what cosmetic surgery a patient wants.

222
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:28,637
For circumstances of facial trauma or past surgeries,

223
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:31,244
you should talk with your family.

224
00:17:31,244 --> 00:17:34,456
As for now, there is nothing I can say.

225
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:08,477
   

226
00:18:08,477 --> 00:18:10,944
Is Mr. Lee Jin Seok okay?

227
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,110
They said he is improving

228
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,077
and expect he'll regain consciousness soon.

229
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:19,044
That's a relief.

230
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,977
Is there any new development?

231
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,877
No traces on the fire extinguisher that is presumed to be the weapon.

232
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:28,510
And the footprints collected from the entrance and rooftop railing

233
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,877
don't match Dr. Cha Jeong Woo's.

234
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:33,310
What about the blood found in the collection box?

235
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,622
It's not Cha Jeong Woo's.

236
00:18:35,622 --> 00:18:37,707
Regarding the ex-convicts around Mr. Lee Jin Seok,

237
00:18:37,707 --> 00:18:39,787
we ran a DB check, but none of them are a match.

238
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:41,177
   
   

239
00:18:41,177 --> 00:18:42,477
Did they find blood?

240
00:18:42,477 --> 00:18:44,806
Yes, along the expected escape route.

241
00:18:44,806 --> 00:18:48,054
But we don't have a comparison sample yet…

242
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:52,477
Detective Lee, you are off of this case.

243
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:53,910
An investigation involving family…

244
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,410
Don't cause unnecessary gossip.

245
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:00,044
Lee Jin Seok's assault

246
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:02,910
is clearly connected to the incident 7 years ago.

247
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,145
I'll look into it.

248
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:08,303
Leaving her out of the case is a bit…

249
00:19:08,303 --> 00:19:10,620
Principles are principles.

250
00:19:11,177 --> 00:19:12,903
Report right away if anything comes up.

251
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:14,360
Yes, sir.

252
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,039
For now, I'll collect all the CCTV footage around Mr. Lee Jin Seok's house.

253
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,344
The exact time of leaving the scene is clear.

254
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:33,444
If we thoroughly investigate around that time, something is bound to come up.

255
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:37,636
Why go to the police station instead of Bintan, like you were told?

256
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,177
How far are you actually planning to go?

257
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:43,223
What do you mean by attempted murder suspect?

258
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,410
Did you know?

259
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,044
About what?

260
00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:49,510
That my memory regarding the accident

261
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,686
is flawed?

262
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,211
I didn't know.

263
00:19:58,444 --> 00:20:00,977
Anyway, what are you going to do now?

264
00:20:00,977 --> 00:20:03,850
The fact that Lee Jin Seok, who denied the crime, was attacked

265
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,777
suggests that there might be a different perpetrator for the incident.

266
00:20:07,777 --> 00:20:12,110
We need to find who attacked Lee Jin Seok.

267
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,677
Anyway, what did Han Woo Jin do yesterday?

268
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:19,010
Why Woo Jin? Now what, huh?

269
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:24,244
I was busy running around getting a lawyer for Jeong Woo on the case.

270
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:27,810
I asked you to keep an eye on him, so he wouldn't get into trouble.

271
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:31,430
Why?

272
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,344
Should we stick together so I can monitor him 24/7 or what?

273
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:35,456
Can you move your face away?

274
00:20:35,456 --> 00:20:37,827
Yeah, it's burdensome for me, too.

275
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,244
What is this?

276
00:20:41,244 --> 00:20:43,029
I thought it was a photo from our middle school days.

277
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:44,937
Weren't our uniforms similar to this?

278
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:47,503
It's something a counseling patient left behind.

279
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,362
Ah, it brings back old memories.

280
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:54,472
I transferred schools in the first year of middle school, and that's when we met.

281
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,110
I didn't know back then,

282
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:01,177
that my friend Cha Jeong Woo would become an attempted murder suspect.

283
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,536
Would he have known?

284
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,850
I have a consultation.

285
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:10,361
Let's go. Go.

286
00:21:22,344 --> 00:21:25,670
You also didn't know about Jeong Woo's accident?

287
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:29,204
I was in Singapore for a conference that day.

288
00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:34,544
You returned the next day, right?

289
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:38,409
Did you hear anything in particular from Professor Yoon?

290
00:21:40,436 --> 00:21:43,443
How about asking her directly?

291
00:21:43,443 --> 00:21:45,160
   

292
00:21:46,277 --> 00:21:49,210
- Forget it. 
 - Answer the phone.

293
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,450
Stay by his side for now and

294
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,579
take care of him, so he doesn't get distracted.

295
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:04,777
Jeong Woo's condition is really okay,

296
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:07,510
so don't worry too much, Madam.

297
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,609
Also, he is not the real suspect.

298
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:11,177
It just happened that way.

299
00:22:11,177 --> 00:22:12,944
 Right, let's talk again later. 

300
00:22:12,944 --> 00:22:15,410
Excuse me, please wait.

301
00:22:16,497 --> 00:22:19,484
I have something I'm curious about.

302
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:21,857
About Jeong Woo's accident…

303
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:24,077
Why did you hide it?

304
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:27,122
 That accident that happened in front of Ms. Hye Jin's house. 

305
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,456
What good would come from being involved with a dead person's affairs?

306
00:22:31,456 --> 00:22:34,423
I just wanted to forget about it quickly.

307
00:22:34,944 --> 00:22:37,110
Take care.

308
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,960
 ­  

309
00:23:02,677 --> 00:23:04,677
 Because I need to know 

310
00:23:04,677 --> 00:23:07,744
 why you even manipulated it. 

311
00:23:08,516 --> 00:23:11,616
   

312
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:33,810
 I looked up the records of the victim's fiancé's accident, 

313
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,229
 and it was different from the testimony. 

314
00:23:35,229 --> 00:23:36,977
 I tried to check it again, 

315
00:23:36,977 --> 00:23:39,590
 but at that time, I went on a vacation I had put off for several years. 

316
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:44,177
 I did ask the investigation team to check the documents, though. 

317
00:23:50,077 --> 00:23:54,044
   

318
00:24:00,144 --> 00:24:02,910
Hello, I'm sorry for the late hour.

319
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,344
This is Detective Lee Min Hyeong.

320
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:08,544
 Ah, yes. However, why are you calling? 

321
00:24:08,544 --> 00:24:12,410
It's about the accident record of Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's partner.

322
00:24:12,943 --> 00:24:17,283
Who on the investigations team did you pass it along to back then?

323
00:24:17,283 --> 00:24:19,077
 Oh, that case, 

324
00:24:19,077 --> 00:24:21,613
 I handed it over to Detective Choi Hyeong Il back then. 

325
00:24:25,044 --> 00:24:27,810
Yes… I understand.

326
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,464
 Did they find blood? 

327
00:24:37,464 --> 00:24:40,254
 Detective Lee, you are off of this case. 

328
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:57,167
You must be very concerned.

329
00:25:00,044 --> 00:25:03,777
I came to apologize for the inadequate investigation.

330
00:25:04,923 --> 00:25:06,144
You still don't know who—

331
00:25:06,144 --> 00:25:11,010
I will do my best to resolve it as quickly as possible.

332
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,860
How is Mr. Lee Jin Seok doing?

333
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:18,077
Fortunately, the intracranial pressure is decreasing.

334
00:25:18,077 --> 00:25:22,310
The CT results are good, and he is expected to recover soon.

335
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,755
That's a relief.

336
00:25:25,473 --> 00:25:27,810
I don't have anything to offer you.

337
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,510
No, it's all right.

338
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,144
Still, you've come all this way…

339
00:25:32,144 --> 00:25:34,344
Just a moment.

340
00:25:44,537 --> 00:25:47,104
 I request this urgently. 

341
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,477
   

342
00:26:07,136 --> 00:26:09,144
How did it go?

343
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:10,277
The DNA matches, right?

344
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:13,444
Yes, it matches.

345
00:26:14,644 --> 00:26:17,977
 Fortunately, the intracranial pressure is decreasing. 

346
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:20,448
 The CT results are good, 

347
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:23,144
 and he is expected to recover soon. 

348
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,544
 Why are you here? 

349
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:48,510
   

350
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,110
 Let's meet in court later. 

351
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,744
 Since I have found the evidence, 

352
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,363
 I'm about to apply for a retrial. 

353
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,377
 Evidence? 

354
00:26:56,377 --> 00:27:00,097
 Ah, I said I didn't kill her! 

355
00:27:01,843 --> 00:27:04,070
 I'll see you in court. 

356
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,298
 Okay? 

357
00:27:05,298 --> 00:27:09,744
 I'll expose how incompetent a police officer you are! 

358
00:27:09,744 --> 00:27:11,516
 Please leave. 

359
00:27:13,284 --> 00:27:17,150
 You're done for! 

360
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,590
 What? 

361
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,270
 What are you doing? 

362
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,291
What are you doing?

363
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,491
No, I just…

364
00:28:15,926 --> 00:28:19,141
It was strange that you knew about the evidence.

365
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:23,127
 Don't worry too much about 

366
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:25,437
 what Lee Jin Seok said. 

367
00:28:26,301 --> 00:28:29,553
 Even the nonsense about evidence or memories 

368
00:28:29,553 --> 00:28:32,112
 is all just to provoke the victims. 

369
00:28:32,112 --> 00:28:35,358
It was revealed just before leaving the interrogation room.

370
00:28:35,358 --> 00:28:37,252
How did you know that?

371
00:28:37,252 --> 00:28:40,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

372
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,333
I'll let you know.

373
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,093
 It's a bloodstain. 

374
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:48,593
 If the sound of footsteps on the rooftop had disappeared, 

375
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:51,262
 this would have been the only way. 

376
00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:55,862
Why did you do that to Lee Jin Seok?

377
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,250
What are you hiding?

378
00:28:59,726 --> 00:29:04,593
What on earth are you hiding about that incident 7 years ago?

379
00:29:06,993 --> 00:29:08,993
Jin Seok!

380
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,093
Jin… Jin Seok!

381
00:29:11,093 --> 00:29:12,261
Call the medical team!

382
00:29:12,261 --> 00:29:14,671
Over here!

383
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,637
Ah, what's this?

384
00:29:33,026 --> 00:29:34,448
   

385
00:29:34,448 --> 00:29:36,493
   

386
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,380
Thank you so much.

387
00:29:57,986 --> 00:30:00,586
He is going to be fine now.

388
00:30:01,993 --> 00:30:04,440
That's such a relief.

389
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,060
 I thought about it for seven years. Why I would have killed her. 

390
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:12,593
 However, no matter how much I thought about it, I couldn't figure it out. 

391
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:14,093
 Why? 

392
00:30:14,093 --> 00:30:15,726
 Because I didn't kill her. 

393
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:17,395
 Did you really not kill her? 

394
00:30:17,395 --> 00:30:19,245
 No, I didn't kill her. 

395
00:30:19,245 --> 00:30:21,293
 I really didn't do it! 

396
00:30:21,293 --> 00:30:25,126
 But why were all your fingerprints found? 

397
00:30:25,126 --> 00:30:27,260
 On the front door, 

398
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,526
 on the victim's body, 

399
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:31,626
 everywhere, even on the weapon! 

400
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:35,426
 No, they would have been imprinted because I went into that house. 

401
00:30:35,426 --> 00:30:37,160
 But it wasn't me. 

402
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,926
 When I entered, that woman was already dead— 

403
00:30:38,926 --> 00:30:42,704
 Who would believe the word of a drug-addict with a criminal record? 

404
00:30:43,852 --> 00:30:47,652
 Living a life that way, and now talking nonsense… 

405
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,076
 Do you want to see 

406
00:30:54,076 --> 00:30:57,626
 your sister strip off her uniform? 

407
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,693
 Congratulations on your promotion. 

408
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:06,693
 - Congratulations. 
 - Catching a murderer who is a druggy is the best case! 

409
00:31:06,693 --> 00:31:10,526
 I'll treat you guys to a meal.  Don't worry, okay? 

410
00:31:17,652 --> 00:31:19,333
 Senior, 

411
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:21,826
 it looks like we need to reinvestigate the victim's lover. 

412
00:31:21,826 --> 00:31:23,326
 About the victim's partner, Cha Jeong Woo... 

413
00:31:23,326 --> 00:31:25,384
The accident took place in Gayeon-dong. 
    

414
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,026
It's in front of the dead victim's house. 
     

415
00:31:30,993 --> 00:31:32,660
 Got it. 

416
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,560
 - Yeah, I'll check it out. 
 - Okay. 

417
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,580
 Is the accident location important at this time? 

418
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,526
 It doesn't seem to be beneficial for either party. 

419
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,466
 To my son who lost his fiancée, as well as 

420
00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:50,074
 the detective who has already apprehended the offender. 

421
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:03,793
   

422
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:08,033
No one cared...

423
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:11,660
about the victim's partner's accident.

424
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,540
If it weren't for that moment of hesitation,

425
00:32:18,926 --> 00:32:23,214
Cha Jeong Woo would have become a prime suspect. And, if so,

426
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,726
that accident wouldn't have been buried.

427
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:31,160
Please cooperate with us,

428
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:35,219
so we can complete that investigation.

429
00:32:36,026 --> 00:32:38,491
The evidence that Lee Jin Seok said he found,

430
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:40,860
you have it. Right?

431
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,526
What's with those eyes?

432
00:32:49,293 --> 00:32:51,765
I basically died and came back to life.

433
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,796
Are you crying?

434
00:32:58,052 --> 00:33:01,052
It would be better to just get angry.

435
00:33:02,012 --> 00:33:06,279
Having a sibling who won't believe a word her brother says.

436
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,146
Am I even a detective? I'd rather see you angry.

437
00:33:23,425 --> 00:33:25,606
I'm sorry.

438
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:27,725
What?

439
00:33:27,725 --> 00:33:30,060
Why are you saying what I should be saying?

440
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,093
Makes me even sorrier.

441
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,212
To Mom… and to you…

442
00:33:36,026 --> 00:33:39,293
But Mom believed in you until the end.

443
00:33:40,126 --> 00:33:43,020
- I… 
 - You must catch...

444
00:33:44,586 --> 00:33:47,480
the real criminal who killed that woman.

445
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:50,687
Go after him as if your life depended on it.

446
00:33:50,687 --> 00:33:52,712
I will.

447
00:33:56,426 --> 00:33:58,466
What about the evidence I found?

448
00:33:58,466 --> 00:34:00,833
It's under investigation right now.

449
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,780
What about Cha Jeong Woo?

450
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:05,685
That too.

451
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:08,485
Is there anything else I should know?

452
00:34:11,026 --> 00:34:14,660
I was sure it was that guy,

453
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,426
but I didn't know what to do, so I just kept watching, you know?

454
00:34:19,633 --> 00:34:23,133
Then it came to me, the way that punk left.

455
00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:27,113
In that memory, Cha Jeong Woo

456
00:34:27,113 --> 00:34:30,260
doesn't seem like he was running away.

457
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,219
What… What does that mean?

458
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:36,180
It's not that he was running away,

459
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:39,180
it was more like he was chasing after someone.

460
00:34:51,993 --> 00:34:54,426
   

461
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:03,277
I've checked the purchase history of Cha Jeong Woo before the incident 7 years ago.

462
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,595
What's most significant is,

463
00:35:05,595 --> 00:35:07,026
the time it stopped 
    

464
00:35:07,026 --> 00:35:09,693
on March 24th, the day Ms. Yoon Hye Jin died.

465
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:12,593
It stopped precisely at 8:20 p.m.

466
00:35:14,493 --> 00:35:15,826
According to the investigation records,

467
00:35:15,826 --> 00:35:18,370
the police were dispatched to the scene upon a neighbor's report

468
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,560
at 10:37 p.m.

469
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,326
At the scene, where Ms. Yoon Hye Jin died,

470
00:35:23,326 --> 00:35:25,901
it suggests that Cha Jeong Woo was also there.

471
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:29,494
We have secured a statement from the team leader

472
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,546
that there were clear mistakes made during the investigation.

473
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,620
And we now have a new suspect.

474
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,352
With this much, a reinvestigation should be possible.

475
00:35:40,714 --> 00:35:43,959
This means your brother can file for a retrial.

476
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:46,426
Isn't this good news?

477
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:52,349
For now, let's request a forensic examination of the bloodstain and wait for the results.

478
00:35:54,726 --> 00:35:57,326
   

479
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:12,658
How about Detective Choi Hyeong Il?

480
00:36:12,658 --> 00:36:14,646
He admitted everything.

481
00:36:14,646 --> 00:36:16,593
That there were mistakes in the investigation.

482
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:19,060
By mistakes, are you referring to

483
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:23,113
how my accident records were written differently from the actual event?

484
00:36:23,986 --> 00:36:28,253
He just covered up matters that should have been further investigated.

485
00:36:29,927 --> 00:36:32,893
What about the evidence that Lee Jin Seok discovered?

486
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,526
It is presumed to have been found at the scene of Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's incident.

487
00:36:53,017 --> 00:36:55,859
Ultimately, the investigations that were not conducted...

488
00:36:56,492 --> 00:36:58,792
were about me.

489
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:08,519
You can't remember anything

490
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:10,819
that happened that day?

491
00:37:13,894 --> 00:37:16,979
Depending on the results of the wristwatch analysis,

492
00:37:16,979 --> 00:37:19,752
you could become a suspect.

493
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,300
I understand.

494
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,107
Understand what?

495
00:37:27,953 --> 00:37:30,186
What do you understand?

496
00:37:32,593 --> 00:37:34,193
Do you think I'm saying you are now a suspect,

497
00:37:34,193 --> 00:37:37,620
so don't run away, and wait for the investigation.

498
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,553
Is that what you think I'm telling you?

499
00:37:41,866 --> 00:37:44,828
Then, do you want to hear an apology?

500
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:48,560
Being a suspect myself, I mistakenly believed Lee Jin Seok to be the culprit.

501
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,693
Do you think I'm confronting someone who is confused

502
00:37:50,693 --> 00:37:53,893
and frustrated just to receive an apology?

503
00:37:53,893 --> 00:37:56,826
Not "I understand," but "Why would I?"

504
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,735
If you've realized that the investigation and memories of that day were wrong,

505
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,539
shouldn't you do something about it?

506
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:09,432
Saying, "I understand," and accept it like that.

507
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:42,160
  ­ 

508
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:50,693
Director Cha said you would come back for the photo, so

509
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:53,082
I've been keeping it safe.

510
00:38:54,194 --> 00:38:56,294
Thank you.

511
00:39:11,826 --> 00:39:13,993
 - Let's just stop. 
 - Stop what? 

512
00:39:13,993 --> 00:39:16,493
 Stop what! 

513
00:39:19,393 --> 00:39:21,426
 What! 

514
00:39:37,393 --> 00:39:39,185
I…

515
00:39:40,633 --> 00:39:43,118
need another consultation.

516
00:39:44,002 --> 00:39:45,728
We only offer consultations related to plastic surgery…

517
00:39:45,728 --> 00:39:48,219
Yes, surgery.

518
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:52,086
I'll do it too, plastic surgery.

519
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:55,793
   
   

520
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:59,092
My family keeps saying it was a car accident.

521
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:02,426
If it was a car accident, there should have been other injuries, too.

522
00:40:02,426 --> 00:40:05,433
So I got the surgery confirmation just in case.

523
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:07,450
It was just the face…

524
00:40:08,892 --> 00:40:12,559
So what kind of surgery are you planning to do?

525
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:14,824
Back to my original face.

526
00:40:16,453 --> 00:40:18,916
Please perform surgery to give me this face.

527
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:24,274
If you had reconstructive surgery due to facial trauma,

528
00:40:24,274 --> 00:40:28,244
it would be the best choice to get it done by the same medical team.

529
00:40:28,244 --> 00:40:30,766
Without any particular abnormalities or problems,

530
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:34,408
we cannot perform surgery for emotional reasons alone.

531
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:44,673
Doctor, there's a family member of the patient,

532
00:40:44,673 --> 00:40:47,699
who asked to stop the consultation.

533
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:50,133
What are you doing here?

534
00:40:55,473 --> 00:40:57,231
I'm sorry.

535
00:40:57,231 --> 00:40:58,566
My brother

536
00:40:58,566 --> 00:41:02,147
has body integrity dysphoria. 
    

537
00:41:02,147 --> 00:41:03,253
Excuse me.

538
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,640
Let's talk outside.

539
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,800
Talk about what?

540
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,611
You're not even answering my questions.

541
00:41:11,926 --> 00:41:14,659
Let's go out for now, okay?

542
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:16,243
I'm going to have surgery.

543
00:41:16,243 --> 00:41:17,643
You never know.

544
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:19,076
If I get my original face back,

545
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,209
I might remember why I became like this.

546
00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:22,476
 Are you crazy? 

547
00:41:22,476 --> 00:41:24,376
 What do you mean "restore the face to its original state"? 

548
00:41:24,376 --> 00:41:27,309
 Excuse me, both of you, please step outside for now. Okay? 

549
00:41:27,309 --> 00:41:28,909
 For now, please go outside… 

550
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:31,876
Let's do it, the surgery.

551
00:41:36,848 --> 00:41:39,376
Let's do a restoration surgery to your original face.

552
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:42,948
Will his memory return if he gets plastic surgery?

553
00:41:42,948 --> 00:41:44,676
We have to try something,

554
00:41:44,676 --> 00:41:48,309
if the person wants to regain their memory.

555
00:41:50,837 --> 00:41:52,543
If you want to keep this face,

556
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:55,176
we should start by reconstructing the resected cheekbones.

557
00:41:55,176 --> 00:41:56,952
Just a moment.

558
00:42:06,455 --> 00:42:11,022
So, you are curious about why your face ended up like that, eh?

559
00:42:14,427 --> 00:42:16,308
That was you.

560
00:42:16,308 --> 00:42:19,147
The one who ruined your face like that,

561
00:42:19,147 --> 00:42:20,960
it was you!

562
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,016
 - Stop! 
 - Stop what? 

563
00:42:22,016 --> 00:42:23,115
 I said stop it. Just stop… 

564
00:42:23,115 --> 00:42:24,543
 Stop what! 

565
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:28,109
Not as a traffic accident victim, 
    

566
00:42:28,109 --> 00:42:30,061
but as a school violence perpetrator.

567
00:42:30,061 --> 00:42:33,528
With that friend who was always with you.

568
00:42:35,143 --> 00:42:38,150
You want to recover the memory that...

569
00:42:38,743 --> 00:42:41,332
would have been better left unknown?

570
00:42:50,843 --> 00:42:53,143
It's a perfect betrayal by memory.

571
00:42:53,143 --> 00:42:56,204
Since his personal information was exposed as a school bully,

572
00:42:56,204 --> 00:42:58,219
they decided to change what he looked like

573
00:42:58,219 --> 00:43:00,061
since he was going to do reconstructive surgery anyway.

574
00:43:00,061 --> 00:43:03,272
Claiming it to be a truth better left unknown,

575
00:43:03,272 --> 00:43:05,413
is it right to hide it from the person themselves?

576
00:43:05,413 --> 00:43:07,309
If it's family,

577
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:09,776
I think I would cover it up, too.

578
00:43:09,776 --> 00:43:11,822
He can't remember anyway.

579
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,976
Why unearth a dark past if there's nothing good in it?

580
00:43:14,976 --> 00:43:17,576
 You want to recover the memory that 

581
00:43:17,576 --> 00:43:20,009
 would have been better left unknown? 

582
00:43:20,009 --> 00:43:22,343
 Can you really handle 

583
00:43:22,343 --> 00:43:26,326
 confronting those blocked memories? 

584
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:35,809
Hey! What? Restorative surgery?

585
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:38,943
Wow! That empathy is no joke.

586
00:43:40,943 --> 00:43:43,815
What? Restoring the face to recover memories?

587
00:43:43,815 --> 00:43:46,796
I thought I was watching a sci-fi movie.

588
00:43:48,776 --> 00:43:51,743
What do you think that patient is feeling?

589
00:43:51,743 --> 00:43:54,343
Well, he must be having huge regrets by now.

590
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:58,309
It's better being a traffic accident victim than being a perpetrator.

591
00:44:01,088 --> 00:44:03,943
Do you think so, too?

592
00:44:03,943 --> 00:44:06,309
That I might have...

593
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:09,209
killed Hye Jin.

594
00:44:09,209 --> 00:44:10,876
What?

595
00:44:12,643 --> 00:44:16,120
Just like that patient, who was betrayed by his memory,

596
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,354
turns out I am a suspect.

597
00:44:18,354 --> 00:44:20,446
Hey!

598
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:23,043
Hey, make some sense, will you?

599
00:44:23,043 --> 00:44:25,329
Jeong Woo, why would you?

600
00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:34,962
Jeong Woo,

601
00:44:34,962 --> 00:44:37,609
just buy your ticket and leave the country as soon as possible.

602
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:39,909
Your mother's also making a fuss to send you off,

603
00:44:39,909 --> 00:44:44,062
and the director is also very troubled by the delay in your dispatch schedule.

604
00:44:44,062 --> 00:44:47,062
Let's just shake it all off and forget it, okay?

605
00:44:48,388 --> 00:44:51,821
Shouldn't you go your own way, too?

606
00:45:16,128 --> 00:45:18,735
I found it.

607
00:45:18,735 --> 00:45:22,237
CCTV footage of a suspect in Nam Hyo Joo's assault case!

608
00:45:24,276 --> 00:45:26,776
   

609
00:45:26,776 --> 00:45:28,876
   

610
00:45:31,475 --> 00:45:34,643
The guy who left that house on the day of Nam Gi Taek's death, and this guy here!

611
00:45:34,643 --> 00:45:36,443
We ran the forensic anthropology comparison program,

612
00:45:36,443 --> 00:45:38,809
and body proportions match 90 to 95%!

613
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:40,743
It's a perfect match for the same person.

614
00:45:40,743 --> 00:45:42,343
Here.

615
00:45:42,343 --> 00:45:44,843
Do you see the zipper pocket near the shoulder of the outer garment, right?

616
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:46,876
It's the same.

617
00:45:46,876 --> 00:45:48,176
What about the subsequent movements?

618
00:45:48,176 --> 00:45:50,309
I found a few more CCTVs in the vicinity.

619
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:53,609
We need to scan more, including the nearby subway stations.

620
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:55,715
What about the forensic results on Dr. Cha Jeong Woo's wristwatch?

621
00:45:55,715 --> 00:45:58,776
They said it would come out by tomorrow morning.

622
00:45:58,776 --> 00:46:00,619
Regardless of the results, Dr. Cha Jeong Woo

623
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:03,376
is likely to be summoned for investigation

624
00:46:03,376 --> 00:46:06,226
because of Team Leader Choi's statement.

625
00:46:07,021 --> 00:46:09,022
We'll know when the results come out.

626
00:46:09,022 --> 00:46:11,522
You focus on tracking the suspect's movements.

627
00:46:11,522 --> 00:46:13,232
Yes, ma'am.

628
00:46:24,009 --> 00:46:26,468
What are you doing?

629
00:46:26,468 --> 00:46:28,376
Uh…

630
00:46:28,376 --> 00:46:30,047
What brings you here?

631
00:46:30,047 --> 00:46:32,837
Well, I came to check on the patient's condition.

632
00:46:32,837 --> 00:46:33,971
At this hour?

633
00:46:33,971 --> 00:46:39,322
All because of someone, I can't leave work at a proper time, worrying over him.

634
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:52,253
I'm still in danger, aren't I?

635
00:46:54,137 --> 00:46:55,876
Every night,

636
00:46:55,876 --> 00:46:58,643
I see you come and go in front of the door several times.

637
00:46:58,643 --> 00:47:00,843
You don't need to worry about it.

638
00:47:00,843 --> 00:47:04,209
As we'll schedule the surgery soon,

639
00:47:04,209 --> 00:47:07,343
just take good care of yourself.

640
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:35,476
I received it in the emergency room, when you had the accident.

641
00:47:35,476 --> 00:47:38,243
I thought it had been lost.

642
00:47:39,243 --> 00:47:42,043
Why did you have it?

643
00:47:43,509 --> 00:47:48,272
The reason I kept silent about your accident…

644
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:04,076
There are a few more photos sent anonymously, similar to this.

645
00:48:16,509 --> 00:48:18,776
For you to have erased the memory of that day,

646
00:48:18,776 --> 00:48:21,944
there must've been a significant reason, don't you think?

647
00:48:22,509 --> 00:48:26,394
 I'm sorry, I should have told you earlier. 

648
00:48:27,743 --> 00:48:30,143
 Go ahead with your trip as scheduled. 

649
00:48:30,143 --> 00:48:33,509
 Just until this situation is settled. 

650
00:48:37,476 --> 00:48:38,843
   
   

651
00:48:38,843 --> 00:48:40,032
   

652
00:48:40,032 --> 00:48:41,088
   

653
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:42,276
   

654
00:48:42,276 --> 00:48:45,543
   

655
00:48:45,543 --> 00:48:47,943
We can skip the greetings.

656
00:48:47,943 --> 00:48:50,243
I'm just a team leader here on a temporary basis.

657
00:48:50,243 --> 00:48:51,743
I'm not someone with free time.

658
00:48:51,743 --> 00:48:54,968
Since there's no time, just briefly touch on the core points.

659
00:48:59,709 --> 00:49:01,409
Let's get started.

660
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:03,809
The traffic accident involving Cha Jeong Woo, who is the deceased victim's lover,

661
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:05,176
contrary to the investigation records at the time,

662
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:08,343
was confirmed to have occurred in front of the victim's house.

663
00:49:08,343 --> 00:49:11,009
And the wristwatch that Cha Jeong Woo was wearing that day

664
00:49:11,009 --> 00:49:13,176
has been confirmed as evidence found at the scene.

665
00:49:13,176 --> 00:49:14,509
According to the forensic analysis,

666
00:49:14,509 --> 00:49:16,376
the bloodstains on the wristwatch

667
00:49:16,376 --> 00:49:20,309
were identified as the DNA of both the victim, Yoon Hye Jin, and Cha Jeong Woo.

668
00:49:24,243 --> 00:49:26,609
If the case had been verified properly from the beginning,

669
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:29,443
this trouble wouldn't have happened.

670
00:49:29,443 --> 00:49:31,776
For now, let's start by summoning Cha Jeong Woo

671
00:49:31,776 --> 00:49:34,488
and, if additional evidence comes out, we'll formalize the reinvestigation then.

672
00:49:34,488 --> 00:49:36,243
However, from that wristwatch, an unidentified

673
00:49:36,243 --> 00:49:38,632
male's DNA was also detected.

674
00:49:38,632 --> 00:49:41,209
Oh my goodness!

675
00:49:41,209 --> 00:49:42,309
Is there another suspect?

676
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:44,676
After looking more into the situation,

677
00:49:44,676 --> 00:49:46,843
it seems best to decide on the direction of the investigation.

678
00:49:46,843 --> 00:49:49,076
Specifying the DNA will take quite some time.

679
00:49:49,076 --> 00:49:51,676
I heard that Dr. Cha Jeong Woo will be quitting the hospital.

680
00:49:51,676 --> 00:49:54,204
For now, it might be best to start with a summoning him for questioning.

681
00:49:54,204 --> 00:49:57,843
Even if Dr. Cha Jeong Woo was at the scene, that alone is not evidence of murder.

682
00:49:57,843 --> 00:49:59,976
From fingerprints to footprints, even theft of items at the scene,

683
00:49:59,976 --> 00:50:02,643
there were a lot of evidence against Lee Jin Seok.

684
00:50:04,109 --> 00:50:05,943
Anyway,

685
00:50:05,943 --> 00:50:10,043
he is a key person who needs to be interviewed as a reference.

686
00:50:10,043 --> 00:50:11,709
If Cha Jeong Woo disappears after quitting the hospital,

687
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:13,843
how do you intend to deal with the aftermath?

688
00:50:13,843 --> 00:50:16,336
Don't waste time, just summon him first.

689
00:50:16,336 --> 00:50:18,009
Yes, sir.

690
00:50:54,422 --> 00:50:56,509
What's the progress? Have you found Dr. Cha Jeong Woo?

691
00:50:56,509 --> 00:50:59,455
 No, did he run off after learning about the forensic results? 

692
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:02,476
We'll look into it more, and if it's not fruitful, we'll have to put him on the wanted list.

693
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,743
I'll withdraw for now.

694
00:51:03,743 --> 00:51:05,876
Okay.

695
00:51:10,148 --> 00:51:11,109
What is this?

696
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,443
What? Put him on the wanted list?

697
00:51:12,443 --> 00:51:13,543
Are you talking about Director Cha?

698
00:51:13,543 --> 00:51:15,048
Where is Dr. Cha Jeong Woo?

699
00:51:15,048 --> 00:51:16,282
I haven't been able to get in touch with him.

700
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:20,819
But, please, tell me what the matter is first.

701
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:21,969
The summoning of a suspect has been issued.

702
00:51:21,969 --> 00:51:24,602
Ah, suspect of what?

703
00:51:25,955 --> 00:51:28,589
The murder case of Ms. Yoon Hye Jin.

704
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:41,976
 Go ahead with your trip as scheduled. 

705
00:51:41,976 --> 00:51:45,309
 Just until this situation is settled. 

706
00:52:06,808 --> 00:52:09,969
 In that memory, Cha Jeong Woo 

707
00:52:09,969 --> 00:52:13,242
 doesn't seem like he was running away. 

708
00:52:13,242 --> 00:52:15,943
 What does that mean? 

709
00:52:15,943 --> 00:52:18,509
 It's not that he was running away, 

710
00:52:19,075 --> 00:52:22,271
 it was more like he was chasing after someone. 

711
00:52:23,409 --> 00:52:26,929
   

712
00:52:26,929 --> 00:52:30,072
Yes, team leader, have the DNA forensic results come out?

713
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:33,576
What about Cha Jeong Woo?

714
00:52:33,576 --> 00:52:35,443
He's not at home or at the hospital.

715
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:39,062
I think we need to report to the team leader and put him on the wanted list.

716
00:52:39,062 --> 00:52:42,896
I'm almost there, so I'll go in and tell you.

717
00:52:53,121 --> 00:52:55,552
Come with me!

718
00:53:03,062 --> 00:53:06,323
What? Isn't that Cha Jeong Woo?

719
00:53:07,415 --> 00:53:11,543
Did you come voluntarily to be investigated as a suspect?

720
00:53:11,543 --> 00:53:13,902
Seeing as you blocked that investigation,

721
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:17,289
you must be confident that I'm not the culprit.

722
00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:19,102
Then could it be…

723
00:53:19,102 --> 00:53:22,765
You were confused and thought that you really might have killed your fiancé?

724
00:53:23,662 --> 00:53:26,495
What about the wristwatch forensics?

725
00:53:29,244 --> 00:53:31,509
The bloodstains on the watch

726
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:34,743
match the DNA of Yoon Hye Jin and yours.

727
00:53:34,743 --> 00:53:38,043
And another person's DNA was also detected.

728
00:53:38,043 --> 00:53:40,916
That day, I had an accident while chasing the culprit.

729
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:44,467
You are not a suspect, but a witness.

730
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,479
But how did you find out about this story?

731
00:53:47,479 --> 00:53:49,602
You told me not to "understand,"

732
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:52,762
but to wonder, "Why would I?"

733
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,600
There was someone else that day.

734
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,828
The real culprit of that day

735
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:10,475
is on the move again.

736
00:54:14,169 --> 00:54:16,069
Don't worry.

737
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:18,735
I definitely won't miss him this time.

738
00:54:20,422 --> 00:54:24,164
So where are we going now?

739
00:54:28,443 --> 00:54:30,667
To meet the real culprit.

740
00:54:43,008 --> 00:54:45,664
   

741
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:59,950
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 ✨ The Marvellous ✨ Team @ Viki.com  

742
00:55:03,808 --> 00:55:05,109
 It's the suspect's evidence. 

743
00:55:05,109 --> 00:55:07,983
 Please reinvestigate Yoon Hye Jin's murder case. 

744
00:55:07,983 --> 00:55:10,942
 Cha Jeong Woo is refusing to remember the criminal. 

745
00:55:10,942 --> 00:55:12,930
 Does that mean the person is that shocking? 

746
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:15,564
 If we need to find that reason, we have to start from here. 

747
00:55:15,564 --> 00:55:18,965
 It says you were not favorable to your son's marriage. 

748
00:55:18,965 --> 00:55:21,279
  Do you have any idea who it might be? 
   

749
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:24,076
 In the end, both in the past and now, the criminal 

750
00:55:24,076 --> 00:55:26,675
 is moving around you, Cha Jeong Woo. 

751
00:55:26,675 --> 00:55:29,888
 I have to find him, the real culprit. 

752
00:55:29,888 --> 00:55:32,762
 I think I saw that guy.
