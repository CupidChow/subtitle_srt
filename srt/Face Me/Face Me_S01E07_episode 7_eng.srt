1
00:00:08,654 --> 00:00:13,625
   

2
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:20,461
   

3
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,502
   

4
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:37,053
   

5
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:51,950



6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,920
   

7
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:12,518
Find out...

8
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:16,023
where Lee Jin Seok is right now.

9
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:24,697
You have to find him before I do.

10
00:01:36,084 --> 00:01:38,084
 It's that man. 
   

11
00:01:38,084 --> 00:01:40,984
 That man from the day the neighbor died. 

12
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:43,084
 He's in my house right now. 

13
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:44,351
Lee Jin Seok?

14
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:46,451
 Hyo Joo is in danger. 

15
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:49,003
 Please help, I beg you! 

16
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:50,837
Miss Hyo Joo!

17
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,283
Code Zero occurring with Ms. Nam Hyo Joo right now.

18
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:12,350
Request urgent dispatch to Nakwon Apartment in Gangsin-gu.

19
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:16,951
Are you talking about Nam Hyo Joo, Nam Gi Taek's daughter?

20
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:18,918
We'll talk about it later.

21
00:03:11,603 --> 00:03:13,403
Stop it!

22
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,720
  ­ 

23
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,818
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo?

24
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,951
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo!

25
00:04:19,903 --> 00:04:21,084
How is her condition now?

26
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:22,618
Per visual inspection, the wound areas are

27
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:24,363
on the wrist and the thigh, two places.

28
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:26,151
And it seems the artery in the wrist is damaged.

29
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:28,818
So we are compressing it by tying it.

30
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,218
- How long has it been compressed? 
 - Two minutes.

31
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:36,021
Keep compressing 
    

32
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:37,077
while checking her finger circulation.

33
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,351
Okay.

34
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:40,260
Let me take a look.

35
00:04:43,518 --> 00:04:45,018
The femoral artery is ruptured.

36
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,951
- Do you have a manual blood pressure monitor? 
 - Yes.

37
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:59,274
- Maintain it at 130 and transfer her. 
 - Yes, sir.

38
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:05,442
How is it?

39
00:05:05,442 --> 00:05:06,704
If the artery is damaged—

40
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:09,304
Just check Lee Jin Seok's location.

41
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,584
What happened?

42
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:14,936
Location of Lee Jin Seok's phone?

43
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:16,444
I've requested a search. It should come up soon.

44
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:18,965
Let me know immediately if you get it, and control the scene from here.

45
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:21,537
When Forensics arrive, ask them to secure the evidence, starting near the sofa.

46
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:22,577
Yes, but Dr. Cha Jeong Woo…

47
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:24,657
Let's talk later.

48
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,190
Yes.

49
00:05:43,278 --> 00:05:46,031
 It was that man. 

50
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:48,677
 The day the neighbor died. 

51
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,384
 Tape on the bottom of the sneakers. 

52
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:56,718
 Yes, it's the person I saw. 

53
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:08,977
 No… 

54
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:10,867
 Stop it! 

55
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,684
 Please save me! Help! 

56
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:33,943
I thought I had to do something, so I just started taking pictures.

57
00:06:35,524 --> 00:06:38,584
If only I had been a little faster…

58
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:41,551
Then Hyo Joo wouldn't have been injured so much.

59
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:44,310
No.

60
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,651
You are the one who saved Hyo Joo.

61
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:50,668
You must be going through a lot, yet you're still helping like this.

62
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:53,137
Hyo Joo...

63
00:06:53,137 --> 00:06:55,501
will be okay, right?

64
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:09,084
Blood pressure is dropping!

65
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:11,514
The femoral artery has been severed and is retracting into the muscle.

66
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,584
The bleeding won't stop.

67
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:14,651
How far to the hospital?

68
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:17,451
If there's no blockage, we can get there in 5 minutes.

69
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:20,078
What's going on?

70
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:25,418
It's an emergency patient.

71
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:27,518
We need to get to the hospital in less than 5 minutes to save her.

72
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:29,151
There's an accident in the tunnel.

73
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:31,218
A cargo truck has overturned and blocked the road!

74
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:34,942
It's more chaotic ahead, so it might be better to turn back.

75
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:36,277
If we take another route around the tunnel,

76
00:07:36,277 --> 00:07:39,296
it will take about 20 minutes to get to the hospital.

77
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:40,690
The blood pressure is dropping.

78
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,264
It's cardiac arrest!

79
00:07:42,264 --> 00:07:44,218
Defibrillator!

80
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:45,380
Give me epinephrine!

81
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,118
   

82
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,271
One, two, three.

83
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,942
- Ready! 
 - One, two, three.

84
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:08,975
Here we go! One, two, three!

85
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:13,684
 So, what? 

86
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:16,150
 Is surgery possible or not? 

87
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,784
 This is a cosmetic surgery clinic. 

88
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:20,318
 We do not do reconstructive surgery. 

89
00:08:20,318 --> 00:08:22,034
 What? 

90
00:08:34,945 --> 00:08:36,924
 Who is it? 

91
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:39,818
 The person who killed my father. 

92
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:41,630
 The killer? 

93
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,030
 They said he might be someone with a grudge against you. 

94
00:08:54,803 --> 00:08:56,606
It's back.

95
00:09:03,118 --> 00:09:05,853
- What about the blood? 
 - This is the last of it.

96
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:08,630
She won't last long.

97
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,917
- I'll give a direct transfusion. 
 - What?

98
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,047
I'm type O.

99
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:26,851
It seems Miss Hyo Joo scratched the perpetrator's wrist while resisting.

100
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:29,862
With luck, we might be able to secure the culprit's DNA, too.

101
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:33,351
The thigh has a vessel injury.

102
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:36,451
The right wrist is suspected to have radial artery and nerve tendon injuries.

103
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,091
There was a cardiac arrest during transport.

104
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:40,067
Yes, I understand.

105
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:42,381
What happened?

106
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,837
There is a lot of bleeding.

107
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:46,001
Stopping the bleeding in the femoral artery should be the priority.

108
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,251
Contact the trauma team and set up the ECMO.

109
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:50,351
Ah, they said you transfused blood directly?

110
00:09:50,351 --> 00:09:51,951
Aren't you dizzy? Take a break.

111
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:53,784
I'll let you know as soon as the results are out.

112
00:09:53,784 --> 00:09:54,951
Operating room 3 is open.

113
00:09:54,951 --> 00:09:56,251
The trauma team is all ready.

114
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:57,851
Let's go.

115
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:10,251
 Code Blue! Code Blue! 

116
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:12,818
 Unit 1, 5th floor, neurosurgery intensive care unit. 

117
00:10:12,818 --> 00:10:15,618
 Unit 1, 5th floor, neurosurgery intensive care unit. 

118
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:17,318
 Code Blue! Code Blue! 

119
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:20,751
 Unit 1, 5th floor, neurosurgery intensive care unit. 

120
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:37,118
   

121
00:10:39,351 --> 00:10:41,477
 How is Hyo Joo's condition? 

122
00:10:41,477 --> 00:10:44,543
She was just taken up to the operating room.

123
00:10:46,117 --> 00:10:48,330
The crime scene investigation team will go there.

124
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:51,018
Nam Hyo Joo resisted during the attack,

125
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,751
and it seems that the assailant was also injured at that time.

126
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:56,684
 There might be DNA left behind. 

127
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,184
I would like to ask for your cooperation.

128
00:11:53,484 --> 00:11:55,084
How's her condition?

129
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:58,716
She's passed the critical phase and is stable now.

130
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:03,170
The amount of bleeding was an issue, but you saved her.

131
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,936
It's been a while since I've seen you like this.

132
00:12:06,744 --> 00:12:08,693
We've secured the femoral artery and vein.

133
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:12,251
It's a stab wound, but all it needs is proper suturing…

134
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:14,377
The problem isn't the leg; it's the wrist.

135
00:12:14,377 --> 00:12:16,786
The issue is with the nerve connections?

136
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:18,051
You know, right?

137
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:20,884
Our hospital can't perform the hand reattachment.

138
00:12:20,884 --> 00:12:23,684
To go to a specialized hospital for hand reattachment with a microscope,

139
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:26,718
she will need to go to Gwangmyeong city, but there's no time.

140
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:29,951
Otherwise…

141
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:32,248
What? Otherwise?

142
00:12:32,248 --> 00:12:33,918
Well...

143
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:35,939
If someone capable can do it with loupe lenses,

144
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:38,051
without the microscope, then…

145
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:41,809
It looks like there's enough willingness.

146
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:46,188
But still, it can't be done here.

147
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:47,283
You know.

148
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:50,860
The director won't allow you to use the operating room.

149
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,278
Prepare for the transfer.

150
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:55,318
Yes, doctor.

151
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:57,591
Just in case, hang a pack of RBCs, too.

152
00:12:57,591 --> 00:12:59,770
Understood.

153
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,155
Ah, but won't you

154
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:04,670
need an assistant?

155
00:13:06,788 --> 00:13:09,118
Hey, what are you talking about?

156
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:11,384
What time is it now? Surgery now?

157
00:13:11,384 --> 00:13:12,891
Come to the hospital now.

158
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:14,937
But what can I do?

159
00:13:14,937 --> 00:13:17,984
It seems you're a step behind.

160
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:21,734
I'm already anesthetized by alcohol.

161
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,051
Understood.

162
00:13:24,051 --> 00:13:26,751
But what sudden surgery are you doing tonight?

163
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:28,651
Hello…

164
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,118
He's too cool.

165
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:41,018
A surgery in the middle of the night?

166
00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:59,964
So, is Dr. Song also on standby?

167
00:14:01,484 --> 00:14:05,718
Oh, dear. Everyone is struggling through the night.

168
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:13,518
Anyway, provide as much support as Director Cha wants.

169
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:16,718
Yes, that's right. Yes. Thank you.

170
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:23,018
What surgery is Jeong Woo performing at this hour?

171
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:24,199
Huh…

172
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:28,999
It seems they've brought in a crime victim from the scene.

173
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:35,774
As for the Bintan dispatch, we need to send him immediately.

174
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:38,284
No.

175
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:40,084
It's not a dispatch, it's a refuge.

176
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:42,600
That's what you said, making him angry.

177
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:44,518
The approval is still pending.

178
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:47,451
We have to get the approval by any means.

179
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:50,457
Yoon Hye Jin…

180
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:53,818
The criminal who killed her has been released.

181
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:58,251
That incident is not in the past for Jeong Woo yet.

182
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:00,184
You saw it, too.

183
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:01,578
The fuss he's making is because he's in pain.

184
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:05,551
If he's in pain, he needs surgery or treatment.

185
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:07,884
Do you think it'll work out just by covering it up?

186
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:16,584
I don't think the problem is that he can't forget the deceased.

187
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,184
What's the reason?

188
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:23,555
The real reason you want Jeong Woo to escape from him.

189
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,243
Not being able to forget the dead.

190
00:15:31,823 --> 00:15:34,473
That's the real problem.

191
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:21,318
I'm thinking of finishing now that we've completed the forensic examination

192
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:23,651
from the entrance to the bedroom near the sofa.

193
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,751
If you want anything else, please let us know.

194
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,677
She said the criminal entered by pressing the door lock code.

195
00:16:28,677 --> 00:16:32,251
I'm wondering if there might be traces of a miniature camera being attached.

196
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:35,437
That's possible.

197
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:37,777
There have been similar cases.

198
00:16:46,684 --> 00:16:47,885
- Detective. 
 - Yes?

199
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:50,252
We've located Lee Jin Seok.

200
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:03,984
- I entrust you with today's work. 
 - Yes.

201
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:06,884
Dr. Kim will repair the right femur.

202
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:09,070
I'll start with the wrist.

203
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,774
Yes.

204
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,984
Castro and smooth forceps, please.

205
00:17:13,984 --> 00:17:16,648
I will remove the staples first.

206
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:24,840
The thigh suturing will be done layer by layer.

207
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,618
   

208
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:27,217
Insert a Hemovac drain. 
    

209
00:17:27,217 --> 00:17:29,157
You can do it, right?

210
00:17:29,157 --> 00:17:32,355
Hand me the forceps, please.

211
00:17:37,418 --> 00:17:39,684
I will suture the nerve.

212
00:18:14,684 --> 00:18:17,129
Did this person come here by chance?

213
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,677
Yes, he was here.

214
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:38,051
Who is Lee Jin Seok?

215
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:41,684
Isn't it a bit too much

216
00:18:41,684 --> 00:18:43,584
to ask for an emergency arrest, because his phone signal

217
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:46,651
was located nearby, at the time of the incident?

218
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:48,518
We have to arrest him and check his alibi.

219
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:50,562
You know this is not like you, right?

220
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:58,117
He's my older brother… Lee Jin Seok.

221
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:01,777
He is the culprit of the Gayeon-dong bride-to-be murder case seven years ago.

222
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:04,648
The victim was Dr. Cha Jeong Woo's girlfriend.

223
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:07,218
While I was investigating whether

224
00:19:07,218 --> 00:19:08,711
he was involved in the death of Mr. Nam Gi Taek

225
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:11,203
because of bad feelings towards Mr. Cha Jeong Woo,

226
00:19:11,203 --> 00:19:13,878
the incident with Nam Hyo Joo happened.

227
00:19:40,237 --> 00:19:43,450
Hey, what happened?

228
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,684
You brought Ms. Nam Hyo Joo directly from the crime scene?

229
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:48,818
There was something like that.

230
00:19:48,818 --> 00:19:49,949
Hm?

231
00:19:49,949 --> 00:19:51,283
Hold on a second.

232
00:19:51,283 --> 00:19:53,918
Then, were you with Detective Lee again, by any chance?

233
00:19:53,918 --> 00:19:55,384
What were you two up to at this hour?

234
00:19:55,384 --> 00:19:57,184
Why are you here at this time?

235
00:19:57,184 --> 00:19:58,551
You said you were drinking.

236
00:19:58,551 --> 00:20:01,684
There's a sudden surgery, so I had to come and check it out.

237
00:20:01,684 --> 00:20:05,811
I can't just be cool like someone because I'm a softy.

238
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:13,353
- Ms. Hyo Joo— 
 - What about Lee Jin Seok?

239
00:20:13,353 --> 00:20:16,620
It seems that's what you need to know.

240
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,220
We're looking for him.

241
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,320
- I will find him soon— 
 - What do you think about it?

242
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,253
Do you really think Lee Jin Seok

243
00:20:22,253 --> 00:20:25,126
is doing this to take revenge on me?

244
00:20:26,193 --> 00:20:27,894
Wait a minute, that…

245
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,240
Lee Jin Seok?

246
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,453
So are you saying Lee Jin Seok is the one who did that to Ms. Nam Hyo Joo?

247
00:20:32,453 --> 00:20:34,760
I don't know.

248
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,274
It's not because Lee Jin Seok is my older brother,

249
00:20:38,274 --> 00:20:40,780
but the reason he's doing this to you

250
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,108
is not convincing to me.

251
00:20:47,153 --> 00:20:49,287
Wait a second. Older brother?

252
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:52,833
So, Lee Jin Seok's younger sister is Detective Lee?

253
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,567
Did I hear that wrong or something?

254
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:19,173
   

255
00:21:42,753 --> 00:21:45,720
   

256
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:53,920
   

257
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,853
   u

258
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,420
   

259
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,120
   

260
00:22:21,219 --> 00:22:23,032
 Just wait. 

261
00:22:23,032 --> 00:22:26,032
 Because I am preparing something as well. 

262
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,033
 What are you up to? 

263
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,180
   

264
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,887
Was the wound about this long then?

265
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:40,520
About 20 cm or so.

266
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,187
Then I went like, swoosh!

267
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:46,087
I was an intern back then, and the senior doctors said things like,

268
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:49,718
"You're born to be a surgeon!"

269
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:51,220
Really?

270
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,420
Then how did you become a plastic surgeon?

271
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,160
Ever since I was young,

272
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,159
I liked pretty things.

273
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,887
I wanted to enhance all the girls' beauty with my own hands.

274
00:23:01,887 --> 00:23:03,854
You were a playboy from a young age.

275
00:23:03,854 --> 00:23:05,211
Hey, hey!

276
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:06,787
You see,

277
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:09,526
despite how it seems, I am a pure romantic at heart.

278
00:23:09,526 --> 00:23:11,220
You don't even know.

279
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,987
- Oh, you're here? 
 - Oh, Director.

280
00:23:12,987 --> 00:23:16,633
Why are you talking about old times so early in the morning?

281
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:18,525
Was it obvious?

282
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:20,393
How's patient Nam Hyo Joo's condition?

283
00:23:20,393 --> 00:23:23,853
She is now resting in the room.

284
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:26,120
But how was it Director Cha knew

285
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,053
and brought the patient in from the scene?

286
00:23:28,053 --> 00:23:32,053
Well, I haven't really heard anything specific.

287
00:23:32,053 --> 00:23:34,280
Do you know anything about patient Nam Hyo Joo's case?

288
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,453
Even if I did, I don't.

289
00:23:36,453 --> 00:23:37,487
Gosh, darn it.

290
00:23:37,487 --> 00:23:40,018
Should I make something out of nothing?

291
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,453
Well, I've heard something like,

292
00:23:43,453 --> 00:23:45,520
Lee Jin Seok was trying to take revenge on Jeong Woo

293
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,387
by deliberately involving Mr. Nam Gi Taek or something like that.

294
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,620
Does that mean Nam Hyo Joo's attack was also his doing?

295
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,520
Is he like a total psycho serial-something? That sort of thing?

296
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,987
I don't know. How can I know that?

297
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:02,087
Anyway, please draw the line properly this time.

298
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:05,253
It's not a good look with the cops coming in and out of the hospital.

299
00:24:05,253 --> 00:24:07,553
Seeing Jeong Woo unable to focus on his main job while taking care of the victim,

300
00:24:07,553 --> 00:24:09,520
it's killing me with anxiety.

301
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,953
I feel uneasy, too.

302
00:24:29,086 --> 00:24:32,653
Ms. Hyo Joo! Ms. Hyo Joo!

303
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:36,472
Just a moment, please.

304
00:24:36,472 --> 00:24:39,472
It won't be good if her psychological state is unstable.

305
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,353
Considering Director Cha performed the surgery with care,

306
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:44,539
there shouldn't be any major issues.

307
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:46,887
It's important to rest for now.

308
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:48,953
I don't know.

309
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:51,020
Nothing.

310
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,304
I can't remember anything.

311
00:24:53,304 --> 00:24:55,020
Ms. Nam Hyo Joo,

312
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,520
after microsurgery, blood circulation is very important.

313
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,386
That's why you need to rest.

314
00:25:00,386 --> 00:25:01,924
Let's go.

315
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,899
I can't remember.

316
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:16,832
If I could remember, we could catch the culprit…

317
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:20,153
I'm sorry.

318
00:25:20,153 --> 00:25:22,787
It's not your fault.

319
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:26,087
You don't remember that, either?

320
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:28,259
That I don't give up?

321
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,353
   

322
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,820
   

323
00:26:13,553 --> 00:26:14,953
Jeong Woo.

324
00:26:14,953 --> 00:26:17,787
This morning, Detective Lee came to see patient Nam Hyo Joo

325
00:26:17,787 --> 00:26:19,620
when we were checking on her.

326
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,787
The surgical site and vitals are all good.

327
00:26:28,293 --> 00:26:30,560
   

328
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,487
Hey, you can't possibly…

329
00:26:34,487 --> 00:26:36,153
You are not going to take this to Ms. Nam Hyo Joo,

330
00:26:36,153 --> 00:26:40,220
to confirm whether Lee Jin Seok is the culprit, are you?

331
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,587
That would be the most definitive way, I guess.

332
00:26:42,587 --> 00:26:44,553
Are you crazy?

333
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:48,020
Hey, Ms. Nam Hyo Joo said she can't remember.

334
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,620
Memory block due to shock—

335
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:58,088
You know what that is… Right, sorry.

336
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,853
If he really wanted to take revenge on me,

337
00:27:04,853 --> 00:27:08,553
he should have pointed the knife at me. Isn't that right?

338
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,320
There are many ways to screw someone over.

339
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,187
Is stabbing and ramming the only way to take revenge?

340
00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:24,453
The culprit of the Gayeon-dong bride-to-be murder case seven years ago.

341
00:27:24,453 --> 00:27:27,431
Lee Jin Seok. 
    

342
00:27:27,431 --> 00:27:29,987
He is the suspect in the Nam Hyo Joo assault case that happened yesterday.

343
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:33,887
The incident from 7 years ago and Nam Hyo Joo or Nam Gi Taek's case,

344
00:27:33,887 --> 00:27:36,396
how are they related?

345
00:27:36,953 --> 00:27:40,020
Harboring a grudge against Cha Jeong Woo, the boyfriend of the deceased victim,

346
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,787
there are chances of a staged homicide

347
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:43,553
to take revenge on Cha Jeong Woo.

348
00:27:43,553 --> 00:27:45,634
In that process, while trying to harm the neighbor witness,

349
00:27:45,634 --> 00:27:47,220
he ended up assaulting Ms. Nam Hyo Joo—

350
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,636
Detectives should investigate. Why are you writing fiction?

351
00:27:53,787 --> 00:27:55,853
If Lee Jin Seok is the offender,

352
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:57,920
why would he take revenge on the victim's boyfriend?

353
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,053
Leaving the person he has a grudge against alone,

354
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:01,287
why is he going around causing trouble to others?

355
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:05,853
There was a physical altercation with Dr. Cha during the transfer process 7 years ago.

356
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,787
And, at that time, his face and personal information were all revealed—

357
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:08,920
Ah, that's right.

358
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,953
There were explosive news articles about it then,

359
00:28:10,953 --> 00:28:12,561
and it was a huge issue as he was labeled a national murderer.

360
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:14,828
I didn't ask you.

361
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,687
I heard it directly.

362
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,487
Lee Jin Seok...

363
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,297
is my older brother.

364
00:28:32,187 --> 00:28:33,853
Everyone, except her, leave.

365
00:28:33,853 --> 00:28:35,314
With the team leader's promotion review coming up,

366
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:37,353
it's a sensitive time to be caught in this trouble.

367
00:28:37,353 --> 00:28:38,673
Entering the headquarters,

368
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:41,287
as the new senior superintendent is his dream.

369
00:28:48,653 --> 00:28:51,253
Did you find any evidence connecting

370
00:28:51,253 --> 00:28:53,553
Lee Jin Seok to Nam Gi Taek's death?

371
00:28:53,553 --> 00:28:55,620
We secured CCTV footage

372
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,146
from near Nam Gi Taek's house around the estimated time of death.

373
00:29:00,146 --> 00:29:03,092
But there's no evidence yet that he entered inside.

374
00:29:03,092 --> 00:29:04,753
What about the evidence of the attack on Nam Hyo Joo?

375
00:29:04,753 --> 00:29:07,855
At the time of the incident, the phone's location was confirmed to be nearby.

376
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:09,946
At that time,

377
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:13,633
everyone who had a phone in the vicinity would be a suspect?

378
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:15,154
Considering his connection with Nam Gi Taek—

379
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:16,398
If he weren't your brother,

380
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:18,592
would the conclusion be the same?

381
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:21,100
Based on just one phone location?

382
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,720
You are worried about getting your career stained.

383
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,612
I understand you want to get rid of your criminal brother.

384
00:29:30,612 --> 00:29:34,639
But is it okay to use public authority to settle your personal feelings like that?

385
00:29:35,287 --> 00:29:37,787
It is true that it is a sensitive matter to me,

386
00:29:37,787 --> 00:29:42,720
but I can't just cover up the circumstances and doubts simply because he is family.

387
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,787
Regarding Lee Jin Seok's alibi

388
00:29:50,787 --> 00:29:54,309
and the forensic results, I will check them myself, so you need to stay away from this case.

389
00:29:55,453 --> 00:29:57,453
From now on,

390
00:29:57,453 --> 00:30:00,920
if you try stirring up internal investigations or whatever without reporting,

391
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,520
I won't let it slide. So, behave yourself.

392
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,953
Please put Lee Jin Seok on the wanted list.

393
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:16,820
You're really...

394
00:30:19,293 --> 00:30:21,553
 I don't know. 

395
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:25,120
 It's not because Lee Jin Seok is my older brother, 

396
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,693
 but the reason he's doing this to you 

397
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:30,126
 is not convincing to me. 

398
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:41,592
   

399
00:30:49,132 --> 00:30:51,387
   

400
00:31:03,753 --> 00:31:06,487
You want me to check Lee Jin Seok's investigation status?

401
00:31:06,487 --> 00:31:09,053
 It's somewhat related to a patient in the hospital. 

402
00:31:09,053 --> 00:31:10,920
You could just ask Detective Lee.

403
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,448
Detective Lee and Lee Jin Seok...

404
00:31:14,613 --> 00:31:16,253
are family.

405
00:31:16,253 --> 00:31:19,587
That detective sibling is Lee Min Hyeong?

406
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:23,453
Please find out if Lee Jin Seok is the culprit.

407
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:24,420
And if he is?

408
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,953
No, what will you do if he isn't?

409
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:30,520
I need to find out the real reason why he appeared before me

410
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,287
right after his release.

411
00:31:33,287 --> 00:31:35,353
 Jeong Woo. 

412
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:38,420
I'm counting on you. I'll hang up now.

413
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,295
Hey, Cha Jeong—

414
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:15,471
I'm sorry.

415
00:32:17,064 --> 00:32:18,811
Did he do that on purpose?

416
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:21,304
Do you know much is at stake here?

417
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,605
This is crazy!

418
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:25,287
Darn it!

419
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:28,130
Pay up, you punk!

420
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:35,310
Good job.

421
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,277
I've recovered everything those rats took.

422
00:32:38,277 --> 00:32:40,177
Thank you.

423
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,894
   

424
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,272
   

425
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,787
   

426
00:32:57,407 --> 00:32:59,153
 Just wait. 

427
00:32:59,153 --> 00:33:01,153
 Because I am preparing something as well. 

428
00:33:01,153 --> 00:33:03,120
   

429
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,901
   

430
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:07,620
 While looking into a retrial, 

431
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:11,287
 he approached Dr. Cha Jeong Woo. 

432
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:12,620
   

433
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,306
   

434
00:33:16,306 --> 00:33:18,506
 Why on earth? 

435
00:33:19,453 --> 00:33:21,587
 It's not about revenge, 
   

436
00:33:21,587 --> 00:33:24,987
 but to confirm something with Dr. Cha Jeong Woo? 

437
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:36,987
Lee Jin Seok is on the wanted list.

438
00:33:36,987 --> 00:33:40,320
But are you really going to be okay?

439
00:33:40,887 --> 00:33:43,187
I have to verify what needs to be verified.

440
00:33:51,087 --> 00:33:56,220
 There's still no evidence that Lee Jin Seok is the attacker of Nam Hyo Joo. 

441
00:34:34,153 --> 00:34:36,360
What brings you here?

442
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,440
How did you know about this place?

443
00:34:48,932 --> 00:34:51,665
We should set up a stakeout for now.

444
00:35:07,092 --> 00:35:08,893
Hm?

445
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:11,692
Oh, my! Who do we have here?

446
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,553
Hey, it's been a long time.

447
00:35:13,553 --> 00:35:15,887
But what made you call at this hour?

448
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,186
What?

449
00:35:19,186 --> 00:35:21,620
What's the situation now?

450
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,887
Well, good work, everyone. You should head home quickly.

451
00:35:24,887 --> 00:35:27,287
- Manager Yang? 
 - She's over there.

452
00:35:27,287 --> 00:35:28,212
Oh, Manager Yang,

453
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:30,118
I was hoping you could stay, instead of going home.

454
00:35:30,118 --> 00:35:31,253
Excuse me?

455
00:35:31,253 --> 00:35:34,507
No… why? Is there something wrong?

456
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,380
- Is Director Cha inside? 
 - No.

457
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,420
He left early today, saying he had something to do.

458
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,153
Ah, really?

459
00:35:41,153 --> 00:35:43,628
Ah, call him, and tell him there's an emergency patient.

460
00:35:43,628 --> 00:35:44,720
Right now?

461
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,187
Ah… They said they were on their way to the hospital now.

462
00:35:50,087 --> 00:35:51,787
What kind of patient at this hour?

463
00:35:51,787 --> 00:35:54,887
Oh, geez! Give that to me!

464
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:58,986
They say it's an emergency, and why are you asking about the kind of patient?

465
00:35:58,986 --> 00:36:01,191
Just come back!

466
00:36:25,987 --> 00:36:27,312
No, not yet.

467
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:29,379
There's nothing special.

468
00:36:45,014 --> 00:36:48,180
 It's the actress from the agency where my friend is a representative. 

469
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:52,525
Slowly, slowly…

470
00:36:54,805 --> 00:36:57,487
 She had hip prosthesis surgery 3 weeks ago. 

471
00:36:57,487 --> 00:37:01,053
 It looks like the prosthesis has suddenly moved from its original position. 

472
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:06,142
Bring something like a wheelchair.

473
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:07,879
Wheelchair?

474
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:09,779
Are you okay?

475
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:14,373
I'm okay.

476
00:37:14,373 --> 00:37:17,106
- I'll go. 
 - Okay.

477
00:37:21,746 --> 00:37:23,552
Hello!

478
00:37:24,853 --> 00:37:27,453
 The surgeon who operated is abroad now, 

479
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,820
 so I was contacted urgently. 

480
00:37:31,846 --> 00:37:33,946
Can you do it?

481
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,187
Anyway, they want us

482
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:40,176
to do an examination and perform a second surgery (revision) right away, if necessary.

483
00:37:40,687 --> 00:37:43,687
They asked you, then why do I…

484
00:37:43,687 --> 00:37:45,420
The patient requested it.

485
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,720
She said she wants to be treated only by you.

486
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,053
They said they need it fixed quickly to carry out next week's schedule.

487
00:37:50,053 --> 00:37:51,778
Now, here.

488
00:37:52,587 --> 00:37:54,126
But I heard that lately

489
00:37:54,126 --> 00:37:57,153
you can't focus on your main job.

490
00:37:57,153 --> 00:37:59,977
Where did you go, slacking off during clinic hours?

491
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,953
I came, so it's not a problem.

492
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,020
 She has arrived. 

493
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,153
Send her to the treatment room.

494
00:38:17,853 --> 00:38:20,512
Oh, my… Goodness…

495
00:38:24,278 --> 00:38:25,753
 I have money, you know? 

496
00:38:25,753 --> 00:38:27,287
 I just need a moment! 

497
00:38:27,287 --> 00:38:28,987
Consultation is not possible right now.

498
00:38:28,987 --> 00:38:30,608
What's so difficult? It isn't difficult at all!

499
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:31,820
You have to make a reservation…

500
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,120
Please call for Lawyer Park Chae Kyeong just once, all right?

501
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,187
You are Lawyer Park Chae Kyeong, right?

502
00:38:39,187 --> 00:38:41,820
I heard you won a retrial last year. Please, let me have just one consultation.

503
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,853
You can't do it now. You have to make a reservation.

504
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:45,720
Please, enter.

505
00:38:54,087 --> 00:38:56,120
It's a prosthesis displacement.

506
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,787
When external force is applied or during intense physical activity,

507
00:38:58,787 --> 00:39:02,453
part of the fascia that envelopes the prosthesis becomes damaged,

508
00:39:02,453 --> 00:39:05,890
causing the prosthesis to shift to the side or downwards.

509
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:10,819
I've said so many times that action is off-limits for the time being.

510
00:39:12,487 --> 00:39:15,608
What do I do now? The pain persists.

511
00:39:15,608 --> 00:39:18,787
With a re-incision through the existing scar to adjust the prosthesis,

512
00:39:18,787 --> 00:39:21,953
it must be repositioned underneath the gluteal muscles.

513
00:39:21,953 --> 00:39:24,620
Will there be no problem if only that's done?

514
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,820
We can only be sure once we open and examine it,

515
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,153
but it looks like there are no other issues on the ultrasound.

516
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:35,526
Consider whether to have surgery and consult the hospital where it was performed.

517
00:39:35,526 --> 00:39:37,697
Doctor,

518
00:39:38,987 --> 00:39:41,187
just because it looks okay,

519
00:39:41,187 --> 00:39:44,253
does it mean that there are no other problems?

520
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:49,453
I just need some reassurance about my condition.

521
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,689
It means there aren't any.

522
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,639
Doctor…

523
00:40:00,053 --> 00:40:02,787
- Retrial? 
  - First, I want to hear what he has to say. 

524
00:40:02,787 --> 00:40:05,532
And also to check why he is so obsessed with you.

525
00:40:05,532 --> 00:40:07,287
Buy some time, I'll be right there.

526
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:10,787
There's nothing good about confronting him face to face. I will look into it...

527
00:40:10,787 --> 00:40:12,910
 I'm leaving now. 

528
00:40:15,766 --> 00:40:18,844
I'm not sure who is obsessed with whom.

529
00:40:18,844 --> 00:40:20,853
- He's a skilled guy, right? 
 - Of course.

530
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:23,834
Well, how was it? The surgery isn't complicated, right?

531
00:40:23,834 --> 00:40:25,353
The prosthesis in the subfascial position 
    

532
00:40:25,353 --> 00:40:27,485
needs to be moved to the submuscular position. 
    

533
00:40:27,485 --> 00:40:28,819
If properly sutured, it should be fine.

534
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:31,229
So, there won't be any additional scarring?

535
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:33,053
Since it's a reopening of the area that was already incised,

536
00:40:33,053 --> 00:40:35,359
there's less concern about the scarring.

537
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,007
So, should we proceed with the surgery?

538
00:40:38,007 --> 00:40:40,240
What does our Eun Ah have to say?

539
00:40:42,087 --> 00:40:44,753
You should ask her.

540
00:40:44,753 --> 00:40:46,744
Where are you going?

541
00:40:48,187 --> 00:40:50,720
Aren't you going to operate after seeing everything?

542
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,087
Would it be okay to do it here?

543
00:40:52,087 --> 00:40:53,920
Then, how can I leave it the way it is?

544
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,831
Are you telling me to open up somewhere else again?

545
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:57,087
Right. You are right.

546
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:59,453
Please, I ask you to handle it well.

547
00:40:59,453 --> 00:41:01,487
I'm not sure if she is prepared for surgery.

548
00:41:01,487 --> 00:41:02,953
I've been fasting today.

549
00:41:02,953 --> 00:41:06,294
- Isn't fasting enough? 
 - Yes.

550
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,287
I'm not sure how much it will cost.

551
00:41:22,325 --> 00:41:24,387
Let's talk about it first.

552
00:41:24,387 --> 00:41:26,100
Back then…

553
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,280
although I was out of my mind on drugs, it wasn't me.

554
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,780
I did enter the house, but I did not kill her.

555
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,587
Feeling wronged cannot be a reason for requesting a retrial.

556
00:41:37,587 --> 00:41:41,887
The law only recognizes facts that can be proven.

557
00:41:48,653 --> 00:41:51,341
What if there is a different culprit?

558
00:41:52,673 --> 00:41:54,720
What do you mean?

559
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,165
That day...

560
00:41:57,165 --> 00:42:00,165
I saw someone running out of the house.

561
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,487
I saw it clearly,

562
00:42:14,487 --> 00:42:17,568
the guy frantically escaping from the house.

563
00:42:20,602 --> 00:42:25,053
Do you have any idea who it could be?

564
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:31,667
- Thank you for your hard work. 
 - Good job today.

565
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,187
   

566
00:42:58,087 --> 00:43:02,160
   

567
00:43:02,853 --> 00:43:04,253
Is Lee Jin Seok still there?

568
00:43:04,253 --> 00:43:05,973
I'll go over there.

569
00:43:05,973 --> 00:43:08,306
 There's no need to meet him. 

570
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,520
What do you mean?

571
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,153
That's what those people say.

572
00:43:12,153 --> 00:43:14,253
"It's unfair. I've been framed. It's because of you."

573
00:43:14,253 --> 00:43:16,087
 Why listen to such talk? It will only upset you. 

574
00:43:16,087 --> 00:43:18,495
Don't change the subject.

575
00:43:20,086 --> 00:43:23,053
What do you want to confirm with Lee Jin Seok?

576
00:43:23,053 --> 00:43:26,453
 It seems like it's just anger towards the perpetrator. 

577
00:43:26,453 --> 00:43:30,821
So... he talked about me.

578
00:43:31,553 --> 00:43:33,557
 Chae Kyeong. 

579
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:40,053
He said he saw someone running out of the house.

580
00:43:40,053 --> 00:43:43,087
 Seems like similar statements were made seven years ago. 

581
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,747
 Because he was on drugs, 

582
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,726
 the statement was not accepted. 

583
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:52,393
Who… did he say it was?

584
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,253
I don't know. He said he doesn't know!

585
00:44:08,553 --> 00:44:12,746
 Do you have any idea who it could be? 

586
00:44:12,746 --> 00:44:15,879
 Wouldn't it be the person closest to that woman? 

587
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,457
 Like a lover, perhaps… 

588
00:44:20,587 --> 00:44:22,687
 From what I saw in prison, 

589
00:44:22,687 --> 00:44:26,720
 the biggest motive for murder cases was an affair. 

590
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,820
It takes a while for the anesthesia to wear off, right?

591
00:44:41,153 --> 00:44:44,099
What is it? Why is she like this?

592
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,916
Why is she like this?

593
00:44:49,093 --> 00:44:51,488
Why is it dropping so much?

594
00:44:52,987 --> 00:44:55,739
What? Please check the breathing.

595
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:59,387
Patient! Can you hear me, Miss?

596
00:44:59,387 --> 00:45:00,808
Patient!

597
00:45:00,808 --> 00:45:02,187
What do we do? It dropped too much!

598
00:45:02,187 --> 00:45:04,059
Please contact the director.

599
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:06,920
What are you talking about? Respiratory distress?

600
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,667
Respiratory distress?

601
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:09,920
- Are you talking about Eun Ah? 
 - What about Director Cha?

602
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,686
 I don't know where he is. 

603
00:45:11,686 --> 00:45:13,853
What?

604
00:45:13,853 --> 00:45:16,020
   

605
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,846
   

606
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,653
What is it?

607
00:45:25,653 --> 00:45:27,460
Who's closing today?

608
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,053
- Jeez, my forgetfulness… 
 - Eun Ah…

609
00:45:29,053 --> 00:45:31,084
- How many times have I left my phone behind… 
 - Eun Ah!

610
00:45:31,084 --> 00:45:32,953
You scared me! What is it?

611
00:45:32,953 --> 00:45:34,920
What is it, at this hour?

612
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,287
Huh? What's this?

613
00:45:37,287 --> 00:45:40,420
Eun Ah! Eun Ah…

614
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,020
Wait here.

615
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,720
No, I'll check on our Eun Ah.

616
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,553
- Just trust me and wait. 
 - Shouldn't I see her face at least?

617
00:45:46,553 --> 00:45:47,987
You're not helping by doing this.

618
00:45:47,987 --> 00:45:49,787
Do you know what she means to me?

619
00:45:49,787 --> 00:45:51,220
- All right, calm down. 
 - If something goes wrong, I swear!

620
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,320
Calm down!

621
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,087
- Just a moment! 
 - I'll take a look.

622
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:56,687
No, wait. Just a moment.

623
00:45:56,687 --> 00:46:00,353
It seems like an emergency. Delaying is not going to do the patient any good.

624
00:46:00,353 --> 00:46:03,020
Please trust us and just calm down.

625
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:05,520
Calm down. And wait.

626
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,320
O-Okay.

627
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,760
Patient, can you hear me?

628
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,160
Are you all right, Miss?

629
00:46:16,012 --> 00:46:18,474
Gown! Give me a gown, please!

630
00:46:19,273 --> 00:46:21,244
How much oxygen did you give?

631
00:46:21,764 --> 00:46:24,520
It's on full, but the oxygen saturation won't go above 80.

632
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,553
Did Jeong Woo operate?

633
00:46:25,553 --> 00:46:27,889
Yes, it's a hip prosthesis revision. 
    

634
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:29,020
Did you contact Cha Jeong Woo?

635
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,053
No, he went down after the surgery, but I can't reach him.

636
00:46:32,053 --> 00:46:34,729
Ah, where the heck did he go?!

637
00:46:35,987 --> 00:46:38,320
Yes, Southern Police Station…

638
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,272
Yes?

639
00:46:40,272 --> 00:46:41,931
Who?

640
00:46:43,453 --> 00:46:45,920
Where did he go?

641
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,820
Yes, I understand.

642
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,920
A part-time worker in a convenience store

643
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,475
saw someone who looks like Lee Jin Seok

644
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,187
being dragged to a nearby construction site.

645
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:43,533
Argh, damn!

646
00:47:43,533 --> 00:47:46,053
Do you know how much money I've poured into this all this time?

647
00:47:46,053 --> 00:47:48,087
And you pull off such thuggery?!

648
00:47:48,087 --> 00:47:50,107
You've got to pay for the money you received, right?

649
00:47:50,107 --> 00:47:52,197
Gosh, damn!

650
00:48:00,153 --> 00:48:03,087
This is a real wake-up call.

651
00:48:03,087 --> 00:48:05,719
So even trash like you have some use after all.

652
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,012
What?

653
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:09,520
This trashy rat who is only good for emptying ashtrays.

654
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,289
How dare you call us trash?! Jeez!

655
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:14,491
- Ha! He is laughing. 
 - I'm going to kill this rat today.

656
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,270
Hush, just a moment.

657
00:48:20,622 --> 00:48:22,853
Look down. Look down! Darn!

658
00:48:22,853 --> 00:48:25,787
Darn it, the cops are here! Let's go!

659
00:48:25,787 --> 00:48:29,299
- Hey, consider yourself lucky. 
 - My money!

660
00:48:30,353 --> 00:48:32,222
Come quickly!

661
00:48:40,272 --> 00:48:42,321
Let's start from this side.

662
00:49:09,853 --> 00:49:11,253
It hasn't been long.

663
00:49:11,253 --> 00:49:13,220
They must be nearby.

664
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,787
What do you want to say to me?

665
00:49:30,787 --> 00:49:33,287
What do you want to hear that made you chase after me this late at night?

666
00:49:33,287 --> 00:49:36,453
The reason you came to me as soon as you were released.

667
00:49:37,387 --> 00:49:38,654
What is it?

668
00:49:38,654 --> 00:49:40,612
Reason?

669
00:49:40,612 --> 00:49:42,820
You asked the same thing seven years ago.

670
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,758
Why… Why I did it…

671
00:49:44,758 --> 00:49:46,763
 Hey, block him! 

672
00:49:46,763 --> 00:49:47,920
 Why did you do it? 

673
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,106
 Why? Why did you do that? Why? 

674
00:49:51,106 --> 00:49:53,453
I thought about it for seven years.

675
00:49:53,453 --> 00:49:55,753
Why I would have killed her.

676
00:49:55,753 --> 00:49:57,236
But...

677
00:49:57,236 --> 00:50:00,120
no matter how much I thought about it, I couldn't figure it out.

678
00:50:00,952 --> 00:50:02,682
Why?

679
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,253
Because I didn't kill her.

680
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:06,453
You crazy...

681
00:50:06,453 --> 00:50:09,100
A drug addict, who couldn't adapt

682
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:13,279
to society brutally murdered

683
00:50:13,279 --> 00:50:15,689
a bride-to-be.

684
00:50:17,987 --> 00:50:21,387
Back then, in front of the police station, you beat me up,

685
00:50:21,387 --> 00:50:23,987
and I really became a guy who deserved to be beaten to death.

686
00:50:25,687 --> 00:50:27,320
What do you want to say?

687
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,653
You…

688
00:50:28,653 --> 00:50:32,824
I've also been curious about what you really wanted to do.

689
00:50:34,153 --> 00:50:36,187
It was all a show, wasn't it?

690
00:50:36,187 --> 00:50:38,453
A trick to frame me as the culprit.

691
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:41,866
You should stop talking nonsense!

692
00:50:41,866 --> 00:50:45,308
What's the real reason you're doing this to me?

693
00:50:46,953 --> 00:50:49,087
I did not kill your woman.

694
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:52,949
When I went in, she was already sprawled out covered in blood!

695
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:03,786
It almost looked like she was sleeping.

696
00:51:03,786 --> 00:51:06,830
But when I went to her, she was all covered in blood.

697
00:51:07,794 --> 00:51:09,927
Someone was definitely there.

698
00:51:09,927 --> 00:51:13,009
The guy who was in that house is the culprit!

699
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,908
You know, don't you, who that guy is.

700
00:51:20,433 --> 00:51:22,464
You know, don't you?

701
00:51:54,332 --> 00:51:56,314
What's with that look?

702
00:52:02,587 --> 00:52:04,539
It's you, isn't it?

703
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:07,015
The guy who ran out of the house that day.

704
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:12,653
Those who killed their girlfriends and wives, it was all because of an affair.

705
00:52:12,653 --> 00:52:16,619
Why? Did your lover cheat on you?

706
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:09,820



707
00:53:25,507 --> 00:53:27,776
   

708
00:53:31,279 --> 00:53:35,182
♫  I can't forget the day we first met  ♫

709
00:53:35,182 --> 00:53:38,908
♫  The wind was so cold  ♫

710
00:53:38,908 --> 00:53:43,164
♫  Your awkward greeting  ♫

711
00:53:43,164 --> 00:53:46,293
♫  Frozen, you were all I could see  ♫

712
00:53:46,293 --> 00:53:47,663
 That's the rat. 

713
00:53:47,663 --> 00:53:49,787
 That's why he came to me on his own accord. 

714
00:53:49,787 --> 00:53:51,987
 The one who ran out of that house looked exactly like him. 

715
00:53:51,987 --> 00:53:53,653
 That was Cha Jeong Woo? 

716
00:53:53,653 --> 00:53:55,636
 Do you not know anything about my accident? 

717
00:53:55,636 --> 00:53:56,853
 But one question remained. 

718
00:53:56,853 --> 00:54:00,187
 That there was no investigation into the victim's partner's movements on that day. 

719
00:54:00,187 --> 00:54:04,356
 There was no accident in front of the hospital that day? 

720
00:54:04,356 --> 00:54:06,206
 What on earth did you do in that house? 

721
00:54:06,206 --> 00:54:07,387
 What do you mean? 

722
00:54:07,387 --> 00:54:08,668
 You don't remember? 

723
00:54:08,668 --> 00:54:11,187
 Then come over, and I'll make you remember everything. 

724
00:54:11,187 --> 00:54:13,193
 Lee Jin… 

725
00:54:13,193 --> 00:54:17,105
♫  I saw you  ♫

726
00:54:17,105 --> 00:54:20,547
♫  Looking back for a long time  ♫
