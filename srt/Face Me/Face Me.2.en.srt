00:26:19,189 --> 00:26:21,372
A victim of a crime, a traumatized patient?

350
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:23,153
They say to cover it up, what can I do?

351
00:26:23,153 --> 00:26:25,335
Cha Jeong Woo, what about the crime victim?

352
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,962
They absolutely need that
consolation and empathy.

353
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:30,215
But you, having discarded all
such emotions and come here,

354
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,495
treating them is like setting a time bomb.

355
00:26:32,495 --> 00:26:35,804
What's the difference from lighting the fuse?

356
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:38,959
Apart from empathy and consolation,

357
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,019
I said I would do the surgery.

358
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:47,298
It's going to explode soon. It'll explode.

359
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,443
Pardon?

360
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:53,279
<i>Come on up, a patient has arrived.</i>

361
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,621
What patient?

362
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:59,953
<i>[Laceration]</i>
A 12CM laceration from the cheekbone to the chin.

363
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:02,093
<i>[Artery, Nerve]</i>
Judging by the controlled bleeding,

364
00:27:02,093 --> 00:27:04,499
<i>[Artery, Nerve]</i>
the artery and nerve seem to be fine.

365
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:08,044
It's said he followed a woman to the bathroom.

366
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,713
It's unclear whether this is
the perpetrator or the victim.

367
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:12,674
Let's start with the treatment, anyway.

368
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:15,944
And then we consider
the second case is completed?

369
00:27:15,944 --> 00:27:17,963
Yes.

370
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:21,307
If it's a simple suture,
wouldn't that be a non-issue?

371
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,268
Are you saying you're
going to select patients now?

372
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:25,812
No, it's not necessarily that, but,

373
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,606
if possible, something
that could make an issue.

374
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:30,364
Do we have to wait longer?

375
00:27:30,364 --> 00:27:32,110
We need to stitch it up quickly
and start the investigation.

376
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,153
Yes.

377
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,207
Mr. Yoon Min Soo,

378
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:49,128
please sit down, let me take a look.

379
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:53,490
Aren't you going to receive treatment?

380
00:27:58,992 --> 00:28:02,724
Will there be scars?

381
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,346
There can't be none.

382
00:28:05,346 --> 00:28:07,002
This is not it.

383
00:28:07,002 --> 00:28:09,063
Doctor, this can't be real, can it?

384
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:10,857
Mr. Yoon Min Soo, please calm down.

385
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:12,211
Please, fix my face.

386
00:28:12,211 --> 00:28:14,110
I really didn't do anything.

387
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,945
Calm down and let's start
with the medical treatment.

388
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:19,832
Yes? If you get treated,
something can surely be done.

389
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:39,718
<i>[Emergency Medical Center]</i>

390
00:28:41,593 --> 00:28:43,056
Shall we get off?

391
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:44,492
Well… not really.

392
00:28:44,492 --> 00:28:47,212
I'm not hurt.

393
00:28:47,212 --> 00:28:50,034
Do I really have to go?

394
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,931
There's a Sunflower Center
next to the emergency center.

395
00:28:53,931 --> 00:28:57,642
It's a place with only female
doctors, so you can feel safe.

396
00:28:58,238 --> 00:28:59,826
For the treatment of sexual assault victims,

397
00:28:59,826 --> 00:29:01,074
or for the collection of evidence.

398
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:05,306
It's not like I was sexually assaulted,

399
00:29:05,972 --> 00:29:08,717
I just don't want to be
misunderstood for no reason.

400
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,955
It's okay to talk about it here, right?

401
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:22,848
Yes.

402
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,933
I'm going to start recording.

403
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:29,831
Inside the PC, your boyfriend,
Mr. Park Dong Gun,

404
00:29:29,831 --> 00:29:31,980
had a fight with the suspect, and

405
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,684
after that, he said you went to the restroom.

406
00:29:35,684 --> 00:29:37,351
Yes.

407
00:29:37,351 --> 00:29:40,559
When I came out of the restroom,
right in front of the door…

408
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:49,072
<i>What are you doing?</i>

409
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,507
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

410
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,474
<i>Move aside!</i>

411
00:29:57,474 --> 00:29:59,798
<i>I said move!</i>

412
00:30:00,322 --> 00:30:02,427
<i>Move aside!</i>

413
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:06,185
I was so shocked that, at the moment, I

414
00:30:06,185 --> 00:30:08,620
swung the knife at Soo Bin without knowing.

415
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,644
And then, did your boyfriend,
Park Dong Gun, come in?

416
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,644
Yes.

417
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,498
This is self-defense, right?

418
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:30,037
It seems so, given the circumstances.

419
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,961
But, for now, let's move to the center
to collect evidence.

420
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:39,273
What evidence?

421
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:44,385
I didn't really have
any direct physical contact.

422
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:46,300
Besides physical contact,
traces on the victim's clothes or

423
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,721
belongings can also be taken as evidence.

424
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:59,289
The starting point is quite deep.

425
00:31:01,784 --> 00:31:04,724
If you feel any discomfort, let me know.

426
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:08,550
I don't have any.

427
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,909
If we need any additional
statements, I'll contact you.

428
00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:32,918
Yes.

429
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:37,924
- Are you done? Are you okay?
- Yeah.

430
00:31:37,924 --> 00:31:39,976
Gosh…

431
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:42,375
Can I go now?

432
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,620
Just a moment.

433
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:49,666
Ah, it looks like it splashed
from the restroom floor.

434
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:53,007
It seems like it could be useful evidence
for reconstructing the scene.

435
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:54,918
Would you mind taking them off?

436
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:56,938
How am I supposed to go without my shoes?

437
00:31:56,938 --> 00:31:58,751
Yes, this is Officer Lee Min Hyeong.

438
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:01,392
You have spare shoes at the center, right?

439
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:10,379
Yes?

440
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:11,798
I'll take the statement from the accused.

441
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:14,114
You go to the PC room and investigate the area.

442
00:32:14,114 --> 00:32:17,001
Where is the hospital? Give me the location.

443
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:19,450
What?

444
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,611
Doctor Cha Jeong Woo?

445
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:26,492
Min Soo is so taciturn.

446
00:32:26,492 --> 00:32:28,041
He is always just drawing,

447
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:30,574
and he's a bit peculiar.

448
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,784
But, I'm not sure if this is related…

449
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:35,139
For now, please tell me.

450
00:32:35,139 --> 00:32:37,664
Recently, a female customer in the restroom

451
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,834
complained about someone lurking around,

452
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,880
so I checked the CCTV.

453
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,997
Is that so?

454
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:46,132
But it's not like he entered
a place with people around,

455
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:48,248
nor did he install something like a camera,

456
00:32:48,248 --> 00:32:50,599
so, we just let it slide.

457
00:33:01,324 --> 00:33:03,424
Cut.

458
00:33:06,687 --> 00:33:08,540
The suturing is all done.

459
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,107
Please give me a mirror.

460
00:33:36,498 --> 00:33:38,818
- Mr. Yoon Min Soo's treatment--
- Please wait outside.

461
00:33:38,818 --> 00:33:40,523
What? The suturing is all done--

462
00:33:40,523 --> 00:33:44,017
This is a hospital, and I am the doctor.

463
00:33:44,017 --> 00:33:47,454
Will you take responsibility if
something goes wrong with the patient?

464
00:33:53,728 --> 00:33:56,048
I can't give you much time.

465
00:34:00,635 --> 00:34:04,591
When was the surgery done?

466
00:34:25,986 --> 00:34:28,368
Just a moment.

467
00:34:32,198 --> 00:34:33,664
What happened?

468
00:34:33,664 --> 00:34:36,097
Move to the operating room
as soon as the ultrasound is done.

469
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:37,120
Yes.

470
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,760
You said the operating room?

471
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,071
Mr. Yoon Min Soo will be
going into surgery immediately.

472
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:46,824
What? What kind of surgery?

473
00:34:51,728 --> 00:34:54,493
Starting the removal surgery

474
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:56,523
of patient Yoon Min Soo's breast implants.

475
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:07,426
Bovie.

476
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:19,004
After being diagnosed with gender
dysphoria, received hormone therapy

477
00:35:19,004 --> 00:35:21,974
and had breast surgery 3 weeks ago.

478
00:35:21,974 --> 00:35:24,840
The surgical site is severely inflamed.

479
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,074
There's a risk of

480
00:35:26,074 --> 00:35:27,673
sepsis,

481
00:35:27,673 --> 00:35:30,188
and the patient has agreed
to have the implants removed.

482
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,087
A patient in a critical state
due to surgical complications

483
00:35:41,087 --> 00:35:44,018
has attempted sexual assault?

484
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:46,824
And that too, a patient with gender dysphoria?

485
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,929
Yoon Min Soo

486
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:56,013
was previously seen lurking around
the women's restroom,

487
00:35:56,013 --> 00:35:58,042
and they got complaints.

488
00:35:58,042 --> 00:36:01,434
<i>Yoon Min Soo, whose gender identity is female,</i>

489
00:36:01,434 --> 00:36:04,627
<i>needed the women's restroom,</i>

490
00:36:04,627 --> 00:36:06,190
<i>and was worried about being
misunderstood due to the appearance,</i>

491
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:09,187
<i>So, she was checking to see
if there was anyone around.</i>

492
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:12,379
<i>It wouldn't be easy to speak about that fact.</i>

493
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:15,559
<i>This is self-defense, right?</i>

494
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:17,465
<i>What evidence?</i>

495
00:36:17,465 --> 00:36:21,222
<i>I didn't have any direct physical contact.</i>

496
00:36:21,994 --> 00:36:23,394
<i>Then, it means</i>

497
00:36:23,394 --> 00:36:25,962
<i>we need something else.</i>

498
00:36:25,962 --> 00:36:28,734
- Is the surgery over?
- Yes.

499
00:36:28,734 --> 00:36:31,357
- Yoon Min Soo's surgery record--
- You can't get it.

500
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:34,226
The patient won't consent to it either.

501
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,336
If consent were given
to disclose all medical records,

502
00:36:37,336 --> 00:36:39,884
you'd have already talked to the police, right?

503
00:36:39,884 --> 00:36:41,761
It's possible that he may
not be the perpetrator,

504
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:44,223
since only circumstantial
evidence is barely convincing.

505
00:36:44,223 --> 00:36:48,310
Just because someone is a transgender
person doesn't make it the basis.

506
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:55,909
This means that we should
look for another angle now.

507
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:58,280
It's difficult to clear Yoon Min Soo
of the assault charges

508
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,187
merely with the surgery records.

509
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:03,292
We need to look for another method.

510
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:04,866
In other words,

511
00:37:04,866 --> 00:37:07,517
even the doctor in charge of the victim

512
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:10,196
might think that Mr. Yoon Min Soo
may not be the assailant.

513
00:37:10,196 --> 00:37:12,683
Is my opinion important?

514
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,823
Suspicion needs to accumulate momentum.

515
00:37:16,823 --> 00:37:18,933
Thank you for your efforts.

516
00:37:21,883 --> 00:37:26,101
May I ask just one thing?

517
00:37:26,101 --> 00:37:29,363
Why do this? The victim medical support.

518
00:37:30,224 --> 00:37:33,208
As someone who doesn't like
to interfere with patient affairs.

519
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:37,724
Why particularly treat a crime victim's case?

520
00:37:40,072 --> 00:37:44,308
You don't seem the type to be told to do it.

521
00:37:44,308 --> 00:37:47,269
Maybe sincerity?

522
00:37:49,465 --> 00:37:51,996
Just do the investigation.

523
00:38:05,343 --> 00:38:07,922
<i>This isn't real, isn't it?</i>

525
00:38:10,215 --> 00:38:13,092

527
00:38:26,176 --> 00:38:29,595
<i>Why do this? Victim medical support.</i>

528
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:47,859
<i>I confirmed through the CCTV
that he was lurking around the locker room.</i>

529
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:51,115
<i>But at that time, as there wasn't
any criminal activity, I just let it go.</i>

530
00:38:51,115 --> 00:38:53,559
<i>But now they say a harassment case
has occurred in the same place.</i>

531
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:56,715
<i>Isn't he a repeated offender? Despicable guy.</i>

532
00:38:56,715 --> 00:39:01,373
<i>This scum needs chemical castration
or just needs to be castrated.</i>

533
00:39:10,073 --> 00:39:12,284
What about the victim's condition
related to the crime?

534
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:15,187
Still hospitalized.

535
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:16,984
Why still in the hospital?

536
00:39:16,984 --> 00:39:20,673
The sutured area is quite large,
it needs treatment for inflammation.

537
00:39:20,673 --> 00:39:23,339
Is it something to brag about,
that the victim went to plastic surgery?

538
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:24,790
Bring the victim here, immediately.

539
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:27,190
There's something I need to check before that.

540
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,090
What is it?

541
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:31,835
I'll report back after checking.

542
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:38,455
Then I'll also…

543
00:39:38,455 --> 00:39:40,849
Ah, hey!

544
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:42,642
You go and bring the suspect.

545
00:39:42,642 --> 00:39:44,043
What's the big deal
about a few stitches on the face?

546
00:39:44,043 --> 00:39:46,743
Are you hiding her at the hospital?

547
00:39:46,743 --> 00:39:48,876
Go!

548
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:51,687
The reconstructive surgery went well.

549
00:39:54,865 --> 00:39:57,325
Everyone must be talking about me.

550
00:39:57,325 --> 00:39:58,369
If it becomes known that I had surgery…

551
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:01,443
I don't disclose surgical records
without my patient's consent.

552
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:05,402
He lied that his girlfriend
did it in self-defense.

553
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:07,874
They'll probably blame me even more.

554
00:40:07,874 --> 00:40:11,590
Saying that kind of guy deserves it
for having gender reassignment surgery.

555
00:40:12,651 --> 00:40:15,067
Self-defense?

556
00:40:15,654 --> 00:40:18,659
Because it's the only way
they can get away with it.

557
00:40:22,455 --> 00:40:24,712
Director, the police is asking

558
00:40:24,712 --> 00:40:27,172
if patient Yoon Min Soo can be discharged.

559
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:28,912
Saying that she has to go for an inquiry.

560
00:40:28,912 --> 00:40:31,664
Yes, everything's done here.

561
00:40:59,384 --> 00:41:01,510
What's the matter?

562
00:41:03,055 --> 00:41:07,433
<i>[Blood Pattern Analysis Lab]</i>

563
00:41:25,747 --> 00:41:28,333
I am Detective Seo Gang Ho from
the Southern Precinct's violent crimes team.

564
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,352
What brings you here?

565
00:41:30,352 --> 00:41:32,204
I have something to discuss with you.

566
00:41:32,204 --> 00:41:33,520
What about Mr. Park Dong Gun?

567
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,900
Is he inside?

568
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,404
He had something to do, so he stepped out.

569
00:41:41,595 --> 00:41:44,366
Do you want to come in?

570
00:41:44,366 --> 00:41:46,692
Please.

571
00:41:48,518 --> 00:41:50,143
He said he might not be able to come today,

572
00:41:50,143 --> 00:41:53,145
since he went to the countryside.

573
00:42:14,544 --> 00:42:16,545
Stop!

574
00:42:29,305 --> 00:42:32,515
Try to get away, you rat.

575
00:42:42,918 --> 00:42:44,980
Hey, are you okay?

576
00:42:47,096 --> 00:42:49,307
What is it?

577
00:42:49,307 --> 00:42:51,871
How did you know about this place?

578
00:42:51,871 --> 00:42:54,731
Hey, Mr. Park Dong Gun.

579
00:42:54,731 --> 00:42:57,187
Let's go together.

580
00:42:58,067 --> 00:43:00,826
Let's just go together.

581
00:43:18,533 --> 00:43:19,686
Darn!

582
00:43:19,686 --> 00:43:22,396
- Hi!
- You startled me.

583
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,829
Oh, you came?

584
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:36,217
Yes.

585
00:43:36,217 --> 00:43:37,757
Ugh!

586
00:43:37,757 --> 00:43:40,933
Ah, let's go together.

587
00:43:41,713 --> 00:43:43,860
Let's go.

588
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,764
Huh? Let's go.

589
00:43:46,764 --> 00:43:49,250
Let's go quietly.

590
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,392
Ah!

591
00:43:54,053 --> 00:43:55,434
Now, Mr. Park Dong Gun, you are

592
00:43:55,434 --> 00:43:57,150
under arrest for assault

593
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,991
and false accusation against Yoon Min Soo,
as well as obstruction of justice.

594
00:44:00,991 --> 00:44:03,550
Hey, are you all right?

595
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,396
Seems like I've sprained my ankle,

596
00:44:05,396 --> 00:44:07,287
but it will get better.

597
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:08,507
But, what happened?

598
00:44:08,507 --> 00:44:09,556
Why are you here, of all places?

599
00:44:09,556 --> 00:44:11,976
Because of Dr. Cha Jeong Woo.

600
00:44:11,976 --> 00:44:14,118
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo?

601
00:44:19,092 --> 00:44:21,267
What's the matter?

602
00:44:22,157 --> 00:44:25,688
How tall is the woman who cut her face?

603
00:44:25,688 --> 00:44:27,641
Excuse me?

604
00:44:27,641 --> 00:44:29,929
Why do you ask?

605
00:44:31,948 --> 00:44:34,172
The depth of the wound at the
starting point, the cheekbone area,

606
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,758
is more than twice as deep as the end.

607
00:44:35,758 --> 00:44:37,970
The direction of the wound
is also from top to bottom.

608
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:41,036
If the shoulder height of the person
wielding the weapon had been lower,

609
00:44:41,036 --> 00:44:43,433
the direction of the wound
would have gone from bottom to top,

610
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:44,736
and at the starting point
of the wound, the cheekbone,

611
00:44:44,736 --> 00:44:48,356
it wouldn't have been possible
to apply enough force to scratch the bone.

612
00:44:48,356 --> 00:44:53,194
<i>[Yoon Min Soo's wounds]</i>
So, the perpetrator must be taller.

613
00:44:57,318 --> 00:44:59,737
Why did you miss it?

614
00:44:59,737 --> 00:45:01,424
Yoon Min Soo went straight to the hospital,

615
00:45:01,424 --> 00:45:03,562
so there was no time to examine the wound.

616
00:45:03,562 --> 00:45:05,469
It was also covered with a dressing.

617
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:08,315
Did Dr. Cha Jeong Woo tell you this
when they took Yoon Min Soo away?

618
00:45:08,315 --> 00:45:11,609
Yes, very unexpectedly.

619
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,990
It is like a subtle consideration out of
concern for secondary harm to the victim?

620
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:21,041
- What are you talking about?
- There is such a thing.

621
00:45:21,041 --> 00:45:25,336
By the way, why did you go to Park Dong Gun?

622
00:45:27,251 --> 00:45:29,583
Solid evidence came out.

623
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:31,416
What is it?

624
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:35,373
Upon hearing Ms. Lee Soo Bin's scream
and rushing to the bathroom,

625
00:45:35,373 --> 00:45:39,479
Yoon Min Soo was already covered in blood.

626
00:45:41,938 --> 00:45:44,350
That's what you stated?

627
00:45:45,101 --> 00:45:48,479
Yes. Why do you ask?

628
00:45:53,534 --> 00:45:57,011
But your sneakers show that
it was not the case.

629
00:45:58,342 --> 00:46:02,421
You see the tail-like pattern
at the end of the elliptical bloodstain?

630
00:46:02,421 --> 00:46:04,854
This is called a cast-off bloodstain.

631
00:46:04,854 --> 00:46:06,608
When a moving object stops,

632
00:46:06,608 --> 00:46:10,674
blood drips off, leaving this kind of pattern.

633
00:46:10,674 --> 00:46:15,141
Typically, when the weapon is swung
quickly and then stopped,

634
00:46:15,141 --> 00:46:19,098
the blood on the weapon flies off
and creates such stains…

635
00:46:19,098 --> 00:46:21,410
The pattern of the splashed blood is here,

636
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,887
on your sneakers.

637
00:46:23,887 --> 00:46:27,248
Which means it was you, Mr. Park Dong Gun,

638
00:46:27,248 --> 00:46:29,980

00:47:06,543 --> 00:47:08,837
<i>You can't bring alcohol in here.</i>

643
00:47:08,837 --> 00:47:11,715
<i>Just stop it, will you?</i>

644
00:47:11,715 --> 00:47:13,872
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

645
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:16,032

Ah, saying he started the quarrel first.

658
00:48:48,389 --> 00:48:50,973
Damn it.

659
00:48:53,421 --> 00:48:56,363

This is nothing much, but

671
00:49:58,471 --> 00:50:01,667
it's a drawing I made.

701
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,219
It doesn't resemble you, man.

702
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:13,359
Cha Jeong Woo was originally
an emergency medical doctor.

703
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,527
The plastic surgery and emergency
departments are covered in one place.

704
00:52:15,527 --> 00:52:18,223
It's been deployed for victim medical support.

705
00:52:18,223 --> 00:52:20,720
Why did he transfer from emergency
medicine to plastic surgery?

706
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,311
In the emergency room, doctors need
to be armed with a sense of mission.

707
00:52:23,311 --> 00:52:24,963
How tiring must that be?

708
00:52:24,963 --> 00:52:27,457
Plastic surgery, of course,
follows the money, too.

709
00:52:27,457 --> 00:52:29,920
And he doesn't have to get deeply
involved with patients' situations.

710
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,501
It would fit right in with
his personality, wouldn't it?

711
00:52:35,733 --> 00:52:39,688
Someone who doesn't like
to get involved with patients' affairs…

712
00:52:44,052 --> 00:52:46,860
<i>This is a hospital, and I am the doctor.</i>

713
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:50,240
<i>Will you take responsibility
if something goes wrong with the patient?</i>

714
00:52:53,723 --> 00:52:55,747
If that were the case, would he really
have been a dedicated doctor for the victim?

715
00:52:55,747 --> 00:52:58,347
He's doing this out of necessity
due to Mr. Nam Gi Taek's death.

716
00:52:58,347 --> 00:53:00,334
It doesn't seem like he does
something just because he's told.

717
00:53:00,334 --> 00:53:05,296
It's about restoring his tarnished honor.
There's nothing he wouldn't do.

718
00:53:06,515 --> 00:53:10,256
The thing about Mr. Nam Gi Taek,
did you check on it?

719
00:53:11,774 --> 00:53:13,973
Of course.

720
00:53:13,973 --> 00:53:16,163
In Nam Gi Taek's records
from two days before his death,

721
00:53:16,163 --> 00:53:19,641
there were calls with those hospitals
written on the memo.

722
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:22,246
And the warrant has been requested.

723
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,670
He probably made an appointment…

724
00:53:35,223 --> 00:53:38,850
<i>[Computer cleaning]</i>

725
00:53:41,304 --> 00:53:43,651
Nothing salvaged from the dash cam?

726
00:53:43,651 --> 00:53:46,585
There is a vehicle owner who said they
would contact us after checking the footage,

727
00:53:46,585 --> 00:53:48,774
but no contact--

728
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:52,429
No contact?

729
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:55,143
- I am about to make the call now.
- Now?

730
00:53:55,143 --> 00:53:57,290
Right now.

731
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:03,988
Yes, this is Lee Min Hyeong
from Seoul Southern Police Station.

732
00:54:04,524 --> 00:54:06,822
Yes, that's correct.

733
00:54:08,759 --> 00:54:11,008
Nam Hyo Ju?

734
00:54:21,379 --> 00:54:24,378
The day he died…

735
00:54:25,046 --> 00:54:28,624
I saw someone passing by.

736
00:54:28,624 --> 00:54:31,655
When I went to investigate,
they said they saw nothing.

737
00:54:31,655 --> 00:54:35,338
I was a bit drunk that day, too.

738
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:39,433
I only caught a glimpse of the person's back,

739
00:54:39,433 --> 00:54:45,354
but the shoes were a bit strange.

740
00:54:48,902 --> 00:54:50,415
They were black sneakers, but…

741
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:54,156
It seemed like something
was taped to the bottom.

742
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:57,264
There were no footprints at the time?

743
00:54:57,264 --> 00:55:00,476
It might have been intentional,
taping the shoes in advance.

744
00:55:00,476 --> 00:55:03,054
Then, my dad…

745
00:55:03,054 --> 00:55:05,612
It wasn't a suicide?

746
00:55:07,715 --> 00:55:09,803
We can't say that yet.

747
00:55:09,803 --> 00:55:11,809
While we look into it more,

748
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,760
let's keep today's discussion
amongst ourselves for now.

749
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,297
At least for the protection of the informant.

750
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:21,427
I'll investigate and contact you again.

751
00:55:23,415 --> 00:55:25,958
I didn't know.

752
00:55:26,459 --> 00:55:31,171
I asked you to finish
the investigation quickly.

753
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:46,736
Don't worry about it.

754
00:55:46,736 --> 00:55:49,688
Even though you asked me to wrap it up,

755
00:55:49,688 --> 00:55:52,789
I never considered doing it
or concluded an investigation.

756
00:56:33,044 --> 00:56:35,058
If the man captured on the dash cam

757
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,981
is related to Mr. Nam Gi Taek's death,

758
00:56:39,495 --> 00:56:43,904
why would they deliberately
involve Dr. Cha Jeong Woo?

759
00:56:56,912 --> 00:57:02,218
Well, if it's someone with
a grudge, it's not impossible.

760
00:57:30,249 --> 00:57:34,713
Then, isn't Mr. Cha Jeong Woo in danger?

761
00:57:57,088 --> 00:58:01,160
<i>[Face Me]</i>

762
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:22,235
She was a victim of sulfuric acid attack.

763
00:58:22,235 --> 00:58:23,490
This is a cosmetic surgery clinic.

764
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:25,514
If you want to provide emotional
care for the patient,

765
00:58:25,514 --> 00:58:27,284
then transfer them to another hospital.

766
00:58:27,284 --> 00:58:29,346
The person who killed my father

767
00:58:29,346 --> 00:58:31,745
is someone with a grudge against you.

768
00:58:31,745 --> 00:58:33,320
Just a little bit.

769
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,755
Just wish for a bit more empathy, nothing more.

770
00:58:35,755 --> 00:58:37,281
Enough worrying about others,

771
00:58:37,281 --> 00:58:38,794
just put the fat back in there.

772
00:58:38,794 --> 00:58:40,998
How on earth did the kid catch this again?

773
00:58:40,998 --> 00:58:42,749
The day Mr. Nam Gi Taek died,

774
00:58:42,749 --> 00:58:44,894
the person who came out of that house.

775
00:58:44,894 --> 00:58:47,124
Is this the person?
