111
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:34,603
it was missing from the documents

is suspected of having
intentionally omitted it.

115
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:55,843
I re-examined the evidence photos from
that time and two fingerprints were restored.

116
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:58,203
One was Mr. Cha Jeong Woo's fingerprint.

117
00:10:58,203 --> 00:11:00,970
He must have provided first aid immediately
upon finding the victim at the scene,

118
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,937
so it's natural that
his fingerprints were found.

119
00:11:03,937 --> 00:11:06,376
And the other one,

120
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,803
might be from when the team leader
checked alone secretly seven years ago,

121
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,403
and couldn't identify
whose fingerprints they were.

122
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:14,703
Because they were partial ones.

123
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,836
But you must have compared it
with Lee Jin Seok's fingerprints.

124
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:26,203
Knowing that they didn't match,

125
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:29,120
you did not correct it.

00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:33,931

127
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:37,136

128
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:39,570
you would see it.

129
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,263
I don't know about it.

130
00:11:45,263 --> 00:11:47,529

Was alive.

133
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,969
As you said, she fell and injured her head, so

134
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:09,160
she probably had no strength
to even defend herself.

135
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,436
In that situation,
you had to use your own hands.

must be because I wanted
to pretend not to know that.

142
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:44,511

00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,703
and other crimes in the line of duty,

183
00:15:49,703 --> 00:15:52,203
during the past investigation
of the retrial petitioner.

184
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:55,036
The objective reasonableness
of the statement at that time

185
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:56,770
and the circumstances
of the defendant's confession

186
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:00,336
were found to be inadequately scrutinized.

187
00:16:01,436 --> 00:16:06,034
Defendant Lee Jin Seok
is hereby declared not guilty.

188
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:26,818
I'm sorry!

189
00:16:36,643 --> 00:16:38,477
Why? Why?

190
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:40,944
What shall we eat? What do you want to eat?

191
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:58,816
I'll go with Mom to get the car,
take your time talking and then come.

192
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:00,852
No.

193
00:17:08,682 --> 00:17:11,745
I thought I was the victim…

194
00:17:12,336 --> 00:17:15,600
But I was also a perpetrator in someone's life.

195
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,149
It's late, but,

196
00:17:20,149 --> 00:17:22,982
I want to apologize sincerely.

197
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:28,847
I'm really sorry for being seven years late.

198
00:17:30,603 --> 00:17:33,117
I am truly sorry.

199
00:17:58,303 --> 00:18:00,311
Chae Kyung!

200
00:18:01,136 --> 00:18:03,570
What? You haven't left yet?

201
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,603
Yeah.

202
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:08,233
Are you okay?

203
00:18:08,836 --> 00:18:10,503
What if I'm not okay?

204
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:12,370
Don't turn off your cell phone,

205
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,083
and don't go to places
where you can't be reached.

206
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,442

but it doesn't seem like just a cause
for celebration as a member of the police.

What brings you here?

258
00:23:42,403 --> 00:23:43,841
Well… I had

259
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:47,263
some business to attend to.

260
00:23:47,263 --> 00:23:50,236

Right, over there.

- How did you know this place?
- I've been here a few times before.

265
00:24:21,277 --> 00:24:25,636
Back when I believed my brother was a murderer,

266
00:24:25,636 --> 00:24:28,323
this was the best I could do

267
00:24:28,323 --> 00:24:31,070
as the family of the perpetrator,

268
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,270

who couldn't protect her.

The apology I could offer

271
00:24:37,236 --> 00:24:39,936
was only this much.

272
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:50,336
It's about finding the best you can do,
even in an unavoidable situation.

273
00:24:50,336 --> 00:24:52,703
I was lacking in that.

274
00:24:52,703 --> 00:24:55,036
Don't think like that.

275
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,803
In any case, that choice seven years ago

276
00:24:57,803 --> 00:25:00,683
turned out to be quite
the best for many people.

277
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:03,336
What choice?

278
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,336
The decision to move to plastic surgery.

279
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:07,503
Thanks to that choice,
so many people have been healed.

280
00:25:07,503 --> 00:25:10,770
I know several crime victims.

281
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:20,551
It sure took a long time

282
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,088
until I saw your smiling face.

283
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,503
As if it was something great.

284
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:32,636

determined to not be happy.

<i>Take my hand.</i>

291
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,623
<i>It's because of my brother, isn't it?</i>

292
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,070
It was something I really wanted,

293
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,970
to see you living and smiling again.

294
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,103
I heard that wasn't the case

295

It was all thanks to Hye Jin.

297
00:26:15,503 --> 00:26:17,741
Exactly.

298
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,803
Because of guilt,

299
00:26:20,803 --> 00:26:25,771
you set down the emotions and passion
you had when with Ms. Yoon Hye Jin

300
00:26:25,771 --> 00:26:28,170
and lived like this.

301
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,403
That's right.

302
00:26:30,403 --> 00:26:32,656
I did that.

303
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,003
The greatest respect
for those who leave first is

304
00:26:41,003 --> 00:26:44,203
to live life fully.

305
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:48,236
Whether they're by my side or not, still,

306
00:26:48,236 --> 00:26:51,936
they became a part of my life,
as if we're living it together.

307
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:01,952
So, are we restoring everything
to its original state now?

308
00:27:03,943 --> 00:27:06,236
What should I do and how?

309
00:27:06,236 --> 00:27:08,803
Hmm…

310
00:27:08,803 --> 00:27:11,236
The hospital doors were still closed.

311
00:27:11,236 --> 00:27:13,303
Hurry up and start the consultations.

312
00:27:13,303 --> 00:27:15,370
I didn't shut them down.

313
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,670
Is that so?

314
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,374
It was our hospital director.

315
00:27:18,374 --> 00:27:22,027
He said he wants to use the occasion to change.

316
00:27:25,149 --> 00:27:29,003
I have someone like that around me, too.

317
00:27:29,003 --> 00:27:30,936
How's he holding up?

318
00:27:30,936 --> 00:27:33,920
He's working hard on it.

319
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:40,170
Should I buy some bread from the shop up front?

320
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,636
You like cream buns, don't you?

321
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:43,203
Oh, no! No way.

322
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,903
I have an exam next week, what if I fail?

323
00:27:45,903 --> 00:27:48,970
Mom, I want some sticky rice cakes.

324
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,203
Huh? Sticky, really sticky ones.

325
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:55,070
Okay! I got it!

326
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,128

329
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:05,596
I'll be sure to pass that on.

Thank you for trusting me
and solving the case until the end.

Well…

334
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:28,436
I just did what I was supposed
to do as a police officer.

335
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,670
But looking at it now,
I do feel somewhat proud.

336
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,036
Investigating a case

337
00:28:35,036 --> 00:28:37,103
is about making sure that the offender
receives an appropriate punishment.

338
00:28:37,103 --> 00:28:39,936
That's where the focus is, but

339
00:28:39,936 --> 00:28:43,321
it's also a process
of helping the victim recover.

340
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,036
Though it's late,

341
00:28:48,036 --> 00:28:51,032
it seems I saw the beginning
of that recovery today.

342
00:28:57,303 --> 00:29:00,036
You seem a bit more at ease now.

343
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:35,065
You're leaving without a word?

344
00:29:38,898 --> 00:29:41,778
You said the hospital is reopening soon.

345
00:29:41,778 --> 00:29:43,548
You must be busy preparing
for the consultations.

346
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,198
So why come here?

347
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:48,535
"It's nice to see your face
before leaving the country."

348
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:51,365
Is that what you're saying?

349
00:29:54,598 --> 00:29:56,598
Yes.

350
00:29:57,465 --> 00:30:00,698
To the mom of seven years ago,

351
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:04,265
that day's choice must have been the best one.

352
00:30:04,265 --> 00:30:07,365
The fact that you hid my accident

353
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:10,897
and that you tried to make me
forget Hye Jin quickly…

354
00:30:10,897 --> 00:30:12,532
Yeah…

355
00:30:12,532 --> 00:30:15,751
Even though you resent me for that,

356
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,465
I was actually grateful.

357
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:23,820
Because by blaming me,

358
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,773
I hoped all your remaining
guilt would be buried.

359
00:30:27,531 --> 00:30:31,965
You should grieve what hurts
and resent what's resented,

360
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:35,092
just let it all out.

361
00:30:41,165 --> 00:30:44,198
I wondered why I ended up like this.

362
00:30:44,198 --> 00:30:46,775
It's because I'm like you.

363
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:52,791
Now stop blaming yourself

364
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:55,758
and forget it.

365
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:08,532
Don't stay away for too long.

366
00:31:12,544 --> 00:31:14,898
Alright.

367
00:31:14,898 --> 00:31:16,932
I won't.

368
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,698
<i>[Q. What do you think plastic surgery is?]</i>
Plastic surgery?

369
00:31:44,698 --> 00:31:46,718
Making your face or body

370
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:48,765
<i>["More Attractive"]</i>
more attractive.

371
00:31:48,765 --> 00:31:50,232
When I became prettier,

372
00:31:50,232 --> 00:31:52,132
<i>["You Become A Better Person"]</i>
I felt like I've become a better person.

373
00:31:52,132 --> 00:31:54,265
Like buying pretty clothes or

374
00:31:54,265 --> 00:31:56,875
<i>["Changing Your Style"]</i>
changing your hairstyle?

375
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,832
I have a friend who did it for an interview,

376
00:31:59,832 --> 00:32:01,165

and indeed, he became more handsome.

377
00:32:01,165 --> 00:32:06,165
<i>["A Privilege Of Modern People"]</i>
A privilege of us given the medical technology.

378
00:32:06,165 --> 00:32:08,038
I thought so, too.

379
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:10,536
<i>[Model / Jung Hee Young]</i>
Plastic surgery is a procedure that

380
00:32:10,536 --> 00:32:13,732
improves one's current state to a better one.

381
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:16,665
But through this experience,

382
00:32:16,665 --> 00:32:18,565
I've realized the real value of plastic surgery

383
00:32:18,565 --> 00:32:21,065
lies in finding oneself.

384
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:24,398
Well, like me, when someone is
traumatized by a crime or accident,

385
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,365
it's like restoring the appearance
from before the injury.

386
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:30,732
Although scars like these have remained,

387
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:35,865
plastic surgery was the operation
that prevented me from losing myself.

388
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:39,038
<i>["Kept Me From Losing Myself"]</i>

389
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:42,832
Well, that's exactly this.

390
00:32:42,832 --> 00:32:45,398
Plastic surgery that enables one
to regain their form before the injury,

391
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:47,765
restorative plastic surgery.

392
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:51,498
Could it be called an operation,
like a journey to find the lost self?

393
00:32:51,498 --> 00:32:54,698
Up until now, you've only treated
cases with a cosmetic inclination,

394
00:32:54,698 --> 00:32:56,598
but now you intend to treat patients

395
00:32:56,598 --> 00:32:59,263
in need of surgery due to trauma
or illness as well?

396
00:32:59,263 --> 00:33:00,731
Yes, that's right.

397
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:01,962
Plastic surgery aims to improve the patient's
physical appearance or function

398
00:33:01,962 --> 00:33:06,398
to a better state,

399
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:10,132
with the goal of enhancing the quality of life.

400
00:33:10,665 --> 00:33:13,798
Therefore, without the boundary
between reconstruction and beauty,

401
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:16,165
let's remain faithful to the original
purpose of plastic surgery.

402
00:33:16,165 --> 00:33:18,866
What led you to specialize
in reconstructive plastic surgery?

403
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:21,565
Was there a particular incident
that inspired you?

404
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:25,299
Ah… as you know, our hospital has

405
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:29,264
provided medical support to crime victims.

406
00:33:29,264 --> 00:33:30,989
Observing patients needing
reconstructive surgery due to trauma

407
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:32,898
from the sidelines,

408
00:33:32,898 --> 00:33:35,965
I realized one thing for certain.

409
00:33:35,965 --> 00:33:39,432
In order to heal the wounded inner self,

410
00:33:39,432 --> 00:33:43,543
external treatment needs to come first.

411
00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:44,980
To do that, one must

412
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,032
be restored to the appearance
they had before the injury.

413
00:33:49,032 --> 00:33:51,233
And the only person who can do this role is

414
00:33:51,233 --> 00:33:54,597
surely a plastic surgeon, right?

415
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:56,432
The graft is good.

416
00:33:56,432 --> 00:33:58,598
Moisturizing is the most important thing,

417
00:33:58,598 --> 00:34:01,118
so please apply the ointment regularly.

418
00:34:01,118 --> 00:34:03,965
And as for scar treatment,

419
00:34:03,965 --> 00:34:07,231
let's check the progress and
revisit it at your next appointment.

420
00:34:07,231 --> 00:34:09,233
Yes.

You visited my father last week, didn't you?

422
00:34:19,178 --> 00:34:22,232
I saw you at the memorial park.

423
00:34:22,232 --> 00:34:24,527
It was too late, right?

424

I'm sorry

425
00:34:26,705 --> 00:34:29,438

From now on, don't lock yourself away.

Don't dwell alone in the thought
that you've been rejected by the world,

429
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:43,497
and don't sink into your own thoughts either.

It's a robbery at a jewelry shop,

472
00:38:07,832 --> 00:38:11,132
and I heard the owner's face was
slashed while trying to stop them.

473
00:38:11,132 --> 00:38:13,698
Ah! Does the victim connect to KSH?

The chief was already talking
about medical support.

I… would like to get surgery consultation.

488
00:38:57,892 --> 00:38:58,945
Do you have an appointment?

489
00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:01,491
Which surgery are you interested in?

490
00:39:14,332 --> 00:39:16,197
Ms. Lee Ju Young?

491
00:39:16,197 --> 00:39:19,332
I tried to get surgery
at that time, but couldn't,

492
00:39:19,332 --> 00:39:24,487
and other hospitals said that
immediate surgery would be difficult.

493
00:39:26,178 --> 00:39:29,225
So, you underwent an illegal procedure?

494
00:39:29,225 --> 00:39:32,005
They said the effects would be immediate…

495
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:34,665
Gods…

496
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:37,965
Firstly, it needs to be removed
as soon as possible.

497
00:39:37,965 --> 00:39:39,232
After consulting with the Director,

498
00:39:39,232 --> 00:39:42,698
it would be best to schedule
the surgery right away.

499
00:39:43,545 --> 00:39:46,911
What about the nose and eyes?

500
00:39:48,024 --> 00:39:49,365
Pardon?

501
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:52,198
Well, while undergoing the removal surgery,

502
00:39:52,198 --> 00:39:55,938
I'd like to have another consultation
about my nose and eyes.

503
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:58,145
I'm certain I have informed you.

504
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:01,532
Further procedures
and surgeries would be excessive.

505
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,098
Then what should I do?

506
00:40:04,098 --> 00:40:06,998
But I really needed the surgery.

507
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:11,971
So, you've put an unknown
foreign substance in your face?

508
00:40:14,298 --> 00:40:20,098
I read an interview article that said
you also perform reconstructive surgery.

509
00:40:20,098 --> 00:40:22,458
Is that something I can do?

510
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:25,025
What should I do, doctor?

511
00:40:28,498 --> 00:40:31,232
The foreign material
has adhered to the normal cells,

512
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:34,098
causing the surrounding tissue to harden.

513
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,665
To minimize damage to the normal tissue,

514
00:40:36,665 --> 00:40:39,532
it seems we have to remove it
via a micro-incision.

515
00:40:40,534 --> 00:40:41,732
Yes.

516
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:44,365
Please schedule the surgery.

517
00:40:44,365 --> 00:40:46,431
And…

518
00:40:46,431 --> 00:40:50,064
What about the nose and eyes?

519
00:40:52,898 --> 00:40:55,765
I'm sorry, but you said it couldn't be done.

520
00:40:55,765 --> 00:41:00,332
Still, I really need this to be done.

521
00:41:01,817 --> 00:41:05,611
Why does it have to be this face?

522
00:41:05,611 --> 00:41:08,331
If it's to the extent of
undergoing illegal procedures…

523
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:25,494
Ah, well…

524
00:41:44,778 --> 00:41:50,378

to see your lovely face this time.</i>

537
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,065
<i>It's such a pity.</i>

538
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:47,398

I might only return after six months.</i>

539
00:43:47,398 --> 00:43:52,232
<i>I earnestly hope that we can surely meet then.</i>

540
00:43:58,565 --> 00:44:02,465
First, let's proceed with
the removal of the foreign material,

541
00:44:02,465 --> 00:44:06,008
and then plan the surgery
while monitoring the progress.

542
00:44:07,765 --> 00:44:13,098
I can't guarantee that surgery can change it
to look like the corrected photo.

543
00:44:13,098 --> 00:44:14,665
However,

544
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:17,478
if you promise to make an effort
to accept your current appearance,

545
00:44:17,478 --> 00:44:19,265
I will work with you.

546
00:44:19,265 --> 00:44:21,099
Thank you!

547
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:24,094
Doctor, thank you so much!

549

But, like,

550
00:44:44,132 --> 00:44:45,912
does it make sense to go to such lengths

551
00:44:45,912 --> 00:44:47,805
for someone you've never met?

552
00:44:47,805 --> 00:44:50,005
Sure.

553
00:44:50,931 --> 00:44:52,984
Have you seen that man's face?

554
00:44:52,984 --> 00:44:55,650
I heard he's incredibly sweet.

555
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,498
But it's really unexpected.

556
00:44:57,498 --> 00:45:00,880
He flatly refused during the last consultation.

557
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,498
Not really.

558
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:05,832
What was unexpected
was Dr. Cha's behavior all this time.

559
00:45:05,832 --> 00:45:07,294
Excuse me?

560
00:45:07,294 --> 00:45:11,298
Because he used to be someone who
communicated and empathized with patients.

561
00:45:11,298 --> 00:45:13,732
It's not unexpected for him
to return to his original place.

562
00:45:13,732 --> 00:45:15,798
It's natural, yes.

563
00:45:15,798 --> 00:45:17,838
Ah…

564
00:45:23,332 --> 00:45:25,432
I'm not sure what to do.

565
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:27,568
Do you do this often for people my age?

566
00:45:27,568 --> 00:45:28,832
Of course.

567
00:45:28,832 --> 00:45:31,438
Breast reconstruction is also
part of the treatment.

In the case of Ms. Kim Mi Hyang,

569
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:37,344
200cc seems appropriate. What do you think?

570
00:45:37,344 --> 00:45:39,298
This small thing?

571
00:45:39,298 --> 00:45:41,963
Yes, this one is 200cc.

572
00:45:41,963 --> 00:45:45,265
No matter what I see, I prefer 400cc.

573
00:45:45,265 --> 00:45:47,689
It's hefty.

574
00:45:48,632 --> 00:45:51,898
If you add an implant
that's too large for your age,

575
00:45:51,898 --> 00:45:55,165
it could cause a cervical disc
or other health issues.

576
00:45:55,165 --> 00:45:58,232
We do not recommend more than 200cc.

Hey, Jeong Woo.

598
00:47:22,665 --> 00:47:26,732
Don't you regret coming
back to plastic surgery?

599
00:47:26,732 --> 00:47:28,898
Regret what?

600
00:47:28,898 --> 00:47:30,491
No, I thought you'd return
as an emergency doctor.

603
00:47:38,132 --> 00:47:41,598
It's not like you have to feel guilty anymore.

604
00:47:42,965 --> 00:47:44,898
That's why I came here,
