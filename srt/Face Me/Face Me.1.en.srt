179
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:48,133
we wouldn't be smiling
at rowdy customers either.

180
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,600
Go back safely.

181
00:13:58,133 --> 00:13:59,233
Are you okay?

182
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,967
I shouldn't have accepted the reservation.

183
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:05,133
Honestly, it's not a surgery
that our hospital should handle.

184
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:07,033
What kind of consultation is it?

185
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,533
It's for burn reconstruction.

186
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:09,867
He asked Director Cha for that?

187
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:13,833
They pleaded so much
just to get a consultation once.

188
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,833
Please do a better patient filtering.

189
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,200
Reconstructive surgery is
not our field of treatment.

190
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,733
Of course.

191
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:28,167
If there are any new consultations coming up,
don't give them to Director Cha, got it?

192
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,867
Don't schedule any. The director has
to prepare for departure.

193
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:32,633
Let's help him out, ok?

194
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:36,600
Director Cha is really leaving.

195
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,600
But, are you okay?

196
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,767
Originally, Director Han was the one
who prepared the Bintan partner doctor.

197
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:44,433
What are you talking about? It's good for me.

198
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:48,933
Isn't Professor Cha going to
suffer abroad in my stead?

199
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:54,367
I'll just establish myself
as the ace doctor of these K-girls.

200
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:56,700
Cheer up and go buy a cup of coffee.

201
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,900
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

202
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:16,867
We came after receiving a report.

203
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:18,033
Where is Oh Ji Eun?

204
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:20,267
What's the matter?

205
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:22,500
What is this?

206
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,633
This is a surgical accident, right?

207
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:25,967
Accident? It seems there
might be some misunderstanding.

208
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,800
I asked, where is Oh Ji Eun?

209
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,067
Yes, she's currently in surgery,
but what's the issue?

210
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:31,067
Surgery?

211
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:32,500
Excuse me!

212
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,600
Just a moment.

213
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,733
<i>[In surgery]</i>

214
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,567
Starting Oh Ji Eun's facial contouring surgery.

215
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:44,500
Please insert the army retractor number 15.

216
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,467
Oh Ji Eun!

217
00:15:58,033 --> 00:16:00,233
Ji Eun!

218
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,033
Please check the surgery consent form here.

219
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:05,067
Oh Ji Eun is currently undergoing surgery.

220
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:08,100
It seems there was a problem
during the surgery. Did you check it properly?

221
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,200
Of course.

222
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,400
The patient signed it herself, and
we proceeded according to the procedure.

223
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,233
It seems like the guardian might be under
some kind of misunderstanding now.

224
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:16,267
No, this surgery can't go on.
Stop it right now.

225
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,733
Ji Eun!

226
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:21,467
What are you doing?
Why didn't you set the retractor?

227
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:23,733
It seems like
the patient's guardian is outside.

228
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,933
Shall we find out what's going on?

229
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:26,933
Why?

230
00:16:26,933 --> 00:16:31,133
Let's see why the guardian is acting like that,
whether to start or to stop after hearing her.

231
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:33,833
The patient is an adult
and has completed the surgical consent.

232
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:37,667
Delaying the surgery while under anesthesia
won't benefit the patient, either.

233
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,367
Let's proceed according to the procedure.

234
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:42,667
If Director Cha says so, that's what we'll do.

235
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,500
Saw.

236
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,033
I will begin the incision.

237
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:58,333
Suction.

238
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:05,800
What? Making a halt request
while the daughter is having surgery?

239
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,033
What's the reason?

240
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,900
What?

241
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,067
The surgery is over.

242
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:19,900
She will be moved to the ward soon.

243
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:25,567
This…

244
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:28,067
This is the diagnosis form
for our child's depression and anxiety.

245
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:29,833
Without properly checking,

246
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:33,600
isn't this pushing a neurotic patient with
poor judgment to undergo cosmetic surgery?

247
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,200
There is no obligation to check the psychiatric
diagnosis of a patient who'll receive surgery.

248
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,967
Do you know the reason why our child

249
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:43,100
wanted to do cosmetic surgery?

250
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,833
Should I know that?

251
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,633
You're a doctor, after all.

252
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:52,833
As a doctor, you should ensure that
the patient can make the right choice.

253
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,000
Whether it was the right choice or not,

254
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,800
let's talk after seeing the results.

255
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,967
There wasn't a problem with the surgical
procedure or the process, was there?

256
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:02,533

happily buy the drinks.

Just practice more and win,
then I'll buy you drinks.

Ah!

272
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,300
Even I would struggle with that.

273
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,600
Don't think about winning, just accept it.

274
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,000
What are you talking about?

275
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,567
He said he'll buy drinks.

It will quiet down with time.

Excuse me.

Eyes and nose.

302
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:35,633
it may turn out that way.

Why some people get surgery and others don't?

What could be the reason?

311
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,500
Perhaps he's considering
the person's feelings about the surgery?

312
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,600
Considering the minds of complete strangers?

313
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,333
Why doesn't he understand
my anxious heart just like that?

314
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,000
Because of this person,

315
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,533
my insides are burning to the point
that my face is turning black, really!

00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,433
I guess I'm lucky,

327
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:18,467

00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:32,367

00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,133
Ah, get out!

331
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:36,133
Why?

332
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:39,233
Hey, a patient has arrived.

333
00:23:43,033 --> 00:23:45,767
Fortunately, artery or
nerve damage was avoided,

334
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:49,433
but the cheekbones and the bones
around the eye are somewhat fractured.

335
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:53,367
While trying to save the fragmented
bones that can be saved,

336
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:54,867
reconstructive surgery will be necessary.

337
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:58,100
Let's transfer her to the emergency department
of a nearby university hospital.

338
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:02,933
How can an emergency medical doctor
leave an emergency patient?

339
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:04,233
That's a thing of the past.

340
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:06,567
I'm just a local plastic surgeon now.

341
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:08,133
So, you do it.

342
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:10,367
Me, perform surgery on a trauma patient?

343
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:14,000
<i>[Facial bone fracture]</i>
It's not typical facial bone fracture.

344
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,800
The patient has orbicularis muscle paralysis.

345
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,867
The orbicularis muscle is on the
fractured bone near the orbital fracture.

346
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:20,633
<i>[Entrapment: Impingement]</i>
It seems to be entrapped.

347
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:23,800
You ought to know better.
It needs immediate surgery.

348
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,400
You are double-board certified
in emergency medicine and plastic surgery.

349
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,600
You're the perfect fit as an
emergency plastic surgeon.

350
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,233
An emergency surgery at the plastic surgery
center in the middle of the night.

351
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:33,833
The title is also good.

352
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,367
Are you suggesting we use the emergency
patient to promote the hospital?

353
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:39,133
It's about planning your future

354
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:41,633
with that patient's surgery.

355
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:28,400
The first impact caused a fracture.

356
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,167
After that, the bones were pushed in,

357
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:33,000
and the eye muscles were wedged inside.

358
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,900
<i>[Orbital contents]</i>
Secure the wedged orbital contents first.

359
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,200
While fitting together the broken pieces,

360
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,733
we reinforce and fix it.

<i>[Bone fragment assembly and fixation device]</i>
Brown's titanium plate,

362
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:48,767
and prepare two plates, 'L' and 'I' shaped.

363
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:49,800
What about the saw?

364
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,733
<i>[ORIP: Open Reduction Internal Fixation]</i>
No need for saw with ORIP.

365
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:54,000
Please prepare an army retractor,

00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,167
number 15.

367
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,567
It fits perfectly.

368
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:40,100
It's amazing,

369
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:52,667
<i>[KSH Cosmetic Surgery]</i>

370
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:29,467
What are you talking about?

371
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:31,900
You say there's no evidence I was assaulted?

372
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,100
The scene of Kim Da Hee being assaulted

373
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,167
was not captured
because it was obscured by a car.

374
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:41,800
But, isn't my face evidence enough?

375
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,033
Choi Chang Min has also
submitted a medical report,

376
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:51,300
claiming that you were the first to attack.

377
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,600
<i>Amazing! I met you here!</i>

378
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,933
<i>Hey, let's talk for a moment.</i>

379
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:56,933
<i>I have nothing to say to you.</i>

380
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:59,767
<i>Just a minute, hold on.</i>

381
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:02,733
<i>Hey, Da Hee, just a second.</i>

382
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:04,867
<i>Come on, it'll only take a second.</i>

383
00:28:04,867 --> 00:28:05,867
<i>I don't want to.</i>

384
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:09,700
I pushed him away because
I was being dragged by force.

385
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:14,300
You're calling that a mutual assault?

386
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,900
After going to the pub in
the basement of that building,

387
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,433
since we met by chance,

388
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:22,100
I just wanted to have a quick chat to catch up.

389
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,533
Darn it.

390
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:26,133
Because of a sudden shove…

391
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:38,800
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

392
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:47,167
So, did you hit the victim's face
with a glass bottle?

393
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,867
It was an accident.

394
00:28:49,867 --> 00:28:54,233
I really don't know why I did it,

395
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:59,533
because it hurt so much
and there was blood everywhere.

396
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:01,900
I just swung whatever I could grab.

397
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,500
I really didn't know if it
was a bottle or something else.

398
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:09,733
I wonder why I did that.

399
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:17,900
For now, the verified CCTV footage
supports Choi Chang Min's statement.

400
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:30,500
So, it's considered a spontaneous response
to Kim Da Hee's act of violence.

401
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,867
You're going to stick to
it consistently, right?

402
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:39,033
Yes, mutual assault.

403
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:41,700
It's a simple injury.

404
00:29:44,733 --> 00:29:47,300
Excuse me.

405
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,633
What's the matter?

406
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:53,600
I heard you moved Ms. Kim Da Hee to the
surgery room from the parking lot yesterday.

407
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,900
I haven't seen anything.

408
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,000
Do you know me?

409
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:00,967
What do you want to say?

410
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:02,900
No, someone said that.

411
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,100
To the discerning eyes
of our dear Cha Jeong Woo,

412
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,833
it's said that they can see things
others couldn't notice.

413
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:10,700
<i>He said that he got the dislocated bone
right back in place.</i>

414
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,833
<i>Ah, he must have x-ray vision!</i>

415
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,833
I believe the diagnosis
has already been issued.

416
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:17,900
I've seen that too.

417
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,200
I'm talking about an expert opinion
on the victim's scars, not the diagnosis.

418
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,633
Striking the cheekbone with a glass bottle
would have caused a fracture,

419
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:31,100
and then the broken glass bottle would
have hit the fractured area again.

420
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,067
That would seem to be how the scar was formed.

421
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:37,300
That's how you should proceed
with the investigation then.

422
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,600
No, I don't have a medical license.

423
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,400
It wasn't a swing made in
a moment of sudden anger,

424
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,100
there were at least two attacks--

425
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,133
You want proof of the perpetrator's intent?

426
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:48,333
Yes.

427
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:52,167
You're asking for a brief appraisal
report on the victim's scars.

428
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:54,333
Yes.

429
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,367
Bring a warrant.

430
00:30:57,367 --> 00:31:00,633
I don't disclose patient medical
information that carelessly.

431
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:03,300
Yes, you're right.

432
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,467
Hey!

433
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:08,467
Are you really a doctor after all this?

434
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:12,467
What kind of doctor are you,
only fixing women's faces?

435
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:14,367
No, I'm not here for that.

436
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:18,033
After she came and went back, my kid left home.

437
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:21,000
Seeing how the doctor was dismissive,

438
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,567
she said she doesn't need a father
like me and left the house.

439
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:26,200
Sir, please calm down for now.

440
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,400
How can I calm down when my child
has run away from home? How?

441
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,033
This is all your fault!

442
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:38,533
You're making a fuss because
I look like I don't have money.

443
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:40,667
Is that why you refused treatment?

444
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:43,367
Sir, just a moment.

445
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:47,033
Sir, let's go outside and talk.

- Please, come out.

00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:52,233

- Oh dear, to me, you…

448
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:53,733
Ah, you know me.

449
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:56,567
- Let this go, please.
- Ah, please calm down.

450
00:31:57,133 --> 00:31:59,533
- Let it go!
- No.

451
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:02,433
Don't overdo it. Sit down.

452
00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:04,700
Please mind your head.

453
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,633
Sir, I am sorry.

454
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,300

in the plastic surgery clinic.

464
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:01,867
Just stay quiet.

465
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:05,000
Quiet?

466
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:14,233

472
00:33:32,467 --> 00:33:35,467
am I just supposed to shut up and stay silent?

Yes, turns out you are a regular.

481
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,800
But it seems that you didn't know
that day was the regular day off.

No, to be beaten up and stupid enough
not to collect any evidence…

519
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:20,800
Right, I did that.

520
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:24,367

<i>Cha Jeong Woo, you rat!</i>

703
00:54:10,367 --> 00:54:12,467
<i>While completely disregarding people,</i>

704
00:54:12,467 --> 00:54:16,500
<i>what kind of doctor
selectively treats patients,</i>

705
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:22,033
<i>and wraps himself up as a
righteous doctor using patients</i>

706
00:54:22,033 --> 00:54:26,667
<i>thrilled with the shamelessness
of trying to gain fame.</i>

707
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:32,367
<i>Don't live like that, Cha Jeong Woo, you rat.</i>

708
00:54:53,367 --> 00:54:57,000
<i>[Face me]</i>

709
00:55:14,133 --> 00:55:15,967
<i>At a famous plastic surgery clinic in Gangnam,</i>

710
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,333
<i>the father of a patient
who was refused treatment</i>

711
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:19,667
<i>committed suicide by jumping off from his home.</i>

712
00:55:19,667 --> 00:55:21,900
- Do you take the responsibility?
- Please say something.

713
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,400
Doctor Cha Jeong Woo, really…

714
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,600
Went between heaven and hell overnight.

715
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,100
From a righteous doctor who saved a patient

716
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,367
to a doctor mentioned in a dead person's will.

717
00:55:30,367 --> 00:55:31,667
You're telling me to cooperate?

718
00:55:31,667 --> 00:55:33,767
Just stand beside me.

719
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:36,200
Okay, then I'll take it. One, two.

720
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,800
Why are you doing this? Victim medical support.

721
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,033
As for the victims of crime,

722
00:55:40,033 --> 00:55:42,833
they absolutely need that
consolation and empathy.

723
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:44,400
Can't I go to the plastic surgery clinic?

724
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,333
If it is related to Nam Gi Taek's death.

725
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:51,300
Why involve Doctor Cha Jeong Woo?
