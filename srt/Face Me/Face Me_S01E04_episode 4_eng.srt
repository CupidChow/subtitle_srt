7
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:30,999
 It's all over. 

8
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,410
 ­  

9
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,225
Where did Jeong Hui Yeong go?

10
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:49,751
What?

11
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:51,251
Huh?

12
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,040
 ­  

13
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:51,018
Is this all you've been doing?

14
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,184
I'm already dead anyway.

15
00:02:55,818 --> 00:03:01,118
I already died in that park!

16
00:03:01,118 --> 00:03:02,651
What's the point of living like this?

17
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:04,998
My life is completely ruined!

18
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:07,784
So, if you die,

19
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:10,095
what will that solve?

20
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:23,618
If you die and disappear,

21
00:03:23,618 --> 00:03:26,005
it means nothing.

22
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:31,025
You are alive, Jeong Hui Yeong.

23
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:36,282
You're not dead.

24
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,840
  ­ 

25
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:05,951
   

26
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:44,518
What is it? Did you get possessed by a spirit guide?

27
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:49,684
With what's happening right now, and also the fact that you knew that Sin Jeong Sook would go to KSH Cosmetic Surgery.

28
00:04:52,784 --> 00:04:54,618
I asked you to find photos

29
00:04:54,618 --> 00:04:58,851
of the acid attack on the district office employee two years ago. Right?

30
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:00,584
I am indebted to that person.

31
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:03,184
 ...after ruining her model face like this, 

32
00:05:03,184 --> 00:05:04,451
 What are you going to do about it? 

33
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:07,384
She was flustered when she saw the photos of other acid attack victims.

34
00:05:07,384 --> 00:05:09,751
Is this woman the victim?

35
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:12,718
Perhaps Sin Jeong Sook probably didn't know Jeong Hui Yeong well.

36
00:05:12,718 --> 00:05:18,130
So she must have needed to confirm if she did her job properly.

37
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,251
Madam, it's me.

38
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:22,184
Could you please open the door?

39
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:24,218
She must have thought she needed to prove it

40
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:27,951
to the person who ordered her to do that.

41
00:05:31,883 --> 00:05:33,818
You are impressive as always.

42
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:36,462
Yes, I know.

43
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:53,285
Because it seemed different from the victim's photo shown at the police station,

44
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:56,185
you went to the hospital yourself?

45
00:05:57,017 --> 00:06:00,051
I was worried I made a mistake.

46
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:02,251
Goodness, you are so naive.

47
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:05,084
The articles are everywhere.

48
00:06:06,677 --> 00:06:09,484
Anyway, well done.

49
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:13,718
But did you have to come at such a late hour?

50
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:16,442
You could have come later.

51
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:19,884
I'm sorry.

52
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:22,818
I was in such a hurry for money.

53
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:25,531
Have you already spent the advance you received?

54
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:27,700
In just a week?

55
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,518
Oh, Madam Sin.

56
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:39,884
I didn't know you were interested in that sort of thing.

57
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:44,644
I guess

58
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:47,084
that would make you desperate for money.

59
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:50,290
The smell of leather is so nice.

60
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:52,840
That's right.

61
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:56,215
It doesn't seem to suit you.

62
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,862
The remaining payment is one thousand.

63
00:06:58,862 --> 00:07:01,820
With this, the payment is all settled.

64
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:16,269
Aren't you leaving?

65
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:22,675
What are you doing, Ajumma?

66
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:25,844
Please leave now.

67
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:37,625
Ajumma.

68
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,064
A-Ajumma!

69
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:05,770
What are you doing?

70
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:10,351
I pretended to be crazy and splashed hydrochloric acid once,

71
00:08:10,351 --> 00:08:13,118
and it stripped away the fear.

72
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:18,158
It's thrilling, isn't it?

73
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:23,025
The fact that you can ruin someone's life with just a flick of the wrist.

74
00:08:27,185 --> 00:08:30,812
Don't look at me that way.

75
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:33,025
It's not like I am a bug.

76
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:35,254
So annoying.

77
00:08:40,597 --> 00:08:42,470
Ajumma!

78
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:46,684
No, Madam Sin,

79
00:08:46,684 --> 00:08:48,718
you must have had a tough time yesterday and today.

80
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:51,651
First, go home and rest.

81
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:55,551
How could I possibly sleep comfortably?

82
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,051
Look...

83
00:08:57,051 --> 00:09:01,218
at what we did to that Jeong Hui Yeong girl.

84
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:08,008
Us, you say?

85
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:13,184
That's right, us…

86
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:17,118
Jeong Hui Yeong had an affair with my husband.

87
00:09:17,118 --> 00:09:19,784
And just to take revenge,

88
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:21,664
I had to pretend to be crazy later on.

89
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:23,451
Then, I got a lawyer.

90
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:25,884
Somehow, claiming mental and physical weakness got me out.

91
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:31,269
Yes, right here, your voice is all recorded, you see?

92
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:36,074
Seriously, Ajumma, how could you?

93
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,438
Madam.

94
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,323
You're as beautiful as Jeong Hui Yeong, Madam.

95
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:50,824
Huh?

96
00:09:56,771 --> 00:10:00,810
Compensation for the mental harm from my guilt.

97
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,495
Please do that for me a bit longer.

98
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,951
Sir, that black box,

99
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,618
could you just…

100
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,184
Seo Yoon Ha.

101
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:38,820
Wife of Kim Ji Hyeok, president of JH Model Agency.

102
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:43,785
Ms. Jeong Hui Yeong was a model under that agency until last year.

103
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:48,513
The fact of giving a large sum of cash

104
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:51,720
to the person who splashed hydrochloric acid...

105
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:56,041
means there was some sort of transaction between Seo Yoon Ha and Sin Jeong Sook.

106
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,342
On social media and personal broadcasts,

107
00:10:58,342 --> 00:11:01,641
the reason Jeong Hui Yeong appeared at that modeling agency last year

108
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:04,696
is rumored to be because of a scandal with the agency's president.

109
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:05,756
So, due to that kind of relationship

110
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:08,635
between Jeong Hui Yeong and Kim Ji Hyeok,

111
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:11,947
Seo Yoon Ha, the wife, harbored ill feelings and just asked Sin Jeong Sook—

112
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:13,960
I should stitch those lips shut.

113
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,646
Who told you to investigate based on rumors?

114
00:11:15,646 --> 00:11:18,444
It's a matter that can cause secondary harm to the victim.

115
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:22,997
Moreover, Kim Ji Hyeok is currently incarcerated due to a sexual harassment case last year.

116
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:24,645
Be careful with your words.

117
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:26,456
I apologize.

118
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:29,625
But securing evidence is the key.

119
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,991
If they brush it off as if that cash is a bonus

120
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,993
given to the housekeeper, there's nothing we can do.

121
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,168
That woman must be hiding something.

122
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:40,859
Looking at the card statements, her spending is no joke.

123
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:43,984
I wonder if she stashed something away in case she ever ran low on funds.

124
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:47,918
We can't even search and seize it since it's still a vague conjecture.

125
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,484
Seeing her coming out with money tonight,

126
00:11:50,484 --> 00:11:53,512
it seems she has an urgent need for it.

127
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,567
Start by looking into her recent movements.

128
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,101
There must be something to dig into.

129
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:01,567
Yes, Ma'am.

130
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:05,311
Yes, hello?

131
00:12:06,878 --> 00:12:09,011
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo?

132
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,965
Is Jeong Hui Yeong okay?

133
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,700
En garde!  (On your guard) 

134
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,360
Êtes prêts?  (Are you ready?) 

135
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,960
Allez!  (Let's go!) 

136
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,260
À droite.  (The right) 

137
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,710
Prêts?  (Ready?) 

138
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,820
Allez!  (Let's go!) 

139
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,560
Halte!  (Halt) 

140
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,650
Attention!

141
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:46,310
Salut!  (Salute) 

142
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:50,360
He let you off easy again.

143
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,255
I did not.

144
00:12:51,255 --> 00:12:52,721
Are you kidding?

145
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,755
With your skills, you could have easily avoided this.

146
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:58,455
Sometimes it seems like you parry just to get stabbed.

147
00:12:58,455 --> 00:13:01,188
- Want a drink? 
 - Next time.

148
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:03,899
Then, we'll go ahead.

149
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,390
♫  I can't forget the first day I saw you  ♫

150
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:43,300
♫  The wind was so cold. After your awkward hello  ♫

151
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,410
 You worked hard today, too. 

152
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,210
♫  Frozen, you were all I could see  ♫

153
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:53,330
♫  Every night when I missed you  ♫

154
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,990
♫  We would spend all night on the phone  ♫

155
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,730
♫  Time passed too quickly  ♫

156
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,850
♫  While we talked and kept sipping our drinks 

157
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,020
♫  We've seen our last sunset  ♫

158
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,310
♫  I wish I could go back to those times with you  ♫

159
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,360
♫  When I saw you  ♫

160
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,010
♫  I want to go back to that dream  ♫

161
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:27,200
♫  When you were sitting there in that chair  ♫

162
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:35,850
♫  I'm walking outside of your thousand miles  ♫

163
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,400
♫  To the place where I saw you   ♫

164
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,955
I told you to stop drinking.

165
00:14:40,955 --> 00:14:44,034
And why don't you answer the phone?

166
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:45,834
Yeah, here.

167
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:54,210
Goodness.

168
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:56,421
   

169
00:15:00,955 --> 00:15:05,270
Yes, this is the customer's phone.

170
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:16,188
All right, you did a great job today, so consider this a reward.

171
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:28,188
   

172
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:39,408
Why are you so anxious? Like a puppy that needs to poop.

173
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:42,867
The detective gave him a lift herself.

174
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:46,340
Was there another unfortunate incident with Jeong Woo at the hospital?

175
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,288
Maybe?

176
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:51,121
What else happened besides yesterday's event?

177
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:53,455
It's been particularly bad these past few days.

178
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:57,321
Then why didn't you stay a bit with him? Why bother so much about a silly blind date?

179
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:58,821
S-Silly?

180
00:15:58,821 --> 00:15:59,988
Excuse me!

181
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:02,055
I'm trying to communicate with these various people.

182
00:16:02,055 --> 00:16:05,655
One shouldn't belittle this open-mindedness, especially a lawyer.

183
00:16:06,421 --> 00:16:07,755
Right.

184
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:09,655
You've been devoted to just one guy since your school days. What would you know

185
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:12,321
about my feelings?

186
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:16,088
- Darn, just like that! 
 - Here it is, right on time! Jeong Woo's car.

187
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:25,121
Oh, my! Sorry for the trouble.

188
00:16:25,121 --> 00:16:27,921
Catching criminals by day, running as a substitute driver by night.

189
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,321
How did you end up driving Director Cha's car, too?

190
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:31,721
Did you two drink together?

191
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:33,055
Of course not.

192
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:34,621
I called him because of work, by coincidence.

193
00:16:34,621 --> 00:16:37,362
- Hurry and take care of him for me. 
 - Okay.

194
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,288
Jeong Woo, how much did you drink?

195
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:44,306
Jeong Woo, come to your senses. Jeong Woo!

196
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:51,230
Be careful.

197
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,821
Come here.

198
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:58,355
We meet again like this.

199
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:00,356
The three of you are friends, I see.

200
00:17:00,356 --> 00:17:03,344
Yes, take care.

201
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,688
Taking care of crime victims,

202
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:10,755
Jeong Woo…

203
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:15,155
No. How long does Director Cha have to do this?

204
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:18,421
That's not something I can confirm.

205
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:20,855
Why do you ask?

206
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:25,210
It seems there were some issues with a victim under treatment.

207
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:27,545
It's not that there were problems,

208
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:29,645
but rather that the existing problems were resolved, no?

209
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:31,355
Whatever the case,

210
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:35,421
dealing with crime victims won't be easy for Director Cha.

211
00:17:38,548 --> 00:17:40,614
Director Cha, too,

212
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:44,588
is a crime victim.

213
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:49,055
He lost his fiancée...

214
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:53,321
to a criminal case seven years ago.

215
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,488
Meeting with crime victims

216
00:17:57,488 --> 00:18:03,715
must be constantly reopening old wounds he thought he had dealt with.

217
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,621
Isn't it about time to forget now?

218
00:18:44,158 --> 00:18:45,866
- Why? 
  - About Sin Jeong Sook. 

219
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:48,055
 There's something unusual about her recent movements. 

220
00:18:48,055 --> 00:18:51,006
Unusual? Like what?

221
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,021
 She frequently visited the hospital. 

222
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:54,267
 A plastic surgery clinic. 

223
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,315
 We found records of an appointment, too. 

224
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:58,115
Really?

225
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,810
 ­  

226
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:12,470
You want your eyes done like this?

227
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:17,703
Yes, I would like to have slightly thicker double eyelids.

228
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:20,328
You don't have drooping eyelids,

229
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:24,122
and it seems like you don't have any discomfort in terms of shape or function.

230
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:27,734
Also, such a flamboyant outline is not in trend these days either.

231
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,968
Well, I don't really know about trends or anything.

232
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:33,472
Can't you just do it like this for me?

233
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:39,021
What is the reason you want the surgery?

234
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:40,688
No, I…

235
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:45,216
Do I have to explain even that to get plastic surgery?

236
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,862
I-It's my first time coming to a place like this.

237
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:55,628
I need to know what kind of problem you want to improve, whether it's function or form,

238
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:59,264
so I can proceed with the surgery more effectively.

239
00:20:02,662 --> 00:20:04,490
Well, just…

240
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:09,274
I just need to look like this person.

241
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:15,028
The wife's lover.

242
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:16,895
From the husband's point of view,

243
00:20:16,895 --> 00:20:19,133
by having surgery to look like the lover his wife fell in love with,

244
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:22,509
doesn't it mean he wants to win back his wife?

245
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:25,876
A little while ago, I heard it also happened at the hospital where my friend works.

246
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:29,860
A woman showed a picture of his mistress and asked to be made similar.

247
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:33,495
Can you really bring back someone who has left by doing that?

248
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:35,128
Of course not!

249
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:37,328
You can't bring them back.

250
00:20:38,262 --> 00:20:41,995
If you could capture a departed heart by changing the face,

251
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:45,328
I would have had that plastic surgery hundreds of times.

252
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,578
I wonder who?

253
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,462
Who would you have wanted to catch so badly?

254
00:20:48,462 --> 00:20:51,662
Did you have such a pure-hearted love, Director Han?

255
00:20:51,662 --> 00:20:53,628
First love?

256
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,328
What?

257
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:58,495
Why are you all so serious about other people's love affairs?

258
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,762
Anyway, this plastic surgery clinic never has a calm day.

259
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:04,328
And come to think of it, that patient Jeong Hui Yeong, the one with the affair…

260
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:05,422
Hey!

261
00:21:05,422 --> 00:21:08,755
That's not a confirmed fact yet.

262
00:21:09,808 --> 00:21:12,008
Please let me know when the facts come out.

263
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:16,600
Are you planning to just leave again today?

264
00:21:17,395 --> 00:21:19,262
Perhaps, do you have

265
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:21,570
    
 any connection to the patient?

266
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,428
Seeing that you came here twice, it seems

267
00:21:23,428 --> 00:21:26,421
like you have something you must want to talk about.

268
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:35,899
She is a friend of our daughter.

269
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:39,528
But for what…

270
00:21:39,528 --> 00:21:42,295
Do you know Kim Ji Hyeok by any chance?

271
00:21:42,295 --> 00:21:45,095
The CEO of JH Model Agency.

272
00:21:46,065 --> 00:21:49,763
Yes, what about that person?

273
00:21:49,763 --> 00:21:51,822
It's just my own thought, however,

274
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:53,663
perhaps this

275
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:56,208
might be related to Kim Ji Hyeok.

276
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,875
Why do you think so?

277
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,388
Our daughter, too,

278
00:22:00,388 --> 00:22:04,188
was a model in his company.

279
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,115
The person who splashed me with hydrochloric acid...

280
00:22:22,088 --> 00:22:25,120
is the woman who works at Kim Ji Hyeok's house?

281
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:30,021
She's been working as a housekeeper for quite a long time.

282
00:22:30,988 --> 00:22:32,902
Last night,

283
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:35,135
the place the suspect visited after leaving this hospital

284
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:37,802
was the house of CEO Kim Ji Hyeok.

285
00:22:38,635 --> 00:22:42,868
That person… is in prison now.

286
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:53,568
I heard that the model who died by suicide

287
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:56,341
after the sexual harassment scandal with Kim Ji Hyeok last year

288
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:59,707
was very close to you.

289
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:04,802
She is related to that case too, right? You too…

290
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:06,568
Enough.

291
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:11,708
Please leave now.

292
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,508
You can tell us everything now.

293
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,168
We'll catch the real criminal.

294
00:23:18,168 --> 00:23:20,294
But that's not the real end, is it?

295
00:23:20,294 --> 00:23:23,061
Both you and your friend...

296
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:27,606
shouldn't be misunderstood anymore. Right?

297
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:34,790
   

298
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,800
 ­  

299
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:39,435
Excluding the deposit of 300,000 won,

300
00:23:39,435 --> 00:23:43,067
you need to pay the surgery fee of 7.5 million won.

301
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:49,002
I've seen that before?

302
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:50,435
Yeah, that's right.

303
00:23:50,435 --> 00:23:52,935
Even the bundles tied with new bill bands in the envelope.

304
00:23:52,935 --> 00:23:55,768
Look at this. It's the same money, isn't it?

305
00:23:58,435 --> 00:24:00,840
You received it from Seo Yoon Ha, right?

306
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,102
Of course.

307
00:24:02,102 --> 00:24:05,168
The madam just gave it to me as a bonus.

308
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:08,346
You didn't receive it after showing photos of the victim?

309
00:24:10,668 --> 00:24:14,035
That… Going to the hospital yesterday was…

310
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,735
to apologize to the victim because I was feeling sorry.

311
00:24:16,735 --> 00:24:19,335
First, let's go to the station together.

312
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:21,835
I request your voluntary accompaniment regarding the supplementary investigation.

313
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,802
Ah, no way.

314
00:24:23,802 --> 00:24:25,568
I-I-I can't go.

315
00:24:25,568 --> 00:24:28,102
I must have the surgery no matter what.

316
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:30,368
After the surgery, you'll see how much I've changed.

317
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,335
I mean, to show off to that person.

318
00:24:32,335 --> 00:24:35,674
So you must cooperate even more with the investigation.

319
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:39,802
That way, you can get the surgery as soon as possible.

320
00:24:39,802 --> 00:24:42,735
No, the date is…

321
00:24:44,102 --> 00:24:46,835
If you resolve it quickly and let us know,

322
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:50,202
we'll make arrangements for you to have the surgery immediately.

323
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:51,914
Yes.

324
00:24:51,914 --> 00:24:54,014
Money…

325
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,902
Ms. Seo Yoon Ha,

326
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:39,590
you are under emergency arrest on charges of instigating special bodily harm against Jeong Hui Yeong.

327
00:25:41,202 --> 00:25:44,235
Sin Jeong Sook spilled everything.

328
00:25:44,235 --> 00:25:47,602
That crazy b*tch is really…

329
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:51,302
Over there… right here.

330
00:25:51,302 --> 00:25:56,435
The deal with the madam has all been recorded.

331
00:25:56,435 --> 00:25:59,035
Uh… And this.

332
00:25:59,035 --> 00:26:02,002
It's a letter sent to the madam

333
00:26:02,002 --> 00:26:04,135
from her husband in prison.

334
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:06,902
It has the whole crime plan written down.

335
00:26:06,902 --> 00:26:12,423
If I cooperate with the investigation, I can get the surgery. Right?

336
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:15,724
Right?

337
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:27,105
Jeong Hui Yeong, that girl.

338
00:26:27,105 --> 00:26:31,638
Do you know how shameless and audacious that woman is?

339
00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:35,638
When a man does big things in society, he can make mistakes.

340
00:26:35,638 --> 00:26:38,438
But to report it so quickly?

341
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,038
After all we'd done to support her.

342
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:45,605
The fact that Mr. Kim Ji Hyeok sexually harassed Ms. Jeong Hui Yeong.

343
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,870
Are you admitting it?

344
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:51,005
What are you talking about?

345
00:26:52,205 --> 00:26:54,272
That's what Jeong Hui Yeong said?

346
00:26:54,272 --> 00:26:56,605
She's a victim, too?

347
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:59,705
No, it's not her!

348
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:02,572
She reported it even though she wasn't a victim!

349
00:27:02,572 --> 00:27:05,972
My husband is also exploding with anger in prison—

350
00:27:11,472 --> 00:27:14,272
So, because Ms. Jeong Hui Yeong is a whistleblower,

351
00:27:14,272 --> 00:27:16,472
you're saying she committed the crime?

352
00:27:16,472 --> 00:27:20,638
And you planned the crime in advance with Mr. Kim Ji Hyeok?

353
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,238
You might as well just keep your mouth shut.

354
00:27:23,238 --> 00:27:27,505
Thank you for detailing everything from the motive to the process of the crime.

355
00:27:28,372 --> 00:27:30,764
It's being recorded well, isn't it?

356
00:27:33,705 --> 00:27:35,972
Ms. Seo Yoon Ha,

357
00:27:35,972 --> 00:27:38,530
this time, you won't be able to get out.

358
00:27:39,172 --> 00:27:44,230
The terrible thing you did, I'll make sure you receive proper punishment.

359
00:27:51,605 --> 00:27:54,872
   

360
00:27:57,712 --> 00:27:59,607
It's Kim Ji Hyeok!

361
00:28:01,238 --> 00:28:02,638
Don't you have anything to say to the victim?

362
00:28:02,638 --> 00:28:03,772
Is there another accomplice?

363
00:28:03,772 --> 00:28:06,338
 A case that was thought to be a crime of someone with mental disability 

364
00:28:06,338 --> 00:28:10,338
 turned out to be a meticulously planned revenge crime. 

365
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:14,205
 Kim, who was in prison last year for charges 

366
00:28:14,205 --> 00:28:16,838
   
 of sexual harassment, harbored a grudge. 

367
00:28:16,838 --> 00:28:19,438
 While exchanging letters with his wife, while in prison, 

368
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:22,572
 he is known to have meticulously planned the crime. 

369
00:28:22,572 --> 00:28:25,505
 In the process, he used the housemaid Ms. Sin 

370
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:26,972
 to abet the crime, and 

371
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:31,005
 it is known that he even attempted to destroy evidence. 

372
00:28:32,572 --> 00:28:35,172
 Please don't do this, Boss. 

373
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,505
 Please! 

374
00:28:37,505 --> 00:28:41,018
 Sir, I have something to say about that contract issue. 

375
00:28:47,705 --> 00:28:50,594
 Why? What's the matter? 

376
00:28:57,365 --> 00:28:59,098
 That is… 

377
00:29:04,518 --> 00:29:06,952
 We can talk about it later. 

378
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:34,471
I'll apply some peripheral vasodilators for you.

379
00:29:42,838 --> 00:29:44,172
    
 Wow, this is crazy.

380
00:29:44,172 --> 00:29:46,538
For someone who detests meddling in others' affairs.

381
00:29:46,538 --> 00:29:48,512
 Exchanging letters with his wife, 

382
00:29:48,512 --> 00:29:52,672
 it was revealed that the crime was meticulously planned. 

383
00:29:52,672 --> 00:29:54,405
Manager Yang, could you please look at this?

384
00:29:54,405 --> 00:29:57,305
What is it? Why?

385
00:29:57,305 --> 00:29:59,905
Have you seen the news?

386
00:29:59,905 --> 00:30:01,038
What news?

387
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:02,938
About patient Jeong Hui Yeong.

388
00:30:02,938 --> 00:30:06,538
They say she is a whistleblower. A whistleblower.

389
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,330
Pardon?

390
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,172
Oh, dear.

391
00:30:10,172 --> 00:30:11,534
Spreading rumors without even verifying the facts.

392
00:30:11,534 --> 00:30:14,305
Who goes around blabbering rumors as if they are true?

393
00:30:14,305 --> 00:30:16,105
Do you know who it is?

394
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,105
Oh, my.

395
00:30:18,865 --> 00:30:21,598
Just really bad people.

396
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,018
Director Cha.

397
00:30:32,003 --> 00:30:35,059
What kind of surgery are you preparing for that is making you look so serious?

398
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:37,905
Mind your own business. It's not your patient.

399
00:30:37,905 --> 00:30:40,865
Right, just take care of your own patients.

400
00:30:40,865 --> 00:30:44,592
Why bother caring about someone else's patient, right?

401
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:48,259
Pay some attention to your patients.

402
00:30:49,052 --> 00:30:52,085
Still, as a doctor specializing in victims, you should know at least this much.

403
00:30:52,085 --> 00:30:54,117
   

404
00:30:57,231 --> 00:31:00,265
It's not important information for the patient's treatment.

405
00:31:01,591 --> 00:31:03,245
Some people never really change.

406
00:31:03,245 --> 00:31:05,528
Right?

407
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:12,497
It's Jeong Hui Yeong.

408
00:31:14,418 --> 00:31:16,941
I guess he was paying attention.

409
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:32,207
Are you going to the police station?

410
00:31:36,158 --> 00:31:39,884
They say the person who ordered the crime is in the police station near here.

411
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:43,517
Are you going to chase after them and stab them with that?

412
00:31:44,325 --> 00:31:45,791
Don't worry about it.

413
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,658
Even if you stabbed them with that, you probably couldn't kill them.

414
00:31:49,957 --> 00:31:54,237
That's ring forceps for holding gauze during dressing.

415
00:31:54,237 --> 00:31:58,458
Instead of wasting your time on nonsense, get a consultation for your scars.

416
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,725
Will that make this go away?

417
00:32:01,725 --> 00:32:04,171
Of course...

418
00:32:04,171 --> 00:32:06,864
We can't get rid of it completely.

419
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:09,417
Even if it's covered with a graft.

420
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:11,225
A graft?

421
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:13,358
A skin graft.

422
00:32:14,158 --> 00:32:16,600
That's what I came to talk about.

423
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:23,091
If you're going to get revenge, make it a real revenge.

424
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:27,025
Don't think about giving up your life like the assailants want.

425
00:32:30,485 --> 00:32:33,951
We can schedule a time for surgery consultation immediately.

426
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:57,891
 Ah, hello? 

427
00:32:57,891 --> 00:33:00,458
 This is the beauty model selection committee. 

428
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:03,591
 Are you feeling all right? 

429
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:05,391
Yes.

430
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:07,491
What's the matter?

431
00:33:07,491 --> 00:33:10,958
 Well… I'm contacting you regarding the final recording of the audition. 

432
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:14,658
 I guess… it would be difficult for you to participate, right? 

433
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:23,318
Let's see…

434
00:33:23,318 --> 00:33:27,458
KSH Plastic Surgery.

435
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:32,758
The article about Director Cha Jeong Woo's reconstructive surgery for a crime victim…

436
00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:36,057
   

437
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,738
There's none.

438
00:33:37,738 --> 00:33:39,925
Why isn't it here?

439
00:33:39,925 --> 00:33:42,219
Why is this missing?

440
00:33:42,758 --> 00:33:44,091
Oh, Manager Yang!

441
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:46,325
Has our article not been published yet?

442
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:48,958
Ah, I talked a lot to Reporter Kim about it.

443
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:51,158
Why hasn't this been turned into an article?

444
00:33:51,158 --> 00:33:52,972
She's the final candidate for the model contest.

445
00:33:52,972 --> 00:33:54,825
It seems like it would be quite an issue.

446
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:58,191
It's too early, the surgery is today.

447
00:33:58,191 --> 00:34:00,591
We should at least have an interview with the patient after the surgery

448
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:03,125
for it to be meaningful, don't you think?

449
00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:09,225
Then, to make sure we can nail down the before-and-after photo materials,

450
00:34:09,225 --> 00:34:13,758
get the pictures or interview before the surgery. Understood?

451
00:34:16,868 --> 00:34:17,825
Why?

452
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:22,211
Director Cha isn't performing the surgery for that reason, is he?

453
00:34:22,211 --> 00:34:25,091
What is this? Am I doing this just for my own benefit?

454
00:34:25,091 --> 00:34:28,425
I also want to quickly clear the disgrace concerning Director Cha.

455
00:34:28,425 --> 00:34:29,825
I know.

456
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:32,091
But you don't have to worry about that.

457
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:34,791
Because sincerity has a way of getting through.

458
00:34:35,758 --> 00:34:37,425
What do you mean by sincerity?

459
00:34:37,425 --> 00:34:40,158
I'm talking about compassion for the patient.

460
00:34:40,158 --> 00:34:43,716
Whether in the emergency room before,

461
00:34:43,716 --> 00:34:45,725
or here at the plastic surgery clinic,

462
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:49,205
doesn't it seem Director Cha's sincerity toward patients remains unchanged?

463
00:34:49,205 --> 00:34:53,491
Beginning the patient Jeong Hui Yeong's autologous skin graft surgery.

464
00:34:55,117 --> 00:34:57,118
We don't need any more debridement.

465
00:34:57,118 --> 00:34:59,270
Give me the local anesthesia.

466
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,184
I will do the skin harvest.

467
00:35:12,184 --> 00:35:14,451
   

468
00:35:52,725 --> 00:35:57,191
   

469
00:35:57,827 --> 00:35:59,828
   

470
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:01,713
   

471
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:09,858
Thank you for your hard work.

472
00:36:09,858 --> 00:36:12,891
Are you here to get the surgery records?

473
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:14,525
If you give them to me, I'll be thankful.

474
00:36:14,525 --> 00:36:18,125
They'll be useful for corroborating the victim's damages.

475
00:36:19,217 --> 00:36:22,150
I'll mention it, please take them.

476
00:36:23,158 --> 00:36:25,091
Thank you.

477
00:36:28,225 --> 00:36:31,358
No matter how much we solve cases and arrest criminals,

478
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:35,258
the police can't directly help the victims recover.

479
00:36:35,258 --> 00:36:38,758
But when a dedicated doctor steps in to assist in the recovery—

480
00:36:38,758 --> 00:36:40,625
I'm just doing what we do in plastic surgery.

481
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:44,591
Come on, that can't be all it is.

482
00:36:44,591 --> 00:36:46,791
Not only are there scars on the face,

483
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:50,125
but wouldn't it have contributed to the healing of Jeong Hui Yeong's heart, too?

484
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:53,825
While treating external wounds, it also helps heal the internal wounds.

485
00:36:53,825 --> 00:36:57,458
That's why they call plastic surgery "psychosurgery," right?

486
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,491
Huh? You seem embarrassed.

487
00:37:00,491 --> 00:37:03,557
Ah, wait a minute!

488
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:07,224
The face of someone who did a good thing is really…

489
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:13,658
Smile.

490
00:37:13,658 --> 00:37:16,166
Get your sugar refill, too.

491
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:29,058
He is embarrassed.

492
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:33,591
   

493
00:37:44,191 --> 00:37:45,858
I got a call from Sergeant Choi.

494
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:47,658
They say Jeong Hui Yeong will be discharged tomorrow.

495
00:37:47,658 --> 00:37:50,125
The surgery went well.

496
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:53,058
Of course, they must have taken good care of her.

497
00:37:53,058 --> 00:37:55,325
That Dr. Cha Jeong Woo.

498
00:37:55,325 --> 00:37:58,691
I heard that when Ms. Jeong Hui Yeong went up to the rooftop,

499
00:37:58,691 --> 00:38:01,391
he had left work but then suddenly turned his car around to come back.

500
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:04,558
It's like he knew Ms. Jeong Hui Yeong's situation perfectly.

501
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:09,125
He must have empathized with the victim's feeling of emptiness.

502
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:10,495
Emptiness?

503
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:14,125
The police investigate to solve cases.

504
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,660
When you see it directly from the side,

505
00:38:17,225 --> 00:38:20,920
it can feel futile from the victim's perspective.

506
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:24,625
What's going to change by doing that?

507
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:28,325
You can't turn it back to before the crime, anyway.

508
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:34,825
But how would Doctor Cha Jeong Woo know that feeling?

509
00:38:34,825 --> 00:38:37,158
Because what you see in a person isn't everything.

510
00:38:37,158 --> 00:38:40,625
Oh, it seems like you know something.

511
00:38:42,124 --> 00:38:44,358
There's something I want to know.

512
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:46,625
What is it? What?

513
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:50,358
How's the video of the car thief in Yeoksam-dong coming along?

514
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:52,091
I said I'd look into it.

515
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:53,391
That's right.

516
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:57,491
That, too, needs to be checked quickly as cases pour in like a flood.

517
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:59,991
On your way home, take a look around the theft location.

518
00:38:59,991 --> 00:39:02,625
I'll try to check the video footage near Mr. Nam Gi Taek's house.

519
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,433
Yes.

520
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:08,425
But if the two really are the same person,

521
00:39:08,425 --> 00:39:11,125
and if it's someone who holds a grudge against Mr. Cha Jeong Woo,

522
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:13,858
he might appear around him again.

523
00:39:13,858 --> 00:39:15,921
That's worrying.

524
00:39:16,825 --> 00:39:18,625
If they're not the same person,

525
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:21,125
I hope it was just my misunderstanding.

526
00:39:21,658 --> 00:39:23,678
I'll eat well.

527
00:39:23,678 --> 00:39:25,945
You've worked hard.

528
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:01,120
 ­  

529
00:40:04,825 --> 00:40:06,625
Hello, did you make a reservation?

530
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:10,340
I don't have a reservation, but could I possibly have a consultation for surgery?

531
00:40:11,505 --> 00:40:13,525
Hmm… What kind of surgery are you considering?

532
00:40:13,525 --> 00:40:15,379
My eyes.

533
00:40:16,971 --> 00:40:20,784
I'm not sure if it's possible.

534
00:40:33,925 --> 00:40:36,758
- Yes. 
  - Operating room number 2 is ready. 

535
00:40:36,758 --> 00:40:38,791
Understood.

536
00:40:44,257 --> 00:40:47,877
Starting anesthesia, please give the midazolam.

537
00:40:56,045 --> 00:40:58,046
Patient, do you feel a bit dizzy?

538
00:40:58,046 --> 00:40:59,912
Yes…

539
00:41:04,658 --> 00:41:06,697
Please give the local anesthesia.

540
00:41:11,191 --> 00:41:13,191
Corneal shield, please.

541
00:41:38,758 --> 00:41:40,658
Number 15.

542
00:41:58,991 --> 00:42:02,058
You want to remove the double eyelids?

543
00:42:02,058 --> 00:42:04,291
Yes, I want to have monolids.

544
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:06,258
Is that kind of operation not possible?

545
00:42:06,258 --> 00:42:09,558
By making an incision right above the eyelashes,

546
00:42:09,558 --> 00:42:12,725
some people do get it removed, occasionally.

547
00:42:12,725 --> 00:42:15,358
However, depending on the height or thickness of the double eyelid,

548
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,191
the possibility and method of surgery may vary.

549
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:21,958
So, it might not be possible?

550
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:25,391
You would have to consult with the director to know for sure.

551
00:42:25,391 --> 00:42:28,058
Do you have a particular eye shape in mind?

552
00:42:28,058 --> 00:42:30,258
Something like a sample photo.

553
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:32,691
You can show it to me.

554
00:42:32,691 --> 00:42:36,653
Yes, here it is.

555
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:41,458
This person…

556
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,125
The surgery went well.

557
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:45,525
Swelling may worsen for about 2 to 3 days,

558
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:48,425
but it will gradually subside, so please don't worry too much.

559
00:42:48,425 --> 00:42:50,691
Yes, thank you.

560
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:58,025
It turned out well like the photo I showed you, right?

561
00:42:58,025 --> 00:43:03,091
Now, you should look a bit more like your son.

562
00:43:03,091 --> 00:43:04,558
Excuse me?

563
00:43:04,558 --> 00:43:07,525
No, how did you…

564
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:13,491
Min-Min Seong! How did you get here?

565
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:16,391
Darn, what's this? Your eyes are all swollen!

566
00:43:16,391 --> 00:43:18,044
Ah, why are you here?

567
00:43:18,044 --> 00:43:19,177
What? Where are you trying to get surgery?

568
00:43:19,177 --> 00:43:21,277
I don't know!

569
00:43:26,891 --> 00:43:28,691
I'm sorry.

570
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:33,410
I thought I was the only one having a hard time.

571
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:45,956
Doctor!

572
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,991
Since my son came all this way,

573
00:43:49,991 --> 00:43:52,425
how about some surgery to make his nose just like mine?

574
00:43:52,425 --> 00:43:54,058
No, my nose is better!

575
00:43:54,058 --> 00:43:56,225
Ah, what do you mean, your nose is better? Dad's nose is better.

576
00:43:56,225 --> 00:43:58,225
- I'm telling you my nose is better. 
 - No, my nose is prettier.

577
00:43:58,225 --> 00:44:01,191
Geez, really, you brat.

578
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:02,991
Are you okay?

579
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:05,325
Ever since he found out about the adoption a while ago,

580
00:44:05,325 --> 00:44:07,358
I've heard the good father-son relationship became strained.

581
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:09,391
They both went their separate ways.

582
00:44:09,391 --> 00:44:13,658
He is not even his real dad, so "why interfere? Mind your own business."

583
00:44:13,658 --> 00:44:15,325
But how did you know?

584
00:44:15,325 --> 00:44:17,991
That the two of them were father and son?

585
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:19,607
The hand around the shoulder in the photo

586
00:44:19,607 --> 00:44:21,925
turned out to be Kim Hyeon Seok's.

587
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:26,658
 I just need to look like this person. 

588
00:44:26,658 --> 00:44:29,125
A photo taken together is still a photo, but

589
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:33,425
who else but family would look at you with such a gaze?

590
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:41,678
You're still the same.

591
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,217
Still?

592
00:44:45,217 --> 00:44:47,758
Something like that.

593
00:44:47,758 --> 00:44:49,491
Anyway, you've worked hard.

594
00:44:49,491 --> 00:44:52,325
The unspoken feelings between the father and son

595
00:44:52,325 --> 00:44:56,425
were clearly conveyed by you through the surgery.

596
00:45:03,558 --> 00:45:05,725
Oh, my…

597
00:45:05,725 --> 00:45:07,870
God!

598
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,391
It turned out so well!

599
00:45:09,391 --> 00:45:11,058
A real jackpot!

600
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:12,525
It is definitely different from being a former model.

601
00:45:12,525 --> 00:45:14,425
Exactly. What do we do?

602
00:45:14,425 --> 00:45:15,925
What are you doing?

603
00:45:15,925 --> 00:45:17,758
What are you all looking at so intently?

604
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:19,391
Manager, take a look at this.

605
00:45:19,391 --> 00:45:22,525
I think this is all because of Director Cha.

606
00:45:22,525 --> 00:45:25,258
Huh? Oh, that person!

607
00:45:25,258 --> 00:45:27,491
She's so pretty, isn't she?

608
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,559
Oh, my, what's going on?

609
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:31,425
 Although I received a skin graft, 

610
00:45:31,425 --> 00:45:33,692
   
 I can't go back to exactly how I was before. 

611
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:35,691
   

612
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,991
 I was about to give up, however 

613
00:45:37,991 --> 00:45:40,658
 someone told me that 

614
00:45:40,658 --> 00:45:42,125
 if I gave up like this, 

615
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:45,891
 I would be letting the assailants decide my life. 

616
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:48,725
 So I challenged myself. 

617
00:45:48,725 --> 00:45:50,691
 My life. These scars, too. 

618
00:45:50,691 --> 00:45:53,325
 I decided not to hide them and to show them as they are. 

619
00:45:53,325 --> 00:45:57,458
New face, new dream!

620
00:45:57,458 --> 00:46:00,458
This is it! This is what I was aiming for.

621
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:03,558
What a touching story this is.

622
00:46:03,558 --> 00:46:06,631
Touching stories like this don't come along every day.

623
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:07,891
Director,

624
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:11,792
did you gather everyone here to talk about that?

625
00:46:11,792 --> 00:46:14,287
Now, just wait a second.

626
00:46:14,287 --> 00:46:16,325
If Jeong Hui Yeong receives the award,

627
00:46:16,325 --> 00:46:18,958
and we continue to take care of the aftermath,

628
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:21,858
where else in the world can you find such promotional effects?

629
00:46:21,858 --> 00:46:25,358
So, let's all come together with one heart,

630
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:27,858
and support Jeong Hui Yeong.

631
00:46:27,858 --> 00:46:29,958
Got it? Let's watch it.

632
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:32,891
 The rankings have finally been decided. 

633
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:36,458
 It's the result of combining the audience votes and the judges' scores. 

634
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:38,991
 We will now announce 

635
00:46:38,991 --> 00:46:42,045
 K Beauty Model Contest's honorable 3rd place. 

636
00:46:42,045 --> 00:46:44,524
 The prestigious 3rd place goes to 

637
00:46:44,524 --> 00:46:48,725
 contestant number 13! Choi Mi Soon! Congratulations. 

638
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:52,191
   
 Congratulatory applause, everyone. 

639
00:46:52,191 --> 00:46:55,758
 I will now continue with the announcement of 2nd place. 

640
00:46:55,758 --> 00:46:58,106
 Second place, 

641
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,444
 number 23! Go Hui Jin! 

642
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:02,644
   
 Congratulations! 

643
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,865
I will go out first.

644
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,363
Uh, hey!

645
00:47:08,363 --> 00:47:10,625
First place… Only the first place remains.

646
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,641
Nobody can leave.

647
00:47:12,641 --> 00:47:14,632
Would she ever take first place?

648
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:16,191
There's no rule saying she can't!

649
00:47:16,191 --> 00:47:18,551
But there's no rule saying she will either.

650
00:47:18,551 --> 00:47:22,430
 Challenge! K Beauty Model Contest! 

651
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:26,817
 The final and most honorable first place, 

652
00:47:26,817 --> 00:47:32,148
 number 29, Choi Soo Ah! Congratulations! 

653
00:47:38,532 --> 00:47:40,258
I told you, didn't I? This?

654
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:42,491
That becoming first place isn't easy, you know?

655
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:44,625
In the end, everything is just about appearance.

656
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:48,378
She must have fallen behind in the public vote because of the early rumors.

657
00:47:48,378 --> 00:47:52,878
Ah, this can't just end like this! Right?

658
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:56,857
 Lastly, Ms. Jeong Hui Yeong, 

659
00:47:57,756 --> 00:48:01,191
 who had the courage to stand up against injustice despite all disadvantages, 

660
00:48:01,191 --> 00:48:03,725
 and who did not yield in the face of unfortunate circumstances, 

661
00:48:03,725 --> 00:48:05,758
 showing a spirit of challenge, 

662
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:08,258
 and embodying what Château Cornell pursues, 

663
00:48:08,258 --> 00:48:10,958
 the true essence of a woman. 

664
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:15,958
 Therefore, Château Cornell has decided to select Ms. Jeong Hui Yeong 

665
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:18,431
 as the representative model for the East Asia region. 

666
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,498
 We just received the information from our headquarters! 

667
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:23,466
 Congratulations, Ms. Jeong Hui Yeong! 

668
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:32,209
- You said it couldn't be done. 
 - What's with that face?

669
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:35,170
It's done!

670
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,758
It's settled!

671
00:48:37,758 --> 00:48:42,616
The plastic surgery, superbly done, changed everything, including the heart.

672
00:48:46,658 --> 00:48:50,391
   

673
00:48:50,391 --> 00:48:54,910
   

674
00:48:57,025 --> 00:49:00,725
 The face of someone who did a good thing is really… 

675
00:49:07,325 --> 00:49:09,325
 Smile. 

676
00:49:09,325 --> 00:49:11,829
 Get your sugar refill, too. 

677
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,160
 ­  

678
00:49:57,858 --> 00:49:59,625
Beautiful!

679
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:02,125
Such a beautiful fragrance!

680
00:50:04,797 --> 00:50:06,630
Good.

681
00:50:07,425 --> 00:50:10,025
Hey, Jeong Woo, won't you try a bit more?

682
00:50:10,025 --> 00:50:13,376
- What? 
 - The victim's dedicated doctor, I mean.

683
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:19,225
It strangely seems to suit you, even though it doesn't look like it will.

684
00:50:20,277 --> 00:50:24,654
No, I mean, the partner doctor in Bintan is still on hold.

685
00:50:26,058 --> 00:50:29,692
It's just that I didn't want you to feel disappointed.

686
00:50:30,425 --> 00:50:32,691
It's because I have a surgery.

687
00:50:42,658 --> 00:50:44,925
Is he doing it?

688
00:50:44,925 --> 00:50:46,943
Or is he not?

689
00:50:50,325 --> 00:50:52,696
Ugh, I sprayed too much.

690
00:50:56,758 --> 00:51:01,358
   

691
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,191
   

692
00:51:06,081 --> 00:51:07,725
Where have you been?

693
00:51:07,725 --> 00:51:09,514
You were nowhere to be seen all night.

694
00:51:09,514 --> 00:51:13,491
It's the guy who stole a car in Yeoksam-dong recently.

695
00:51:13,491 --> 00:51:15,658
Did anything new come out?

696
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:19,145
I heard a video came out, so I brought it.

697
00:51:19,145 --> 00:51:22,612
Is there anything that could identify the person?

698
00:51:23,258 --> 00:51:26,191
They didn't wear a mask here.

699
00:51:28,684 --> 00:51:30,525
The quality is good, too…

700
00:51:30,525 --> 00:51:34,669
It's hard to recognize the face accurately since he's wearing a pressed-down cap.

701
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:45,011
Do you have anyone in mind?

702
00:51:45,011 --> 00:51:46,758
What?

703
00:51:46,758 --> 00:51:50,058
No, I'm not sure.

704
00:51:50,058 --> 00:51:51,591
But somehow, it feels familiar.

705
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:54,111
Really? Who?

706
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:57,345
Among those you've caught before, is there anyone who looks similar?

707
00:51:57,345 --> 00:52:00,671
Well… I'll have to think about it.

708
00:52:00,671 --> 00:52:03,372
I think I need to go somewhere.

709
00:52:03,372 --> 00:52:05,861
Send me this video.

710
00:52:06,631 --> 00:52:08,360
Yes.

711
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:11,137
Good work!

712
00:53:24,012 --> 00:53:26,045
Who are you?

713
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,531
Lee Min Hyeong!

714
00:55:07,371 --> 00:55:09,704
It's been a while.

715
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:17,013
You've become prettier since I last saw you.

♫  I can't forget the first day I saw you  ♫

719
00:56:03,633 --> 00:56:07,248
♫  The wind was so cold  ♫

720
00:56:07,248 --> 00:56:11,641
♫  After your awkward hello  ♫

721
00:56:11,641 --> 00:56:17,725
♫  Frozen, you were all I could see  ♫

722
00:56:17,725 --> 00:56:21,277
 Do you have any idea who it might be after watching this? 

723
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:24,623
 Don't you have anything to talk to me about? 

724
00:56:24,623 --> 00:56:26,136
 Please help! 

725
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:27,826
 I'm a police officer. What's the matter? 

726
00:56:27,826 --> 00:56:29,380
 The delivery person who just ran out… 

727
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,558
 You are under arrest for trespassing. 

728
00:56:31,558 --> 00:56:34,491
 So, are you saying the wound wasn't caused by a falling fragment embedding itself? 

729
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:36,981
 Judging only by the shape of the wound, that's correct. 

730
00:56:36,981 --> 00:56:38,325
 What the heck is this jerk doing? 

731
00:56:38,325 --> 00:56:40,525
 You've been investigating assuming, I was the culprit from the beginning, haven't you? 

732
00:56:40,525 --> 00:56:44,200
 Is Detective Lee Min Hyeong with you now? 

733
00:56:46,325 --> 00:56:48,571
 Are you there? 

734
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,437
 Are you crazy? 

735
00:56:50,437 --> 00:56:52,571
 Lee Min Hyeong. 

736
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:57,978
♫  I'm walking outside of your...  ♫
