1
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:13,625
   

2
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:20,561
   

3
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,402
   

4
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:37,053
   

5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:51,900



6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,020
   

7
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,712
If the man captured on the dashcam

8
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:15,536
is related to Mr. Nam Gi Taek's death,

9
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:19,745
why would he have deliberately involved Dr. Cha Jeong Woo?

10
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:26,052
Well, if it's someone with a grudge, it's not impossible.

11
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:40,877
   

12
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:54,681
 Oppa. 

13
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,529
 What's wrong? Is something wrong? 

14
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,963
 - Hello? Hye Jin! 
 - I'm sorry. 

15
00:02:01,963 --> 00:02:04,132
 I should have told you earlier. 

16
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:07,234
 What are you talking about? Why are… 

17
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:12,035
 Hye Jin, what's going on… Hello? 

18
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:15,990
 Hye Jin! Yoon Hye Jin! 

19
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,591
 Please help. My girlfriend is home alone, but— 

20
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:42,957
Are you okay?

21
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:53,674
Are you okay, Mr. Cha Jeong Woo?

22
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:02,929
Mr. Cha Jeong Woo, can you stand up?

23
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,335
Take my hand.

24
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,348
 Are you okay? 

25
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:26,545
 Take my hand. Can you stand up? 

26
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,400
 ­  

27
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:16,578
Ah, yes! I'm Lee Min Hyeong.

28
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:18,063
Did you get home well?

29
00:04:18,063 --> 00:04:19,873
I'm fine.

30
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:22,192
But...

31
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:24,194
what happened?

32
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:26,546
What's with that car?

33
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:28,282
And how did you come out from there?

34
00:04:28,282 --> 00:04:30,242
I went to the hospital,

35
00:04:30,242 --> 00:04:31,927
and it seemed like that car was chasing you.

36
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:34,246
 So, I looked into it, and it turned out to be a stolen vehicle. 

37
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:35,247
What about the driver?

38
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:37,081
 Still under investigation. 

39
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:40,092
Whether it's my misunderstanding or if there's some kind of intent behind it,

40
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:42,124
I'll contact you again if anything comes up.

41
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:43,589
Understood.

42
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:45,552
 All right then. 

43
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,230
I've confirmed with the car owner, but there's nothing missing inside the car.

44
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,403
So, what happened?

45
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:04,993
I thought something happened when the car was suddenly put on the wanted list.

46
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:48,336
 Yes, Detective. 

47
00:05:48,336 --> 00:05:50,876
 I'll give you a plate number, please check the vehicle for me. 

48
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:53,012
 "28 Geo 0052" 

49
00:05:53,012 --> 00:05:54,781
   

50
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,839
 Did it come up? 

51
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,117
 That car is showing up as a stolen vehicle. 

52
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:37,828
 It was reported stolen an hour ago in Yeoksam-dong. 

53
00:06:37,828 --> 00:06:39,599
 What? 

54
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:54,964
It's recorded on the stolen vehicle's black box.

55
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:57,697
Hat with mask.

56
00:06:57,697 --> 00:07:00,122
Huh? Maybe…

57
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:03,729
Is that why you had me check on the vehicle?

58
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:08,150
Because he looks similar to the guy captured by the dashcam in front of Nam Gi Taek's house?

59
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,502
Well, we'll have to confirm if it's the same person.

60
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:11,778
Come on, surely not.

61
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:15,415
Check the location where the vehicle was initially stolen and secure the CCTV footage.

62
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:16,957
Yes, Ma'am.

63
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,730
   

64
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,660
 ­  

65
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,100
   

66
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,160
   

67
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,810
   

68
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,530
   

69
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,630
 ­  

70
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,074
Cut. Good. Okay.

71
00:07:58,074 --> 00:08:01,411
Now, let's smile brightly. Two, three…

72
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:03,538
Now, smile a little brighter.

73
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:06,479
Yeah, good; a bit more brightly.

74
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,540
Wow! Good!

75
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:12,892
Among the finalists, Hui Yeong has the prettiest smile.

76
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,540
 ­That's right! 

77
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,980
 ­Very good! 

78
00:08:17,986 --> 00:08:20,630
Hold the skirt and turn around once.

79
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,368
Okay, one more time.

80
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,654
Hui Yeong, come here.

81
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,979
Good, that's nice.

82
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:36,862
How do you even deal with that, seriously?

83
00:08:36,862 --> 00:08:38,709
That's really annoying.

84
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,913
 Filming in progress for the 3rd hour of the K-Beauty Model Contest. 

85
00:08:44,913 --> 00:08:46,802
 Contestant number 19, Jeong Hui Yeong. 

86
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:49,251
 Vote for Jeong Hui Yeong! Press down! 

87
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:54,982
 That's Jeong Hui Yeong who was fired from JH Model Agency last year, right? 

88
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:56,639
 I wonder why she was fired. 

89
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,983
 Celebrities and broadcasters from there are all doing well, though. 

90
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:01,633
 It's just obvious. 

91
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:04,494
 Her personal life's a bit… 

92
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:06,819
 Do you know something? 

93
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,720
Crazy bitches!

94
00:09:16,219 --> 00:09:18,547
They just feel inferior.

95
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:23,752
   

96
00:09:23,752 --> 00:09:25,631
Yeah, Oppa.

97
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:31,018
I'm almost done, I finished everything.

98
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:32,902
Okay, see you later.

99
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:39,559
What is it?

100
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,430
Why are you acting like this?

101
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,553
Bitch!

102
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:52,660
   

103
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:03,367
 A current hot topic: A contestant participating in the K-Beauty Model Contest 

104
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:09,265
 has been attacked with hydrochloric acid by a woman in her 40s. 

105
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:11,851
 The police have detained a suspect at the scene 

106
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:16,306
 and are investigating the exact motive for the crime. 

107
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,881
 Why did you do that to the victim? 

108
00:10:32,705 --> 00:10:35,079
Why did you go to that park?

109
00:10:41,915 --> 00:10:45,268
I work as a housekeeper, but suddenly,

110
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:48,947
the lady of the house told me not to come.

111
00:10:52,614 --> 00:10:55,184
And the weather was nice,

112
00:10:57,344 --> 00:11:00,774
so I went to take a walk in the park.

113
00:11:06,238 --> 00:11:08,993
You kept watching the victim in the park, didn't you?

114
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,063
You'd been watching from there from 30 minutes before the crime, right?

115
00:11:23,388 --> 00:11:27,240
She's pretty and slim.

116
00:11:31,514 --> 00:11:34,228
However, Detective,

117
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:38,005
who is this woman?

118
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:40,497
What?

119
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:47,460
I really don't remember, so I'm asking.

120
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:55,547
She's pretty.

121
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,400
   

122
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:09,340
Who is it?

123
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:12,330
What…

124
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:16,058
The person who killed my father.

125
00:12:16,058 --> 00:12:17,877
The killer?

126
00:12:17,877 --> 00:12:21,297
They said he might be someone with a grudge against you.

127
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:23,132
The detective said so yesterday.

128
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:25,880
 If the man captured on the dashcam 

129
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,155
 is related to Mr. Nam Gi Taek's death, 

130
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:33,580
 why would he have deliberately involved Dr. Cha Jeong Woo? 

131
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:37,152
 If it is someone with a grudge, 

132
00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:39,316
 it's not impossible. 

133
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:41,838
The day my father died,

134
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:44,779
they say a man came out of our house.

135
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:50,267
He was all covered up with a hat and a mask, so they couldn't tell who he was.

136
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:53,803
We saw that man in the vehicle's dashcam footage.

137
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:25,220
Considering the apartment's entrance door and the height of the car,

138
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,531
both people are approximately 180 centimeters, plus or minus 5 centimeters, tall.

139
00:13:28,531 --> 00:13:30,739
The general appearance is similar,

140
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:33,469
but it's impossible to compare the specific characteristics.

141
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:36,052
What about their gait or physical characteristics?

142
00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:39,947
Both videos are too short. Look at this.

143
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:45,089
The camera is so outdated,

144
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:48,584
even with the improvement in upscaled clarity, the quality is not good.

145
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:51,184
Therefore, it's impossible to confirm

146
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:54,855
that it's the same person just by looking at these two videos.

147
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,583
Why are you…

148
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:08,779
About the stolen vehicle in front of the convenience store, do you have any leads?

149
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:11,774
That's still being investigated.

150
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:13,701
How did you get in here?

151
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:16,549
Was Mr. Nam Gi Taek's death

152
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:19,392
a homicide and not a suicide?

153
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:26,932
Let's go outside and talk.

154
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,485
There's no evidence of homicide;

155
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:35,285
however, there are some questionable points, so the investigation has yet to be concluded.

156
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:40,807
The day Mr. Nam Gi Taek died, the person who came out of that house.

157
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:42,754
Is this the person?

158
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:49,695
It hasn't been confirmed yet whether it's the same person or not.

159
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:54,116
In fact, people who have surgery at the clinic also cover their faces with hats and masks.

160
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:56,926
It was not someone who came out of our clinic.

161
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,807
Then, would there be someone

162
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:09,697
who might hold a grudge against you or something?

163
00:15:09,697 --> 00:15:11,490
No.

164
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:13,510
Okay.

165
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:19,397
If it's not suicide, but homicide,

166
00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:23,279
that means someone tried to harm me intentionally.

167
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:25,648
There's also what happened last night.

168
00:15:25,648 --> 00:15:28,442
Would you like me to request personal protection?

169
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:30,823
No, it's okay.

170
00:15:30,823 --> 00:15:35,250
More importantly, if anything gets confirmed,

171
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,854
please let me know as well.

172
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,865
Yes, of course.

173
00:15:50,878 --> 00:15:53,025
Where did he hear about this?

174
00:15:53,025 --> 00:15:55,761
   

175
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:05,933
 Would there be someone who might hold a grudge against you or something? 

176
00:16:21,044 --> 00:16:22,994
 The suspect of drug use and murder 

177
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:25,182
 will be transferred to the prosecution this evening. 

178
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:27,594
 Meanwhile, the disclosure of personal information requested by the police 

179
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:29,757
 has been denied by the court, leading to controversy. 

180
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:31,255
 - Please look. 
 - Please look here! 

181
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:34,544
 What was the motive for the murder? 

182
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:37,269
 Do you have anything to say? 

183
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:38,509
 Hey, stop it! 

184
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:42,803
 Why did you do it? Why? 

185
00:16:42,803 --> 00:16:45,956
 Let go! 

186
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:49,241
 His face has been revealed! Quickly, take a picture. Camera! 

187
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:04,218
 Did you take the picture? Did you get it? 

188
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:21,113
   

189
00:17:34,173 --> 00:17:37,632
- Director Cha is inside, right? 
 - Pardon?

190
00:17:47,473 --> 00:17:51,393
Madam, what brings you here at this hour?

191
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:54,938
- Who is she? 
 - Our hospital's VIP.

192
00:17:54,938 --> 00:17:56,732
- Son. 
 - Yes, Madam.

193
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:58,967
How could you make me feel so neglected?

194
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:02,279
What have I done to disappoint you that much, Madam?

195
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:05,808
Do I have to find out the news about Director Cha through an article?

196
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:07,910
Oh, you saw the article.

197
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,559
That's not something you should worry about at all.

198
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,306
How could you say it's not something to worry about?

199
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:14,650
They say Director Cha is treating crime victims.

200
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,665
It's just a couple of cases for hospital promotion, and then he will be out.

201
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,332
Promotion?

202
00:18:22,382 --> 00:18:24,310
This is someone's plan?

203
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,250
   

204
00:18:26,961 --> 00:18:29,011
Ah, this?

205
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:33,790
It's part of our mission as doctors to practice sharing and give back to society

206
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,563
as a meaningful part of our social contribution activities.

207
00:18:36,563 --> 00:18:39,191
But why specifically crime victims?

208
00:18:39,191 --> 00:18:42,136
Aren't there more than one or two patients in need of reconstructive surgery?

209
00:18:42,136 --> 00:18:47,474
Well, if it involves crime, it could become an issue maker.

210
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:50,978
Are you planning to profit off someone else's son?

211
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:53,188
Director Cha does have a certain appeal in this field.

212
00:18:53,188 --> 00:18:54,468
Exactly!

213
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:57,359
Why misuse your "golden hand" on those people?

214
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,384
"Those people"?

215
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:00,963
Why would you do this?

216
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:04,366
Someone who even goes to volunteer at the prison?

217
00:19:04,366 --> 00:19:07,032
Even experts take special care,

218
00:19:07,032 --> 00:19:10,038
referencing counseling techniques, when dealing with crime victims.

219
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:12,030
How can you let Jeong Woo take care of them?

220
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,637
Hey!

221
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:17,088
- Now that I listen to it, it's just perfect. 
 - What?

222
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:19,156
Everything else about Jeong Woo is fine,

223
00:19:19,156 --> 00:19:21,925
but you know what Jeong Woo needs the most.

224
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:25,721
Especially considering the recently dead father incident.

225
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:27,825
He just needs a little, hmm?

226
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:31,510
If he just had a tiny bit of empathy, nothing more.

227
00:19:35,497 --> 00:19:36,957
I mean,

228
00:19:36,957 --> 00:19:41,086
I heard he was released last month and even had depression.

229
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:43,263
He wanted to get surgery done on his daughter's facial burn scars.

230
00:19:43,263 --> 00:19:46,341
Of all people, why did Jeong Woo have to be involved?

231
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:48,537
He was released?

232
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:52,264
Burn scar surgery?

233
00:19:52,264 --> 00:19:55,008
However, why all of a sudden?

234
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:57,290
Because he seems like someone I know.

235
00:19:58,036 --> 00:20:00,090
Someone you know?

236
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:01,860
But how?

237
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,070
   

238
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:10,224
   

239
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:21,903
   

240
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:32,996
   

241
00:20:32,996 --> 00:20:37,334
You had prosthetic surgery on the burned area?

242
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:39,188
Yes, it was last year.

243
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:40,629
Why do you ask?

244
00:20:40,629 --> 00:20:43,840
Fortunately, it's not too deep. It's a second-degree dermal burn,

245
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,468
but it's a chemical burn caused by the acid, 
    

246
00:20:46,468 --> 00:20:50,722
so the internal tissue damage might be more severe than expected.

247
00:20:50,722 --> 00:20:52,909
You should go to the hospital where you had the procedure

248
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:56,872
to get it checked and monitored.

249
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:59,184
The medical opinion—

250
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:06,662
What am I supposed to do now?

251
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:12,909
Thank you.

252
00:21:15,469 --> 00:21:17,013
For now, let's go to the plastic surgery clinic

253
00:21:17,013 --> 00:21:19,906
and I will help you get treatment.

254
00:21:22,724 --> 00:21:25,130
Why did she do that to me?

255
00:21:25,857 --> 00:21:28,986
Why exactly did she do that to me?

256
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:32,159
Crazy hag! Darn it!

257
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,768
Do you have absolutely no relationship with the perpetrator?

258
00:21:36,768 --> 00:21:40,195
I don't know her. She's a stranger!

259
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:12,888
These days, even a lot of men are getting smile-line surgery.

260
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:14,993
It's because the job competition is intense nowadays.

261
00:22:14,993 --> 00:22:17,003
If the smile-line surgery makes it look like you're smiling,

262
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,853
they say it's advantageous in interviews.

263
00:22:19,853 --> 00:22:22,556
A desperate struggle to survive by any means.

264
00:22:22,556 --> 00:22:26,417
Director Han, please check the suction, so we can move on immediately.

265
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,752
- How is it quiet? 
 - What is?

266
00:22:43,752 --> 00:22:45,170
Crime victim.

267
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,767
Why don't you just pray for them to come!

268
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:51,300
You need to quickly finish the 3rd case, so you can leave for Bintan.

269
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,621
Enough worrying about others,

270
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:56,257
just put the fat back in there.

271
00:22:57,504 --> 00:23:00,345
The right side is carved in.

272
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:05,800
How did he catch on to that so quickly?

273
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,220
One thing's for sure. He's got a keen eye.

274
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:11,572
Please give me a 20cc syringe.

275
00:23:14,574 --> 00:23:17,193
Let me carve the left side in deeper.

276
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,052
Director Cha,

277
00:23:24,052 --> 00:23:26,961
you will need to go to the treatment room right now.

278
00:23:26,961 --> 00:23:29,476
This person received a malarplasty from you.

279
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,180
She is a victim of an acid attack. 
    

280
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,808
Victim of crime?

281
00:23:32,808 --> 00:23:35,668
Yes, she has received first-aid treatment.

282
00:23:35,668 --> 00:23:38,065
The injury is located where the implant was made.

283
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:40,817
She is currently waiting in the treatment room.

284
00:23:44,698 --> 00:23:49,354
The injury doesn't seem severe enough to affect the operated area where the implant is located.

285
00:23:49,354 --> 00:23:52,190
Since there's a possibility of further infection,

286
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:56,218
it would be best to remove the implant.

287
00:24:00,726 --> 00:24:05,947
So, will it disappear with treatment?

288
00:24:07,372 --> 00:24:10,371
I have a final audition coming up.

289
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:14,483
I've endured so fiercely just to get to that final audition.

290
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:22,883
Then, hold on a bit longer.

291
00:24:22,883 --> 00:24:25,408
First, stop crying.

292
00:24:25,408 --> 00:24:28,807
Excuse me… This person is a victim of crime.

293
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:32,698
Contaminants should not contact the area that needs to remain aseptic,

294
00:24:32,698 --> 00:24:35,173
because the area is susceptible to infection.

295
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:41,295
Intensive dressing treatment is advisable in the initial stages of chemical burns.

296
00:24:41,295 --> 00:24:44,102
Make sure to visit the hospital every day for now.

297
00:24:44,102 --> 00:24:46,156
Excuse me.

298
00:24:46,156 --> 00:24:49,022
Can't I just stay at the hospital?

299
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:53,754
If I go home, I'll be alone with no one to take care of me.

300
00:24:53,754 --> 00:24:56,070
I'm too scared.

301
00:24:58,678 --> 00:25:01,431
You said she's susceptible to infection.

302
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:06,145
If she needs surgery, please just admit her for inpatient treatment

303
00:25:06,145 --> 00:25:09,100
since you are a dedicated doctor for crime victims.

304
00:25:18,823 --> 00:25:23,411
Admission or surgery isn't something I can decide alone.

305
00:25:23,411 --> 00:25:26,539
Then admit her right away!

306
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:31,586
New Face! New Dream!

307
00:25:31,586 --> 00:25:34,047
How about this for a press release title?

308
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:38,284
"Finding a new face for the model who lost hers to an acid attack."

309
00:25:38,284 --> 00:25:41,095
We will proceed with reconstructive surgery after the burn treatment.

310
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:42,641
When the article is published…

311
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,975
Wow! Wouldn't this lead to quite a few broadcast invitations?

312
00:25:45,975 --> 00:25:48,975
But will the victim agree to an interview?

313
00:25:48,975 --> 00:25:51,648
Not the victim, me.

314
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:52,665
Of course.

315
00:25:52,665 --> 00:25:56,540
Anyway, provide full support as the victim wishes.

316
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,047
How about revealing the before and after once the reconstructive surgery is done?

317
00:26:00,047 --> 00:26:02,900
I hear she's quite a hot model these days because of the broadcast.

318
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,622
Manager Yang, no issues with the schedule?

319
00:26:04,622 --> 00:26:06,529
No, no problem.

320
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:08,809
You two take care of the promotion.

321
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:10,892
This is the last time we'll support a victim.

322
00:26:10,892 --> 00:26:13,394
Hey, why are you being so calculating again…

323
00:26:13,394 --> 00:26:16,481
It was agreed, wasn't it? To just support three people.

324
00:26:16,481 --> 00:26:18,483
Well, that's true.

325
00:26:18,483 --> 00:26:22,186
- Please set the surgery schedule. 
 - Okay.

326
00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:31,120
Is it ending like this so soon?

327
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,030
   

328
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,570
Have you talked to the homeowner

329
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,125
where Sin Jeong Sook worked as a housekeeper?

330
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:37,518
What did they say?

331
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:39,695
They said an important guest was coming to the house,

332
00:26:39,695 --> 00:26:41,472
so they told her not to come to work.

333
00:26:41,472 --> 00:26:43,656
But it's a bit…

334
00:26:43,656 --> 00:26:45,529
A bit what? Why?

335
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:49,085
They said Sin Jeong Sook isn't the type to do such a thing.

336
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:51,599
They kept asking us to earnestly look into it properly.

337
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:52,600
What about the CCTV?

338
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,548
Bus, park, in front of the restroom.

339
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:57,275
Nothing special was found.

340
00:26:57,275 --> 00:27:01,003
On the way to her housekeeping job, she got off the bus

341
00:27:01,003 --> 00:27:02,513
because the homeowner told her not to come.

342
00:27:02,513 --> 00:27:04,368
While walking in the park,

343
00:27:04,368 --> 00:27:07,782
she was just watching the models, and acted impulsively?

344
00:27:07,782 --> 00:27:10,117
In other words, it was an unprovoked, random attack.

345
00:27:10,117 --> 00:27:14,858
Even from a forensic perspective, there's no evidence that the victim was targeted.

346
00:27:15,604 --> 00:27:19,167
The victim's movements were exposed, because it was a public post.

347
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:23,339
So anyone could have known the victim's location and schedule.

348
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:25,383
- What about Sin Jeong Sook's husband? 
 - It's a bit strange.

349
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:26,592
What's strange now?

350
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,096
Sin Jeong Sook is actually asking us to find her husband.

351
00:27:30,096 --> 00:27:32,550
She says she can't reach him.

352
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:37,488
Have you made contact? With my husband?

353
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,591
If you find him, please bring him to me.

354
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:48,464
I ended up like this because of that person.

355
00:27:48,464 --> 00:27:52,580
 I told you not to follow me, it's truly embarrassing. 

356
00:27:57,682 --> 00:28:00,344
 Just because I'm putting up with him… 

357
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:02,087
 they think I'm a fool, a moron! 

358
00:28:02,087 --> 00:28:03,819
 See you later. 

359
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:07,316
 Bitch! 

360
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,359
That bitch started it first.

361
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,420
She started it first!

362
00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:30,591
There is no severe damage to the internal tissue.

363
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:33,210
There's no deformation of the implant, either.

364
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:40,929
First, we'll suture and then start the burn treatment.

365
00:28:47,732 --> 00:28:51,132
 The possible winner of the model audition show was attacked with acid because… 

366
00:28:51,132 --> 00:28:52,261
   

367
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:55,164
 of the revenge by a jealous legitimate wife over an extramarital affair. 

368
00:28:55,164 --> 00:28:57,541
 Really, who is more extreme in this melodrama? 

369
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:00,151
 Let's vote for it in a moment. 

370
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:30,741
   

371
00:29:31,435 --> 00:29:33,519
It's not true at all.

372
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:36,280
I've never had an affair.

373
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,776
No,

374
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:40,741
that's not why I'm asking.

375
00:29:40,741 --> 00:29:44,644
I'm just making sure there are no false accusations.

376
00:29:50,596 --> 00:29:53,672
You seem to take a lot of photos usually.

377
00:29:53,672 --> 00:29:57,820
Could you please show me all the photos you took in the park yesterday?

378
00:29:58,409 --> 00:30:01,130
Not the ones posted on social media.

379
00:30:01,853 --> 00:30:03,930
Why my photos?

380
00:30:04,731 --> 00:30:06,610
Just a moment.

381
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:12,466
- Speak. 
  - I've been able to contact Sin Jeong Sook's husband. 

382
00:30:12,466 --> 00:30:16,600
 But he's asking us to come and see him. 

383
00:30:24,652 --> 00:30:28,656
I was out on a photo shoot for a few days.

384
00:30:28,656 --> 00:30:31,251
I knew something like this would happen someday.

385
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,100
According to Mrs. Sin Jeong Sook, this person was in an affair with you.

386
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,061
This woman was in an affair with me?

387
00:30:41,061 --> 00:30:43,005
It would be nice to even meet a woman like this.

388
00:30:43,005 --> 00:30:44,957
Please be careful with your words.

389
00:30:44,957 --> 00:30:47,789
- Anyway, it has nothing to do with me. 
 - Are you sure?

390
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:51,421
I mean, it's awkward for me to say this,

391
00:30:51,421 --> 00:30:53,899
but the woman I am seeing is…

392
00:30:59,688 --> 00:31:02,595
Could it be that the victim was mistaken for the husband's mistress?

393
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:05,083
My wife knows Seong Hui's face, too.

394
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:08,569
She's seen her many times while following us secretly.

395
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:11,442
Maybe she did it out of spite due to depression again.

396
00:31:11,442 --> 00:31:14,737
Depression? There were no psychiatric records.

397
00:31:14,737 --> 00:31:17,547
She has been on medication for quite a while.

398
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:24,410
Why is it like this?

399
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:30,349
In my heyday, I even made it to the Miss Korea local finals.

400
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:33,323
Because of whom do you think I became like this?

401
00:31:35,149 --> 00:31:38,277
 If there's no record, she might have gone under a friend's name. 

402
00:31:38,277 --> 00:31:41,347
 She may not have used her name, 

403
00:31:41,347 --> 00:31:44,270
 as psychiatric records can be disadvantageous in a divorce. 

404
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:47,204
 They say it's revenge by a jealous legitimate wife over an extramarital affair. 

405
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:49,508
 Really, who is more extreme in this melodrama? 

406
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:52,043
 Let's vote for it in a moment. 

407
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:59,220
Oppa.

408
00:31:59,893 --> 00:32:02,461
The face of a model…

409
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,805
I saw the article.

410
00:32:16,785 --> 00:32:18,971
Is it true?

411
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:20,402
Oppa.

412
00:32:20,402 --> 00:32:22,552
Who is that person?

413
00:32:23,813 --> 00:32:26,123
Oppa, don't you trust me?

414
00:32:26,123 --> 00:32:30,710
No, I can't trust you.

415
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:34,754
It's either filming or a business trip,

416
00:32:34,754 --> 00:32:36,230
not answering calls for half a month.

417
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,423
You say you are going for an offsite shoot,

418
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:39,099
and end up getting photographed in a club,

419
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:41,490
or a man answers the calls in the middle of the night.

420
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,534
I said the staff was just playing around.

421
00:32:43,534 --> 00:32:47,276
How would I know if it's a staff member or someone else?

422
00:32:50,088 --> 00:32:52,014
Get lost!

423
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:56,513
- What? 
 - I said get lost.

424
00:32:59,384 --> 00:33:01,089
Why?

425
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:03,049
You can't leave because you feel wronged?

426
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:07,283
Because you got stabbed in the back, you can't leave because you're upset and angry, you jerk!

427
00:33:07,283 --> 00:33:11,019
- Hey, Jeong Hui Yeong! 
 - Get out of here right now!

428
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,295
Patient, please calm down.

429
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:21,922
We need to reconnect the line. I'll bring the IV line.

430
00:33:23,888 --> 00:33:27,833
We're going to dress the wound. Will you stay here?

431
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,731
What are you doing?

432
00:33:55,222 --> 00:33:56,874
If there's necrosis in the wound…

433
00:33:56,874 --> 00:33:58,683
Then what?

434
00:34:00,515 --> 00:34:03,024
It's all the same anyway.

435
00:34:03,024 --> 00:34:06,423
I can't get my face back to what it was.

436
00:34:06,423 --> 00:34:07,551
Go ahead with the dressing.

437
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:10,476
What's the use of that, anyway?

438
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,085
Losing dreams,

439
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:18,152
losing a lover,

440
00:34:19,406 --> 00:34:22,222
and now being called an adulteress.

441
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:27,498
Everyone curses me, saying I deserve it.

442
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:31,963
What's the point of dressing the wound?

443
00:34:31,963 --> 00:34:33,686
First, get the treatment you can—

444
00:34:33,686 --> 00:34:37,505
I don't need it. I don't need any of this crap!

445
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:44,159
Doing that won't change anything.

446
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:50,868
Have you forgotten?

447
00:34:50,868 --> 00:34:54,799
As a victim, she might be mentally unstable.

448
00:34:56,563 --> 00:34:59,609
Considering the victim's emotional state, could you please speak more kindly—

449
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:00,978
Have you forgotten?

450
00:35:00,978 --> 00:35:03,362
This is a cosmetic surgery clinic.

451
00:35:03,362 --> 00:35:06,115
If you want to provide emotional care for the patient,

452
00:35:06,115 --> 00:35:08,978
then transfer them to another hospital.

453
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,595
I thought he deeply cared for the victims, but why is he acting like this again?

454
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:21,297
Right, I thought it was too good to be true.

455
00:35:21,297 --> 00:35:25,259
I've been feeling uneasy ever since he became a dedicated doctor for victims.

456
00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:27,302
Why?

457
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:31,182
He didn't want to pour his emotions into patients who were on the brink of death.

458
00:35:31,182 --> 00:35:33,434
That's why he switched to plastic surgery.

459
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:38,475
But I fully anticipated this kind of discord today.

460
00:35:52,829 --> 00:35:56,332
What? Is that for real?

461
00:35:56,332 --> 00:36:01,087
So, you're saying you took on the defense of the acid attack perpetrator?

462
00:36:01,087 --> 00:36:02,672
How did it happen?

463
00:36:02,672 --> 00:36:05,119
Well, it's just something the company asked me to do.

464
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,287
Wow! It's a very small world, indeed.

465
00:36:09,287 --> 00:36:12,539
So? What happens with this?

466
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:14,851
- Is this a noncustodial case? 
 - Enough.

467
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:16,906
What about Jeong Woo? Is he okay

468
00:36:16,906 --> 00:36:19,897
after the victim's reconstructive surgery?

469
00:36:19,897 --> 00:36:22,147
Could he possibly be okay?

470
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:25,845
This was supposed to be the last one, but it all blew up at the end.

471
00:36:25,845 --> 00:36:30,714
He's probably busy using his blades right now.

472
00:36:56,763 --> 00:37:00,518
 Please help. My girlfriend is home alone, but— 

473
00:37:03,443 --> 00:37:05,690
 Oppa, 

474
00:37:06,945 --> 00:37:08,980
 I'm sorry. 

475
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,530
 I should have told you earlier. 

476
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:37,189
Depression, delusional disorder.

477
00:37:37,189 --> 00:37:40,502
First-time offender with diminished capacity.

478
00:37:40,502 --> 00:37:43,677
And an unhappy family history, too.

479
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:48,605
Besides, the lawyer's not a public defender, but from the specialized criminal firm Good-n-Good.

480
00:37:49,975 --> 00:37:51,784
You can tell at a glance it's a noncustodial case, can't you?

481
00:37:51,784 --> 00:37:54,146
The change in attitude is quite dramatic.

482
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:57,348
From a random criminal to a wounded wife.

483
00:37:57,348 --> 00:38:00,652
I have a feeling she's leading us in the direction she wants us to go.

484
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:02,696
Could she have been coached by a lawyer?

485
00:38:02,696 --> 00:38:05,567
The husband story came up at the right timing, too,

486
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:07,601
even when we didn't specifically ask about him.

487
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:12,289
Actively revealing the motive for the crime means

488
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,498
that the undisclosed,

489
00:38:14,498 --> 00:38:19,232
real motive is being hidden?

490
00:38:21,192 --> 00:38:26,837
Then, what could the real hidden motive be?

491
00:38:28,362 --> 00:38:31,273
What could it be, to go to such lengths…

492
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:33,905
Last year,

493
00:38:33,905 --> 00:38:37,422
there was a case with a woman in her twenties as the victim of an acid attack.

494
00:38:37,422 --> 00:38:38,674
Yes.

495
00:38:38,674 --> 00:38:40,720
Because of a complaint,

496
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,220
a resident threw acid at a district office worker.

497
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,347
Look up a photo of the victim of that case.

498
00:38:45,347 --> 00:38:47,140
Why bring up that case all of a sudden?

499
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,101
We need to find

500
00:38:49,101 --> 00:38:51,019
the real motive, don't we?

501
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:55,507
 The pre-trial detention warrant for the suspect in the acid attack on a model 

502
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:58,610
 has been rejected. 
     

503
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:02,447
 After interrogation, the judge decided that, since the suspect has a fixed residence, 

504
00:39:02,447 --> 00:39:07,885
 it would be difficult for her to be a flight risk, and therefore rejected the detention warrant. 

505
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:11,780
Miss Sin Jeong Sook, please come out.

506
00:39:26,091 --> 00:39:27,850
Let's go.

507
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:39,602
You're not being detained, are you?

508
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,154
It's not over yet.

509
00:39:42,154 --> 00:39:44,469
There's still the prosecutor's investigation, indictment, and trial.

510
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:45,741
I'm sorry.

511
00:39:45,741 --> 00:39:47,371
That's something you should say to the victim,

512
00:39:47,371 --> 00:39:50,093
after ruining her model face like this.

513
00:39:50,093 --> 00:39:52,873
What are you going to do with this?

514
00:39:52,873 --> 00:39:54,750
Is this woman the victim?

515
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,054
Please refrain from any speech or behavior that might provoke our client.

516
00:39:58,054 --> 00:40:01,030
- Do not respond. 
 - Yes.

517
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:07,032
Yes, team leader. The victim?

518
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:10,782
She is still at KSH Cosmetic Surgery.

519
00:40:10,782 --> 00:40:13,535
Yes, I will check it out.

520
00:40:18,853 --> 00:40:21,674
- Please get in. 
 - No, I'm fine.

521
00:40:21,674 --> 00:40:23,755
I have some places to go.

522
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,337
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

523
00:40:25,337 --> 00:40:28,579
Anyway, do not do anything until the trial and stay quiet.

524
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:31,253
Especially near the victim, you can't approach her at all.

525
00:40:31,253 --> 00:40:35,223
- Yes. Bye. 
 - Go ahead.

526
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,110
Yes.

527
00:41:14,175 --> 00:41:15,738
Yes, she arrived home now.

528
00:41:15,738 --> 00:41:17,680
 Stay put. She is going to move. 

529
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,773
Yes, understood.

530
00:41:25,477 --> 00:41:29,205
- Director, I'm going home. 
 - You've worked hard.

531
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:28,998
   

532
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,434
What is it?

533
00:43:28,434 --> 00:43:31,603
Didn't you hear we got investigative cooperation from the hospital?

534
00:43:31,603 --> 00:43:34,085
We are currently tracking the suspect.

535
00:43:34,085 --> 00:43:36,247
The suspect?

536
00:43:37,121 --> 00:43:39,486
After the pre-trial arrest warrant was rejected,

537
00:43:39,486 --> 00:43:43,023
I checked in advance that the suspect was coming toward the hospital.

538
00:43:44,996 --> 00:43:49,075
Jeong Hui Yeong is safe, so do not worry.

539
00:43:50,702 --> 00:43:52,356
But still, to put the victim in the same space…

540
00:43:52,356 --> 00:43:55,694
You're worried about Jeong Hui Yeong, right?

541
00:43:55,694 --> 00:43:56,995
Yes,

542
00:43:56,995 --> 00:44:01,833
I am quite concerned. Thanks to an obstinate detective.

543
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:05,371
I am not that obstinate.

544
00:44:05,371 --> 00:44:08,707
I've been watching everything.

545
00:44:08,707 --> 00:44:11,082
You see the gun over there?

546
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:16,898
Don't make any more ruckus at the hospital.

547
00:44:17,745 --> 00:44:19,890
Please leave in a bit.

548
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,679
For now, anticipate Hyunnam-dong and follow.

549
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,443
Hyunnam-dong?

550
00:44:48,443 --> 00:44:51,502
- Keep an eye on the front. 
 - Got it!

551
00:45:12,186 --> 00:45:14,610
The investigation will be over soon and will be resolved well,

552
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,740
so do not worry.

553
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:31,525
Are you doing well?

554
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:37,736
How is it?

555
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:39,702
   

556
00:46:39,702 --> 00:46:42,202
Is it comfortable there?

557
00:47:08,449 --> 00:47:11,589
   

558
00:47:25,762 --> 00:47:28,939
She really is entering Hyunnam-dong.

559
00:47:28,939 --> 00:47:31,432
Could it be this case…

560
00:47:38,654 --> 00:47:40,354
Where did Jeong Hui Yeong go?

561
00:47:40,354 --> 00:47:41,900
What?

562
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,417
Huh?

563
00:49:32,184 --> 00:49:34,910
   

564
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:49,910



565
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,617
 Dr. Cha Jeong Woo did? 

566
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:57,174
 Was there another unfortunate incident with Jeong Woo at the hospital? 

567
00:49:57,174 --> 00:49:58,909
 The terrible thing you did, 

568
00:49:58,909 --> 00:50:00,782
 I'll make sure you receive proper punishment. 

569
00:50:00,782 --> 00:50:05,502
 You are as beautiful as Jeong Hui Yeong, Ma'am. 

570
00:50:07,912 --> 00:50:09,721
 Do you have anyone in mind? 

571
00:50:09,721 --> 00:50:11,210
 I don't know. 

572
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:12,756
 But it feels somehow familiar. 

573
00:50:12,756 --> 00:50:14,928
 Lee Min Hyeong! 

574
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,495
 It's been a long time. 

575
00:50:16,495 --> 00:50:18,582
 But if the two really are the same person, 

576
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:20,607
 and if it's someone who holds a grudge against Mr. Cha Jeong Woo, 

577
00:50:20,607 --> 00:50:23,285
 he might appear around him again. 

578
00:50:24,916 --> 00:50:26,834
 Who are you? 

579
00:50:28,043 --> 00:50:32,171
 Director Cha, too, is a crime victim. 

580
00:50:32,171 --> 00:50:36,479
♫  I want you back  ♫
