Where did Jung Hee Young go?

8
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:49,751
What?

9
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:52,051
Huh?

10
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:51,018
Is this all you've been doing?

11
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,284
I'm already dead anyway.

12
00:02:55,818 --> 00:03:01,118
I already died in that park!

13
00:03:01,118 --> 00:03:02,651
What's the point of living like this?

14
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:04,998
My life is completely ruined!

15
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:07,784
So, if you die,

16
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:10,395
what will that solve?

17
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:23,618
If you die and disappear,

18
00:03:23,618 --> 00:03:26,205
it means nothing.

19
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:31,025
You are alive, Jung Hee Young.

20
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:36,582
You're not dead.

<i>[Green / Shin Jeong Sook]</i>

22
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:44,518
What is it, did you receive a spirit?

23
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:49,584
Even now, and the fact that Shin Jeong Sook
would go to KSH Cosmetic Surgery.

24
00:04:52,784 --> 00:04:54,618
I asked you to find photos

25
00:04:54,618 --> 00:04:58,851
of the acid attack on the district office
employee two years ago, right?

26
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:00,584
I am indebted to that person.

27
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:03,184
<i>After ruining her model's face like this.</i>

28
00:05:03,184 --> 00:05:04,451
<i>What are you going to do about it?</i>

29
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:07,384
She was flustered when she saw
the photos of other acid attack victims.

30
00:05:07,384 --> 00:05:09,851
Is this woman the victim?

31
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,718
Perhaps Shin Jeong Sook
didn't know Jung Hee Young well.

32
00:05:12,718 --> 00:05:18,130
So she must have needed to confirm
if she did her job properly.

33
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,251
Madam, it's me.

34
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:22,184
Could you please open the door?

35
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:24,218
She must have thought she needed to prove it

36
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:27,851
to the person who ordered her to do that.

37
00:05:31,883 --> 00:05:33,818
You are impressive as always.

38
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:36,362
Yes, I know.

39
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:53,285
Because it seemed different from
the victim's photo shown at the police station,

40
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:56,185
you went to the hospital yourself?

41
00:05:57,017 --> 00:06:00,051
I was worried I made a mistake…

42
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:02,251
Anyway, you are naive.

43
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:05,384
The articles are all over…

44
00:06:06,677 --> 00:06:09,484
Anyway, well done.

45
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:13,718
But did you have to come at such a late hour?

46
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:16,542
You could have come later.

47
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:19,884
I'm sorry.

48
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:22,818
I was in such a hurry for money.

49
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:25,531
Have you already spent the advance
you received?

50
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:28,000
In just a week?

51
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,518
Oh, Madam Shin.

52
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:40,084
I didn't know you were interested
in that sort of thing.

53
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:44,644
Indeed.

54
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:47,084
That would make you desperate for money.

55
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:50,864
The smell of leather is so nice.

56
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:53,384
That's right.

57
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:56,415
It doesn't seem to suit you.

58
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,862
The remaining payment is one thousand.

59
00:06:58,862 --> 00:07:02,120
With this, the payment is all settled.

60
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:16,569
Aren't you leaving?

61
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:22,975
What are you doing, ma'am?

62
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:26,144
Please leave now.

63
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:37,925
Ma'am.

64
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,064
Ah… ma'am!

65
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:06,484
What are you doing?

66
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:10,351
I pretended to be crazy
and splashed hydrochloric acid once,

67
00:08:10,351 --> 00:08:12,918
and it stripped away the fear.

68
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:18,158
It's thrilling, isn't it?

69
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:23,125
The fact that you can ruin
someone's life with just a wrist.

70
00:08:27,185 --> 00:08:30,812
Don't look at people that way.

71
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:33,025
It's not like I am a bug.

72
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:35,254
So annoying.

73
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:43,171
Ma'am!

74
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:46,684
No, Madam Shin,

75
00:08:46,684 --> 00:08:48,718
you must have had a tough time
yesterday and today.

76
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:51,651
First, go home and rest.

77
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:55,551
How could I possibly sleep comfortably?

78
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,051
Look

79
00:08:57,051 --> 00:09:00,918
what we did to that Jung Hee Young.

80
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:08,208
Us, you say?

81
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:13,184
That's right, us…

82
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:17,118
Jung Hee Young had an affair with my husband.

83
00:09:17,118 --> 00:09:19,784
And, just to take revenge,

84
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:21,664
I just had to pretend to be crazy later on.

85
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:23,451
Then, I got a lawyer,

86
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:25,784
Somehow, claiming mental
and physical weakness got me out.

87
00:09:25,784 --> 00:09:30,869
Yes, right here, your
voice is all recorded, you see?

88
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:36,074
How could you do this!

89
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,838
Madam.

90
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:49,323
The madam is as beautiful as Jung Hee Young.

91
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,524
Huh?

92
00:09:56,571 --> 00:10:00,410
Compensation for the mental harm from my guilt.

93
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,695
Please do that for me a bit longer.

94
00:10:15,718 --> 00:10:18,751
Sir, that black box,

95
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,618
could you just…

96
00:10:32,618 --> 00:10:34,084
Seo Yoon Ha.

97
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:39,418
Wife of Kim Ji Hyuk,
president of JH Model Agency.

98
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:43,785
Ms. Jung Hee Young was a model
under that agency until last year.

99
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:48,613
The fact of giving a large sum of cash

100
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:52,118
to the person who splashed hydrochloric acid

101
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:56,141
means there was some sort of transaction
between Seo Yoon Ha and Shin Jeong Sook.

102
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:58,242
On social media and personal broadcasts,

103
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:01,641
the reason Jung Hee Young appeared
at that modeling agency last year

104
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:04,696
is rumored to be because of a scandal
with the agency's president.

105
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:05,756
So, due to that kind of relationship

106
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:08,635
between Jung Hee Young and Kim Ji Hyuk,

107
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:11,747
Seo Yoon Ha, the wife, harbors ill feelings
and just asked Shin Jeong Sook--

108
00:11:11,747 --> 00:11:13,960
I should stitch those lips.

109
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,646
Who told you to investigate based on rumors?

110
00:11:15,646 --> 00:11:18,444
It's a matter that can cause
secondary harm to the victim.

111
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:22,997
Moreover, Kim Ji Hyuk is currently incarcerated
due to a sexual harassment case last year.

112
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:24,545
Be careful with your words.

113
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:26,456
I apologize.

114
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:29,625
But securing evidence is the key.

115
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,791
If they brush it off,
as if that cash is a bonus

116
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,993
given to the housekeeper,
there's nothing we can do.

117
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,868
That woman must be hiding something.

118
00:11:35,868 --> 00:11:40,859
Looking at the card statements,
her spending is not minimal.

119
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:43,884
Perhaps she stashed something away
in anticipation of running low on money?

120
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:47,918
We can't even search and seize it,
since it's still a vague conjecture.

121
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:50,484
Seeing her coming out with money tonight,

122
00:11:50,484 --> 00:11:53,712
it seems she has an urgent need for it.

123
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:58,467
Start by looking into her recent movements.

124
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,101
There must be something to dig into.

125
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:02,267
Yes.

126
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:05,511
Yes, hello?

127
00:12:06,878 --> 00:12:09,011
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo?

128
00:12:10,232 --> 00:12:13,365
Is Jung Hee Young okay?

129
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:44,621
Attention!

130
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:46,688
Attention.

131
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:50,260
Ah… he let it slide again.

132
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,255
I did not.

133
00:12:51,255 --> 00:12:52,721
Are you kidding?

134
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,755
With your skills, you could
have easily avoided this.

135
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:58,455
Sometimes it seems like you
parry just to get stabbed.

136
00:12:58,455 --> 00:13:01,188
- Want a drink?
- Next time.

137
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:03,899
Then, we'll go ahead.

138
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:46,247
<i>You worked hard today, too.</i>

139
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:41,055
I told you to stop drinking.

140
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:44,034
And why don't you answer the phone?

141
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:46,134
Yeah, here.

142
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:54,888
Oh, dear!

143
00:14:54,888 --> 00:14:57,421
<i>[Detective Lee Min Hyeong]</i>

144
00:15:00,955 --> 00:15:05,270
Yes, here is the customer's phone.

145
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:16,388
Alright, you did a great job today,
so consider this a reward.

146
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:29,188
<i>[Park Chae Kyung]</i>

147
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:39,408
Why are you so anxious?
Like a puppy that needs to poop.

148
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:42,867
The detective gave him a lift herself.

149
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:46,888
Was there another unfortunate incident
with Jeong Woo at the hospital?

150
00:15:46,888 --> 00:15:48,288
Maybe?

151
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:51,121
What else happened besides yesterday's event?

152
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:53,455
It's been particularly bad these past few days.

153
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:57,021
Then why didn't you stay a bit with him?
Why bother so much about a silly blind date?

154
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:58,821
S-Silly?

155
00:15:58,821 --> 00:15:59,988
Excuse me!

156
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:01,555
I'm trying to communicate
with these various people.

157
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:05,755
One shouldn't belittle this
open-mindedness, especially a lawyer.

158
00:16:06,421 --> 00:16:07,755
Right.

159
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:09,655
You've been devoted to just one guy
since school days. What would you know

160
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:12,321
about my feelings?

161
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:15,988
- Darn, just like that!
- Here it is, right on time! Jeong Woo's car.

162
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:25,121
Oh, my! Sorry for the trouble.

163
00:16:25,121 --> 00:16:27,921
Catching criminals by day,
running as a substitute driver by night.

164
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,321
How did you end up
driving Director Cha's car, too?

165
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:31,621
Did you two drink together?

166
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:33,055
Of course not.

167
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:34,621
I called him because of work, by coincidence.

168
00:16:34,621 --> 00:16:37,762
- Hurry and take care of him for me.
- Okay.

169
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,288
Jeong Woo, how much did you drink?

170
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:44,506
Jeong Woo, come to your senses. Jeong Woo!

171
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:51,952
Be careful.

172
00:16:51,952 --> 00:16:55,821
Come here.

173
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:58,355
We meet again like this.

174
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:00,356
The three of you are friends, I see.

175
00:17:00,356 --> 00:17:03,344
Yes, take care.

176
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:08,021
Ah.

177
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:09,588
Taking care of crime victims,

178
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:10,755
Jeong Woo…

179
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:15,155
I mean, Director Cha will have
to do it for how long?

180
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:18,421
That's not something I can confirm…

181
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:20,855
Why did you ask?

182
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:25,210
It seems there were some issues
with a victim under treatment.

183
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:27,645
It's not that there were problems,

184
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:29,745
but rather that the existing
problems were resolved, no?

185
00:17:29,745 --> 00:17:31,355
Whatever the case,

186
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:35,421
dealing with crime victims
won't be easy for Director Cha.

187
00:17:38,548 --> 00:17:41,114
Director Cha, too,

188
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:45,088
was a crime victim, you know.

189
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:49,455
He lost his fiancé

190
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:53,621
to a criminal case, seven years ago.

191
00:17:54,921 --> 00:17:57,488
Meeting with crime victims

192
00:17:57,488 --> 00:18:03,715
must be constantly stirring up
wounds when he thought it was okay.

193
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,921
Isn't it about time to forget now?

194
00:18:44,158 --> 00:18:45,966
- Why?
- In Shin Jeong Sook recent activities,

195
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:48,155
we found something unusual.

196
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:51,006
Unusual? Like what?

197
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,121
She frequently visited the hospital.

198
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:54,367
A plastic surgery clinic.

199
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,415
We found reservation records, too.

200
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:58,515
Really?

201
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:12,470
You want your eyes done like this?

202
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:17,703
Yes, I would like to have
slightly thicker double eyelids.

203
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:20,328
You don't have drooping eyelids,

204
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:24,122
and it seems like you don't have any
discomfort in terms of shape or function.

205
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:27,834
Also, such a flamboyant outline
is not in trend these days either.

206
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,068
Well, I don't really know
about trends or anything.

207
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,772
Can't you just do it like this for me?

208
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:39,021
What is the reason you want the surgery?

209
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:40,788
No, I…

210
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:45,216
Do I have to explain even that
to get plastic surgery?

211
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,862
I… it's my first time
coming to a place like this.

212
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:55,528
I need to know what kind of problem you want
to improve, whether it's function or form,

213
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:59,264
so I can proceed with the
surgery more effectively.

214
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:05,241
Well, just…

215
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:09,274
I just need to look like this person.

216
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:14,928
The wife's lover.

217
00:20:14,928 --> 00:20:16,795
From the husband's point of view,

218
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:19,233
by having surgery to look like
the lover his wife fell in love with,

219
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:22,309
doesn't it mean he wants to win back his wife?

220
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:25,876
A little while ago, I heard it also happened
at the hospital where my friend works.

221
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:29,428
A woman showed a picture of his
mistress and asked to be made similar.

222
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:33,495
Can you really bring back someone
who has left by doing that?

223
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:35,128
Of course not!

224
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:37,328
You can't bring it back.

225
00:20:38,262 --> 00:20:41,895
If you could capture a departed
heart by changing the face,

226
00:20:41,895 --> 00:20:45,328
I would have had that plastic
surgery hundreds of times.

227
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,578
I wonder who?

228
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,362
Who would you have wanted to catch so badly?

229
00:20:48,362 --> 00:20:51,562
Did you have such a pure-hearted
love, Director Han?

230
00:20:51,562 --> 00:20:53,528
First love?

231
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:55,228
What?

232
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:58,395
Why are you all so serious
about other people's love affairs?

233
00:20:58,395 --> 00:21:01,662
Anyway, this plastic surgery clinic
never has a calm day.

234
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:04,228
And come to think of it, that patient
Jung Hee Young, the one with the affair…

235
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:05,422
Hey!

236
00:21:05,422 --> 00:21:08,955
That's not a confirmed fact yet.

237
00:21:09,808 --> 00:21:12,208
Please let me know when the facts come out.

238
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:17,295
Are you planning to just leave again today?

239
00:21:17,295 --> 00:21:19,062
Perhaps, do you have

240
00:21:19,062 --> 00:21:21,570
<i>[Officer Lee Min Hyeong]</i>
any connection to the patient?

241
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,428
Seeing that you came here twice, it seems

242
00:21:23,428 --> 00:21:26,421
like you have something
you must want to talk about.

243
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:36,099
She is a friend of our daughter.

244
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:39,428
But for what…

245
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:42,295
Do you know Kim Ji Hyuk by any chance?

246
00:21:42,295 --> 00:21:44,895
The representative of JH Model Agency.

247
00:21:46,065 --> 00:21:49,763
Yes, what about that person?

248
00:21:49,763 --> 00:21:51,822
It's just my own thought but,

249
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:53,563
perhaps this

250
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:56,208
might be related to Kim Ji Hyuk.

251
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,875
Why do you think so?

252
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,388
Our daughter too,

253
00:22:00,388 --> 00:22:04,188
was a model affiliated
in that person's company.

254
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:21,115
The person who splashed
me with hydrochloric acid

255
00:22:22,088 --> 00:22:25,721
is the woman who works at Kim Ji Hyuk's house?

256
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:30,221
She's been working as a
housekeeper for quite a long time.

257
00:22:30,988 --> 00:22:32,802
Last night…

258
00:22:32,802 --> 00:22:35,035
The place the suspect visited
after leaving this hospital as well,

259
00:22:35,035 --> 00:22:37,902
was the house of president Kim Ji Hyuk.

260
00:22:38,635 --> 00:22:42,868
That person… is in prison now.

261
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:53,568
Due to the sexual harassment case
involving Kim Ji Hyuk, last year,

262
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:56,341
the model who committed suicide

263
00:22:56,341 --> 00:23:00,107
was very close to you.

264
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:04,902
She is related to that
case too, right? You too…

265
00:23:04,902 --> 00:23:06,968
Enough.

266
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:11,708
Please leave now.

267
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,708
I want you to tell us everything now.

268
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,168
We'll catch the real criminal.

269
00:23:18,168 --> 00:23:20,294
But that's not the real end, is it?

270
00:23:20,294 --> 00:23:23,261
Both you and your friend

271
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:27,806
shouldn't be misunderstood anymore, right?

272
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:35,409
<i>[Model affiliated with JH Model
Agency found dead at home]</i>

273
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:39,435
Excluding the deposit of 300,000 won,

274
00:23:39,435 --> 00:23:43,067
you need to pay the surgery
fee of 7.5 million won.

275
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:49,002
Huh? I've seen that before?

276
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:50,435
Yeah, that's right.

277
00:23:50,435 --> 00:23:52,935
Even the bundles tied with
new bill bands in the envelope.

278
00:23:52,935 --> 00:23:55,768
Look at this, this, it's correct, isn't it?

279
00:23:58,435 --> 00:23:59,940
You received it from Seo Yoon Ha, right?

280
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,102
Yes.

281
00:24:02,102 --> 00:24:05,168
The madam gave it to me, just like a bonus.

282
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:08,346
You didn't receive it after
showing photos of the victim?

283
00:24:10,668 --> 00:24:14,035
That… Going to the hospital yesterday was…

284
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,735
To apologize to the victim for feeling sorry.

285
00:24:16,735 --> 00:24:19,335
First, let's go to the station together.

286
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:21,735
I request your voluntary accompaniment
regarding the supplementary investigation.

287
00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:23,802
Ah, no way.

288
00:24:23,802 --> 00:24:25,568
I-I-I can't go.

289
00:24:25,568 --> 00:24:28,002
I must have the surgery no matter what.

290
00:24:28,002 --> 00:24:30,268
After the surgery, you'll
see how much I've changed.

291
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,335
I mean, to show off to that person.

292
00:24:32,335 --> 00:24:35,574
So you must cooperate
even more with the investigation.

293
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:39,902
That way, you can get the
surgery as soon as possible.

294
00:24:39,902 --> 00:24:42,635
No, the date is…

295
00:24:44,102 --> 00:24:46,735
If you resolve it quickly and let us know,

296
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:50,202
we'll make arrangements for you
to have the surgery immediately.

297
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:51,914
Yes.

298
00:24:51,914 --> 00:24:54,214
Money…

299
00:25:31,502 --> 00:25:34,002
Ms. Seo Yoon Ha, you are under

300
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:39,490
emergency arrest on charges of instigating
special bodily harm against Jung Hee Young.

301
00:25:41,202 --> 00:25:44,135
Shin Jeong Sook has spilled everything.

302
00:25:44,135 --> 00:25:48,002
That crazy witch is really…

303
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:51,302
Over there… right here.

304
00:25:51,302 --> 00:25:56,335
The deal with the madam has all been recorded.

305
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:58,935
Uh… And this.

306
00:25:58,935 --> 00:26:02,002
It's a letter sent to the madam

307
00:26:02,002 --> 00:26:04,135
from her husband in prison.

308
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:06,902
It has the whole crime plan written down.

309
00:26:06,902 --> 00:26:12,423
If I cooperate with the investigation,
I can get the surgery, right?

310
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:17,524
Right?

311
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:27,205
Jung Hee Young, that girl,

312
00:26:27,205 --> 00:26:31,738
do you know how shameless
and audacious that woman is?

313
00:26:31,738 --> 00:26:35,738
When a man does big things in
society, he can make mistakes.

314
00:26:35,738 --> 00:26:38,738
But to report it so quickly?

315
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,038
After all we've done to support her.

316
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:45,705
The fact that Mr. Kim Ji Hyuk sexually
harassed Ms. Jung Hee Young,

317
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:48,405
do you admit it?

318
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:51,005
What are you talking about?

319
00:26:52,205 --> 00:26:54,272
That's what Jung Hee Young said?

320
00:26:54,272 --> 00:26:56,605
She's a victim too?

321
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:59,805
No, it's not her!

322
00:26:59,805 --> 00:27:02,572
She reported it even
though she wasn't a victim!

323
00:27:02,572 --> 00:27:06,172
My husband is also exploding
with anger in prison--

324
00:27:11,472 --> 00:27:14,172
So, because Ms. Jung Hee Young
is a whistleblower,

325
00:27:14,172 --> 00:27:16,472
you're saying she committed the crime?

326
00:27:16,472 --> 00:27:20,638
And you planned the crime in
advance with Mr. Kim Ji Hyuk?

327
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,238
You might as well just keep your mouth shut.

328
00:27:23,238 --> 00:27:27,505
Thank you for detailing everything
from the motive to the process of the crime.

329
00:27:28,372 --> 00:27:30,964
It's being recorded well, isn't it?

330
00:27:33,705 --> 00:27:35,972
Ms. Seo Yoon Ha,

331
00:27:35,972 --> 00:27:39,172
this time, you won't be able to get out.

332
00:27:39,172 --> 00:27:44,230
You will receive a fitting
punishment for what you've done

It's Kim Ji Hyuk!

335
00:28:01,238 --> 00:28:02,638
Don't you have anything to say to the victim?

336
00:28:02,638 --> 00:28:03,772
Is there another accomplice?

Gosh, what a scandal.

354
00:29:44,272 --> 00:29:46,638

meddling in others' affairs.

Manager Yang, could you please look at this?

358
00:29:54,505 --> 00:29:57,405
What is it? Why?

359
00:29:57,405 --> 00:30:00,005
Have you seen the news?

360
00:30:00,005 --> 00:30:01,138
What news?

361
00:30:01,138 --> 00:30:03,038
About patient Jung Hee Young.

362
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,638
They say she is a whistleblower.
A whistleblower.

363
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,430
Pardon?

364
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,272
Oh, dear.

365
00:30:10,272 --> 00:30:11,634
Spreading rumors without
even verifying the facts.

366
00:30:11,634 --> 00:30:14,405
Who goes around blabbering
them as if they are true?

367
00:30:14,405 --> 00:30:16,205
Do you know who it is?

368
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:18,305
Oh, my.

369
00:30:18,865 --> 00:30:21,698
Just really bad people.

370
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,418
Director Cha,

371
00:30:32,103 --> 00:30:35,159
what kind of surgery are you preparing
that is making you seem so serious?

372
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:37,905
Mind your own business, it's not your patient.

373
00:30:37,905 --> 00:30:40,965
Right, just take care of your own patients.

374
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:44,692
Why bother caring about
someone else's patient, right?

375
00:30:44,692 --> 00:30:48,259
Pay some attention to your patients.

376
00:30:49,052 --> 00:30:52,185
Still, as a doctor specializing in victims,
you should know at least this much.

380
00:31:03,345 --> 00:31:05,828
right?

381
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:12,797
It's Jung Hee Young.

382
00:31:14,518 --> 00:31:17,141
He was paying attention.

383
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:32,207
Are you going to the police station?

384
00:31:36,258 --> 00:31:39,984
They say the person who ordered the crime
is in the police station near here.

385
00:31:39,984 --> 00:31:43,517
Are you going to chase after them
and stab them with that?

386
00:31:44,425 --> 00:31:45,891
Don't worry about it.

387
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:48,858
Even if you stabbed them with that,
you probably couldn't kill them.

388

That's a ring forceps for
holding gauze during dressing.

389
00:31:54,337 --> 00:31:58,558
Instead of wasting your time on nonsense,
get a consultation for your scars.

390
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:01,825
Will that make this go away?

391
00:32:01,825 --> 00:32:04,271
Of course,

392
00:32:04,271 --> 00:32:06,964
we can't get rid of it completely.

393
00:32:06,964 --> 00:32:09,517
Even if it's covered with a graft.

394
00:32:09,517 --> 00:32:11,325
A graft?

395
00:32:11,325 --> 00:32:13,658
A skin graft.

396
00:32:14,258 --> 00:32:16,600
That's what I came to talk about.

Ah, I talked a lot to Reporter Kim about it.

417
00:33:49,058 --> 00:33:51,258
Why hasn't this been turned into an article?

She's the final candidate

419
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,925
It seems like it would be quite an issue.

420
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:58,291
It's too early, the surgery is today.

421
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:00,691
We should at least have an interview
with the patient after the surgery

422
00:34:00,691 --> 00:34:03,625
for it to be meaningful, don't you think?

423
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,591
Ah…

424
00:34:05,591 --> 00:34:09,325
Then, to make sure we can nail down
the before-and-after photo materials,

425
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:13,758
get the pictures or interview
before the surgery, understood?

426
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:17,825
Why?

427
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:22,311
Director Cha isn't performing
the surgery for that reason, is he?

428
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:25,191
What is this? Am I doing this
just for my own benefit?

429
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:28,525
I also want to quickly clear
the disgrace concerning Director Cha.

430
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:29,925
I know.

431
00:34:29,925 --> 00:34:32,191
But you don't have to worry about that.

432
00:34:32,191 --> 00:34:34,791
Because sincerity has a way of getting through.

433
00:34:35,858 --> 00:34:37,425
What do you mean by sincerity?

434
00:34:37,425 --> 00:34:40,258
I'm talking about compassion for the patient.

435
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:43,816
Whether in the emergency room before,

436
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:45,825
or here at the plastic surgery clinic,

437
00:34:45,825 --> 00:34:49,305
it seems Director Cha's sincerity towards
patients remains unchanged, doesn't it?

No matter how much we solve

453
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:35,358
the police can't directly
help the victims recover.

454
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:38,858
But when a dedicated doctor steps in
to assist in the recovery…

455

I'm just doing what we do in plastic surgery.

457

Not only are there scars on the face,

458
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:50,225
but wouldn't it have contributed to the
healing of Jung Hee Young's heart too?

459
00:36:50,225 --> 00:36:53,925
While treating external wounds,
it also helps heal the internal wounds.

460
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:57,458
That's why they call plastic surgery
"psychosurgery", right?

461
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,591

<i>[Seoul Southern Police Station]</i>

468
00:37:44,191 --> 00:37:45,958

They say Jung Hee Young
will be discharged tomorrow.

That Dr. Cha Jeong Woo.

473
00:37:55,425 --> 00:37:58,791
I hear that when Ms. Jung Hee Young
went up to the rooftop,

474
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:01,491
he had left work, but then, suddenly
turned his car around to come back.

475
00:38:01,491 --> 00:38:04,658
It's like he knew Ms. Jung Hee Young's
situation perfectly,

476
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:09,225
He must have empathized with
the victim's feeling of emptiness.

477
00:38:09,225 --> 00:38:10,595
Emptiness?

478
00:38:10,595 --> 00:38:14,225
The police investigate to solve cases.

479
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,325
When you see it directly from the side,

480
00:38:17,325 --> 00:38:21,691
it can feel futile from
the victim's perspective.

481
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:24,625
What's going to change by doing that?

482
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:28,325
You can't turn it back
to before the crime, anyway.

483
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:34,825
But how would Doctor Cha Jeong Woo
know that feeling?

484
00:38:34,825 --> 00:38:37,158

in Yeoksam-dong coming along?

489
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:52,091
I said I'd look into it.

490
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:53,391
That's right.

491
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:57,491
That too needs to be checked quickly
as cases pour in like a flood.

492
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:59,991
On your way home, take a
look around the theft location.

But if the two really are the same person,

496
00:39:08,525 --> 00:39:11,225
and if there's someone who really
bears a grudge against Mr. Cha Jeong Woo,

497
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:13,958
they might appear around him again.

498
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:16,021
That's worrying.

499
00:39:16,825 --> 00:39:18,725
If they're not the same person,

500
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:21,225

00:39:21,758 --> 00:39:23,678

possibly have a consultation for surgery?

00:40:10,405 --> 00:40:13,525
Hmm… What kind of surgery are you considering?

507
00:40:16,971 --> 00:40:20,884
I'm not sure if it's possible.

00:41:04,658 --> 00:41:06,997
Please give the local anesthesia.

514
00:41:11,191 --> 00:41:13,291

515
00:41:38,758 --> 00:41:40,958
Number 15.

516
00:41:58,991 --> 00:42:02,158
You want to remove the double eyelids?

517
00:42:02,158 --> 00:42:04,391
Yes, I want to have monolids.

518
00:42:04,391 --> 00:42:06,358
Is that kind of operation not possible?

519
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:09,658
By making an incision
right above the eyelashes,

520
00:42:09,658 --> 00:42:12,825
some people do get it removed, occasionally.

521
00:42:12,825 --> 00:42:15,458
But, depending on the height
or thickness of the double eyelid,

522
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:19,291
the possibility and method of surgery may vary.

523
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:22,058
So, it might not be possible?

524
00:42:22,058 --> 00:42:25,291
You would have to consult
with the director to know for sure.

525
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:28,058
Do you have a particular eye shape in mind?

526
00:42:28,058 --> 00:42:30,258
Something like a sample photo.

527
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:32,691
You can show it to me.

528
00:42:32,691 --> 00:42:36,653
Yes, here it is.

529
00:42:37,991 --> 00:42:41,458
Oh?! This person…

530
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,125
The surgery went well.

531
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:45,525
Swelling may worsen for about 2 to 3 days,

532
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:48,425
but it will gradually subside,
so please don't worry too much.

533
00:42:48,425 --> 00:42:50,691
Yes, thank you.

534
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:58,025
It turned out well like the
photo I showed you, right?

535
00:42:58,025 --> 00:43:03,091
Now, you should look a bit more like your son.

536
00:43:03,091 --> 00:43:04,558
Excuse me?

537
00:43:04,558 --> 00:43:07,725
No, how did you…

538
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:13,491
Min-Min Seong! How did you get here?

539
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:16,391
Darn, what's this? Your eyes are all swollen!

540
00:43:16,391 --> 00:43:18,044
Ah, why are you here?

541
00:43:18,044 --> 00:43:19,177
What? Where are you trying to get surgery?

542
00:43:19,177 --> 00:43:21,277
I don't know!

543
00:43:26,891 --> 00:43:29,191
I'm sorry…

544
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:33,710
I thought I was the only one
having a hard time…

545
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:46,256
Doctor,

546
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,991
since my son came all this way,

547
00:43:49,991 --> 00:43:52,425
how about some surgery
to make his nose just like mine?

548
00:43:52,425 --> 00:43:54,058
No, my nose is better!

549
00:43:54,058 --> 00:43:56,225
Ah, what do you mean, your nose
is better? Dad's nose is better.

550
00:43:56,225 --> 00:43:58,225
- I'm telling you my nose is better.
- No, my nose is prettier.

551
00:43:58,225 --> 00:44:01,191
Geez, really, you brat.

552
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:02,991
Are you okay?

553
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:05,325
Ever since he found out
about the adoption a while ago,

554
00:44:05,325 --> 00:44:07,358
I've heard the good father-son
relationship became strained.

555
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:09,391
They both went their separate ways.

556
00:44:09,391 --> 00:44:13,658
He is not even his real dad, so "why
interfere? Mind your own business".

557
00:44:13,658 --> 00:44:15,325
But how did you know?

558
00:44:15,325 --> 00:44:17,991
That the two of them were father and son?

559
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:19,607
The hand around the shoulder in the photo

560
00:44:19,607 --> 00:44:21,925
turned out to be Kim Hyun Seok's.

561
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:26,658
<i>I just need to look like this person.</i>

562
00:44:26,658 --> 00:44:29,125
A photo taken together is still a photo, but

563
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:33,425
who else but family would look
at you with such a gaze?

564
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:41,878
You're still the same.

565
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,217
Still?

566
00:44:45,217 --> 00:44:47,758
Something like that.

567
00:44:47,758 --> 00:44:49,491
Anyway, you've worked hard.

568
00:44:49,491 --> 00:44:52,325
The unspoken feelings
between the father and son

569
00:44:52,325 --> 00:44:56,425
were clearly conveyed by
you through the surgery.

570
00:45:03,558 --> 00:45:05,725
Oh, my…

571
00:45:05,725 --> 00:45:07,870
God!

572
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,391
It turned out so well!

573
00:45:09,391 --> 00:45:11,058
A real jackpot!

574
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:12,525
It is definitely different
from being a former model.

575
00:45:12,525 --> 00:45:14,425
Exactly. What do we do?

576
00:45:14,425 --> 00:45:16,025
What are you doing?

577
00:45:16,025 --> 00:45:17,758
What are you all looking at so intently?

578
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:19,391
Manager, take a look at this.

579
00:45:19,391 --> 00:45:22,525
I think this is all because of Director Cha.

580
00:45:22,525 --> 00:45:25,258
Huh? Oh, that person!

581
00:45:25,258 --> 00:45:27,491
She's so pretty, isn't she?

582
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,559
Oh, my, what's going on?

583
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:31,425
<i>Although I received a skin graft,</i>

584
00:45:31,425 --> 00:45:33,692

587
00:45:37,991 --> 00:45:40,658

<i>if I gave up like this,</i>

589
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:45,891
<i>I would be letting the

590
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:48,725
<i>So I challenged myself.</i>

591
00:45:48,725 --> 00:45:50,691
<i>My life… these scars too…</i>

592
00:45:50,691 --> 00:45:53,325
<i>I decided not to hide them
and to show them as they are.</i>

593
00:45:53,325 --> 00:45:57,458
New face, new dream!

594
00:45:57,458 --> 00:46:00,458
This is it! This is what I was aiming for.

595
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:03,558
What a touching story this is.

596
00:46:03,558 --> 00:46:06,631
Touching stories like this
don't come along every day.

597
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:07,891
Director,

598
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:11,792
did you gather everyone here
to talk about that?

599
00:46:11,792 --> 00:46:14,287
Now, just wait a second.

600
00:46:14,287 --> 00:46:16,425
If Jung Hee Young receives the award,

601
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:18,958
and we continue to take care of the aftermath,

602
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:21,858
where else in the world can you
find such promotional effects?

603
00:46:21,858 --> 00:46:25,358
So, let's all come together with one heart,

604
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:27,858
and support Jung Hee Young.

605
00:46:27,858 --> 00:46:29,958
Got it? Let's watch it.

<i>The rankings have finally been decided.</i>

607
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:36,558
<i>It's the result of combining the
audience votes and the judges' scores.</i>

608
00:46:36,558 --> 00:46:38,991
<i>We will now announce</i>

609
00:46:38,991 --> 00:46:42,045

619
00:47:08,363 --> 00:47:10,625
First place… Only the first place remains.

620
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,641
Nobody can leave.

621
00:47:12,641 --> 00:47:14,632
Would she ever become the first place?

622
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:16,191
There's no rule saying she can't!

623
00:47:16,191 --> 00:47:18,551
But, there's no rule saying she will either.

I told you, didn't I? This?

628
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:42,491
That becoming first place isn't easy, you know?

629
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:44,725
In the end, everything
is just about appearance.

630
00:47:44,725 --> 00:47:48,478
She must have fallen behind in the
public vote because of the early rumors.

631
00:47:48,478 --> 00:47:52,978
Ah, this can't just end like this! Right?

632
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:57,057
<i>Lastly, Ms. Jung Hee Young,</i>

633
00:47:57,756 --> 00:48:01,291

against injustice despite all disadvantages,</i>

634
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:03,825
<i>and who did not yield in the face
of unfortunate circumstances,</i>

<i>showing a spirit of challenge,</i>

to select Ms. Jung Hee Young</i>

639

<i>Congratulations, Ms. Jung Hee Young!</i>

642
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:32,309

643
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:35,270

- What?
- The victim's dedicated doctor, I mean.

656
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:19,425
It strangely seems to suit you,
even though it doesn't look like it would.

657
00:50:20,377 --> 00:50:24,854
No, I mean, the partner doctor
in Bintan is still on hold.

658
00:50:26,158 --> 00:50:29,792
It's just that I didn't want you
to feel disappointed.

659
00:50:30,525 --> 00:50:32,891
It's because I have a surgery.

You were nowhere to be seen all night.

669

I heard a video came out, so I brought it.

670
00:51:19,245 --> 00:51:22,712
Is there anything that
could identify the person?

671
00:51:23,258 --> 00:51:26,191
They didn't wear a mask here.

672
00:51:28,684 --> 00:51:30,525
The quality is good, too…

673
00:51:30,525 --> 00:51:34,669
It's hard to recognize the face accurately
since he's wearing a cap pressed down.

674

Well… I'll have to think about it.

681
00:52:00,671 --> 00:52:03,372

00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:27,826
I'm a police officer, what's the matter?

698
00:56:27,826 --> 00:56:29,380
The delivery person who just ran out…

699
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,558
You are under arrest for unauthorized entry.

700
00:56:31,558 --> 00:56:34,491
So, are you saying the wound wasn't caused
by fragments falling and embedding themselves?

701
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:36,981
Judging by the shape of the wound, yes.

702
00:56:36,981 --> 00:56:38,325
What the heck is this rat doing?

703
00:56:38,325 --> 00:56:40,525
You've been investigating me as the culprit
from the beginning, haven't you?

704
00:56:40,525 --> 00:56:44,200
Is Detective Lee Min Hyeong with you now?

705
00:56:46,325 --> 00:56:48,571
Are you there?

706
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,437
Are you crazy?

707
00:56:50,437 --> 00:56:52,771
Lee Min Hyeong.

708
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:57,978
