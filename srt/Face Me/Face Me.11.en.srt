what's the matter?

9
00:05:28,808 --> 00:05:31,056
It's nothing.

10
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:44,264
- Yes?
- Where are you? Not checking the patient?

11
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,372
You said you had a surgery.

12
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:50,642
Yes, I'm on my way.

What's the matter, miss?

14
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:39,694
The DNA of the culprit found
under Nam Hyo Ju's fingernails,

15
00:06:39,694 --> 00:06:42,675
and the other DNA taken from the watch match.

16

Yes, Director Han.

25

The surgery preparation is done,

What's going on, Director?

28
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:16,835
Why did you suddenly cancel the surgery?

29
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:21,598
No, why lie…

30
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:25,962
There are some reasons…

31
00:08:25,962 --> 00:08:27,982
Anyway…

32
00:08:27,982 --> 00:08:30,975
Cancel all the remaining surgeries.

Wait, don't do anything.

39
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:20,475
I'll be there shortly.

00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:37,588
I know you must be shocked,

41

All the surgeries were cancelled today.

47
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,758
The director canceled them.

48
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:11,454

- Yes.

It seems you've come to pick up Hye Jin.

00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,342
- So cool.
- I'm envious.

57

and left right away.

Ah… Well…

65
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:13,807

I'm sorry. I should have told you earlier.

69

Why?

76
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:07,158
Why did he kill my father?

77
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:10,442
Because he was a criminal?

78
00:12:10,442 --> 00:12:12,442
Because he was poor?

79
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:16,608
Or because he looked easy to him?

80
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:22,211
What on earth did we do to deserve this?

81
00:12:46,547 --> 00:12:50,508
Go to the hospital, secure
Han Woo Jin's location, and prepare for arrest.

82

The DNA comparison results will be out soon.

83
00:12:53,408 --> 00:12:55,131
I'll contact you as soon as the results are in.

Yes, I understand.

on the list of attendees at the conference

86

about Jeong Woo's accident?

88
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:21,600
I was in Singapore for a conference that day.

00:13:43,747 --> 00:13:46,147
What do you know so far?

90
00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:57,101
On the day of Yoon Hye Jin's death,

91
00:13:57,101 --> 00:14:00,108
you were officially in Singapore.

92
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:02,642
But, upon checking,

93
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,110
you didn't attend the conference.

wanting to become a doctor?

Woo Jin, you!

107
00:16:10,308 --> 00:16:13,135
Is it because I'm not Cha Jeong Woo?

108

Jeong Woo all this time?

with Jeong Woo, it was you guys.

for me in the operation room.

Didn't he go into another surgery?

Yes, it's a match.

he wouldn't just let it be.

You saw Hye Jin's crime scene photo
in front of the police station that day.

164
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:13,408
Could it be because of that?

165

Do you think so, too?

166
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,568
I… might not know
