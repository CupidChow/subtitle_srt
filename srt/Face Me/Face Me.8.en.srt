It is you, isn't it?

8
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,743
The guy who ran out of the house that day.

9
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:36,557
Those who killed their girlfriends
and wives, it was all out of jealousy.

10
00:01:36,557 --> 00:01:41,290
Why? Did your lover cheat on you?

11
00:02:01,949 --> 00:02:04,694
Darn it!

12
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:53,056
Mr. Cha Jeong Woo!

13
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,474
Mr. Cha Jeong Woo, wait a moment!

14
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,657
Now, calm down.

Lee Jin Seok.

16
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:10,490
You are under emergency arrest
for the attempted murder of Nam Hyo Ju.

17
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,457
- What? What did you say?
- Detective!

18
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:14,990
You have the right to appoint a lawyer and
to refuse to make any statements.

19
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,823
What are you talking about? Let go! Let me go!

20
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:18,123
What are you doing?! Grab him!

21
00:03:18,123 --> 00:03:21,723
- Gods!
- Let go!

22
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:23,557
You can apply for a habeas corpus review.

23
00:03:23,557 --> 00:03:25,190
Lee Min Hyeong, are you out of your mind?

24
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,223
What are you doing?

25
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:29,957
Let go! Let go! Darn!

26
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:49,609
It almost looked like she was sleeping.

27
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:52,757
But, upon checking,
she was all covered in blood.

28
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:54,857
Someone was definitely there.

29
00:03:54,857 --> 00:03:57,157
The guy who was in that house is the culprit!

30
00:03:57,157 --> 00:04:00,290
Jeong Woo, I'm sorry.

31
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,723
I should have told you earlier.

32
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:06,423
Those who killed their girlfriends
and wives, it was all out of jealousy.

33
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:08,436
Why? Did your lover

34
00:04:08,436 --> 00:04:11,823
cheat on you?

35
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,957
If the saturation is 90,

36
00:04:32,957 --> 00:04:37,217

it's not respiratory distress due to phlegm or vomit.

37
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:40,389
[Sound heard from lung auscultation]
It's wheezing.

38
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:41,423
It says no underlying diseases

39
00:04:41,423 --> 00:04:43,323
were reported.

40
00:04:43,323 --> 00:04:44,557
What?

41
00:04:44,557 --> 00:04:48,695
Patient, can you hear me?

42
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:53,024
Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma?

43

[Bronchospasm - bronchial obstruction]
It's bronchospasm!

Dexamethasone and bring Ventolin.

45

Yes.

46
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:06,251
But, why did…

47
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:19,723
Did he provide an alibi?

48
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:21,490
He invoked his right to stay silent.

49
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,124
If he speaks, will you even believe him?

50
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:52,023
Hey, get up.

51
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:55,781
- Why?
- Because I put it in the mailbox.

52
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:58,990
Bring it quickly!

53
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,690
Quickly!

54
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,357
This guy is hilarious.

55
00:06:03,357 --> 00:06:06,943
Darn it, so annoying.

56
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:27,957
Hey!

57
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:30,815
Excuse me!

58

Ah, darn it!

59
00:07:51,457 --> 00:07:54,369
Even after saying it hundreds of times,

60
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:57,790
that darned evidence
made me out to be a murderer.

61
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,190
Someone was there, I'm sure.

62
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,323
He's the one who did this to me.

63
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:03,857
You mean Cha Jeong Woo?

64
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:06,157
That's why I've been surrounding that guy.

65
00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:08,423
The one who ran out of that house
looked exactly like him.

66
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:10,143
No!

67
00:08:10,143 --> 00:08:12,891
It's that guy!

68
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:15,057
That's why he came to me on his own accord.

69
00:08:15,057 --> 00:08:18,644
He must be scared now.

70
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:21,523
Hey!

71
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:26,057
Grab that guy and see what you can find, okay?

72
00:08:26,057 --> 00:08:28,123
If we dig into where and
what he was doing that day,

73
00:08:28,123 --> 00:08:29,701
something's bound to turn up.

74
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:32,357
There's no use putting emotions first.

75
00:08:32,357 --> 00:08:33,957
Whether it's a retrial or reinvestigation,

76
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:37,657
it's not anger that moves
public power, but evidence.

77
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:40,980
Reliable evidence.

78
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,157
Who is there to believe me?

79
00:08:51,956 --> 00:08:55,390
We're investigating Mr. Nam
Gi Taek's possible murder.

80
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,590
And in the assault case of Ms. Nam Hyo Ju,

81
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,029
the perpetrator left evidence behind.

82
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:06,250
It'll be revealed once
the DNA results come out.

83
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,523
Just say what you have to.

84
00:09:08,523 --> 00:09:11,390
Even just once.

85
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,023
Then there will be

86
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:15,923
someone who believes you.

87
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,690
That's why I've been surrounding that guy.

88
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,823
The guy who ran out of that house
looked just like that rat.

89
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:32,596
No!

90
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:35,441
It's that guy.

91
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:43,829
With no past medical history
or underlying conditions,

92
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:46,466
the patient signed in her own hand.

93
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:49,023
If they find out the surgeon
wasn't present after the surgery,

94
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:52,257
it could be an issue.

95
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:56,458
Still, we fulfilled our duty
to administer first aid

96
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,423
properly, didn't we?

97
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:00,923
It's not like there was a problem
with the surgery itself.

98
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:02,782
Anyway, the patient is recovering
without any complications.

99
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:04,557
That's true but…

100
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:06,663
I trusted and left it to you because
you said he performs well…

101
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:09,176
What kind of doctor leaves a
patient and vacates their post?

102
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:10,944
I'm sorry it turned out this way.

103
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,972
I will give a warning and tell him
to contact you separately.

104
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:17,067
Hey, this isn't something that can
be made up for with just one call.

105
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:19,657
The nation's actress Choi Eun Ah was at
death's door and came back. This is serious.

106
00:10:19,657 --> 00:10:22,390
Indeed, it was almost a disaster.

107
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,257
So before the surgery, the patient
must personally check their medical history.

108
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,790
They need to do it very diligently.

109
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,557
If you happen to go to another hospital,

110
00:10:29,557 --> 00:10:32,657
please be sure to mention that she has asthma.

111
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:34,050
That is important.

112
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,757
That, something minor you
were diagnosed with years ago,

113
00:10:36,757 --> 00:10:41,542
how could you check each of them?

114
00:10:43,023 --> 00:10:46,523
It's not the hospital's fault.

115
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,690
It's my own fault for forgetting, really.

116
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,200
- Thank you for your hard work.
- I apologize.

117
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,267
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Ah, yes.

118
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:04,290
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

119
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,313
- Then…
- I am sorry.

120
00:11:08,313 --> 00:11:09,657
Walk slowly.

121
00:11:09,657 --> 00:11:11,239
- Good job.
- Ah, yes.

122
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:13,590
- Let's talk next time.
- Sorry, go.

123
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,757
Hey, walk slowly. Take it easy.

124
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:20,423
Still, it's a relief.

125
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:22,423
I'm glad it's over without any major issues.

126
00:11:22,423 --> 00:11:26,123
But, this isn't something to just let slide.

127
00:11:26,123 --> 00:11:28,157
- Still no contact?
- None.

128
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:33,423
What on earth is he
so preoccupied with? Really!

129
00:11:34,556 --> 00:11:38,290
- Is it Jeong Woo?
- No, it's not.

130
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,363
Oh, honey.

131
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:42,369
How is it that this darn hospital
can't function without me?

132
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,870
We need to keep the hospital
in order, for real.

133
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,104
Cha Jeong Woo, you rat!

134
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:50,757
What are you doing after
leaving a mess in the hospital?

135
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:52,693
What?

136
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:55,487
Where?

137
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:15,890
Hello?

138
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,110
What are you doing here?

139
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,282
It's noisy and chaotic.

140
00:12:23,282 --> 00:12:25,963
Just great.

141
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:28,257
What are you saying?

142
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:30,103
Why did you just abandon the patient,
and where have you been

143
00:12:30,103 --> 00:12:33,718
to be this mentally frazzled?

144
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:38,123
Cha Jeong Woo!

145
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:41,405
What's wrong with you?

146
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:48,032
Hye Jin…

147
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:59,098
I keep thinking of her last moments.

148
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:01,338
What are you saying? I can hardly
hear you. It's so loud it's killing me.

149
00:13:01,338 --> 00:13:04,662
Let's talk outside. Get up.

150
00:13:04,662 --> 00:13:07,518
Get up!

151
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:19,490
You know, don't you? Who that guy is.

152
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,367
You know, right?

153
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:33,857
There's something about that guy.

154
00:13:33,857 --> 00:13:37,023
There must be something.

155
00:13:41,157 --> 00:13:43,290
The last sight of Hye Jin?

156
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,123
What are you talking about?

157
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:46,890
That day, you were on the way
to Hye Jin's house and had an accident.

158
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,990
You woke up three days later, man.

159
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,207
What kind of nonsense is this?

160
00:13:57,923 --> 00:14:00,623
Jeong Woo,

161
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:02,923
what is this?

162
00:14:02,923 --> 00:14:06,249
The reason Lee Jin Seok appeared before me.

163
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:08,890
Did you meet Lee Jin Seok?

164
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,854
So?

165
00:14:10,854 --> 00:14:13,290
What's the reason?

166
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,990
He said he saw a person

167
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,957
running out Hye Jin's house that day.

168
00:14:20,957 --> 00:14:22,958
That is…

169
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,910
Who did he say it was?

170
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,523
You told me not to care
about what such a punk says.

171
00:14:28,523 --> 00:14:32,323
That's because it's just unbelievable.

172
00:14:32,323 --> 00:14:37,549
So, that punk is saying the one
who ran away was you?

173
00:14:39,323 --> 00:14:42,111
Yeah.

174
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:46,918
He said it seemed like me…

175
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,990
I have seen all kinds of crazy folks.

176
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,690
What Lee Jin Seok talked about

177
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,257
and the image of Hye Jin in my mind

178
00:14:57,257 --> 00:15:00,590
are similar.

179
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,623
Jeong Woo,

00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,990
There was no official document for the
traffic accident that occurred that day, right?

357
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,257
If it's a person closely related to the victim,

358
00:26:25,257 --> 00:26:27,923
an official document specifying
the accident location or time

359
00:26:27,923 --> 00:26:31,223
is necessary, isn't it?

360
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,723
Lee Jin Seok,

361
00:26:34,723 --> 00:26:38,189
said he saw a guy running out of that house.

362
00:26:38,189 --> 00:26:40,208
Upon opening the file,

363
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,557
the investigation regarding
the victim's lover is empty.

364
00:26:42,557 --> 00:26:45,223
They say there was an accident,

365
00:26:45,223 --> 00:26:48,590
but since there are no documents to
confirm it, the suspect is Cha Jeong Woo.

366
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,523
Is this the provisional
conclusion of your question?

367
00:26:50,523 --> 00:26:52,378
Having not clearly investigated the accident--

368
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:54,827
What you're saying right now is quite

369
00:26:54,827 --> 00:26:57,790
risky, you know that?

370
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:02,457
I have raised an obvious question
that can be held as a detective.

371
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:08,757
Before being a detective,

372
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:12,723
you are the family of the offender.

373
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:16,190
How desperate must one be
to hide evidence among family

374
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,706
and even to hide a criminal,

375
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:20,523
thinking they will be exempted from punishment?

376
00:27:20,523 --> 00:27:24,457
I learned that from my team leader.

377
00:27:24,457 --> 00:27:28,057
Please don't distort the intention.

378
00:27:29,657 --> 00:27:32,523
That day, Doctor Cha Jeong Woo

379
00:27:32,523 --> 00:27:36,423
had an accident on his way
to his girlfriend's house.

380
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:38,890
When he woke up, the lover was dead,

381
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,490
and a doctor who saves lives

382
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:44,923
had let his lover go so vainly.

383
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:47,976
Imagine how he must have felt.

384
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:50,257
Stop it.

385
00:27:50,257 --> 00:27:52,823
Avoid thoughtlessly touching
the victim's wounds.

386
00:27:52,823 --> 00:27:56,523
Lee Min Hyeong, in this case,

387
00:27:56,523 --> 00:27:59,123
don't forget that you are
the family of the perpetrator,

388
00:27:59,123 --> 00:28:03,011
before being a detective.

389
00:28:06,076 --> 00:28:09,409
Not leaving even a speck of doubt

390
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:13,275
is a true investigation for the victim.

391
00:28:14,723 --> 00:28:19,616
I haven't forgotten what you said.

392
00:28:20,957 --> 00:28:24,009
I apologize in advance.

393
00:28:38,057 --> 00:28:40,023
What did you do?

394
00:28:40,023 --> 00:28:44,223
It looks like Jeong Woo is packing his things.

395
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:48,023
Those who need to go should go, what else…

396
00:28:48,657 --> 00:28:50,623
Since Jeong Woo is also leaving,

397
00:28:50,623 --> 00:28:53,590
how about discharging the patient Nam Hyo Ju?

398
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:57,957
There's nothing more that can be
treated at our hospital anyway.

399
00:28:58,523 --> 00:29:02,590
Hasn't that case been resolved yet?

400
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,290
Since there is no memory
of the time of the crime,

401
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,723
it seems it's not easy.

402
00:29:09,857 --> 00:29:11,457
Well, for now,

403
00:29:11,457 --> 00:29:16,850
let's keep an eye on the patient until
she expresses her desire to be discharged.

404
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,883
Even if Jeong Woo is out, you can check on her.

405
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:26,323
I'm soon entering the peak
season. I'll be busy.

408

Try bending the second finger.

409
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:40,990
The surgery went well.

410
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,890
And the function at the surgical site is good.

411
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,423
I think we might not need
to continue with ischemia monitoring.

412
00:29:45,423 --> 00:29:48,225
Yes.

413

416
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:06,723

no memory of that time, right?

By any chance…

418
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:16,490
Please inform me when the victim
protection measures come out,

419
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,623
I'll issue the discharge order then.

420
00:30:47,176 --> 00:30:50,690
Director, we've decided to have
a farewell party together this evening.

421
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:53,557
Yes.

422
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:59,090
I'll step out for a bit and come back.

423
00:31:06,623 --> 00:31:09,533

427
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:17,757
he was running errands at a gambling den

428

when a fight started.

429
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:20,823
They were caught in a raid.

and secured the CCTV footage as well.

433
00:31:29,757 --> 00:31:32,990
They don't match Mr. Lee Jin Seok.

434
00:31:49,503 --> 00:31:51,309
Mr. Lee Jin Seok,

435
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:54,509
you can go home.

436
00:32:07,257 --> 00:32:10,123
I just have one question. Dr. Cha Jeong Woo…

437
00:32:10,123 --> 00:32:13,090
Why?

438
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,000
You think I'm going to kill that punk?

439
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,729
Cha Jeong Woo was
in a traffic accident that day,

440
00:32:21,729 --> 00:32:24,290
and woke up a few days later.
He couldn't have been there.

441
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:27,187
That's a perfect alibi right there.

442
00:32:27,187 --> 00:32:28,874
Hey!

443
00:32:28,874 --> 00:32:31,623
When and where did that accident happen?

444
00:32:31,623 --> 00:32:35,028
Before or after that woman died?

445
00:32:35,818 --> 00:32:38,957
Do you have the evidence
you like, credible evidence?

446
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,223
I've seen it too.

447
00:32:41,223 --> 00:32:46,123

traffic accident that occurred that day, right?

448

449
00:32:49,857 --> 00:32:53,123
I don't believe it anymore.

450
00:32:53,123 --> 00:32:56,990
I'll handle it myself, so stop worrying.

451
00:33:18,783 --> 00:33:21,290
And Lee Jin Seok?

452
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,157
He was just released and returned home.

453
00:33:24,157 --> 00:33:25,990
Nam Hyo Ju's case,

454
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,341
are you sure it's not Lee Jin Seok?

455
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:32,123
The results of the DNA analysis
from under Nam Hyo Ju's fingernails

456
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:33,290
don't match his.

457
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:38,407
Is Nam Gi Taek's death
also unrelated to Lee Jin Seok?

458
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:42,190
There were some suspicious circumstances,

459

but there's no physical evidence at all.

460
00:33:46,742 --> 00:33:49,857

461

Jeong Woo.

708
00:49:49,026 --> 00:49:54,459
Do you have a moment?

709
00:50:38,733 --> 00:50:42,399
I'm sorry, Jeong Woo.

710
00:50:43,593 --> 00:50:47,193
So where was

711
00:50:47,193 --> 00:50:50,193
the accident?

712
00:50:56,259 --> 00:50:57,893
Jeong Woo!

713
00:50:57,893 --> 00:50:59,059
Where did the accident happen?

714
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:01,026
It was a pedestrian accident
that occurred in Gayeon-dong.

715
00:51:01,026 --> 00:51:02,626
According to the driver,
someone suddenly jumped out.

716
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:05,647
- Let's go.
- Yes.

717
00:51:09,426 --> 00:51:11,905
It's you, the one who ran out
of that house that day.

718
00:51:11,905 --> 00:51:13,759
People who block their own memories,

719
00:51:13,759 --> 00:51:18,388
do so because they can't handle
the events from the past.

720
00:51:34,819 --> 00:51:37,439
You…

721
00:51:37,439 --> 00:51:40,926
What on earth did you do at that house?

722
00:51:40,926 --> 00:51:44,211
Do you really not know?
Or are you pretending not to know?

723
00:51:44,211 --> 00:51:45,636
What are you talking about?

724
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:47,268
You don't remember?

725
00:51:47,268 --> 00:51:52,081
Then, come over and I'll
make you remember everything.

726
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,059
[Lee Jin Seok]

727
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:06,993
Come home right now.

728
00:52:06,993 --> 00:52:09,492
I'll clearly show you that
Cha Jeong Woo is the culprit.

729
00:52:09,492 --> 00:52:11,393
What does that mean?

730
00:52:11,393 --> 00:52:14,242
Hello?

731
00:52:21,793 --> 00:52:22,926
Yes, detective.

732
00:52:22,926 --> 00:52:25,393
Come to Lee Jin Seok's house right away.

733
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:28,713
I'm sorry.

734
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:32,879
I've told everything to Jeong Woo.

735
00:53:41,478 --> 00:53:44,412
Lee Jin…

736
00:54:02,498 --> 00:54:05,394
Brother…

737
00:54:05,912 --> 00:54:10,093
Jin Seok, can you hear me?

738
00:54:10,093 --> 00:54:12,932
Jin Seok!

739
00:54:12,932 --> 00:54:15,865
Lee Jin Seok!

740
00:54:27,326 --> 00:54:31,726
No, this can't be right.

741
00:54:32,793 --> 00:54:35,577
Detective!

742
00:54:35,577 --> 00:54:37,359
Lee Jin Seok!

743
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:41,108
Lee Jin Seok, snap out of it!

744
00:54:54,655 --> 00:54:58,184
[Face Me]

745
00:54:59,776 --> 00:55:03,543
♫ I can't forget the day we first met ♫

746
00:55:03,543 --> 00:55:07,478
♫ The wind was so cold ♫

747
00:55:07,478 --> 00:55:11,774
♫ Your awkward greeting ♫

748
00:55:11,774 --> 00:55:15,893
♫ Frozen, you were all I can see ♫

749
00:55:15,893 --> 00:55:17,193
Jin Seok!

750
00:55:17,193 --> 00:55:18,459
Lee Jin Seok!

751
00:55:18,459 --> 00:55:22,259
Did you take personal revenge on
the murderer who killed your girlfriend?

752
00:55:22,259 --> 00:55:25,237
Regarding the case of Ms. Yoon Hye Jin,

753
00:55:25,237 --> 00:55:27,193
is there some secret that
Lee Jin Seok could disclose?

754
00:55:27,193 --> 00:55:28,622
Do you think so, too?

755
00:55:28,622 --> 00:55:31,659
I might have killed Hye Jin.

756
00:55:31,659 --> 00:55:34,493
Why did you hide Jeong Woo's accident?

757
00:55:34,493 --> 00:55:36,059
The bloodstain on the wristwatch

758
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:38,893
has been identified as the DNA of the
victims Yoon Hye Jin and Cha Jeong Woo.

759
00:55:38,893 --> 00:55:41,393
The reason why you are so anxious right now

760
00:55:41,393 --> 00:55:45,593
is because you may be involved
in Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's death?

761
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:48,101
What, a warrant? For Director Cha?

762
00:55:48,101 --> 00:55:49,326
The summoning of a suspect has been issued.

763
00:55:49,326 --> 00:55:52,717
It's about Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's murder case.

764
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:57,877
♫ I'm walking outside of your ♫
