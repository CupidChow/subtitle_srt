1
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:13,625
   

2
00:00:15,604 --> 00:00:20,561
   

3
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,402
   

4
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:36,953
   

5
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:51,840



6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,920
   

7
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,747
 Woo Jin, please stop! 

8
00:01:20,534 --> 00:01:22,567
 Are you scared? 

9
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:26,810
 Then, why did you do that to Hye Jin? 

10
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:31,967
 Woo Jin, I stopped there. 

11
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,301
 You should stop, too. 

12
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:46,201
 Hye Jin died because of you, and... 

13
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:50,509
 I became a murderer because of Jeong Woo. 

14
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,159
 Why only Hyejin and I... 

15
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:57,807
 Woo Jin, 

16
00:01:57,807 --> 00:02:00,522
 this won't solve anything. 

17
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:04,106
 So, first calm down and… 

18
00:02:04,106 --> 00:02:05,772
 Is that so? 

19
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:12,088
 If it can't be resolved, there's nothing we can do. 

20
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:14,188
 What are you going to do? 

21
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,156
 We have no choice but to fall together. 

22
00:02:19,302 --> 00:02:21,243
 Jeong Woo, too. 

23
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:25,532
 I will make him a murderer just like me. 

24
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:27,666
 Woo Jin! 

25
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:35,132
 Help me, 

26
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:36,866
 Mom. 

27
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:48,099
 Woo Jin! 

28
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:49,699
 Don't do this! 

29
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:52,539
 Stop, please! 

30
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,611
 Woo Jin! Woo Jin! 

31
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:57,211
 Woo Jin! 

32
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,266
 Woo Jin, don't do this! 

33
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:03,199
 Don't do this, please! 

34
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:07,398
Jeong Woo…

35
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,006
Put an end to this now.

36
00:03:15,352 --> 00:03:17,799
End it with your hands, you bastard!

37
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,879
No!

38
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,880
   

39
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,220
  ­ 

40
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,299
   

41
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:08,932
It looks like it's gone under. 
    

42
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:10,766
Then, let's go somewhere else.

43
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:14,099
   

44
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:33,266
   

45
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,799
   

46
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:57,738
Are you still blaming yourself?

47
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:02,770
I was ignorant,

48
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,270
as a doctor and as a mother.

49
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,436
The situation couldn't be helped.

50
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:13,836
It wasn't a situation that happened overnight.

51
00:05:13,836 --> 00:05:17,870
It's the result of a long-standing and festering inflammation that burst.

52
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,070
While Woo Jin was trapped in his own world,

53
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,236
the fact that I knew nothing...

54
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:28,703
is just pitiful.

55
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,670
You can never truly know what's in a person's heart if they're trying to hide it.

56
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,771
Thanks to your guardianship, he was close to Jeong Woo like a brother.

57
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:40,455
The feeling of inadequacy that couldn't be helped

58
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:44,289
became resentment towards Jeong Woo.

59
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:51,450
At any rate,

60
00:05:57,103 --> 00:05:58,736
what's with these pictures?

61
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:01,103
I've explained everything to the police.

62
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:04,720
I said it had nothing to do with the incident from seven years ago.

63
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,510
   

64
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,736
Because I wanted to stop their marriage,

65
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:26,270
I was going to try to find out some of her weaknesses.

66
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:31,584
I felt it was because of my mean heart that Hye Jin ended up like that.

67
00:06:32,536 --> 00:06:33,570
That's why,

68
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,270
I had hoped for both Jeong Woo and I to quickly escape from her death.

69
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,642
It must have been a good pretext for Woo Jin.

70
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:45,042
By using such an excuse,

71
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,370
he probably wanted to justify what happened that day.

72
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:54,036
I closed up the hospital.

73
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,803
Why the hospital, all of a sudden?

74
00:06:56,803 --> 00:07:00,503
What right do I have to counsel people who are emotionally hurt,

75
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:04,436
when I didn't even properly understand the pain of the person beside me.

76
00:07:04,436 --> 00:07:06,936
What are you going to do now?

77
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:09,583
I'm leaving the country next week.

78
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,503
While doing medical volunteer work,

79
00:07:12,503 --> 00:07:15,336
I'll try to learn more about people.

80
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,170
What about Jeong Woo?

81
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,436
Does Jeong Woo know?

82
00:07:19,436 --> 00:07:23,103
   

83
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,975
I thought you wouldn't come out.

84
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:55,990
Why did you save me?

85
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,975
 Jeong Woo… 

86
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:07,783
 Put an end to this now. 

87
00:08:09,062 --> 00:08:11,503
 - Hmm? 
 - Isn't he a doctor? 

88
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:14,156
 Doctors are supposed to save lives. 

89
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:17,229
 How could a doctor… 

90
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:21,803
 - Are you angry? 
 - No, I'm in a really good mood. 

91
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:23,403
 Why? 

92
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:28,974
 The people you saved are now saving you. 

93
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:33,144
 End it with your hands, you bastard! 

94
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:35,093
 No! 

95
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,483
 Don't die. 

96
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,595
 Don't run away, you rat. 

97
00:09:24,436 --> 00:09:27,303
I heard you keep denying

98
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:29,703
Hye Jin's murder charges.

99
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,436
Because it was an accident.

100
00:09:32,436 --> 00:09:34,943
Do you still think so?

101
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:37,736
If we talked about it here,

102
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:40,536
did you think my answer would change?

103
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:46,380
Let's never see each other again.

104
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,372
It wasn't an accident.

105
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,875
I'm talking about Hye Jin's cause of death.

106
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,270
Compression marks were found on the victim's neck.

107
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,536
These are additional documents sent from the National Forensic Service.

108
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:19,636
Whether it was due to other injuries on the neck, 
    

109
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:23,370
it was sent a bit later than the other results.

110
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,603
I didn't know about it.

111
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:29,452
There is a record of it being sent from the National Forensic Service.

112
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:31,403
When it was transferred to the prosecution,

113
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:34,503
it was missing from the documents that were handed over.

114
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:37,776
Someone who received that result

115
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:41,076
is suspected of having intentionally omitted it.

116
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,326
I don't know.

117
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:55,743
I re-examined the evidence photos from that time and two fingerprints were restored.

118
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:58,103
One was Mr. Cha Jeong Woo's fingerprint.

119
00:10:58,103 --> 00:11:00,970
He must have provided first aid immediately upon finding the victim at the scene,

120
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,837
so it's natural that his fingerprints were found.

121
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:06,276
And about the other one...

122
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,803
When you checked it alone secretly seven years ago,

123
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,403
you probably couldn't identify whose fingerprints they were

124
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:14,603
because they were partial ones.

125
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,836
But you must have compared them with Lee Jin Seok's fingerprints.

126
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:26,203
Knowing that they didn't match,

127
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:29,020
you did not correct it.

128
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:33,931
The carotid artery was torn,

129
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:37,036
and though obscured by the blood,

130
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:39,270
I'm sure you can see it.

131
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:45,163
I don't know about it.

132
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,529
She was alive.

133
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:55,196
Even after she collapsed from the accident, Hye Jin…

134
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:59,051
was alive.

135
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,869
As you said, she fell and injured her head,

136
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:09,160
so she probably had no strength to even defend herself.

137
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,336
In that situation, you had to use your own hands.

138
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,439
The person you killed at that moment...

139
00:12:23,024 --> 00:12:25,724
was not Hye Jin, but me.

140
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:29,136
The reason I lost my memory...

141
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,319
must be because I wanted to pretend not to know that.

142
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,203
As a doctor

143
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:39,991
trying to save injured people,

144
00:12:40,536 --> 00:12:44,511
my helpless self was unable to protect the one I loved.

145
00:12:47,836 --> 00:12:49,836
My friend whom I trusted like a brother...

146
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,809
Even at the moment when he was killing my woman,

147
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:56,140
I had no clue.

148
00:12:56,636 --> 00:12:59,203
I did not admit how pathetic I was.

149
00:13:05,103 --> 00:13:07,220
But, Woo Jin,

150
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,100
was I the only one...

151
00:13:11,736 --> 00:13:14,141
who ignored what happened that day?

152
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,360
Didn't you want to feign ignorance as well?

153
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:22,391
What?

154
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:26,736
You wanted to forget that day when you were distorted by an inferiority complex…

155
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:28,544
Shut up!

156
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,970
You didn't want to face it.

157
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,280
If you had admitted it,

158
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:38,670
you would have had to confront your real face.

159
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,176
Shut up! Shut the f*ck up!

160
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:43,342
Shut up!

161
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:48,570
   

162
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,350
 ­  

163
00:14:04,236 --> 00:14:05,236
   

164
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:08,570
I submit the appraisal report about the fingerprints found

165
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:13,236
on the victim's neck at the time, which match Han Woo Jin's fingerprints.

166
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,836
   

167
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,603
Prosecutor,

168
00:14:33,603 --> 00:14:35,803
do you acknowledge the claims of the defendant's side?

169
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:37,350
Yes.

170
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:41,703
Defendant, please make your final statement.

171
00:14:48,977 --> 00:14:53,610
Seven years ago, I did not kill anyone.

172
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,552
But for seven years, I've given so much pain and agony

173
00:14:58,552 --> 00:15:01,970
to my younger sister and mother.

174
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,802
I was arrested as a murderer and dragged away in front of my sister.

175
00:15:05,802 --> 00:15:07,836
And I turned

176
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:11,770
my mother into a murderer's mother.

177
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:16,203
The pain I endured for seven years,

178
00:15:16,203 --> 00:15:20,585
I believe was the price for my failure to live uprightly.

179
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:27,034
Now,

180
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,497
please allow my family...

181
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,470
to be freed from these painful memories.

182
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,600
   

183
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,800
 ­  

184
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:43,536
As a result of examining the newly revealed evidence,

185
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:47,070
it was found that during the past investigation of the retrial petitioner,

186
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,703
the detective committed crimes, such as document falsification

187
00:15:49,703 --> 00:15:52,203
and other crimes in the line of duty.

188
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:55,036
The objective reasonableness of the statement at that time

189
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:56,770
and the circumstances of the defendant's confession

190
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:00,236
were found to be inadequately scrutinized.

191
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:05,934
Defendant Lee Jin Seok is hereby declared not guilty.

192
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:26,618
I'm sorry!

193
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:38,477
Why? Why?

194
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:40,944
What shall we eat? What do you want to eat?

195
00:16:55,503 --> 00:16:58,816
I'll go with Mom to get the car. Take your time talking and then come.

196
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:00,652
No.

197
00:17:08,582 --> 00:17:11,645
I thought I was the victim,

198
00:17:12,236 --> 00:17:15,600
but I was also a perpetrator in someone's life.

199
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,420
It's late,

200
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:22,982
but I want to apologize sincerely.

201
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:28,647
For being seven years late,

202
00:17:30,503 --> 00:17:32,717
I am reallyy sorry.

203
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:00,011
Chae Kyeong!

204
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:03,570
What? You haven't left yet?

205
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,300
No.

206
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:08,033
Are you okay?

207
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:10,403
What if I'm not okay?

208
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:12,270
Don't turn off your cell phone,

209
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,983
and don't go to places where you can't be reached.

210
00:18:14,983 --> 00:18:17,342
It's a request from a friend.

211
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,803
If something ever happens to me,

212
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:23,136
you must come running, Jeong Woo.

213
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,936
Now,

214
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,607
you're the only one I have.

215
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:35,213
That is my request.

216
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,368
Come on, enter.

217
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,152
 But, Woo Jin, 

218
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:18,536
 was I the only one 

219
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:20,807
 who ignored what happened that day? 

220
00:19:23,337 --> 00:19:26,770
 Didn't you want to feign ignorance, too? 

221
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,675
 What? 

222
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:32,242
 You, who were distorted by an inferiority complex that day… 

223
00:19:34,836 --> 00:19:37,409
 Why is Cha Jeong Woo okay, 

224
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:41,106
 but not me? 

225
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:47,660
 I just love Jeong Woo. 

226
00:19:48,282 --> 00:19:51,422
 It's not that you won't do. 

227
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:59,197
 I was never going to be the one anyway. 

228
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:10,723
 Die! 

229
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:12,909
 Die! 

230
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:14,277
 I said die! 

231
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:16,477
 Die, darn it! 

232
00:20:18,642 --> 00:20:22,209
 Cha Jeong Woo, you rat, die! 

233
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,116
 The person you killed at that moment... 

234
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:54,952
 was not Hye Jin, but me. 

235
00:21:14,063 --> 00:21:17,530
3245, what are you doing? Go in.

236
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:23,036
 Hey! 3245! 

237
00:21:27,727 --> 00:21:30,336
No! No!

238
00:21:30,336 --> 00:21:33,236
It's not me! It's not me!

239
00:21:33,236 --> 00:21:35,336
- Catch him! 
 - It's not me!

240
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,570
It's not me!

241
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,236
- Catch him! 
 - It's not me! It was an accident!

242
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:40,636
I said it's not me!

243
00:21:40,636 --> 00:21:43,936
It's not me!

244
00:21:54,303 --> 00:21:58,270
   

245
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,136
   

246
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,470
It's really something to celebrate for you,

247
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,677
but as a member of the police, it's not something we can just celebrate.

248
00:22:20,677 --> 00:22:22,970
Let's avoid getting hung up on what's past

249
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,103
and focus on the things we need to resolve.

250
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:28,209
All right.

251
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:29,820
Huh?

252
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,950
The special promotion announcement is out.

253
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:41,378
    
   

254
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:42,670
Special promotion to Sergeant!

255
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,836
   
   

256
00:22:44,836 --> 00:22:46,903
Finally! Finally!

257
00:22:46,903 --> 00:22:51,759
Awesome! We got a special promotion! A special promotion!

258
00:23:10,603 --> 00:23:13,533
   

259
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:18,353
 Hye Jin. 

260
00:23:31,596 --> 00:23:33,630
Ms. Lee Min Hyeong.

261
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,830
What brings you here?

262
00:23:42,303 --> 00:23:43,641
Well…

263
00:23:43,641 --> 00:23:47,163
I had some business to attend to.

264
00:23:47,163 --> 00:23:50,136
Could that business possibly be

265
00:23:50,136 --> 00:23:52,736
over here?

266
00:24:00,103 --> 00:24:01,993
Yes.

267
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:04,120
That's right, over there.

268
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:09,481
- How did you know this place? 
 - I've been here a few times before.

269
00:24:21,177 --> 00:24:25,636
Back when I believed my brother was a murderer,

270
00:24:25,636 --> 00:24:28,123
this was the best I could do

271
00:24:28,123 --> 00:24:30,870
as the family of the perpetrator,

272
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,370
and as a police officer who couldn't protect her.

273
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,036
   

274
00:24:35,036 --> 00:24:37,236
The apology I could offer

275
00:24:37,236 --> 00:24:39,836
was only this much.

276
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:50,336
It's about finding the best you can do, even in an unavoidable situation.

277
00:24:50,336 --> 00:24:52,603
I was lacking in that.

278
00:24:52,603 --> 00:24:54,936
Don't think like that.

279
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:57,703
In any case, the choice you made seven years ago

280
00:24:57,703 --> 00:25:00,583
turned out to be quite the best for many people.

281
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,720
What choice?

282
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:05,336
The decision to move to plastic surgery.

283
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:07,503
Thanks to that choice, so many people have been healed.

284
00:25:07,503 --> 00:25:10,570
I know several crime victims.

285
00:25:17,776 --> 00:25:20,551
It sure took a long time...

286
00:25:21,336 --> 00:25:24,088
until I saw your smiling face.

287
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,503
As if it's something grand.

288
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,436
You seemed like someone determined to not be happy.

289
00:25:32,436 --> 00:25:34,803
 Nothing will change even if you do that. 

290
00:25:34,803 --> 00:25:37,503
 Like someone without any feelings, 

291
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,144
 pretending not to care. 

292
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,070
 Keeping a distance to prevent anyone, patients or otherwise, from getting close. 

293
00:25:47,663 --> 00:25:50,468
 I figured it was because of that incident. 

294
00:25:51,603 --> 00:25:53,800
 Take my hand. 

295
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,523
 It must be because of my brother. 

296
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,070
It was something I really wanted to see,

297
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,870
you living and smiling again.

298
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:08,003
I heard that wasn't the case when you worked in the ER.

299
00:26:08,003 --> 00:26:11,336
They say you were quite passionate and humane.

300
00:26:13,736 --> 00:26:15,503
It was all thanks to Hye Jin.

301
00:26:15,503 --> 00:26:17,541
Exactly.

302
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,703
You were like that, but because of guilt,

303
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:25,671
you set down the emotions and passion you had when you were with Ms. Yoon Hye Jin

304
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:28,070
and lived like this.

305
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,780
That's right.

306
00:26:30,303 --> 00:26:32,456
I did that.

307
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:41,003
The greatest respect for those who left first is

308
00:26:41,003 --> 00:26:43,540
to live life fully.

309
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:48,136
Whether they're by my side or not,

310
00:26:48,136 --> 00:26:51,736
they still become a part of my life, as if they are living with us.

311
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:01,952
So, we are restoring everything to its original state now. Okay?

312
00:27:03,843 --> 00:27:06,136
What should I do and how?

313
00:27:08,703 --> 00:27:11,136
The hospital doors were still closed.

314
00:27:11,136 --> 00:27:13,303
Hurry up and start the consultations.

315
00:27:13,303 --> 00:27:15,270
I didn't shut them down.

316
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,570
Then who did?

317
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,574
It was our hospital director.

318
00:27:18,574 --> 00:27:22,027
He wants to use this occasion to make some changes.

319
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:28,903
I have someone like that around me, too.

320
00:27:28,903 --> 00:27:30,836
How's he holding up?

321
00:27:30,836 --> 00:27:33,920
He's working hard on it.

322
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:40,170
Should I buy some bread from the shop up front?

323
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,536
You like cream buns, don't you?

324
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:43,103
Oh, no! No way.

325
00:27:43,103 --> 00:27:45,803
I have an exam next week, what if I fail? 
  (*Cream is slippery, so he may slip and fall/fail.) 

326
00:27:45,803 --> 00:27:48,870
Mom, I want some sticky rice cakes.

327
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:52,003
You know, right? Sticky, really sticky ones. 
  (*Korean words for "sticky" and "pass" sound the same.) 

328
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,070
Okay! I got it!

329
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,028
Please take good care of me.

330
00:27:56,028 --> 00:28:00,358
 Enjoying the model student cosplay that he couldn't do during school days. 

331
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,425
Tell him to treat me to a meal if he passes.

332
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:05,596
I'll be sure to pass that on.

333
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,811
I'll get going. Thank you for the drink.

334
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,831
Thank you.

335
00:28:16,336 --> 00:28:20,910
Thank you for trusting me and solving the case until the end.

336
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,803
Well…

337
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:28,336
I just did what I was supposed to do as a police officer.

338
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,570
But looking at it now, I do feel somewhat proud.

339
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,936
Investigating a case

340
00:28:34,936 --> 00:28:37,103
is about making sure that the offender receives an appropriate punishment.

341
00:28:37,103 --> 00:28:39,836
That's where the focus is,

342
00:28:39,836 --> 00:28:43,321
but it's also a process of helping the victim recover.

343
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,936
Though it's late,

344
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,832
it seems I saw the beginning of that recovery today.

345
00:28:57,303 --> 00:29:00,036
You seem a bit more at ease now.

346
00:29:32,765 --> 00:29:34,965
You're leaving without a word?

347
00:29:38,898 --> 00:29:41,778
You said the hospital is reopening soon.

348
00:29:41,778 --> 00:29:43,548
You must be busy preparing for the consultations.

349
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,198
So why come here?

350
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:48,435
"It's nice to see your face before leaving the country."

351
00:29:49,165 --> 00:29:51,265
Is that what you're saying?

352
00:29:54,598 --> 00:29:56,298
Yes.

353
00:29:57,465 --> 00:30:00,698
To the mom of seven years ago,

354
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:04,165
that day's choice must have been the best one.

355
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:07,365
The fact that you hid my accident,

356
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:10,797
and that you tried to make me forget Hye Jin quickly…

357
00:30:10,797 --> 00:30:12,532
Yeah…

358
00:30:12,532 --> 00:30:15,751
Even though you resent me for that,

359
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,365
I was actually grateful.

360
00:30:20,265 --> 00:30:23,820
Because by blaming me,

361
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,873
I hoped all your remaining guilt would be buried.

362
00:30:27,431 --> 00:30:31,865
You should have grieved for what hurts and resented what's resentful.

363
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:34,992
I should have just let it all out.

364
00:30:41,065 --> 00:30:44,198
I wondered why I ended up like this.

365
00:30:44,198 --> 00:30:46,675
It's because I take after you.

366
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:52,691
Now stop blaming yourself...

367
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:55,458
and forget it.

368
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:08,632
Don't stay away for too long.

369
00:31:12,444 --> 00:31:14,200
All right.

370
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:16,632
I won't.

371
00:31:43,516 --> 00:31:44,798
    
 Plastic surgery?

372
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:46,618
Making your face or body

373
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:48,765
more attractive. 
    

374
00:31:48,765 --> 00:31:50,232
When I became prettier,

375
00:31:50,232 --> 00:31:52,132
I felt like I'd become a better person. 
    

376
00:31:52,132 --> 00:31:54,265
Isn't it like buying pretty clothes,

377
00:31:54,265 --> 00:31:57,275
or changing your hairstyle? 
    

378
00:31:57,275 --> 00:31:59,832
I have a friend who did it for an interview,

379
00:31:59,832 --> 00:32:01,265
and indeed, he became more handsome. 
    

380
00:32:01,265 --> 00:32:06,065
Isn't it a privilege of modern people due to medical advancement? 
    

381
00:32:06,065 --> 00:32:07,938
I thought so, too.

382
00:32:07,938 --> 00:32:10,536
Plastic surgery is a procedure that 
    

383
00:32:10,536 --> 00:32:13,732
improves one's current state to a better one.

384
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:16,565
But through this experience, I've realized

385
00:32:16,565 --> 00:32:18,465
the real value of plastic surgery

386
00:32:18,465 --> 00:32:20,965
lies in finding oneself.

387
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:24,398
Well, like me, when someone is injured by a crime or accident,

388
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,365
it's like restoring the appearance from before the injury.

389
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:30,732
Although scars like these have remained,

390
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:35,865
plastic surgery was the operation that prevented me from losing myself.

391
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:39,038
   

392
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:42,732
Well, this is it!

393
00:32:42,732 --> 00:32:45,398
Plastic surgery that enables one to regain their form before the injury;

394
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:47,665
restorative plastic surgery.

395
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:51,498
Could it be called an operation journey to find the lost self?

396
00:32:51,498 --> 00:32:54,698
Up until now, you've only treated cases with a cosmetic inclination,

397
00:32:54,698 --> 00:32:56,598
but now you intend to treat patients

398
00:32:56,598 --> 00:32:59,263
in need of surgery due to trauma or illness as well?

399
00:32:59,263 --> 00:33:00,631
Yes, that's right.

400
00:33:00,631 --> 00:33:01,862
Plastic surgery aims

401
00:33:01,862 --> 00:33:06,298
to improve the patient's physical appearance or function to a better state,

402
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:10,532
with the goal of enhancing the quality of life.

403
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:13,698
Therefore, without the boundary between reconstruction and beauty,

404
00:33:13,698 --> 00:33:16,165
let's remain faithful to the original purpose of plastic surgery.

405
00:33:16,165 --> 00:33:18,766
What led you to specialize in reconstructive plastic surgery?

406
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:21,280
Was there a particular incident that inspired you?

407
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,199
As you know, our hospital had

408
00:33:25,199 --> 00:33:29,264
provided medical support to crime victims.

409
00:33:29,264 --> 00:33:32,889
Observing patients needing reconstructive surgery due to trauma from the sidelines,

410
00:33:32,889 --> 00:33:35,965
I realized one thing for certain.

411
00:33:35,965 --> 00:33:39,332
In order to heal the wounded inner self,

412
00:33:39,332 --> 00:33:43,443
external treatment needs to come first.

413
00:33:43,443 --> 00:33:44,880
To do that,

414
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,932
we need to restore them to the appearance they had before the injury.

415
00:33:48,932 --> 00:33:51,133
And the only person who can fill this role is

416
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:54,497
surely a plastic surgeon, right?

417
00:33:54,497 --> 00:33:56,332
The graft is good.

418
00:33:56,332 --> 00:33:58,498
Moisturizing is the most important thing,

419
00:33:58,498 --> 00:34:01,018
so please apply the ointment regularly.

420
00:34:01,018 --> 00:34:03,865
And as for scar treatment,

421
00:34:03,865 --> 00:34:07,131
let's check the progress and revisit it at your next appointment.

422
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:08,833
Okay.

423
00:34:14,998 --> 00:34:19,078
You visited my father last week, didn't you?

424
00:34:19,078 --> 00:34:22,132
I saw you at the memorial park.

425
00:34:22,132 --> 00:34:24,327
It was too late, right?

426
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:26,705
I'm sorry

427
00:34:26,705 --> 00:34:29,438
for making you go through all that because of me.

428
00:34:30,164 --> 00:34:32,277
Not at all.

429
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:37,878
From now on, don't lock yourself away.

430
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:39,935
Don't dwell alone in the thought

431
00:34:39,935 --> 00:34:43,397
that you've been rejected by the world.

432
00:34:43,397 --> 00:34:45,610
Be brave...

433
00:34:46,232 --> 00:34:48,278
and move forward.

434
00:34:49,898 --> 00:34:52,103
Trust your primary care physician.

435
00:34:54,014 --> 00:34:57,724
You know that your primary care physician is quite skillful with hands, right?

436
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:02,938
The scars...

437
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:06,478
will be made as inconspicuous as possible.

438
00:35:18,398 --> 00:35:22,398
   

439
00:35:24,728 --> 00:35:27,022
 Be brave... 

440
00:35:29,551 --> 00:35:31,929
 and move forward. 

441
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:11,531
   

442
00:36:11,531 --> 00:36:13,932
Inspector Lee Min Hyeong

443
00:36:13,932 --> 00:36:17,898
has greatly contributed to the delivery of criminals in the Gayeon-dong murder case.

444
00:36:17,898 --> 00:36:20,832
With this commendation for her meritorious capture of important criminals,

445
00:36:20,832 --> 00:36:24,532
she is awarded a special promotion by one rank.

446
00:36:34,198 --> 00:36:39,032
Sergeant Seo Kang Ho, the same commendation as above.

447
00:36:48,465 --> 00:36:49,632
Salute!

448
00:36:49,632 --> 00:36:53,465
   

449
00:37:02,065 --> 00:37:04,532
Ah, the meat is grilling nicely.

450
00:37:04,532 --> 00:37:06,198
Sergeant Seo Kang Ho!

451
00:37:06,198 --> 00:37:07,898
Just like running on this grill,

452
00:37:07,898 --> 00:37:11,432
I'll run tirelessly, without rest.

453
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:13,765
I'll partner up with this one now.

454
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,744
So we can simmer together on the grill.

455
00:37:15,744 --> 00:37:18,665
Then, I will join Senior Lee Min Hyeong.

456
00:37:18,665 --> 00:37:21,078
Certainly.

457
00:37:21,078 --> 00:37:22,565
After all,

458
00:37:22,565 --> 00:37:24,598
you're a victim in the Gayeon-dong case, too,

459
00:37:24,598 --> 00:37:26,101
since your brother was wrongfully accused.

460
00:37:26,101 --> 00:37:28,598
It would be fortunate if he were only a victim.

461
00:37:28,598 --> 00:37:31,958
To someone, he might be a perpetrator.

462
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,698
Trapped in his own mistaken certainty,

463
00:37:34,698 --> 00:37:38,124
he might have created another victim like my brother.

464
00:37:38,124 --> 00:37:41,559
To say such dangerous things on the day you received an award.

465
00:37:43,732 --> 00:37:45,298
Now!

466
00:37:45,298 --> 00:37:47,032
I will become an even more careful detective.

467
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:50,432
I was startled by the toast, thinking you were declining the promotion.

468
00:37:50,432 --> 00:37:53,826
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

469
00:37:56,798 --> 00:37:58,532
Yes, this is Lee Min Hyeong.

470
00:37:58,532 --> 00:38:00,160
What?

471
00:38:00,798 --> 00:38:03,198
Yes, understood.

472
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:06,298
Everyone put down your drinks. There's been a robbery and assault incident.

473
00:38:06,298 --> 00:38:07,832
It's a robbery at a jewelry shop,

474
00:38:07,832 --> 00:38:11,432
and I heard the owner's face was slashed while trying to stop them.

475
00:38:11,432 --> 00:38:13,698
Does the victim connect to KSH?

476
00:38:13,698 --> 00:38:16,398
The chief was already talking about medical support.

477
00:38:16,398 --> 00:38:18,332
Will Director Cha Jeong Woo accept it?

478
00:38:18,332 --> 00:38:20,398
It seems he'll be very welcoming this time.

479
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,632
Come out.

480
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:24,420
Ah… darn.

481
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,890
 ­  

482
00:38:29,858 --> 00:38:32,065
You have a burn scar from six months ago,

483
00:38:32,065 --> 00:38:34,632
and you would like a consultation for a skin graft, correct?

484
00:38:34,632 --> 00:38:35,665
Yes, I will register it.

485
00:38:35,665 --> 00:38:38,458
Could you please wait a moment?

486
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,832
Yes, of course.

487
00:38:39,832 --> 00:38:42,431
Micro suturing of the face is also possible.

488
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:44,465
Yes.

489
00:38:51,804 --> 00:38:54,129
Welcome!

490
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:57,792
I… would like to get a surgery consultation.

491
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,845
Do you have an appointment?

492
00:38:58,845 --> 00:39:01,591
Which surgery are you interested in?

493
00:39:14,332 --> 00:39:16,197
Ms. Lee Joo Yeong?

494
00:39:16,197 --> 00:39:19,332
I tried to get surgery at that time, but couldn't,

495
00:39:19,332 --> 00:39:24,387
and other hospitals said that immediate surgery would be difficult.

496
00:39:26,078 --> 00:39:29,125
So, you underwent an illegal procedure?

497
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:31,905
They said the effects would be immediate…

498
00:39:31,905 --> 00:39:34,665
Goodness!

499
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:37,965
It needs to be removed as soon as possible.

500
00:39:37,965 --> 00:39:39,232
After consulting with the director,

501
00:39:39,232 --> 00:39:42,598
it would be best to schedule the surgery right away.

502
00:39:43,445 --> 00:39:46,911
What about the nose and eyes?

503
00:39:47,924 --> 00:39:49,365
Pardon?

504
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:52,098
Well, while undergoing the removal surgery,

505
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,838
I'd like to have another consultation about my nose and eyes.

506
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:58,045
I'm certain I have informed you.

507
00:39:58,045 --> 00:40:01,432
Further procedures and surgeries would be excessive.

508
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,998
Then what should I do?

509
00:40:03,998 --> 00:40:06,998
But I really needed the surgery.

510
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:11,871
Is that why you've put an unknown foreign substance in your face?

511
00:40:14,198 --> 00:40:20,098
I read an interview article that said you also perform reconstructive surgery.

512
00:40:20,098 --> 00:40:22,358
Is that something I can do?

513
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:25,025
What should I do, doctor?

514
00:40:28,398 --> 00:40:31,232
The foreign material has adhered to the normal cells,

515
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:34,098
causing the surrounding tissue to harden.

516
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,665
To minimize damage to the normal tissue,

517
00:40:36,665 --> 00:40:39,732
it seems we have to remove it via a micro-incision.

518
00:40:40,434 --> 00:40:41,632
Understood.

519
00:40:41,632 --> 00:40:44,265
Please schedule the surgery.

520
00:40:44,265 --> 00:40:46,331
And…

521
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:50,064
What about the nose and eyes?

522
00:40:52,798 --> 00:40:55,665
I'm sorry, but you said it couldn't be done.

523
00:40:55,665 --> 00:41:00,332
Still, I really need this to be done.

524
00:41:01,717 --> 00:41:05,511
Why does it have to be this face

525
00:41:05,511 --> 00:41:08,331
if it's to the extent of undergoing illegal procedures?

526
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:25,494
Ah, well…

527
00:41:44,678 --> 00:41:50,378
This person knows this face as my own.

528
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:01,865
 I'm really sorry, Si Wan. 

529
00:42:01,865 --> 00:42:03,732
 Something important has come up, 

530
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:06,798
 and I have to go down to the countryside for a few months, 

531
00:42:06,798 --> 00:42:09,820
 so I don't think I can go out today. 

532
00:42:17,032 --> 00:42:18,832
 I don't know what's going on, 

533
00:42:18,832 --> 00:42:21,098
 but I hope it's not something bad. 

534
00:42:21,098 --> 00:42:25,332
 Although, for me, it's already quite bad. 

535
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:46,298
 The conversations I've had with you 

536
00:42:46,298 --> 00:42:48,365
 were so precious to me. 

537
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,165
 My time abroad, filled with regret and loneliness, 

538
00:42:51,165 --> 00:42:54,714
 was incredibly enjoyable thanks to you. 

539
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:11,965
 I thought I'd finally be able to see your lovely face this time. 

540
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,065
 It's such a pity. 

541
00:43:43,218 --> 00:43:47,398
 When I go back this time, it seems I might only return after six months. 

542
00:43:47,398 --> 00:43:52,332
 I earnestly hope that we can surely meet then. 

543
00:43:58,465 --> 00:44:02,365
First, let's proceed with the removal of the foreign material,

544
00:44:02,365 --> 00:44:06,108
and then plan the surgery while monitoring the progress.

545
00:44:07,665 --> 00:44:12,998
I can't guarantee that surgery can change it to look like the corrected photo.

546
00:44:12,998 --> 00:44:14,665
However,

547
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:17,478
if you promise to make an effort to accept your current appearance,

548
00:44:17,478 --> 00:44:19,265
I will work with you.

549
00:44:19,265 --> 00:44:21,199
Thank you!

550
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,094
Doctor, thank you so much!

551
00:44:36,265 --> 00:44:38,032
   

552
00:44:42,298 --> 00:44:44,132
But...

553
00:44:44,132 --> 00:44:45,912
does it make sense

554
00:44:45,912 --> 00:44:47,805
to go to such lengths for someone you've never met?

555
00:44:47,805 --> 00:44:49,805
Sure.

556
00:44:50,931 --> 00:44:52,984
Have you seen that man's face?

557
00:44:52,984 --> 00:44:55,650
I heard he's incredibly sweet.

558
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,598
But it's really unexpected.

559
00:44:57,598 --> 00:45:00,880
He flatly refused during the last consultation.

560
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,398
Not really.

561
00:45:02,398 --> 00:45:05,732
What was unexpected was Dr. Cha's behavior all this time.

562
00:45:05,732 --> 00:45:07,294
Excuse me?

563
00:45:07,294 --> 00:45:11,298
Because he used to be someone who communicated and empathized with patients.

564
00:45:11,298 --> 00:45:13,732
It's not unexpected for him to return to his original place.

565
00:45:13,732 --> 00:45:15,698
It's natural, yes.

566
00:45:23,232 --> 00:45:25,332
I'm not sure what to do.

567
00:45:25,332 --> 00:45:27,568
Do you do this often for people my age?

568
00:45:27,568 --> 00:45:28,832
Of course.

569
00:45:28,832 --> 00:45:31,338
Breast reconstruction from cancer is also part of the treatment.

570
00:45:31,338 --> 00:45:34,132
In the case of you, Ms. Kim Mi Hyang,

571
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:37,344
200cc seems appropriate. What do you think?

572
00:45:37,344 --> 00:45:39,298
This small thing?

573
00:45:39,298 --> 00:45:41,963
Yes, this one is 200cc.

574
00:45:41,963 --> 00:45:45,265
No matter what I see, I prefer 400cc.

575
00:45:45,265 --> 00:45:47,689
It's hefty.

576
00:45:48,632 --> 00:45:51,898
If you add an implant that's too large at your age,

577
00:45:51,898 --> 00:45:55,165
it could cause a cervical disc or other health issues.

578
00:45:55,165 --> 00:45:58,332
We do not recommend more than 200cc.

579
00:46:01,618 --> 00:46:04,505
But we can live up to 100.

580
00:46:06,704 --> 00:46:10,704
I want to live the remaining 40 years as a woman.

581
00:46:14,393 --> 00:46:16,532
- Then I'll book your appointment for the 27th. 
 - Yes.

582
00:46:16,532 --> 00:46:18,632
- I'll see you on that day. Take care. 
 - Yes, thank you.

583
00:46:18,632 --> 00:46:19,965
Yes.

584
00:46:19,965 --> 00:46:21,471
 Don't worry. 

585
00:46:21,471 --> 00:46:25,338
 You will look feminine enough with 200cc. 

586
00:46:37,765 --> 00:46:39,732
Next schedule.

587
00:46:39,732 --> 00:46:41,432
Yes.

588
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,956
   

589
00:46:51,956 --> 00:46:53,808
   

590
00:46:56,698 --> 00:46:58,504
Oh dear, Director Cha,

591
00:46:58,504 --> 00:47:00,932
are you leaving now?

592
00:47:00,932 --> 00:47:02,032
I'll be heading home.

593
00:47:02,032 --> 00:47:03,765
Yes, go on.

594
00:47:03,765 --> 00:47:06,958
You have to come to work early tomorrow, right?

595
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:09,198
I'm off tomorrow.

596
00:47:09,198 --> 00:47:11,465
Oh, is that so?

597
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:14,532
Geez, that means tomorrow's sales are gone again.

598
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:17,279
Ah, a waste.

599
00:47:17,279 --> 00:47:19,212
Hey, Jeong Woo.

600
00:47:22,565 --> 00:47:26,632
Don't you regret coming back to plastic surgery?

601
00:47:26,632 --> 00:47:28,898
Regret?

602
00:47:28,898 --> 00:47:30,491
You see...

603
00:47:30,491 --> 00:47:35,265
I thought you'd return as an emergency doctor.

604
00:47:35,265 --> 00:47:38,132
Saving people now

605
00:47:38,132 --> 00:47:41,798
shouldn't make you feel guilty anymore.

606
00:47:42,865 --> 00:47:44,898
That's why I came here,

607
00:47:44,898 --> 00:47:47,238
to save people.

608
00:47:48,898 --> 00:47:50,932
Make them want to live.

609
00:47:50,932 --> 00:47:54,133
Trying to make them survive, no matter what.

610
00:47:57,632 --> 00:48:01,732
Did you set up a plastic surgery practice without knowing that?

611
00:48:01,732 --> 00:48:04,432
Look at this kid.

612
00:48:04,432 --> 00:48:05,832
Hurry up and leave!

613
00:48:05,832 --> 00:48:07,776
- I'm leaving. 
 - All right.

614
00:48:07,776 --> 00:48:10,409
- Go ahead. 
 - Yes.

615
00:48:16,398 --> 00:48:17,765
It's nice.

616
00:48:17,765 --> 00:48:20,832
   

617
00:48:24,932 --> 00:48:27,198
   

618
00:48:30,732 --> 00:48:33,965
   

619
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:41,860
 Thank you to the entire ✨ The Marvellous Team  ✨ 

620
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:45,081
Why make an appointment so suddenly?

621
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,240
 Channel Manager: 
 miss_rochester  

622
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,107
Thank you.

623
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:06,980
 Editors: kakashiandme (Chief Editor), 
 joysprite (General Editor), ajumma2 &amp; mindmuse (Translation Editors) 

624
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:13,970
 Chief Segmenter: 
 queen_sung_kyung 

625
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:20,870
 Segmenters: 
 ts_lambrini, hana_860, miss_rochester &amp; queen_sung_kyung 

626
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:27,820
 Cover Page Designer: 
 anryumi 

627
00:49:28,558 --> 00:49:33,191
Why… call me out of the blue for this?

628
00:49:33,191 --> 00:49:36,457
Don't people usually prepare this kind of thing?

629
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,944
Thank you for coming!

630
00:49:39,944 --> 00:49:43,298
Thank you for not forgetting to invite us.

631
00:49:43,298 --> 00:49:46,798
It's even more delightful to see both of you together.

632
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:50,232
You look well, I'm glad too.

633
00:49:50,232 --> 00:49:52,990
All these pieces are your work?

634
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:55,732
That's impressive!

635
00:49:55,732 --> 00:49:59,324
Oh, it's not even a solo exhibition, but a joint one.

636
00:49:59,324 --> 00:50:00,998
It's still a big deal,

637
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,412
seeing that you're chosen as one of this year's young artists.

638
00:50:12,271 --> 00:50:14,698
Is this painting, perhaps…

639
00:50:14,698 --> 00:50:17,081
Did you paint it after that incident?

640
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:18,398
Yes.

641
00:50:18,398 --> 00:50:20,098
After the case was resolved,

642
00:50:20,098 --> 00:50:23,231
I painted it like a diary as soon as I was discharged from the hospital.

643
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:27,825
Thank you for seeing me without any prejudice,

644
00:50:27,825 --> 00:50:31,298
because it allowed me to be confident in myself.

645
00:50:31,298 --> 00:50:34,290
If it weren't for the two of you,

646
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:39,824
neither this painting nor I would be here right now.

647
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:44,932
At the time of that incident, even more than me,

648
00:50:44,932 --> 00:50:49,019
Dr. Cha's compassion really stood out.

649
00:50:51,338 --> 00:50:54,538
That's right, I agree.

650
00:50:57,898 --> 00:51:01,658
What are you doing as the person who inspired the work?

651
00:51:04,132 --> 00:51:06,010
You should make a choice right away.

652
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:08,785
I see. I'll buy this one.

653
00:51:08,785 --> 00:51:10,598
No! You don't have to do that.

654
00:51:10,598 --> 00:51:11,798
Okay.

655
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:14,698
   

656
00:51:14,698 --> 00:51:17,632
Someone's transformation because of you.

657
00:51:17,632 --> 00:51:20,432
How does it feel to see it in person?

658
00:51:21,332 --> 00:51:23,732
I really...

659
00:51:23,732 --> 00:51:26,220
have a golden touch.

660
00:51:30,532 --> 00:51:33,065
The change in Mr. Yoon Min Soo was

661
00:51:33,065 --> 00:51:36,565
nothing more than making the scars fade away.

662
00:51:36,565 --> 00:51:41,704
Change always starts from within oneself, after all.

663
00:51:41,704 --> 00:51:46,769
It's difficult to confront oneself who needs the change.

664
00:51:48,065 --> 00:51:51,032
You've ignited that challenging spark of beginning,

665
00:51:51,032 --> 00:51:54,865
just as healing the outside cures the inside.

666
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:57,998
Isn't that why you rebranded to a plastic surgery clinic that also heals?

667
00:51:57,998 --> 00:52:00,432
It's quite hot these days.

668
00:52:02,198 --> 00:52:04,132
But…

669
00:52:04,132 --> 00:52:06,098
Are you very interested in our hospital,

670
00:52:06,098 --> 00:52:08,898
or are you interested in me?

671
00:52:14,121 --> 00:52:17,565
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo's transformation has been quite significant.

672
00:52:17,565 --> 00:52:20,391
How can you say something like that so openly?

673
00:52:20,391 --> 00:52:23,191
Ah, I'm not used to this.

674
00:52:24,865 --> 00:52:28,498
Weren't you a bit disappointed earlier?

675
00:52:28,498 --> 00:52:30,144
About what?

676
00:52:30,144 --> 00:52:32,297
The flowers.

677
00:52:32,297 --> 00:52:35,277
Did you perhaps think you were the one receiving…

678
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:38,598
No? No, that's not it.

679
00:52:38,598 --> 00:52:40,298
I don't like flowers.

680
00:52:40,298 --> 00:52:43,360
Oh, you don't like them?

681
00:52:43,932 --> 00:52:47,932
What's so good about cutting them off and watching them wither away?

682
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:51,898
I was thinking of giving you a promotion bouquet.

683
00:52:52,932 --> 00:52:54,438
Who even asks before giving them?

684
00:52:54,438 --> 00:52:57,131
Go ahead. Just surprise me then.

685
00:52:57,131 --> 00:52:59,964
Ah, never mind, I won't take it.

686
00:53:01,398 --> 00:53:05,498
How about a congratulatory drink instead of the bouquet?

687
00:53:08,498 --> 00:53:10,560
Not bad!

688
00:53:13,698 --> 00:53:15,435
What do you like?

689
00:53:15,435 --> 00:53:17,180
Me?

690
00:53:18,784 --> 00:53:20,935
I should be eating a lot of stuff.

691
00:53:20,935 --> 00:53:24,208
Yes, indulge in the expensive stuff.

692
00:53:31,488 --> 00:53:35,080
   

693
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:46,730



694
00:53:48,523 --> 00:53:51,140
♫  It's okay  ♫

695
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:54,620
♫  Whatever it was  ♫

696
00:53:55,825 --> 00:54:01,100
♫  I don't cry, no more, so  ♫

697
00:54:01,957 --> 00:54:04,362
♫  Even  ♫

698
00:54:04,362 --> 00:54:07,885
♫  In this tiresome dark night  ♫

699
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:13,348
♫  Give me your hand  ♫

700
00:54:15,409 --> 00:54:19,931
♫  Just once is enough  ♫

701
00:54:22,022 --> 00:54:27,955
♫  You're not alone anymore  ♫

702
00:54:29,148 --> 00:54:35,356
♫  You've made it through the steep road well  ♫

703
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:38,792
♫  I'll guide  ♫
