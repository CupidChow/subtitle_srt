1
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:13,625
   

2
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:20,561
   

3
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,402
   

4
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:37,053
   

5
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:49,990



6
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:01,950
   

7
00:01:10,145 --> 00:01:12,145
Anyone here?

8
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,172
Is there someone inside?

9
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:21,307
Ms. Lee Min Hyeong, you're in there. Right?

10
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:22,912
Come on, quickly!

11
00:01:22,912 --> 00:01:25,534
How…

12
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:29,324
Snap out of it, Woo Min Jae!

13
00:01:29,838 --> 00:01:32,278
This isn't our first time.

14
00:01:32,278 --> 00:01:34,084
We've done this before, right?

15
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:36,185
You can do it. Right?

16
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:45,475
It's the same this time.

17
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:47,141
We have to do it.

18
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:49,241
If we're going to do it together,

19
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:51,791
we have to do this.

20
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:53,608
Yes.

21
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:55,627
It's nothing.

22
00:01:55,627 --> 00:01:59,727
Just like that day on the rooftop, just for a moment.

23
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:02,631
You just need to give a little push.

24
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:10,232
Hurry.

25
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:28,902
My head…

26
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:33,075
Ms. Lee Min Hyeong!

27
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:34,547
Mr. Woo Min Jae,

28
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:36,957
if you grip the knife like that,

29
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,582
your holding hand will get hurt, too.

30
00:02:39,582 --> 00:02:43,217
And what you're doing right now is attempted murder.

31
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:48,308
Min Jae, why did you do that?

32
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:50,075
Teacher…

33
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:51,828
Please help me.

34
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:53,757
Right now, I…

35
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,741
Teacher…

36
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:57,908
Why are you doing this to me?

37
00:02:57,908 --> 00:03:00,175
Why?

38
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:04,541
No…

39
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,375
It wasn't me!

40
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,742
No!

41
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:09,808
- Min Jae! 
 - Are you okay?

42
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:11,941
Please follow Woo Min Jae.

43
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,175
   

44
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:18,841
- You're coming, right? 
  - Yes, I'll be there in the blink of an eye. 

45
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:20,575
   

46
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:26,690
 What brings you here? 

47
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:38,443
It seems I have some unfinished business with Ms. Cho Soo Kyeong.

48
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:46,075
 Who do you think they will listen to? 

49
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:47,375
 If I speak up, 

50
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,247
 you'll have to spend your life in prison. 

51
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:53,630
No! I don't want that!

52
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,075
 I'd rather die! 

53
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:56,241
 Just die! 

54
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:58,663
 Want to go to the police station? Shall we talk there? 

55
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:01,707
 Do you want to spend your life in prison? 

56
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,875
No, I won't go.

57
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,508
I'm not going to the police station.

58
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:11,475
I said I'm not going to the police station!

59
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:20,447
It's going to work now.

60
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:33,475
 What would happen if this got out? 

61
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:35,141
 This has to be kept secret. Okay? 

62
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,541
 Whose word do you think they'll believe? 

63
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,997
 If I speak out, you'll have to spend your life in prison. 

64
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:42,141
- Hey! 
 - Let go!

65
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:45,154
I did everything the teacher told me to!

66
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:49,608
I did everything I was told to do.

67
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:51,641
I said it wasn't me.

68
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:56,141
I'm not a rapist or anything like that.

69
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,632
This must be it, right?

70
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:05,907
Okay, found it. Check communications with Woo Min Jae.

71
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,807
Now, let's come clean.

72
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:30,492
Ah…

73
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,875
What idiot ordered delivery at that time?

74
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:40,841
 I was wrong, please forgive me just this once. 

75
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,775
 I'll do everything you want, please. 

76
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,941
 Please don't report me. 

77
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:46,608
 Let go! Won't you let go? 

78
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:48,708
 I'll never do it again, never. 

79
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,254
 Let go. Let go! 

80
00:05:51,254 --> 00:05:54,119
 Just let go! 

81
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:15,377
 You can't keep your eyes off the young ones on TV, so you can't keep your promise? 

82
00:06:16,094 --> 00:06:18,673
 Can you do that to me? 

83
00:06:18,673 --> 00:06:21,629
 What have I done to you? 

84
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:33,275
 Do it one more time. 

85
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:37,638
 And I'll make sure you rot in prison as a rapist. 

86
00:06:39,714 --> 00:06:42,518
 Delivery! 

87
00:06:42,518 --> 00:06:45,560
Even the one who made my face like this

88
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,600
wasn't that delivery guy.

89
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:52,911
You heard it, didn't you? A confession just now.

90
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:04,841
It was almost a big issue.

91
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,975
Well, thanks to that, we learned about their relationship.

92
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:09,741
Because Cho Soo Kyeong suddenly screamed,

93
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:12,941
I missed Woo Min Jae approaching.

94
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:19,841
Anyway, thanks to Dr. Cha Jeong Woo, we overcame a big crisis this time.

95
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,141
That's true.

96
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:30,408
Was the delay of the deliveryman's warrant hearing arranged by you?

97
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,441
I only delayed Woo Min Jae's assault charges.

98
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:35,124
We need to reassess the facts regarding the home invasion.

99
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:37,041
Speaking of which,

100
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,875
during the deliveryman's questioning, did you…?

101
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,481
Aren't you preserving the crime scene?

102
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:42,041
Hurry up and control it upstairs.

103
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,862
Yes, understood.

104
00:07:50,175 --> 00:07:52,047
Are you okay?

105
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:54,547
Any dizziness or pain?

106
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,381
I'm not injured enough for you to have to worry.

107
00:07:58,381 --> 00:08:02,809
Anyway, thank you for helping.

108
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:06,854
Are the police made of something different?

109
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:09,281
Or…

110
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:12,215
is it that you just don't trust me as a doctor?

111
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:15,547
That's not it.

112
00:08:15,547 --> 00:08:16,941
I'm really okay.

113
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:19,210
Why are you avoiding me?

114
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,908
It seems to be true.

115
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:27,241
Is there something bothering you?

116
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:31,660
There's nothing like that going on.

117
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:36,215
It's all written on your face.

118
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,485
   

119
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:57,514
Cho Soo Kyeong did her teacher training with Woo Min Jae, and

120
00:08:57,514 --> 00:08:59,541
because of the rumors, she cut off all personal relationships

121
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,337
and confined herself at home.

122
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:05,509
The examination showed that Woo Min Jae was psychologically and physically

123
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:08,974
dependent on Cho Soo Kyeong.

124
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:11,967
She had been gaslighting Woo Min Jae for a long time.

125
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:15,788
You applied for a warrant before the results came out?

126
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,681
It would have been disgraceful if the warrant had been rejected.

127
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:19,375
What would you have done if it had been declined?

128
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,043
Oh, Chief, it wasn't declined.

129
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:25,341
Detective Min Hyeong handled the warrant review well—

130
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:27,875
I apologize, I will correct it.

131
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,108
The direct evidence?

132
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:31,741
Yes, the fiber from Cho Soo Kyeong's slippers

133
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,641
and the traces from the shards of mirror collected from Woo Min Jae's chin

134
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,899
showed matching microfiber components.

135
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,159
That settles it.

136
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,223
They had a similar incident in the past, didn't they?

137
00:09:39,223 --> 00:09:40,975
Yes, we informed the relevant station,

138
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:43,341
and they informed us that a reinvestigation would be initiated.

139
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:45,141
Okay, got it.

140
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:47,627
Next month is the evaluation period.

141
00:09:47,627 --> 00:09:49,441
If Kim Seon Yong files a complaint about the investigation,

142
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:52,141
we're all doomed, you know?

143
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:54,040
Make sure you all wrap it up well, got it?

144
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,007
- Yes, I understand. 
 - Let's go.

145
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:02,666
Still, with the non-prosecution decision, it won't be a big issue. Right?

146
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,434
Even if it becomes a problem, it's my problem, so don't worry about it.

147
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:07,620
Just prepare the transfer documents for Cho Soo Kyeong.

148
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,553
Yes, Ma'am.

149
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,541
If you think...

150
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,686
there was any unfairness in the procedure…

151
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,108
Unfairness in the procedure?

152
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:39,920
What kind of procedure?

153
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,766
I admit the investigation process was hasty.

154
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:44,475
I should have examined the scene better.

155
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:46,610
That's not it.

156
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:51,048
You never intended to listen to me from the beginning.

157
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,775
If we're saying different things,

158
00:10:53,775 --> 00:10:57,341
even as ex-convicts, shouldn't we at least be listened to first?

159
00:10:57,341 --> 00:10:59,774
Instead of dismissing it without listening,

160
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:05,547
what can I say when you're sitting in front of me with his ears covered?

161
00:11:05,547 --> 00:11:08,080
No matter what I say, you won't hear me.

162
00:11:19,908 --> 00:11:22,880
   

163
00:11:24,914 --> 00:11:27,270
Hey! This case is about our hospital,

164
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,041
but we are hardly mentioned? Huh?

165
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,498
This time, Director Cha played a remarkable role

166
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:34,520
with his keen analysis of the injury.

167
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,032
Immediately catching the guardian's suspicious behavior!

168
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,608
Jeong Woo, if you keep this up,

169
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:42,350
won't you be heading to the police station instead of Bintan?

170
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,008
You're right.

171
00:11:44,008 --> 00:11:46,774
Why do you keep getting involved in cases?

172
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:48,801
And you seem pretty willing to do it, too.

173
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:51,635
Think whatever you want.

174
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:55,815
Hey, Jeong Woo,

175
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,315
did you grab a drink with Detective Lee afterward?

176
00:11:58,315 --> 00:11:59,315
What "after"?

177
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:00,349
Oh, you know…

178
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:01,304
Thanks to you, the case was solved.

179
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,515
Shouldn't Detective Lee have bought you a drink or something?

180
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,882
In the clink of glasses and the exchange of glances,

181
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:09,949
you come to realize the true value of getting involved in this case.

182
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:14,974
And there's this thing about you being mine but not mine, you know what I mean. ight?

183
00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:17,915
It was manipulation disguised as help.

184
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:19,349
Seriously…

185
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:20,515
Why?

186
00:12:20,515 --> 00:12:22,905
You told us to think whatever we want.

187
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:34,282
Well, anyway,

188
00:12:34,282 --> 00:12:36,482
if he put up walls for seven years,

189
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:39,882
it's about time he let someone in.

190
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:44,554
Ah, so you're just going to let Jeong Woo keep bringing victims like that?

191
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:45,949
Brother,

192
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:48,174
now is not the time to worry about someone else's love life.

193
00:12:48,174 --> 00:12:51,865
You should be worrying about running the hospital. Right?

194
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:56,735
- Just do it well. 
 - Okay.

195
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:11,390
Why didn't you tell me that Jin Seok was released on parole?

196
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:15,008
He asked me to wait.

197
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:19,508
He said he would tell you once he was settled down.

198
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:25,749
Perhaps,

199
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:29,855
do you know where he went on the day he was released?

200
00:13:30,782 --> 00:13:32,844
D-Did something happen?

201
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:35,682
What do you mean?

202
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:38,215
How could he have caused trouble when he had just been released?

203
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:40,941
He just wanted to see you.

204
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,624
   

205
00:13:58,624 --> 00:14:00,749
Even though I raised him without money,

206
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:02,275
my son knows very well

207
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:05,135
how far he can and can't go.

208
00:14:05,715 --> 00:14:09,148
Your brother must have suffered a lot because of that incident.

209
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:12,763
Mom… you

210
00:14:12,763 --> 00:14:15,652
still believe in my brother.

211
00:14:18,915 --> 00:14:21,415
Even this fabric

212
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:25,482
must be punctured by many needles before the thread can pass through and turn it into clothes.

213
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:28,249
After your heart has suffered many holes,

214
00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:31,847
only after being entwined with people around like this,

215
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:35,081
only then will you properly fulfill your role as a person.

216
00:14:35,682 --> 00:14:37,549
Thinking you are better than others,

217
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:40,855
or even if you try not to let your heart be pierced,

218
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:44,782
you're just a piece of fabric.

219
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:57,082
I was so happy to have lost 12 kg in a month,

220
00:14:57,082 --> 00:15:01,415
but the jawline collapsed and the skin sagged. It's a complete mess.

221
00:15:01,963 --> 00:15:04,749
I'll try my best to lift the sagging part under the cheek here

222
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:07,649
and improve the drooping feeling.

223
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:09,849
I'll put my complete faith in you.

224
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:13,149
It will settle in place, so don't worry.

225
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:16,215
Are you married, Doctor?

226
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,453
Well, they say men

227
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,315
remember the first time

228
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:24,615
their girlfriend wears a wedding dress, more so than at the wedding?

229
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:27,023
I was wondering if that's really true…

230
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:32,587
I'll see you in the surgery room.

231
00:15:32,587 --> 00:15:35,834
Anyway, I'm counting on you, Doctor.

232
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,220
♫  I can see it in your eyes ♫

233
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:08,360
♫  Your sad inner side ♫

234
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:15,270
♫  Will you stay for a little while? ♫

235
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:23,490
♫  I think there is no reason ♫

236
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:28,660
♫  Small injuries added up ♫

237
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:37,110
♫  And closed my heart up. Why don't you talk to me ♫

238
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,850
♫  I know you ♫

239
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:44,680
♫  I'm falling down for you ♫

240
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,160
♫  The thing I hid deep in my heart ♫

241
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,870
♫  I'll hug the hurt ♫

242
00:16:54,870 --> 00:17:00,850
♫  You always hold it in your heart ♫

243
00:17:25,741 --> 00:17:30,050
   

244
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:40,549
Yes, I found it.

245
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:44,449
The person who made a payment around 22:50 three weeks ago.

246
00:17:45,082 --> 00:17:47,920
That customer got off in front of Nakwon Apartment in Gangsin-gu…

247
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,511
 At Nam Gi Taek's house? 

248
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:55,749
It's Lee Jin Seok, who was paroled last month.

249
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:58,184
It seems he's not at the registered residence.

250
00:17:58,184 --> 00:18:01,940
 There are quite a few cases of moving residences temporarily for jobs. 

251
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,149
 Is he involved in any incident? 

252
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,715
It's because we need to verify a person related to another case.

253
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:11,449
Please contact me as soon as the actual residence is confirmed.

254
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:14,041
Yes, please take care.

255
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,150
   
  ­ 

256
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:00,661
Thank you.

257
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:07,627
Udon and soju, please.

258
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,682
I followed you after seeing you come in.

259
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:15,148
I'm also a regular here.

260
00:19:18,514 --> 00:19:20,287
Ah, yes.

261
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:24,814
Did you check out the guy who was following me?

262
00:19:24,814 --> 00:19:28,628
There are many piled-up cases.

263
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:32,437
I'll check it out slowly whenever I have time.

264
00:19:38,231 --> 00:19:40,926
That… you asked me to confirm

265
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:44,082
the release of that person you have in mind. Right?

266
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,182
Lee Jin Seok.

267
00:19:48,682 --> 00:19:51,282
Yes, Lee Jin Seok.

268
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:55,145
What are you going to do after confirming that?

269
00:19:56,515 --> 00:19:59,849
If the police take measures to ensure he never shows up around here again,

270
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:01,449
there's no need for you to find him—

271
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:03,491
Seven years ago,

272
00:20:04,222 --> 00:20:07,000
a month before we would get married,

273
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:11,439
she was killed by that man.

274
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:20,049
Even if I take revenge,

275
00:20:22,582 --> 00:20:25,249
isn't that something I must do?

276
00:20:31,508 --> 00:20:33,965
I'll just have one drink as well.

277
00:20:42,382 --> 00:20:44,710
Ugh, bitter!

278
00:20:53,214 --> 00:20:56,087
Losing someone who was to become family…

279
00:20:56,927 --> 00:20:59,958
must be truly painful and sad.

280
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,015
However, family can really

281
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,115
be troublesome if you have them,

282
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:13,382
and troublesome if you don't, it seems.

283
00:21:15,582 --> 00:21:20,536
For me, having a family is truly a source of distress.

284
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:25,250
You are distressed because you have one…

285
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:41,381
That's true, I feel the same way.

286
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:44,194
What? You're laughing?

287
00:21:44,194 --> 00:21:47,240
You know how to laugh? I thought you didn't know how.

288
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,911
I'm not such an emotionally stunted person.

289
00:21:52,682 --> 00:21:55,282
Yes, that's right.

290
00:21:55,282 --> 00:21:57,768
I see.

291
00:21:57,768 --> 00:21:59,620
But…

292
00:22:00,421 --> 00:22:02,927
So, what?

293
00:22:02,927 --> 00:22:05,449
If you confirm that person's release,

294
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,695
what do you intend to do?

295
00:22:07,695 --> 00:22:10,628
- Revenge or some— 
 - That's what you said.

296
00:22:11,082 --> 00:22:14,505
Because of his grudge against me,

297
00:22:14,505 --> 00:22:17,241
he could have faked Mr. Nam Gi Taek's death.

298
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:19,994
If by any chance that death

299
00:22:19,994 --> 00:22:22,607
was really because of me…

300
00:22:23,882 --> 00:22:26,782
Why would that be because of you?

301
00:22:27,482 --> 00:22:29,949
There's no direct connection with you.

302
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,415
It's not a medical accident, nor is it a matter that requires legal liability.

303
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:35,031
So, why stick "because" onto it? Why would you?

304
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:36,449
If there's any wrongdoing, it's nonsensical

305
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:39,784
to be blaming the victim's boyfriend. That person, Lee Jin Seok…

306
00:22:46,474 --> 00:22:51,188
Ah, anyway, don't blame yourself.

307
00:22:51,188 --> 00:22:54,400
You're blaming yourself for nothing.

308
00:23:01,449 --> 00:23:03,215
Are you leaving?

309
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,615
Half a glass is enough.

310
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:19,897
 I'll just have half a glass. 

311
00:23:23,328 --> 00:23:25,361
 Then, cheers! 

312
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:53,282
Min Hyeong,

313
00:23:53,282 --> 00:23:55,582
if you're going to meddle,

314
00:23:55,582 --> 00:24:00,982
you must consider the person and situation when you do it!

315
00:24:03,949 --> 00:24:06,344
I'm sorry.

316
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:09,500
   

317
00:24:17,694 --> 00:24:21,058
Hello? Ms. Hyo Joo, what's the matter?

318
00:24:46,205 --> 00:24:47,549
Lee Jin Seok was released, right?

319
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:48,949
   

320
00:24:48,949 --> 00:24:51,915
They say he was paroled on the 10th of last month.

321
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:53,882
Are you okay?

322
00:24:53,882 --> 00:24:54,994
Did you find out anything else?

323
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,482
While in prison,

324
00:24:56,482 --> 00:24:58,982
he kept saying he wasn't properly investigated

325
00:24:58,982 --> 00:25:01,188
because of the victim's boyfriend.

326
00:25:01,188 --> 00:25:03,935
He is saying...

327
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:07,235
- he didn't do it? 
  - Don't pay attention to that 

328
00:25:07,235 --> 00:25:08,982
 and let's just report it first. 

329
00:25:08,982 --> 00:25:10,549
Looking at the investigation material from that time,

330
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:12,782
they say Lee Jin Seok's sister is a cop.

331
00:25:12,782 --> 00:25:15,182
Let's find this person first to make them aware—

332
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:17,182
 Chae Kyeong, 

333
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:22,549
I need to catch that rat first.

334
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:24,547
   

335
00:25:24,547 --> 00:25:27,580
Okay, I'll look into it.

336
00:25:55,582 --> 00:25:59,015
You're saying this was found in the corner of the balcony?

337
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,697
But why…?

338
00:26:00,697 --> 00:26:04,228
When the crime scene officer was examining the scene,

339
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:08,295
they asked if it was my father's. I said yes and kept it.

340
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:12,314
However,

341
00:26:12,314 --> 00:26:16,268
when I was about to put it with my father's keepsakes…

342
00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:19,615
   

343
00:26:19,615 --> 00:26:21,682
I'm sorry, but...

344
00:26:21,682 --> 00:26:25,092
I thought it was my dad's, so I cleaned it.

345
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:30,235
Just in case, I will investigate it.

346
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,615
When I looked into it,

347
00:26:32,615 --> 00:26:36,382
it seemed like some kind of doctors' volunteer group.

348
00:26:36,382 --> 00:26:40,082
They apparently did volunteer work at the prison where my dad was.

349
00:26:41,703 --> 00:26:43,574
The man you showed me in the photo

350
00:26:43,574 --> 00:26:46,396
was also in the same prison as my father.

351
00:26:48,695 --> 00:26:52,581
I'm not sure who it belongs to…

352
00:26:52,581 --> 00:26:54,948
However, just in case.

353
00:26:59,946 --> 00:27:01,701
 The man you showed me in the photo 

354
00:27:01,701 --> 00:27:04,082
 was also in the same prison as my father. 

355
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:06,949
On the day the released Lee Jin Seok came here,

356
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:09,541
Nam Gi Taek died.

357
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:14,748
And an item presumed to be Lee Jin Seok's was found on the home veranda.

358
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:21,582
   

359
00:27:21,582 --> 00:27:24,843
 I have confirmed Lee Jin Seok's residence. 

360
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:28,148
 - I got the address.  
 - Really? Where is it?

361
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:31,182
No, send it through text message.

362
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,341
 However, do you have to meet him? 

363
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:35,782
Yeah, do me a favor. Send it by text.

364
00:27:35,782 --> 00:27:38,349
There is a first-time patient, saying she would like to get filler treatment.

365
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:40,692
Do you have time?

366
00:27:42,215 --> 00:27:44,215
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

367
00:27:44,215 --> 00:27:46,274
Director Han is here, right?

368
00:27:46,274 --> 00:27:48,182
Yes, I'll do it, sure.

369
00:27:48,182 --> 00:27:50,115
I'll do the consultation right away in the treatment room.

370
00:27:50,115 --> 00:27:51,482
Yes.

371
00:27:51,482 --> 00:27:53,149
What is Director Cha doing?

372
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:57,502
These days, with surgeries getting canceled, he should have a lot of time.

373
00:27:57,502 --> 00:27:59,482
Just because he's removed scars from a few crime victims,

374
00:27:59,482 --> 00:28:01,829
does he think cosmetic surgery is insignificant or what?

375
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:04,149
He left for the day, saying he had work to do.

376
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,515
Hmm, he went early.

377
00:28:05,515 --> 00:28:09,281
- Hmm? What? 
 - Yes.

378
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:11,315
But he was supposed to have dinner with me tonight.

379
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:14,270
We scheduled it a month ago, and he just went home? Why?

380
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,887
I wouldn't know

381
00:28:15,887 --> 00:28:18,302
since it was something between you two.

382
00:28:19,274 --> 00:28:21,174
Why?

383
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:30,255
How do I get him to come later?

384
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:33,453
He can't be controlled.

385
00:28:34,182 --> 00:28:36,515
Just a prick.

386
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:41,354
You endured it well.

387
00:28:41,354 --> 00:28:43,588
I'll hold it.

388
00:28:48,615 --> 00:28:50,660
It's done.

389
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:53,814
Maybe, because your lip line is so pretty,

390
00:28:53,814 --> 00:28:57,361
the volume looks incredibly charming.

391
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:00,249
Nurse Choi, please give her the mirror.

392
00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:02,315
Here, take a look.

393
00:29:06,648 --> 00:29:09,915
But the chin and forehead are a bit disappointing.

394
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,315
Why?

395
00:29:11,315 --> 00:29:14,582
If you look here, since the lip volume has increased

396
00:29:14,582 --> 00:29:17,482
the chin and forehead look somewhat subdued in comparison.

397
00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:19,728
If you added a bit more here,

398
00:29:19,728 --> 00:29:24,282
it will look more three-dimensional and the lines will look more refined.

399
00:29:24,282 --> 00:29:27,749
Shall we add a bit more with an additional procedure?

400
00:29:48,531 --> 00:29:50,696
Why are you here?

401
00:29:52,472 --> 00:29:54,852
Why did you come here, Dr. Cha Jeong Woo?

402
00:29:54,852 --> 00:29:57,387
To meet Lee Jin Seok.

403
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,585
What are you going to do by meeting him?

404
00:29:59,585 --> 00:30:02,219
Are you going to take personal revenge or something?

405
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:08,485
A person who has been sentenced and served his time,

406
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:11,219
and continues to deny the crime.

407
00:30:11,219 --> 00:30:12,752
What does that mean?

408
00:30:12,752 --> 00:30:15,075
Did you meet Lee Jin Seok?

409
00:30:16,818 --> 00:30:19,170
   

410
00:30:23,552 --> 00:30:25,152
 Just wait. 

411
00:30:25,152 --> 00:30:27,252
 Because I have something prepared as well. 

412
00:30:27,252 --> 00:30:29,252
Let's say he can claim

413
00:30:29,252 --> 00:30:31,819
he didn't do it, and it's unfair.

414
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:34,819
But why does he need to direct those words at me?

415
00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:37,181
What's his intention?

416
00:30:40,771 --> 00:30:43,643
How about the investigation on Mr. Nam Gi Taek?

417
00:30:43,643 --> 00:30:47,325
Has it been confirmed that Lee Jin Seok was involved?

418
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:52,431
I'm still looking into it,

419
00:30:52,431 --> 00:30:55,633
but there's nothing certain yet.

420
00:30:55,633 --> 00:31:00,071
If you're not here because that has been confirmed, then why are you here?

421
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:12,252
 Hey, Jeong Woo, where are you? Hurry to the hospital, will you? 

422
00:31:12,252 --> 00:31:13,359
What happened?

423
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,952
 I did the filler treatment for you, and the situation now… I really… 

424
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:18,085
What's the situation? What happened…

425
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,995
Hello?

426
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:29,033
Contact me if you find Lee Jin Seok.

427
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:44,585
Look at that expression. Look at it, will you?

428
00:31:44,585 --> 00:31:48,603
That refreshed face, satisfied with a perfect procedure, huh?

429
00:31:48,603 --> 00:31:50,285
You saw it, right?

430
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:53,352
Hey, Jeong Woo, my molding today was absolutely fantastic.

431
00:31:53,352 --> 00:31:55,951
I've made this chin-end as a V without a scalpel, you know?

432
00:31:55,951 --> 00:31:59,052
I thought there was a problem.

433
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:01,752
Ah, that's why you ran out so startled?

434
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:04,585
Hey, how can you forget our appointment and leave work early?

435
00:32:04,585 --> 00:32:06,119
Especially an appointment made a month ago.

436
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,852
And then you use an accident as an excuse?

437
00:32:07,852 --> 00:32:09,852
Are you someone who just comes when called?

438
00:32:09,852 --> 00:32:11,085
Besides,

439
00:32:11,085 --> 00:32:12,819
I just trailed off at the end of my sentence.

440
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:15,152
I never even brought up the "ac" of "accident."

441
00:32:15,152 --> 00:32:19,252
It's annoying that you misinterpreted it as an "accident," you know?

442
00:32:19,252 --> 00:32:20,524
- Did you forget? 
 - Huh?

443
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:21,819
Last year, while you were inserting fillers…

444
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:24,998
Hey, it's late. Hurry up and leave. Let's go.

445
00:32:26,752 --> 00:32:28,960
- But to where? 
 - Huh?

446
00:32:29,452 --> 00:32:32,044
I'll set the navigation, you can just follow it.

447
00:32:32,044 --> 00:32:33,867
Okay.

448
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:43,415
The only fingerprints collected from the keychain belonged to Ms. Nam Hyo Joo.

449
00:32:43,415 --> 00:32:47,785
I checked to see if there might be other DNA between the stitches,

450
00:32:47,785 --> 00:32:49,801
but there was nothing.

451
00:32:51,185 --> 00:32:52,219
Understood.

452
00:32:52,219 --> 00:32:54,825
- Thank you for your hard work. 
 - Yes.

453
00:32:58,295 --> 00:32:59,681
   

454
00:32:59,681 --> 00:33:02,950
   

455
00:33:09,152 --> 00:33:11,319
Madam, you remember that, don't you?

456
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:14,719
Was it when I was in the first year of high school or the second?

457
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:18,285
That time when Jeong Woo and I were going to make a birthday cake for you,

458
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:19,685
we put it in the oven and

459
00:33:19,685 --> 00:33:22,798
ended up going out to play basketball because we couldn't wait,

460
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:25,719
and it all burned up, setting off the fire alarms,

461
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:28,097
triggering all the sprinklers.

462
00:33:28,097 --> 00:33:31,189
Madam, how many fire trucks came that time?

463
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:35,587
Just thinking about that time makes it seem so distant, right?

464
00:33:35,587 --> 00:33:37,571
Did that really happen?

465
00:33:37,571 --> 00:33:40,166
Jeong Woo, don't you remember? Huh?

466
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:45,655
What? You got nothing to say?

467
00:33:48,477 --> 00:33:51,577
I came to say goodbye before leaving the country.

468
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:54,445
Because I have to see you at least once.

469
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:01,352
Thank you for the meal.

470
00:34:02,004 --> 00:34:05,459
Are you running away to Bintan?

471
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:08,152
Dwelling in the past, reminiscing about someone who's gone.

472
00:34:08,152 --> 00:34:09,385
Are you trying to waste your life?

473
00:34:09,385 --> 00:34:10,968
Enough with that.

474
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:15,011
Let's get through this good day well. Hey, sit down too.

475
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,419
To you, she might have been a non-existent person from the start, Mother,

476
00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:20,388
but to me, not for a single moment...

477
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:24,391
has she ever been a non-existent person.

478
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:28,119
Hey, stop it Jeong Woo. Okay? Hey!

479
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,984
Hey, where are you going? Hey, Cha Jeong Woo!

480
00:34:30,984 --> 00:34:33,032
Hey, Cha Jeong Woo!

481
00:34:33,032 --> 00:34:35,920
Hey, do some damage control.

482
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,889
Just how long will it…

483
00:34:39,685 --> 00:34:42,419
Madam, please don't worry too much about it, it's just something I said.

484
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:44,791
He is being sensitive again today.

485
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,591
It was good, right?

486
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:54,352
Hello, this is Yoon Seo Hee.

487
00:34:54,352 --> 00:34:56,898
Yes, who is this?

488
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:04,019
What do you need from me, Detective?

489
00:35:05,445 --> 00:35:09,285
Jeong Woo! Hey, Cha Jeong Woo! You!

490
00:35:09,285 --> 00:35:12,585
Are you really just going to leave like this?

491
00:35:12,585 --> 00:35:15,152
Please check the partner doctor's schedule.

492
00:35:15,152 --> 00:35:17,892
So that approval comes quickly.

493
00:35:17,892 --> 00:35:20,134
It's true, he's fleeing.

494
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:30,085
If you run away because it hurts every time your wounds are touched,

495
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:32,493
it won't hurt anymore?

496
00:35:33,148 --> 00:35:35,747
You know that letting it fester will only lead to inflammation

497
00:35:35,747 --> 00:35:38,074
till it bursts, you frustrating brat.

498
00:35:38,074 --> 00:35:40,052
Hey, you might as well

499
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:42,619
tell her everything you should and shouldn't say.

500
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:47,428
Expose all those painful things inside, and stop pretending to be fine.

501
00:35:50,718 --> 00:35:52,519
I know

502
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:56,800
that your past isn't something that can be easily forgotten.

503
00:35:59,964 --> 00:36:03,179
I have no memories that can be forgotten,

504
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:07,491
that's why I can't forget.

505
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:11,152
See you at the hospital.

506
00:36:11,152 --> 00:36:13,076
Hey, Cha…

507
00:36:16,731 --> 00:36:19,525
Madam, please don't worry too much about Jeong Woo.

508
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:23,852
Besides, he's probably worrying about it again after all that.

509
00:36:23,852 --> 00:36:26,585
Since it's your birthday.

510
00:36:27,412 --> 00:36:29,585
Detective Lee?

511
00:36:29,585 --> 00:36:32,164
Director Han, why are you here?

512
00:36:32,164 --> 00:36:35,425
Are you the detective who called?

513
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:38,218
What is the matter you wanted to discuss with me?

514
00:36:41,486 --> 00:36:45,465
But if you take fingerprints from this, you can quickly find out who it is. Right?

515
00:36:45,465 --> 00:36:47,852
You know, like the DNA or something?

516
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:51,785
Unfortunately, the person who found it accidentally wiped off the fingerprints.

517
00:36:51,785 --> 00:36:54,904
Ah… I see…

518
00:36:54,904 --> 00:36:57,852
I heard that you organized the Good Hands Medical Association volunteering.

519
00:36:57,852 --> 00:37:02,485
Yes, that's the souvenir from the volunteer service at Cheongsoo Prison last year.

520
00:37:02,485 --> 00:37:05,852
Do you happen to have a list of the inmates who received medical treatment at that time?

521
00:37:08,885 --> 00:37:10,052
Ah, I'm sorry, but

522
00:37:10,052 --> 00:37:12,952
those people are quite reluctant to disclose their personal information.

523
00:37:12,952 --> 00:37:16,285
We often provide medical care without knowing their names.

524
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:19,119
Ah, I am also part of the volunteer group.

525
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:23,244
Then,

526
00:37:26,352 --> 00:37:28,690
do you remember this person?

527
00:37:29,285 --> 00:37:31,152
He was an inmate at that time.

528
00:37:31,152 --> 00:37:34,441
I wanted to know if he was part of the volunteer program.

529
00:37:35,398 --> 00:37:36,758
This person…

530
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:38,865
Why? Do you know him?

531
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:40,525
Hye Jin…

532
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:42,363
What?

533
00:37:43,572 --> 00:37:46,977
Do you know about… that incident?

534
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:51,547
Ah, she's Director Cha's mother.

535
00:37:52,485 --> 00:37:55,647
Why are the police looking for this person?

536
00:37:57,219 --> 00:37:59,085
It's confidential to the investigation, so I can't say.

537
00:37:59,085 --> 00:38:01,120
Has this person been released?

538
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,719
Thank you for your time.

539
00:38:13,985 --> 00:38:15,252
   

540
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:18,052
   

541
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:24,452
   

542
00:38:24,452 --> 00:38:27,985
Madam, I'll be going in now.

543
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:41,285
Yes, please speak, Ms. Hyo Joo.

544
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,019
 How about 

545
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:45,319
 asking the lady next door about that man? 

546
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:46,885
Ah, that's a good idea.

547
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:49,199
Detective!

548
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,825
She said she saw the perpetrator on the day of the incident, right?

549
00:38:52,825 --> 00:38:56,149
I'll leave right away. Yes.

550
00:38:57,623 --> 00:38:58,452
What's the matter?

551
00:38:58,452 --> 00:39:01,752
Hm… the person in the photo you just showed us.

552
00:39:01,752 --> 00:39:05,219
That person was in the same prison as the one who committed suicide because of Director Cha.

553
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:07,023
I'm already aware of that.

554
00:39:07,023 --> 00:39:08,719
Both of them participated in our program

555
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,745
and were model prisoners.

556
00:39:10,745 --> 00:39:13,463
I just checked with a group photo.

557
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,985
- Yes, thank you. 
 - Yes.

558
00:39:24,185 --> 00:39:27,270
   

559
00:39:35,252 --> 00:39:39,052
 The subscriber is not available… 

560
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:45,452
I'm not sure about the face.

561
00:39:45,452 --> 00:39:48,968
I just saw him passing.

562
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:53,527
There might be parts you saw, but don't remember.

563
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:57,510
Even the smallest detail could help, if you mention it.

564
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:02,551
However, I really don't know.

565
00:40:02,551 --> 00:40:05,282
It was just too dark.

566
00:40:11,611 --> 00:40:13,690
Well…

567
00:40:14,652 --> 00:40:19,752
I think I can only help with the dashcam footage.

568
00:40:20,538 --> 00:40:22,611
Regarding this matter,

569
00:40:22,611 --> 00:40:26,619
I'd prefer it if you didn't come looking for me again.

570
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:30,090
Sure, thank you for your cooperation.

571
00:40:35,898 --> 00:40:38,753
I'll find out more and get back to you.

572
00:41:19,531 --> 00:41:21,764
 Jeong Woo… 

573
00:41:23,352 --> 00:41:25,985
 I'm sorry… 

574
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:27,785
 I should have told you earlier. 

575
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,082
 This is the 112 emergency center. 

576
00:41:29,082 --> 00:41:30,219
 Please help. 

577
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:32,774
 My girlfriend is alone at home, but— 

578
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,275
 Hye Jin… 

579
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:54,144
 Are you okay? 

580
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,631
 Bring the stretcher quickly! 

581
00:41:57,619 --> 00:41:59,919
 Please say something. 

582
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:05,027
 What's your name? 

583
00:42:05,027 --> 00:42:07,099
 Are you okay? 

584
00:42:18,352 --> 00:42:20,452
 Jeong Woo! 

585
00:42:20,452 --> 00:42:22,485
 - Are you really awake now? 
 - Jeong Woo! 

586
00:42:22,485 --> 00:42:24,601
 What about Hye Jin? 

587
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:28,711
 While looking at dresses… 

588
00:42:29,885 --> 00:42:32,734
 Hye Jin must be worried. 

589
00:42:42,736 --> 00:42:45,052
 Why did you do that? Why? 

590
00:42:45,052 --> 00:42:48,171
 Why did you do that? Why? 

591
00:42:48,171 --> 00:42:50,590
 Ah, let go! 

592
00:43:02,104 --> 00:43:04,161
Hey, Director Cha,

593
00:43:06,352 --> 00:43:09,536
do you feel a bit better after doing that?

594
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:14,719
Why are you here?

595
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:19,268
Did you have to do that in front of your mother?

596
00:43:19,268 --> 00:43:21,778
You're her only son, isn't that too much?

597
00:43:21,778 --> 00:43:24,252
I know.

598
00:43:24,252 --> 00:43:26,822
Oh, I met Detective Lee.

599
00:43:28,885 --> 00:43:30,985
Why that detective?

600
00:43:34,557 --> 00:43:37,477
The guy who tailed you in the parking lot

601
00:43:37,477 --> 00:43:39,516
is Lee Jin Seok, right?

602
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,174
What did you hear?

603
00:43:41,174 --> 00:43:42,852
Did you know that person was released?

604
00:43:42,852 --> 00:43:44,191
What did Detective Lee say?

605
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:46,399
Ah, she was desperately looking for him

606
00:43:46,399 --> 00:43:49,871
because of Mr. Nam Gi Taek's case.

607
00:43:49,871 --> 00:43:53,182
Wait, stay still for a second.

608
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:58,128
Knowing that these two were prison mates,

609
00:43:58,128 --> 00:43:59,985
she even came to your mother's hospital.

610
00:43:59,985 --> 00:44:01,052
   

611
00:44:01,052 --> 00:44:03,985
Seeing that the relationship between them is confirmed,

612
00:44:03,985 --> 00:44:07,585
it's clear that Lee Jin Seok was involved in Nam Gi Taek's death.

613
00:44:07,585 --> 00:44:11,085
She knew about the relationship between them?

614
00:44:11,085 --> 00:44:13,501
Did she say something different to you?

615
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,795
- I'll go first. 
 - Hey…

616
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,008
Somehow, I feel anxious again.

617
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:53,252
Isn't that the guy you saw the other day?

618
00:44:53,252 --> 00:44:55,685
The phone remains switched off.

619
00:44:55,685 --> 00:44:58,444
Check the last known location where it was turned off.

620
00:44:58,444 --> 00:45:01,811
And request work cooperation for real-time location tracking.

621
00:45:01,811 --> 00:45:03,585
What case is it?

622
00:45:03,585 --> 00:45:06,755
Is it related to the internal investigation of Mr. Nam Gi Taek?

623
00:45:13,871 --> 00:45:17,846
Do you want to eat chicken together?

624
00:45:19,298 --> 00:45:21,970
You don't want to be alone, do you?

625
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:27,340
I'm going to leave this place.

626
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:32,960
I'm planning to go to a relative's house abroad and look for a job.

627
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,734
Being a witness to the incident

628
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:38,845
feels somewhat unsettling.

629
00:45:43,898 --> 00:45:46,094
I'm sorry.

630
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:49,213
Hey,

631
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:52,944
it's not that I'm saying this to get an apology from you.

632
00:45:53,861 --> 00:45:59,203
If you have somewhere to go, you should look into it.

633
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:04,885
Wherever you live,

634
00:46:04,885 --> 00:46:08,965
it's not an impediment to your drawing or anything.

635
00:46:35,617 --> 00:46:38,105
I am…

636
00:46:38,105 --> 00:46:42,119
a little scared of this place now.

637
00:47:47,285 --> 00:47:49,131
   

638
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:09,219
   

639
00:48:39,859 --> 00:48:42,071
   

640
00:48:43,752 --> 00:48:45,019
   

641
00:48:45,019 --> 00:48:47,819
   

642
00:48:48,419 --> 00:48:52,121
   

643
00:48:57,785 --> 00:48:59,085
   

644
00:48:59,085 --> 00:49:03,519
 Looking at the investigation material from that time, Lee Jin Seok's sister is a cop. 

645
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:05,619
 I have someone in mind. 

646
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:08,271
 The person who did this to you. 

647
00:49:08,271 --> 00:49:09,723
 What? 

648
00:49:09,723 --> 00:49:11,452
 Why are you so surprised? 

649
00:49:11,452 --> 00:49:14,084
 A month before we would get married, 

650
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:16,152
 she was killed by that man. 

651
00:49:16,152 --> 00:49:19,322
 A person who has been sentenced and served his time, 

652
00:49:19,322 --> 00:49:22,077
 and continues to deny the crime. 

653
00:49:22,077 --> 00:49:23,411
 What does that mean? 

654
00:49:23,411 --> 00:49:25,620
 Did you meet Lee Jin Seok? 

655
00:49:34,419 --> 00:49:36,219
Are you not going home?

656
00:49:36,219 --> 00:49:38,852
You should sleep at home.

657
00:49:38,852 --> 00:49:41,519
This girl really…

658
00:49:42,571 --> 00:49:45,005
She won't wake up, huh?

659
00:50:04,845 --> 00:50:06,878
Lee Jin Seok!

660
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:24,185
You seem flustered.

661
00:50:24,185 --> 00:50:26,916
Because it's not the person you were expecting.

662
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:30,744
What happened?

663
00:50:30,744 --> 00:50:32,444
Why?

664
00:50:34,391 --> 00:50:37,152
Are you afraid

665
00:50:37,152 --> 00:50:39,352
I did something to your brother?

666
00:50:39,352 --> 00:50:40,419
Hey, Dr. Cha Jeong Woo—

667
00:50:40,419 --> 00:50:43,701
How long were you planning to deceive me?

668
00:50:49,478 --> 00:50:51,845
I need to find out...

669
00:50:52,805 --> 00:50:56,298
the reason Lee Jin Seok hangs around you

670
00:50:56,298 --> 00:50:58,798
and about the death of Mr. Nam Gi Taek.

671
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:03,212
As the family of the offender, I thought apologizing and feeling sorry

672
00:51:03,212 --> 00:51:05,819
was something I could do later.

673
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:08,316
So, what did you find out?

674
00:51:09,819 --> 00:51:11,752
If you secretly investigate this by yourself,

675
00:51:11,752 --> 00:51:14,371
what will it matter if you find something?

676
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:15,252
Isn't it over if you just cover it up?

677
00:51:15,252 --> 00:51:19,352
I'm sorry for dragging out the time without finding any solid evidence,

678
00:51:19,885 --> 00:51:22,552
but don't rashly presume and distort someone's intentions.

679
00:51:22,552 --> 00:51:25,933
Why did Lee Jin Seok appear before me?

680
00:51:25,933 --> 00:51:28,871
Why does he deny the crime, even after being in jail?

681
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:31,430
Was it really to get revenge on me…

682
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:36,725
that he killed Nam Gi Taek?

683
00:51:43,691 --> 00:51:45,591
Find out...

684
00:51:46,345 --> 00:51:49,078
where Lee Jin Seok is right now.

685
00:51:54,697 --> 00:51:57,592
You have to find him before I do.

686
00:52:57,019 --> 00:52:59,646
 Hello? 112 Emergency… 

687
00:53:33,885 --> 00:53:35,887
   
 It's that man. 

688
00:53:35,887 --> 00:53:38,752
 That man from the day the neighbor died. 

689
00:53:38,752 --> 00:53:40,919
 He's in my house right now. 

690
00:53:40,919 --> 00:53:42,152
Lee Jin Seok?

691
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,204
 Hyo Joo is in danger. 

692
00:53:44,204 --> 00:53:46,752
 Please help, I beg you! 

693
00:53:46,752 --> 00:53:48,811
Miss Hyo Joo!

694
00:54:05,185 --> 00:54:07,085
Code Zero is occurring with Ms. Nam Hyo Joo right now.

695
00:54:07,085 --> 00:54:10,231
Request urgent dispatch to Nakwon Apartment in Gangsin-gu.

696
00:54:11,811 --> 00:54:14,719
Are you talking about Nam Hyo Joo, Nam Gi Taek's daughter?

697
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:16,780
We'll talk about it later.

698
00:55:09,385 --> 00:55:11,492
Stop it!

699
00:55:26,685 --> 00:55:29,319
   

700
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:42,790



701
00:55:44,019 --> 00:55:47,855
♫  I can see it in your eyes ♫

702
00:55:47,855 --> 00:55:49,113
 Blood pressure is dropping. 

703
00:55:49,113 --> 00:55:50,225
 It's cardiac arrest. 

704
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:51,946
 Two, three. 

705
00:55:51,946 --> 00:55:54,913
 It seems Miss Hyo Joo scratched the perpetrator's wrist while resisting. 

706
00:55:54,913 --> 00:55:57,446
 If he really wanted to take revenge on me, 

707
00:55:57,446 --> 00:55:59,035
 he should have pointed the knife at me. 

708
00:55:59,035 --> 00:56:00,488
 Please issue a warrant for Lee Jin Seok. 

709
00:56:00,488 --> 00:56:01,546
 You need to stay away from this case. 

710
00:56:01,546 --> 00:56:02,746
 What's so difficult? It isn't difficult at all! 

711
00:56:02,746 --> 00:56:04,706
 Please call for Lawyer Park Chae Kyeong just once, all right? 

712
00:56:04,706 --> 00:56:07,452
 What if there is a different culprit? 

713
00:56:07,452 --> 00:56:09,213
 A retrial? 

714
00:56:09,213 --> 00:56:11,446
 What do you want to hear that made you chase after me this late at night? 

715
00:56:11,446 --> 00:56:14,013
 What's the real reason you're doing this to me? 

716
00:56:14,013 --> 00:56:16,398
 You know, don't you, who that guy is. 

717
00:56:16,398 --> 00:56:17,653
 You know, don't you? 

718
00:56:17,653 --> 00:56:23,510
♫  Why don't you talk to me  ♫
