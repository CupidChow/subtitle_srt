[Jeon Bae Soo]

5
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:12,345
Are you there?

6
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,172
Is there someone inside?

7
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:21,307
Mr. Lee Min Hyeong, you're in there, right?

8
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:22,912
Come on, quickly!

9
00:01:22,912 --> 00:01:25,134
How…

10
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:29,424
Snap out of it, Woo Min Jae!

11
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:32,378
This isn't our first time.

12
00:01:32,378 --> 00:01:34,184
We've done this before.

13
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:36,185
You can do it, right?

14
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:45,475
It's the same this time.

15
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:47,141
We have to do it.

16
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:49,241
If we're going to do it together,

17
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:51,691
we have to do this.

18
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:53,608
Yes.

19
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:55,627
It's nothing.

20
00:01:55,627 --> 00:01:59,827
Just like that day on the rooftop,
just for a moment.

21
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:02,331
You just need to give a little push.

22
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:10,632
Hurry.

23
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:29,002
My head…

24
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:33,075
Ms. Lee Min Hyeong!

25
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:34,647
Mr. Woo Min Jae,

26
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:36,957
if you grip the knife like that,

27
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,582
your holding hand will get hurt, too.

28
00:02:39,582 --> 00:02:43,317
And you, right now, it's attempted murder.

29
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:48,308
Min Jae, why did you do that?

30
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:49,875
Teacher…

31
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,828
Please help me.

32
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:53,757
Right now, I…

33
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,741
Teacher…

34
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:57,908
Why are you doing this to me?

35
00:02:57,908 --> 00:03:00,075
Why?

36
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:04,541
No…

37
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,375
It wasn't me!

38
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,742
No!

39
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:09,808
- Min Jae!
- Are you okay?

40
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:11,741
Please follow Woo Min Jae.

[Seo Gang Ho]

44
00:03:23,307 --> 00:03:26,590
What brings you here?

45
00:03:34,308 --> 00:03:38,243
It seems I have some unfinished
business with Ms. Cho Soo Kyung.

46
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:46,075
Who do you think they will listen?

47
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:47,375
If I speak up,

48
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,247
you'll have to spend your life in prison.

49
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:53,630
No! I don't want that!

50
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,075
I'd rather die!

51
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:56,241
Just die!

52
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:58,663
Want to go to the police
station? Shall we talk there?

53
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:01,707
Do you want to spend your life in prison?

54
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,875
No, I won't go.

55
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,508
I'm not going to the police station.

56
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:11,375
I said I'm not going to the police station!

57
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:20,447
It's going to work now.

58
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:33,475
What would happen if this gets out?

59
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:35,141
This is an absolute secret, okay?

60
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,541
Whose word do you think they'll believe?

61
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,997
If I speak out, you'll have to
spend your life in prison.

62
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:42,141
- Hey!
- Let go!

63
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:45,154
I did everything the teacher told me to!

64
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:49,608
I did everything I was told to do.

65
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:51,641
It wasn't me.

66
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:56,141
I'm not a rapist or anything like that.

67
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,832
This must be it, right?

68
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:05,807
Okay, found it. Check communications
with Woo Min Jae.

69
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,907
Now, let's come clean.

70
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:32,092
Ah…

71
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,875
Who on earth ordered delivery
at that time like that?

72
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:40,841
I was wrong, please forgive me just this once.

73
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,775
I'll do everything you want, please.

74
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,941
Please don't report me.

75
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:46,608
Let go! Won't you let go?

76
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:48,708
I'll never do it again, never.

77
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,254
Let go, let go!

78
00:05:51,254 --> 00:05:53,919
Just let go!

79
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:15,477
You can't keep your eyes off the young ones
on TV, so you can't keep your promise?

80
00:06:16,094 --> 00:06:18,673
Can you do that to me?

81
00:06:18,673 --> 00:06:21,429
What have I done to you?

82
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:33,275
Do it one more time.

83
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:37,438
And I'll make sure
you rot in prison as a rapist.

84
00:06:39,714 --> 00:06:42,518
Delivery!

85
00:06:42,518 --> 00:06:45,560
Even the one who made my face like this

86
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,454
wasn't that delivery guy.

87
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:52,911
You heard it, didn't you?
A confession just now.

88
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:04,941
It was almost a big trouble.

89
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:07,975
Well, thanks to that, we got to know
about the relationship between them.

90
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:09,741
Because Cho Soo Kyung suddenly screamed,

91
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:12,741
I missed Woo Min Jae approaching.

92
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:19,641
Anyway, thanks to Dr. Cha Jeong Woo,
we overcame a big crisis this time.

93
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,241
Indeed.

94
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:30,408
Was the delay of the deliveryman's
warrant hearing arranged by you?

95
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,441
I only delayed Woo Min Jae's assault charges.

96
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:35,124
We need to reassess the facts
regarding the home invasion.

97
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:37,041
Speaking of which,

98
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,875
during the deliveryman's questioning, did you…?

99
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,481
Don't you preserve the crime scene?

100
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:42,041
Hurry up and control it upstairs.

101
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,762
Yes, understood.

102
00:07:50,175 --> 00:07:52,047
Are you okay?

103
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:54,547
Any dizziness or pain?

104
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,381
I'm not seriously injured to trouble you.

105
00:07:58,381 --> 00:08:03,009
Anyway, thank you for helping.

106
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:06,854
Are the police made of something different?

107
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:09,281
Or…

108
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:12,215
don't you trust me as a doctor?

109
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:15,547
That's not it.

110
00:08:15,547 --> 00:08:16,941
I'm really okay.

111
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:19,110
Why are you avoiding me?

112
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,908
It seems to be true.

113
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:27,241
Is there something bothering you?

114
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:31,660
That is not true at all.

115
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:36,115
It's all written on your face.

116
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:57,514
Cho Soo Kyung did her teacher
training with Woo Min Jae, and,

117
00:08:57,514 --> 00:08:59,541
because of the rumors,
she cut off all personal relationships

118
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,837
and confined herself at home.

119
00:09:01,837 --> 00:09:05,509
The examination showed that Woo Min Jae
was psychologically and physically

120
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:08,974
dependent on Cho Soo Kyung.

121
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:11,967
She had been gaslighting
Woo Min Jae for a long time.

122
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:15,788
You applied for a warrant
before the results came out?

123
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,681
It would have been disgraceful
if the warrant had been rejected.

124
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:19,375
What would you have done if it'd been declined?

125
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,043
Oh, Chief, it wasn't declined.

126
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:24,841
Detective Min Hyeong handled
the warrant review well--

127
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:27,875
I apologize, I will correct it.

128
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,108
The direct evidence?

129
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:31,741
Yes, the fiber of Cho Soo Kyung's sleepers

130
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,641
and the shards of mirror
collected from Woo Min Jae's chin

131
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,899
showed matching microfiber components.

132
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,159
That settles it.

133
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,223
They had a similar incident
in the past, didn't they?

134
00:09:39,223 --> 00:09:40,975
Yes, we informed the relevant station,

135
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:43,341
and they informed us
that a reinvestigation would be initiated.

136
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:45,141
Okay, got it.

137
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:47,627
Next month is the evaluation period.

138
00:09:47,627 --> 00:09:49,441
If Kim Seon Yong files a complaint
about the investigation,

139
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:52,141
we're all doomed, you know?

140
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:54,140
Make sure you all wrap it up well, got it?

141
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,807
- Yes, I understand.
- Let's go.

142
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:02,766
Still, with the non-prosecution decision,
it won't be a big issue, will it?

143
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:05,534
Even if it becomes a problem,
it's my problem, so don't worry about it.

144
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:07,520
Just prepare the transfer
documents for Cho Soo Kyung.

145
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,653
Yes.

146
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,541
If you think

147
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,686
there was any unfairness in the procedure…

148
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,108
Unfairness in the procedure?

149
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:39,920
What kind of procedure?

150
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,766
I admit the investigation process was hasty.

151
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:44,475
I should have examined the scene better…

152
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:46,610
That's not it.

153
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:51,048
You never intended to listen
to me from the beginning.

154
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,775
If we're saying different things,

155
00:10:53,775 --> 00:10:57,341
even if as an ex-convict, shouldn't
we at least be listened first?

156
00:10:57,341 --> 00:10:59,974
It's not about dismissing without listening.

157
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:05,647
What's there to talk about
if you're sitting there

158
00:11:05,647 --> 00:11:08,180
with your ears plugged?

159
00:11:19,908 --> 00:11:23,909
[Student-Teacher Gaslighting]

160
00:11:24,914 --> 00:11:26,470
Hey! This case is about our hospital,

161
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,041
but we are hardly mentioned? Huh?

162
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,598
This time, Director Cha
played a remarkable role

163
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:34,620
with his keen analysis of the injury!

164
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,932
Immediately caught the
guardian's suspicious behavior!

165
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:39,608
Jeong Woo, if you keep this up

166
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:42,450
won't you be heading to the police
station instead of Bintan?

167
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,908
Indeed.

168
00:11:43,908 --> 00:11:46,774
Why do you keep getting involved in cases?

169
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:48,901
And quite voluntarily?

170
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:51,635
Think whatever you want.

171
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:55,815
Hey, Jeong Woo,

172
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,315
did you grab a drink with Detective Lee after?

173
00:11:58,315 --> 00:11:59,315
What after?

174
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:00,349
Oh, you know…

175
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:01,504
Thanks to you, the case was solved.

176
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:03,615
Shouldn't Detective Lee buy
you a drink or something?

177
00:12:03,615 --> 00:12:06,982
In the clink of glasses
and the exchange of glances,

178
00:12:06,982 --> 00:12:09,949
you come to realize the true value
of getting involved in this case.

179
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:14,974
And there's this thing about you being mine
but not mine, you know what I mean, right?

180
00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:17,915

356
00:27:48,282 --> 00:27:49,915
I'll do the consultation right away
in the treatment room.

357
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:51,582
Yes.

358
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:53,249
What is Director Cha doing?

359
00:27:53,249 --> 00:27:57,602
These days, with surgeries getting
canceled, he should have a lot of time.

360
00:27:57,602 --> 00:27:59,582
Just because he's removed scars
from a few crime victims,

361
00:27:59,582 --> 00:28:01,929
he thinks cosmetic surgery
is insignificant, or what?

362
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:04,249
He left for the day, said he had work to do.

363
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,615
Hmm, he went early.

364
00:28:05,615 --> 00:28:09,581
- Hmm? What?
- Yes.

365
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:11,415
But he was supposed to
have dinner with me tonight.

366
00:28:11,415 --> 00:28:14,370
We scheduled it a month ago,
and he just went home? Why?

367
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,987
I wouldn't know.

368
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:18,502
Since it was something between you two.

369
00:28:19,374 --> 00:28:21,374
Why?

370
00:28:26,282 --> 00:28:30,355
Ah… how do I get him to come later?

371
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:33,553
He can't be controlled.

372
00:28:34,182 --> 00:28:36,515
Just a prick.

373
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:41,254
You endured it well.

374
00:28:41,254 --> 00:28:43,588
I'll hold it.

375
00:28:48,615 --> 00:28:50,591
It's done.

376
00:28:50,591 --> 00:28:53,814
Wow! Maybe, because your lip line is so pretty,

377
00:28:53,814 --> 00:28:57,461
the volume looks incredibly charming.

378
00:28:57,461 --> 00:29:00,249
Nurse Choi, please show the mirror.

379
00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:02,415
Here, take a look.

380
00:29:06,648 --> 00:29:10,015
But the chin and forehead
are a bit disappointing.

381
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:11,315
Why?

382
00:29:11,315 --> 00:29:14,582
If you look here, since
the lip volume has been added,

383
00:29:14,582 --> 00:29:17,582
the chin and forehead look
somewhat subdued in comparison.

384
00:29:17,582 --> 00:29:19,728
If you added a bit more here,

385
00:29:19,728 --> 00:29:24,382
the dimensionality would make
the lines look more sophisticated.

386
00:29:24,382 --> 00:29:27,749
Shall we add a bit more
with an additional procedure?

387
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:50,696
Why are you here?

388
00:29:52,472 --> 00:29:54,952
Why did you come here, Dr. Cha Jeong Woo?

389
00:29:54,952 --> 00:29:57,387
To meet Lee Jin Seok.

390
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,585
What are you going to do by meeting him?

391
00:29:59,585 --> 00:30:02,219
Are you going to take
personal revenge or something?

392
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:08,585
A person who has been sentenced
and served his time,

393
00:30:08,585 --> 00:30:11,319
and continues to deny the crime.

394
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,752
What does that mean?

395
00:30:12,752 --> 00:30:15,075
Did you meet Lee Jin Seok?

396
00:30:16,718 --> 00:30:20,085
[You know the killer, don't you?]

397
00:30:23,652 --> 00:30:25,252
Just wait.

398
00:30:25,252 --> 00:30:27,352
Because I have something prepared as well.

399
00:30:27,352 --> 00:30:29,352
Let's say he can clam

400
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:31,919
he didn't do it, and it's unfair.

401
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,919
But, why does he need to direct
those words at me?

402
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,181
What's his intention?

403
00:30:40,771 --> 00:30:43,643
How about the investigation on Mr. Nam Gi Taek?

404
00:30:43,643 --> 00:30:47,425
Has it been confirmed
that Lee Jin Seok was involved?

405
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:52,431
I'm still looking into it,

406
00:30:52,431 --> 00:30:55,733
but there's nothing certain yet.

407
00:30:55,733 --> 00:31:00,071
If you're not here because that has
been confirmed, then why are you here?

408
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,352
Hey, Jeong Woo, where are you?
Hurry to the hospital, will you?

409
00:31:12,352 --> 00:31:13,459
What happened?

410
00:31:13,459 --> 00:31:16,052
I did the filler treatment for you,
and the situation now… I really…

411
00:31:16,052 --> 00:31:18,185
What's the situation? What happened…

412
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:20,195
Hello?

413
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:29,033
Contact me if you find Lee Jin Seok.

414
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:44,685
Look at that expression. Look at it, will you?

415
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:48,703
That refreshed face, satisfied
with a perfect procedure, huh?

416
00:31:48,703 --> 00:31:50,385
You saw it, right?

417
00:31:50,385 --> 00:31:53,452
Hey Jeong Woo, my molding today
was absolutely fantastic.

418
00:31:53,452 --> 00:31:56,051
I've made this chin-end into a V
without a scalpel, you know?

419
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:59,152
I thought there was a problem.

420
00:31:59,152 --> 00:32:01,852
Ah, that's why you ran out so startled?

421
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:04,685
Hey, how can you forget our
appointment and leave work early?

422
00:32:04,685 --> 00:32:06,219
Especially an appointment made a month ago.

423
00:32:06,219 --> 00:32:07,852
And then you use an accident as an excuse?

424
00:32:07,852 --> 00:32:09,852
Are you someone who just comes when called?

425
00:32:09,852 --> 00:32:11,085
Besides,

426
00:32:11,085 --> 00:32:12,819
I just trailed off at the end of my sentence.

427
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:15,152
I never even brought up the "ac" of "accident".

428
00:32:15,152 --> 00:32:19,252
It's annoying that you misinterpreted it
as "accident", you know?

429
00:32:19,252 --> 00:32:20,624
- Did you forget?
- Huh?

430
00:32:20,624 --> 00:32:21,819
Last year, while you were inserting fillers…

431
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:24,998
Hey, it's late. Hurry up and leave. Let's go.

432
00:32:26,752 --> 00:32:28,952
- But, to where?
- Huh?

433
00:32:28,952 --> 00:32:32,144
I'll set the navigation,
you can just follow it.

434
00:32:32,144 --> 00:32:34,267
Ok.

435
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,415
The fingerprints collected from the keychain
belonged only to Ms. Nam Hyo Ju.

436
00:32:43,415 --> 00:32:47,785
I checked to see if there might be
other DNA between the stitches,

437
00:32:47,785 --> 00:32:49,801
but it failed.

438
00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:52,319
Understood.

439
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:54,825
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Yes.

440
00:32:58,295 --> 00:32:59,681
[Good Hands Medical Association]

441
00:32:59,681 --> 00:33:03,758
[Cheongsu Medical Volunteer, 2022.10.10]

442
00:33:09,152 --> 00:33:11,319
Madam, you remember that, don't you?

443
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:14,819
Was it when I was in the first year
of high school, or the second?

444
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:18,385
That time when Jeong Woo and I were going
to make a birthday cake for you,

445
00:33:18,385 --> 00:33:19,785
we put it in the oven and

446
00:33:19,785 --> 00:33:22,798
ended up going out to play basketball
because we couldn't wait,

447
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:25,819
and it all burned up,
setting off the fire alarms,

448
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:28,197
triggering all the sprinklers.

449
00:33:28,197 --> 00:33:31,189
Madam, how many fire trucks came that time?

450
00:33:32,185 --> 00:33:35,587
Wow! Just thinking about that time
makes it seem so distant, right?

451
00:33:35,587 --> 00:33:37,571
Did that really happen?

452
00:33:37,571 --> 00:33:40,166
Jeong Woo, don't you remember? Huh?

453
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:45,655
What, you got nothing to talk?

454
00:33:48,577 --> 00:33:51,577
I came to say goodbye
before leaving the country.

455
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:54,545
Because I have to see you at least once.

456
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:01,352
Thank you for the meal.

457
00:34:02,104 --> 00:34:05,559
Are you running away to Bintan?

458
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:08,252
Dwelling in the past, reminiscing
about someone who's gone.

459
00:34:08,252 --> 00:34:09,485
Are you trying to waste your life?

460
00:34:09,485 --> 00:34:11,068
Enough with that.

461
00:34:11,068 --> 00:34:13,811
Let's get through this good day well.

462
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:15,119
Hey, sit down too.

463
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,419
To mother, she might have been
a non-existent person from the start,

464
00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:20,388
but to me, not for a single moment

465
00:34:21,498 --> 00:34:24,491
has she ever been a non-existent person.

466
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:28,219
Hey, stop it Jeong Woo, ok? Hey!

467
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,984

468
00:34:30,984 --> 00:34:33,132

00:34:33,132 --> 00:34:35,920
Hey, do some damage control.

00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:39,089
Just how long will it…

471
00:34:39,785 --> 00:34:42,519
Madam, please don't worry too much
about it, it's just something I said.

472
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,691
He is being sensitive again today.

473
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:47,591
It was good, right?

474
00:34:52,225 --> 00:34:54,452
Hello, this is Yoon Seo Hee.

475
00:34:54,452 --> 00:34:56,998
Yes, who is this?

476
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:04,219
What do you need from me, detective?

477
00:35:05,445 --> 00:35:09,385
Jeong Woo! Hey, Cha Jeong Woo! You!

478
00:35:09,385 --> 00:35:12,685
Are you really just going to leave like this?

479
00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:15,252
Please check the partner doctor's schedule.

480
00:35:15,252 --> 00:35:17,992
So that approval comes quickly.

481
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:20,234
It's true, he's fleeing.

482
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:30,185
If you run away because it hurts
every time your wounds are touched,

483
00:35:30,185 --> 00:35:32,493
it won't hurt anymore?

484
00:35:33,148 --> 00:35:35,847
You know that letting it fester
will only lead to inflammation

485
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:38,174
till it bursts, you frustrating brat.

486
00:35:38,174 --> 00:35:40,152
Hey, you might as well

487
00:35:40,152 --> 00:35:42,719
tell her everything you should
and shouldn't say.

488
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:47,428
Expose all that painful things inside,
and stop pretending to be fine.

489
00:35:50,718 --> 00:35:52,519
I know.

490
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:56,800
That your past isn't something
that can be easily forgotten.

491
00:35:59,964 --> 00:36:03,379
I have no memories that can be forgotten,

492
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:07,491
that's why I can't forget.

493
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:11,152
See you at the hospital.

494
00:36:11,152 --> 00:36:13,176
Hey, Cha…

495
00:36:16,731 --> 00:36:19,525
Madam, please don't worry
too much about Jeong Woo.

496
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:23,852
Besides, he's probably worrying
about it again after all that.

497
00:36:23,852 --> 00:36:25,985
Since it's your birthday.

498
00:36:25,985 --> 00:36:27,412
Huh?

499
00:36:27,412 --> 00:36:29,585
Detective Lee?

500
00:36:29,585 --> 00:36:32,164
Director Han, why are you here?

501
00:36:32,164 --> 00:36:35,425
Are you the detective who called?

502
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:38,218
What is the matter you
wanted to discuss with me?

503
00:36:41,386 --> 00:36:45,465
But, if you take fingerprints from this,
you can quickly find out who it is, right?

504
00:36:45,465 --> 00:36:47,952
You know, like the DNA?

505
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:51,885
Unfortunately, the person who found it
accidentally wiped off the fingerprints.

506
00:36:51,885 --> 00:36:54,904
Ah… I see…

507
00:36:54,904 --> 00:36:57,952
I heard that you organized Good
Hands Medical Association volunteer.

508
00:36:57,952 --> 00:37:02,585
Yes, that's the souvenir from the volunteer
service at Cheongsoo Prison last year.

509
00:37:02,585 --> 00:37:05,952
Do you happen to have a list of the inmates
who received medical treatment at that time?

510
00:37:05,952 --> 00:37:07,953
Ah…

511
00:37:08,885 --> 00:37:10,152
Ah, I'm sorry, but

512
00:37:10,152 --> 00:37:13,052
those people are quite reluctant
to disclose their personal information.

513
00:37:13,052 --> 00:37:16,385
We often provide medical care
without knowing their names.

514
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:19,119
Ah, I am also part of the volunteer group.

515
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:23,444
Then,

516
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,285
do you remember this person?

517
00:37:29,285 --> 00:37:31,252
He was an inmate at that time.

518
00:37:31,252 --> 00:37:34,441
I wonder if he participated
in the volunteer program.

519
00:37:35,398 --> 00:37:36,858
This person…

520
00:37:36,858 --> 00:37:38,965
Why? Do you know him?

521
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,625
Hye Jin…

522
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,663
What?

523
00:37:43,572 --> 00:37:46,977
Do you know about… that incident?

524
00:37:47,785 --> 00:37:51,547
Ah, she's Director Cha's mother.

525
00:37:52,585 --> 00:37:55,547
Why is the police looking for this person?

526
00:37:57,219 --> 00:37:59,085
It's confidential to the
investigation, so I can't say.

527
00:37:59,085 --> 00:38:01,120
