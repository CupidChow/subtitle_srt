9
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:34,390

10
00:02:35,844 --> 00:02:39,692
running from the one chasing after him.

11

12
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:47,964
that came out of that house.

13

What about the person who left first?
Did you see his face?

14
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:03,298
No.

15
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:07,920
I didn't see it.

16

17

That there was someone else
at Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's place.

18
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:23,797
Perhaps after hearing what I said…

19
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:26,831
No, he mentioned it first.

20
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,297
He said it seemed like
you were chasing someone.

21
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:35,881
He requested a hypnotic investigation himself.

22
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:42,197
What did you mean when you said
the real culprit is on the move?

23
00:03:42,197 --> 00:03:44,630
It's about the Nam Hyo Ju case.

24
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,864
The DNA of the culprit found
under Nam Hyo Ju's fingernails,

25
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:52,831
and the other DNA taken from the watch match.

26
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:54,797
Then, the case of Hye Jin and Nam Hyo Ju…

27
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:57,464
Have the same perpetrator.

28
00:03:57,464 --> 00:04:01,137
The person who murdered Nam Gi Taek
and staged it as a suicide,

29

and the criminal who attacked Nam Hyo Ju
in an attempt to eliminate a witness,

30
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:11,997

46

In the end,

52
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,231
we didn't catch the real culprit.

53
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:35,897
But we know there is a real perpetrator.

54
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:38,178
It will take time.

55
00:07:41,517 --> 00:07:45,498
I'm still the prime suspect, aren't I?

56
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:50,364
It's because we haven't received
the forensic report yet.

57
00:07:50,364 --> 00:07:54,531
I intended to report after the hypnosis
investigation if things became clearer.

58
00:07:55,364 --> 00:07:57,485
Let's go.

59
00:07:58,597 --> 00:07:59,664
Where to?

60
00:07:59,664 --> 00:08:02,497
We need to meet the real culprit.

61
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:06,745
It's not the present me
who's denying the memory,

62
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:09,028
but the me from seven years ago.

63
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:23,631
You lost the suspect in front
of the police station?

64
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:25,397
No, it's not that we lost him,
but with Detective Min Hyeong--

65
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:26,564
Don't make excuses!

66
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:28,550
You failed to catch them,
that's why they got away!

67
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,097
Their identity is confirmed,
they couldn't possibly run away, right?

68
00:08:31,097 --> 00:08:33,916
An active police officer
concealed a murder case.

69
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:37,064
Who knows what the repercussions
will be if this becomes an issue?

70

Higher-ups are in a frenzy
to get it resolved quickly,

71
00:08:41,764 --> 00:08:44,230

- Yes!

74
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:55,457
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo has voluntarily appeared.

75
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:05,164
What's this?

76
00:09:05,164 --> 00:09:07,664
It's the suspect's evidence.

77
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:11,831
Reinvestigate the Yoon Hye Jin murder case.

78
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:26,257
I thought it was lost during
the accident seven years ago,

79
00:09:26,257 --> 00:09:29,003
but my mother had it.

80
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:31,497
What about this photo?

81
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:34,331
It was received without a caller ID,

82
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:37,531
and a few other similar photos came through.

83
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:43,430
Hye Jin and I,

84
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:48,797
we weren't in a relationship
to care about such pictures.

85
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:52,197
Does anyone have a guess who it might be?

86
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:53,931
We'll have to check.

87
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:58,164
I can't let anyone else get hurt because of me.

88
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:01,731
Cha Jeong Woo is not the suspect,

89
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:03,531
but a witness to the case?

90
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:05,331
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo, at the time
of the Yoon Hye Jin case,

91
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:08,264
is assumed to have had a physical altercation
with the criminal at the scene.

92
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:11,031
After that, while chasing the fleeing criminal,

93
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:12,997
it seems he was involved in a traffic accident.

94
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:16,297
Lee Jin Seok's statement during
the hypnosis investigation is similar.

95
00:10:16,297 --> 00:10:19,797
But, the real culprit who killed Yoon Hye Jin,

96
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:24,797
and the criminal in the Nam Gi Taek
and Nam Hyo Ju cases are the same person?

97
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:26,031
What's the evidence?

98
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:28,631
The criminal's DNA from
Yoon Hye Jin's case scene and

99
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:32,164
the criminal's DNA from
the Nam Hyo Ju case scene match.

100
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,364
And the criminal who staged
Nam Gi Taek's murder as a suicide is

101
00:10:35,364 --> 00:10:38,331
the one who attacked Nam Hyo Ju
to eliminate a witness.

102
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:41,564
The point is that the three incidents
involve the same culprit.

103
00:10:41,564 --> 00:10:45,531
And that the criminal is
an acquaintance of Cha Jeong Woo.

104
00:10:45,531 --> 00:10:48,556
Make a list by investigating
the people around him,

105
00:10:48,556 --> 00:10:51,780
and then compare it with the criminal's DNA
found under Nam Hyo Ju's fingernails.

106
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,984
Is there no other evidence
to narrow down the suspects?

107
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:56,731
A keyring.

108
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:58,794
Keyring?

109
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:03,597
It was found on the balcony
where Mr. Nam Gi Taek fell,

110
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:06,300
and it's presumed to belong to the criminal.

111
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,392
It's a limited edition.

112
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:08,531
Limited edition?

113
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:13,864
Ah, it's a commemorative keyring from a
medical volunteer program at Cheongsoo Prison.

114
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:16,664
Then,

115
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:19,531
among the inmates who participated
in that volunteer program,

116
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:23,064
if we investigate any connection to Dr. Cha
and Nam Gi Taek, we might find the answer.

117
00:11:23,064 --> 00:11:24,331
Go ahead.

118
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:25,764
And, get ahold of yourselves!

119

and the case resurfaces,

00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:14,677
What are your plans?

177
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:18,477
I plan to go home.

178
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:23,697
Once a temporary residence is arranged,
after talking with the police,

179
00:15:23,697 --> 00:15:27,597
I'll fix the surgery schedule.

180
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,902
I'm sure I saw him.

181
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:39,697
But I can't remember.

182
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:46,378
It's not your fault, Ms. Hyo Ju.

183
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:48,487
Being a victim of a crime,

184
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:51,197
as well as not remembering
what happened that day.

185
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:59,564
Please get the pre-surgery
examinations done in advance.

186
00:15:59,564 --> 00:16:01,697
Yes.

198
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:49,831
<i>Ah, I am also part of the volunteer group.</i>

199
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:55,172
If Yoon Hye Jin and Nam Gi Taek
were killed by the same person,

200
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:57,432
Cha Jeong Woo, Yoon Hye Jin and Nam Gi Taek

201
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:59,664
must have been a connection between them.

202
00:16:59,664 --> 00:17:02,197
Right? But, among the prisoners,

203
00:17:02,197 --> 00:17:05,764
it's not easy to find a connection
with Dr. Cha Jeong Woo.

204
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:10,664
That keyring…

205
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:15,197
Did only the prisoners receive it?

206
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:18,069
Then who else received it?

207
00:17:20,964 --> 00:17:23,575
The medical staff?

208
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:25,997
Ah, but the motive for the murder…

209
00:17:25,997 --> 00:17:28,564
Moreover, if it's the same perpetrator
as in the Yoon Hye Jin case,

210
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:30,797
there should be a motive
for killing Yoon Hye Jin as well.

211
00:17:30,797 --> 00:17:32,777
Ah, these people…

212
00:17:32,777 --> 00:17:37,031
Dr. Cha Jeong Woo is denying
his memory of the criminal.

213
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:39,664
Does that mean the person is that shocking?

214
00:17:39,664 --> 00:17:42,031
Whether it's a shocking reason or not,

215
00:17:42,031 --> 00:17:44,796
if we need to find that reason,

216
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,031
we'll have to start from here.

217
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:54,864
Is the surgery for patient Nam Hyo Ju
scheduled for the day after tomorrow?

218
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:58,397
Yes, we've scheduled it to match
Director Cha's schedule.

219
00:17:58,397 --> 00:18:02,531
Let's not postpone it any further
and just go with the scheduled plan.

220
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,664
Ah, we're short on hospital rooms, too.

221
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:12,071
It's better to perform the surgery
quickly and discharge the patient.

222
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:14,904
Hey, Director.

223
00:18:14,904 --> 00:18:18,197
Has the surgery schedule
been set for Ms. Nam Hyo Ju?

224
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,147
We were just discussing that.

225
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:22,731
You'd be informed once it's scheduled.

226
00:18:22,731 --> 00:18:25,064
Why is there so much interest?

227
00:18:25,064 --> 00:18:27,101
Well, I mean…

228
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,197
Ah, Madam.

229
00:18:29,197 --> 00:18:31,997
What surgery is Director Cha performing again?

230
00:18:31,997 --> 00:18:35,531
What happened to Bintan?

I saw during volunteer…

235
00:18:56,697 --> 00:18:59,131

Ah, Jeong Woo's mother.

00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:06,396
You mean Yoon Seo Hee.

240
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,797
She's a friend's mother, but
you two seem to be very close, right?

241
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:09,931
Yes.

242
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:12,997
She's like a real mother to me.

243
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:16,697
According to the investigation
records at the time,

244
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:21,036
there was content suggesting your
disapproval of your son's marriage.

245
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:23,297
Are you reinvestigating that case?

246
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:25,131
As you know,

247
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:28,099
the investigation at that time was flawed.

248
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:33,731
There was a cover-up
of Dr. Cha Jeong Woo's accident

249
00:19:33,731 --> 00:19:36,708
and a cellphone that wasn't submitted.

250
00:19:37,864 --> 00:19:40,964
Do you know something regarding the photos

251
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:43,564
that were on the cellphone?

252
00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:45,597
No, I don't.

253
00:19:47,897 --> 00:19:52,897
I heard you've known Dr. Cha Jeong Woo
for quite some time.

254
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:55,731
Ah, yes.

255
00:19:55,731 --> 00:19:58,724
Director Cha's mother
and I were college classmates.

256
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:00,764
Well, I've known him since he was young.

257
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:04,397
Then, you must be acquainted
with Ms. Yoon Hye Jin as well?

258
00:20:04,397 --> 00:20:09,531
I've seen her a few times when
their marriage came up.

259
00:20:09,531 --> 00:20:13,864
I've heard there was strong opposition
to Dr. Cha Jeong Woo's marriage.

260
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:15,764
Me?

261
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:18,297
From Dr. Cha Jeong Woo's mother.

262
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:22,939
But, why are you suddenly
asking about such things?

263
00:20:22,939 --> 00:20:24,915
Yoon Hye Jin's case perpetrator

264
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:26,764
is the same as Nam Gi Taek
and Nam Hyo Ju's cases?

265
00:20:26,764 --> 00:20:29,871
You seem to have a lot of interest
in the investigation.

266
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:34,531
Because it involves Director Cha,
whom I care about.

267
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:38,923
Do you remember where you were
on the day of Mr. Nam Gi Taek's death?

268
00:20:38,923 --> 00:20:41,697
What? You mean me?

269
00:20:41,697 --> 00:20:44,142
It's a formal question.

270
00:20:45,264 --> 00:20:47,864
I drank at a bar I often go to.

271
00:20:47,864 --> 00:20:49,197
You remember it clearly.

272
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:50,364
Yes.

273
00:20:50,364 --> 00:20:52,864
The next day, I was struggling with a hangover,

274
00:20:52,864 --> 00:20:55,897
but seeing the article about
Mr. Nam Gi Taek snapped me out of it.

275
00:20:55,897 --> 00:20:58,864
Ah, that day was also plastered
with articles about Director Cha.

276
00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:01,160
You must be quite close to Director Cha.

277
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,951
Of course, we are like brothers.

278
00:21:03,951 --> 00:21:07,231
But last week, you came to our hospital

279
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:09,871
and mentioned investigating
Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's case, didn't you?

280
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:11,910
Well… yes, I did.

281
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,964
Then, why are you suddenly
asking about Mr. Nam Gi Taek?

282
00:21:14,964 --> 00:21:18,664
Ah! Does it have something
to do with Ms. Yoon Hye Jin's case?

283
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:25,931
Do you happen to have the keyring?

284
00:21:28,131 --> 00:21:30,731
This is also a formal, I mean…

285
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:32,531
It is not a formal question.

286
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:35,083
Please answer precisely.

287
00:21:40,831 --> 00:21:42,967
Well, I…

288
00:21:44,397 --> 00:21:46,593
Of course…

289
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:49,764
I don't have it.

290
00:21:49,764 --> 00:21:51,903
I lost it.

291
00:21:53,997 --> 00:21:55,631
But the only doctor likely to have it

292
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:58,764
would be our Director.

293
00:21:58,764 --> 00:22:01,331
After our Director finishes his volunteer work,

294
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:06,197
he likes to collect items for certification.

295
00:22:06,197 --> 00:22:07,731
Hmm…

296
00:22:07,731 --> 00:22:11,831
It was displayed in the hospital's showcase,

297
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,059
but someone took it.

298
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,652
It suddenly disappeared.

299
00:22:18,197 --> 00:22:20,497
When was that?

300
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:23,197
Ah, this is tricky.

301
00:22:23,197 --> 00:22:25,437
I'm not sure.

302
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:28,834
But, the owner of this keyring is

303
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:31,974
the criminal of Nam Gi Taek
and Nam Hyo Ju's cases?

304
00:22:33,697 --> 00:22:37,075
You have the keyring that was a souvenir

305
00:22:37,075 --> 00:22:38,331
at that time, don't you?

306
00:22:38,331 --> 00:22:41,564
No, I don't have it.

307
00:22:42,437 --> 00:22:45,831
Weren't you the one who organized it?

308
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,497
Then, at least a souvenir…

309
00:22:47,497 --> 00:22:50,431
It wasn't really something to commemorate,

310
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:53,031
since it's something I do often.

311
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:55,564
The day Mr. Nam Gi Taek died,

312
00:22:55,564 --> 00:22:58,464
do you remember where you were
and what you were doing?

313
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:01,164
Well, I must have been at home, right?

314
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:04,870

315
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,237
Were you at home with someone?

316

317
00:23:11,403 --> 00:23:12,412

00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,964
<i>[Statement by Kim Seok Hoon]</i>

351
00:25:42,964 --> 00:25:45,410
Is there something wrong?

352
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,731
Just checking if there's anything
that could be wrong, you know.

353
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:50,931
How are Nam Hyo Ju's case suspect
movements being tracked?

354
00:25:50,931 --> 00:25:53,631
Ah… we tracked down to the subway station,

355
00:25:53,631 --> 00:25:56,564
but he just jumped over the ticket gates.

356
00:25:57,131 --> 00:26:01,097
We need to check all the
subway CCTV footage, obviously.

357
00:26:01,097 --> 00:26:02,966
Keep following him.

358
00:26:02,966 --> 00:26:04,055
We need to confirm the final movements
to match with the people investigated

359
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:07,597
so we can try to match them.

360
00:26:07,597 --> 00:26:12,631
But Dr. Cha Jeong Woo's mother,
isn't she a bit strange?

361
00:26:12,631 --> 00:26:13,783
In what way?

362
00:26:13,783 --> 00:26:16,031
The fact that she said she doesn't
remember when asked about the photo.

363
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:19,064
There's no way she couldn't remember
something like that.

364
00:26:19,064 --> 00:26:20,391
Maybe,

365
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:24,515
she hired someone to separate
Cha Jeong Woo and Yoon Hye Jin.

366
00:26:26,531 --> 00:26:27,937
We don't know the person, after all.

367
00:26:27,937 --> 00:26:31,024
<i>[Statement by Yoon Seo Hee]
[Yoon Hye Jin and Nam Gi Taek murder case]</i>

368
00:26:34,797 --> 00:26:38,597
They said you quit all of a sudden.

369
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,964
Am I being misunderstood right now?

370
00:26:41,964 --> 00:26:44,197
Depends on your answer.

371
00:26:45,997 --> 00:26:48,244
You're just as I've heard.

372
00:26:48,244 --> 00:26:50,717
I don't mean it in a bad way.

373
00:26:50,717 --> 00:26:53,997
"Honest, unpretentious. That's his charm."

374
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:56,897
Ms. Hye Jin talked so much about you.

375
00:26:58,197 --> 00:26:59,931
Um…

376
00:26:59,931 --> 00:27:02,231
Me quitting dancing

377
00:27:02,231 --> 00:27:06,764
isn't completely unrelated to Hye Jin.

378
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,731
She supported me a lot,

379
00:27:09,731 --> 00:27:12,464
but it didn't go well without her.

380
00:27:13,697 --> 00:27:16,031
And that incident…

381
00:27:16,031 --> 00:27:20,964
It was quite a shock for me too.

382
00:27:24,431 --> 00:27:28,697
Around that time, is there anything

383
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:31,304
you might know about Hye Jin?

384
00:27:31,304 --> 00:27:34,837
But… why come to me now?

385
00:27:39,902 --> 00:27:42,369
This belongs to her.

386
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:45,729
I thought you'd come to find it right away.

387
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:50,835
Ah, and about that photo,

388
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:54,535
Hye Jin had it on her phone too.

389
00:27:55,669 --> 00:28:00,042
Ms. Hye Jin's reaction
was a bit unusual at that time,

390
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:02,380
so it stuck in my memory.

391
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:30,075
<i>Huh? That's me, right?</i>

392
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,077
<i>Yes, it's you.</i>

393
00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:37,502
<i>Wow… this is just perfect
for misunderstanding, isn't it?</i>

394
00:28:37,502 --> 00:28:39,741
<i>Ms. Hye Jin, who took this? Your boyfriend?</i>

395
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:42,169
<i>Eh? Jeong Woo isn't that kind of person.</i>

396
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:43,471
<i>Then who was it?</i>

397
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,019
<i>Why do you care? I don't even care.</i>

398
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:48,001
<i>But I'm involved too…</i>

399
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:50,302
<i>Did you report it?</i>

400
00:28:50,302 --> 00:28:51,735
<i>Geez, who is it?</i>

401
00:28:51,735 --> 00:28:53,014
<i>Do you know this person?</i>

402
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:55,734
<i>Come on, let's start over.</i>

403
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,202
<i>There were a few more pictures
with a similar vibe.</i>

404
00:28:58,202 --> 00:28:59,935
<i>But she didn't pay much attention to it.</i>

405
00:28:59,935 --> 00:29:01,694
<i>Similar pictures, you say?</i>

406
00:29:01,694 --> 00:29:03,969
<i>It looked like she was alone with another man,</i>

407
00:29:03,969 --> 00:29:06,635
<i>as if it was intentionally
made to feel that way.</i>

408
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:10,269
<i>Maybe someone harbored
ill will towards Hye Jin,</i>

409
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:13,102
<i>and wanted to break up your marriage?</i>

410
00:29:17,635 --> 00:29:19,969
<i>[The password is incorrect, please try again]</i>

00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:27,934
<i>[The number of attempts was exceeded]</i>

412
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,938
<i>[Please try again in 1 minute]</i>

413
00:29:44,068 --> 00:29:46,069
It seems Nam Gi Taek and Hye Jin cases

414
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:48,735
might be related.

415
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:52,349
I heard something came up
during Nam Hyo Ju's case.

416
00:29:52,349 --> 00:29:54,383
Really?

417
00:29:56,735 --> 00:29:59,729
Since evidence has emerged,
they'll find it soon enough.

418
00:29:59,729 --> 00:30:01,896
Do you want another can?

419
00:30:04,209 --> 00:30:07,948
I don't know why I lived like that.

420
00:30:07,948 --> 00:30:10,716
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

421
00:30:10,716 --> 00:30:15,475
I don't really know anything about Hye Jin.

422
00:30:17,068 --> 00:30:18,969
What was going on around her,

423
00:30:18,969 --> 00:30:21,403
why she was struggling…

424
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:27,055
It's not like you to blame yourself.

425
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:32,562
Having lived with no feelings or plans.

426
00:30:34,775 --> 00:30:37,735
Meeting Hye Jin changed everything.

427
00:30:38,447 --> 00:30:41,828
My work, my emotions, my plans.

428
00:30:41,828 --> 00:30:45,228
I said so many things,

429
00:30:45,228 --> 00:30:47,249
but I…

430
00:30:49,728 --> 00:30:52,616
I know nothing about Hye Jin.

431
00:30:57,702 --> 00:31:00,129
So what?

432
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:02,386
What are you going to do now?

433
00:31:03,969 --> 00:31:07,269
I have to find him, somehow.

434
00:31:08,175 --> 00:31:10,409
The real culprit.

435
00:31:11,768 --> 00:31:14,596
I think I saw that guy.

436
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:33,032
Jeong Woo,

437
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,394
have you thought about it?

438
00:31:37,408 --> 00:31:40,465
What do you want to do when you find him?

439
00:31:41,469 --> 00:31:44,569
You said everything changed
when you met Hye Jin.

440
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:48,801
If you meet that guy,

441
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:52,001
everything might change again.

442
00:32:29,994 --> 00:32:32,215
Please operate just like this,

443
00:32:32,215 --> 00:32:34,986
like the face in the picture.

444
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:41,835
Then, cheekbone contouring surgery,

445
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,569
raising the bridge of the nose,

446
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:48,910
and nostrils reduction must also be included,

447
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,169
up to the lower eyelid tailoring…

448
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:54,835
I'll do it. I'll just do it.

449
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:03,286
To make an accurate diagnosis,

450
00:33:03,286 --> 00:33:05,537
we need your surgical history.

451
00:33:05,537 --> 00:33:08,635
If you've had plastic surgery before…

452
00:33:08,635 --> 00:33:12,355
Last year, I had it done
with ear cartilage, but

453
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:16,249
it didn't seem high enough,
so I redid it with silicone.

454
00:33:16,249 --> 00:33:18,636
Did you also do the tip of your nose?

455
00:33:18,636 --> 00:33:20,772
Yes, but,

456
00:33:20,772 --> 00:33:24,984
it still seems a bit low,
so I'm considering raising it a bit more.

457
00:33:24,984 --> 00:33:29,324
Then, by any chance,
have you ever had contouring surgery?

458
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:31,069
Well… two years ago,

459
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:34,189
but there was hardly any difference.

460
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:37,069
As for whether surgery is possible,

461
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:40,869
it seems like you'll have to consult
with our director first.

462
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:45,435
These days, many people
bring retouched photos, you know.

463
00:33:45,435 --> 00:33:48,830
Even so, it's more realistic
than bringing in celebrity photos

464
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,469
and asking for surgery to look like them.

465
00:33:51,469 --> 00:33:54,135
But the problem is when it's excessive.

466
00:33:54,135 --> 00:33:58,101
Plastic surgery isn't as simple
as retouching with an app, is it?

467
00:33:58,101 --> 00:34:01,440
There must be a reason they call it
"Snapchat dysmorphia", right?

468
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,592
Indeed.

469
00:34:02,592 --> 00:34:03,592
<i>[Snapchat Dysmorphia: discrepancy between
retouched photos and real appearance]</i>

470
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:04,635
<i>[Symptoms of obsession with dissatisfaction]</i>

471
00:34:04,635 --> 00:34:07,545
If only I could just come out
looking like the photos.

472
00:34:08,403 --> 00:34:09,902
Me too?

473
00:34:09,902 --> 00:34:13,169
During the last surgery,
the silicone was inserted a bit too high,

474
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:16,892
and it's not fitting snugly,
plus the skin has thinned out.

475
00:34:16,892 --> 00:34:19,894
Rather than replacing it
with a higher silicone piece,

476
00:34:19,894 --> 00:34:23,869
I would recommend removing the implant.

477
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:26,046
What about the contour?

478
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:31,821
To make it like the photo, a significant
amount needs to be reduced,

479
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:34,588
and quite a forward movement
of the chin tip would be necessary.

480
00:34:38,191 --> 00:34:39,691
Your own chin,

481
00:34:39,691 --> 00:34:41,912
wouldn't see a great effect
from a contouring surgery,

482
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:44,058
given the shape of your face.

483
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:45,391
Then what about the eyes?

484
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:48,463
It's impossible to increase the size
of the eyes to match the photo.

485
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:52,006
Can't you just… do it somewhat like this?

486
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,056
It's not like I'm asking you to
make me into someone else's face.

487
00:34:55,056 --> 00:34:59,322
After all, this face is still my face.

488
00:35:00,091 --> 00:35:02,311
But to my eyes, it looks like someone else's.

489
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:03,624
No, doctor.

490
00:35:03,624 --> 00:35:05,024
This is definitely my face.

491
00:35:05,024 --> 00:35:08,224
I took the photo myself.

492
00:35:08,224 --> 00:35:11,358
Yes, it is indeed you.

493
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:14,178
But you've overly retouched it.

494
00:35:25,758 --> 00:35:28,758
I really need the surgery…

495
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,924
What's the matter? Are you okay?

496
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:35,224
- Yes.
- Yes.

497
00:35:35,224 --> 00:35:37,158
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

498
00:35:37,158 --> 00:35:39,991
You're a doctor too, aren't you?

499
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:42,011
Yes, well, as you can see.

500
00:35:42,011 --> 00:35:44,037
Could I possibly have a consultation

501
00:35:44,037 --> 00:35:46,777
from you?

502
00:35:47,324 --> 00:35:50,624
- Pardon?
- Because of someone,

503
00:35:50,624 --> 00:35:54,924
I live as a suspect of having killed someone.

504
00:35:54,924 --> 00:35:56,991
Thank you, Director.

505
00:35:56,991 --> 00:36:00,691
Ah. What is it? Why are you being so scary?

506
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,824
Are you throwing a preemptive strike
in case I say something to you?

507
00:36:03,824 --> 00:36:06,058
Both me and my mother

508
00:36:06,058 --> 00:36:07,689
know that you're looking out for us.

509
00:36:07,689 --> 00:36:09,258
This guy…

510
00:36:09,258 --> 00:36:11,802
If you know, then do well.

511
00:36:13,424 --> 00:36:16,903
Then, Nam Hyo Ju's surgery,

512
00:36:16,903 --> 00:36:18,658
are you doing it with Woo Jin?

513
00:36:18,658 --> 00:36:23,758
Skin grafting and reconstructing
around the eyes, you can cover it alone.

514
00:36:23,758 --> 00:36:25,130
It's easier to do it together.

515
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,658
Is that your idea or Woo Jin's?

516
00:36:27,658 --> 00:36:30,524
Why does it matter whose idea it is?

517
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,824
It's about paying more attention.

518
00:36:35,824 --> 00:36:38,284
Are you doing this because
you think it's your fault?

519
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:40,564
It's not a surgery that takes a lot of time.

520
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:42,831
I'll adjust the schedule.

521
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:07,391
People around Dr. Cha Jeong Woo,

522
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,358
in the past and present too.

523
