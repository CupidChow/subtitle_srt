1
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,033
I gave you the chance to run away,
but you gave that up.

2
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,787
If you run away now,

3
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,123
I'll kill you.

4
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:31,132
Did you just kill the old man
that attacked you earlier?

5
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,457
What is this?

6
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,091
What was that?

7
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,136
The leftover ashes
of that revengeful ghost.

8
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,929
Was he a ghost?

9
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,640
I told you that some of them
look like humans.

10
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,017
But you said they're not dangerous.

11
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,147
If you get attacked by those
who hold deep grudges,

12
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,690
you could end up getting killed.

13
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,109
You should learn to differentiate them.

14
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,361
But you said it's hard to tell them apart.

15
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,738
That's why you need to look closely.

16
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,407
I get scared if I look...

17
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,783
too closely.

18
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,745
What are you scared of?
I'm right by your side.

19
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:45,999
Wait!

20
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,794
Can you...

21
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,256
get that for me?

22
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,304
Wouldn't it be dangerous for me
to get too close?

23
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:00,805
Hurry.

24
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,438
Then address me properly. It's "Ms. Jang."

25
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,690
You know, you're not my boss.

26
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,026
I told you that I don't want
to work at your hotel.

27
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,194
I guess you're not that scared yet.

28
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,123
Hey, if we just leave that there,

29
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,292
wouldn't it be dangerous
to the people passing by?

30
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,961
That piece of trash
will soon get collected.

31
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,087
By whom?

32
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,797
The Grim Reaper.

33
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,302
You're going to wear that again?

34
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,596
Why?

35
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,890
Is it dangerous?

36
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,975
But it's practically new.

37
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,061
Can't I just wipe it and wear it again?

38
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,147
Throw it away.
Let's go get you a new pair of shoes.

39
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,078
Where's my luggage bag?

40
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,834
DEATH

41
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,598
Let's see.

42
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,434
They look nice.

43
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,519
Wear those.

44
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,815
No, they're not my style.

45
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,360
They're way better than the tacky
poop-colored ones you had earlier.

46
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,737
Don't ever wear stuff like that.

47
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,155
I hate that color.

48
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,493
Then, did you tell me
to throw that shoe away because--

49
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,203
Because it was tacky and poop-colored.

50
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,913
Not because it was dangerous?

51
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,583
I never said it was dangerous.

52
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,129
If you don't like those, wear these.

53
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,424
No.

54
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:03,428
I'm going to choose
exactly the same one as earlier.

55
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,848
Just wear them.
The store's going to close soon.

56
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:07,932
Forget it.

57
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,770
Thank you for coming to our store.

58
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:13,896
My goodness.

59
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:19,402
I didn't even get to buy my shoes
because you were being so fussy.

60
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,737
If we had more time,

61
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,281
I would never have bought these.

62
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,325
Well, that's too bad.

63
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,452
Every place has a closing time.

64
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,581
I bought you the new shoes,
so start working from tomorrow.

65
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,041
Let's get the facts straight.

66
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,835
You picked whatever you wanted,
and I'm the one who bought them.

67
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,046
And I'm not going to work at your hotel.

68
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,590
What are you going
to make me do there anyway?

69
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,355
You'll be consoling the ones
who closed the doors with frustration.

70
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,608
Closed what doors?

71
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,652
Closed the doors to their lives.

72
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:15,917
Death.

73
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,354
Mr. Kim Byeong-du.

74
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,443
I've come to escort you.

75
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:09,428
You've started a long journey.

76
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,602
I hope you safely cross
the bridge of the Samdo River.

77
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,922
When people die in this world,
most of them cross the bridge

78
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,382
over the Samdo River

79
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,134
and go to another world.

80
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,765
But some souls
fail to find their way there.

81
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,142
You also saw some of them.

82
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,396
Those who foolishly stay in this world

83
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,651
even when their lives here have ended.

84
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,368
Just like how you're standing here

85
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,954
even when the department store
has already closed?

86
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,540
Good metaphor.

87
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,667
You understood it very well.

88
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,710
Those who come to my hotel

89
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,214
are souls who got lost
on their way to the afterlife.

90
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,513
So you're saying your hotel guests
are all ghosts.

91
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,724
And that's why you made me see them.

92
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,477
Come to Hotel del Luna.

93
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,272
You'll be safe if you stay by my side.

94
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:38,035
The most dangerous thing you can do is
to try and run away without permission.

95
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,745
Don't do it.

96
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,506
Koo Chan-sung,
wear your new shoes tomorrow

97
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,010
and make sure you get on subway Line Four.

98
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,639
Jang Man-wol.

99
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,020
I told you to refer to me
as your boss. Call me "Ms. Jang."

100
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,313
What about you?

101
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,481
Where do you stand?

102
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,818
Is your door not shut yet?

103
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,614
Or are you one of those hanging around
after their doors are shut?

104
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,001
You're not a normal human being like me.

105
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,170
I can tell that much
from what I experienced today.

106
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,049
You said those who hold deep grudges
can kill people.

107
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,093
You said you could kill me.

108
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,304
Does that make you a vengeful ghost too?

109
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,184
The one

110
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,354
standing right beside you now is
probably a vengeful ghost.

111
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,902
You shut your mouth right away.

112
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,864
I knew it. You're totally my cup of tea.

113
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:00,868
Gosh, I'm...

114
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,223
"A vengeful ghost"?

115
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,782
Here you go. I'll give you more.

116
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,283
Let's eat. Come here.

117
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,577
Come on.

118
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,888
Kitties, eat more.

119
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,559
Yun-seo.

120
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,686
Yun-seo.

121
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,094
Meow.

122
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,347
A big cat. You're a big cat.

123
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,315
Yun-seo.

124
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,942
What were you staring at?

125
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,403
Meow. I saw a big cat.

126
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,407
I was so worried about you.

127
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,669
Is this tree alive or dead?

128
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,716
It hasn't grown a single leaf
or flower for over a millennium.

129
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,718
Does it mean it's dead?

130
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,846
Where do you stand?

131
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,890
Is your door not shut yet?

132
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,727
Or are you one of those hanging around
after their doors are shut?

133
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,272
It is still alive.

134
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,233
You said

135
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,444
that this tree is like your second self.

136
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:46,784
Right, so can we say that I am alive?

137
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,082
I prepared a great bottle of champagne
for you.

138
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,583
Would you like some now?

139
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,754
Sure, not just a bottle though.
I want a whole crate.

140
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,761
Someone's here.

141
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,517
A very special guest is here.

142
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,062
I should go welcome the guest.

143
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,468
Ms. Jang, wasn't that a tiger?

144
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,803
It's dangerous

145
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,557
for a soul of a mystical creature
to be wandering like that.

146
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,767
Did you kick out the tiger?

147
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,605
Can't you do your job better?

148
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,816
You should've sensed it
and welcomed the guest.

149
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,776
I've been working here for almost 60 years

150
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,612
but never seen a tiger coming as a guest.

151
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,863
Do your job properly.

152
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,825
A ton of ghosts want to work here
to stay in the living realm.

153
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,745
If you have complaints,
just get on the bus to the afterlife.

154
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:13,829
I won't stop you.

155
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,999
I got Koo Chan-sung involved
because I'm bad at my job, you know.

156
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,877
I'm not that competent,
but I'm quite lucky.

157
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,921
Did you die young because you're so lucky?

158
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,883
Gosh, she's so mean.

159
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,510
Ms. Jang, I'll work harder!

160
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,847
DEAR KOO CHAN-SUNG, HAPPY BIRTHDAY

161
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,518
Hey, when did you get here?

162
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,021
Didn't you say you were going somewhere?

163
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,149
I was so excited when you told me
you'd stay at my place,

164
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,193
then disappointed
thinking you were leaving again.

165
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,653
Hey, let's have a welcome party.

166
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,614
What do you want to drink?
Beer, hard liquor, or soju, pick one.

167
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,743
Why are you all quiet?

168
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,746
Chan-sung.

169
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,540
Hey, Chan-sung.

170
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,170
You're not even answering me.
Let's have beer, then.

171
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,508
YOU'VE BEEN HIRED BY HOTEL DEL LUNA

172
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,302
Does that make you a vengeful ghost too?

173
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,600
Was that too mean?

174
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,306
I saw a glamorous sign flashing,

175
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,892
and it was covered with ivy
on the outside.

176
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,061
It was a fabulous-looking hotel.

177
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,691
"Hotel del Luna."

178
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,736
It looks more ordinary than I expected.

179
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,546
Is it closed during the day?

180
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,468
I scared you, didn't I?

181
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,221
You're not dead.

182
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,893
-No.
-Look at our rates and decide.

183
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,940
ROOM RATES

184
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,235
Your rooms are ridiculously expensive.

185
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,112
Yes. They're very expensive, aren't they?

186
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,531
But we must abide by our rules,
so no discount is allowed.

187
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,283
You sound like you don't want me
as a guest.

188
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,204
With that amount of money, you can stay
at the five-star hotel nearby.

189
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,165
I would've done that
if I had come here as a guest,

190
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,292
but I'm not here as a guest.

191
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,131
"Dear Koo..."

192
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,719
You're the new manager, Mr. Koo Chan-sung.

193
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,388
I haven't accepted the position.
I'm just visiting.

194
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,848
Ms. Jang is waiting for you.

195
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,725
You can go up this way, Mr. Manager.

196
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,478
I'm not a manager.

197
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,271
Okay, sure. This way, please.

198
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,392
Are there no guests at the moment?

199
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,185
All the rooms are full.

200
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,396
But it's quiet
because most of them are asleep.

201
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,566
It's more ordinary than what I've heard.

202
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,235
I've heard this hotel has
a sealike outdoor pool and a rooftop bar.

203
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,862
We take pride in those two facilities.

204
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,156
So you actually have them?

205
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,490
Would you like to take a look,

206
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,825
Mr. Manager?

207
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,618
No, thanks. I don't need to see them.

208
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,872
And I told you
I'm not the manager of this hotel.

209
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,665
Then shall I call you Chan-sung?

210
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,750
Mr. Koo Chan-sung.

211
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,548
Ms. Jang is waiting for you.

212
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,186
You can think
that it's around 3 a.m. here now

213
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,146
for a regular hotel.

214
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,190
He said all the rooms are occupied.

215
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,817
So, they're all occupied by ghosts?

216
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,625
I'm a human

217
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,544
just like you.

218
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,444
She's been alive...

219
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,405
ever since then...

220
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,367
until now?

221
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,796
She'll be here soon.

222
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,090
Excuse me.

223
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,300
Have you been working here
for a long time?

224
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,470
I started working here when I turned 40.

225
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,472
So it's been over 30 years.

226
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,808
What? 30 years?

227
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:11,061
I'm the only person
who ages in this hotel.

228
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:19,528
And now, you'll be taking over my job.

229
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,620
For 30 years?

230
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,458
Does that mean I need to be here
until I become that old?

231
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:38,922
Why are you so late?

232
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,511
You're not wearing the shoes
I picked out for you yesterday.

233
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,516
Those shoes are too flashy to wear

234
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,144
at the hotel I currently work at.

235
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,439
I just dropped by.
I need to go to work soon.

236
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,984
The girl wearing sunglasses
must've gone easy on you.

237
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,321
You're the one who made her
follow me around?

238
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,073
You made her follow me around
when she has no grudge against me?

239
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,283
Oh, that.

240
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,411
She's hovering around the person
she's had a connection with.

241
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,996
Once they form a connection,

242
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,457
the connection
automatically lasts forever.

243
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,584
Do you think I'm a wireless router
or something?

244
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,253
That's a great metaphor.

245
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,590
You understand things very well.
I'm starting to like you even more.

246
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,717
I don't want you to like me.

247
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,218
And I hate seeing those ghosts.

248
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,344
You need to see them.

249
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,430
And you'd better get used to it.

250
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,309
Those ghosts will be your guests
from now on.

251
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,271
Is this a new kind of religion
or something?

252
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:39,441
Is this a house owned by a shaman
who takes care of ghosts?

253
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,567
It's a hotel.

254
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,487
It's even registered
at the Jung-gu District office.

255
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,489
JUNG-GU DISTRICT OFFICE, SEOUL

256
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,407
BUSINESS REGISTRATION
HOTEL DEL LUNA

257
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,660
I searched the web all night
to find the hotel website.

258
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,912
But I couldn't find

259
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,539
a single website or post
regarding Hotel del Luna.

260
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,626
Of course, you couldn't find
a hotel website.

261
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,587
I told you
that this hotel isn't for humans.

262
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,342
You said this place
consoles ghosts, right?

263
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,471
Then what kind of services
do you provide for your guests?

264
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,931
Exorcism?

265
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,349
We don't perform an exorcism.

266
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,601
We comfort them.

267
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,205
It's the room service.

268
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,215
Eat everything you couldn't eat
while you were alive.

269
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,969
We have all kinds of food you want.

270
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,285
Sir.

271
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,537
Do you feel warm now?

272
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,006
I'll burn the firewood for you

273
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,425
until you become warm.

274
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,648
You're even reading
the original copies now.

275
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,818
You'll soon end up reading
every single book in this room.

276
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,653
Study as much as you want.

277
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:54,618
I'll get you
whatever book you want to read.

278
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,661
Thank you.

279
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:02,459
Hotel del Luna is a place
where souls who used to be humans

280
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:06,004
come to rest and do things
that they failed to fulfill

281
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,589
while they were alive.

282
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,594
In other words, it's a place
where they comfort themselves.

283
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,805
Humans are not the only ones
who need that.

284
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:19,434
Ghosts need to do it too
in order to leave with no regrets.

285
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,647
The guests are ghosts,
so the manager should be a ghost as well.

286
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,273
Why do you need someone who's human?

287
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,318
Because there are things
that only humans can do.

288
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,238
Register our business
at the district office, pay taxes,

289
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,531
receive hygiene inspections, and so on.

290
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,408
There are so many things you have to do.

291
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,994
I want to deal with this
like a normal human being.

292
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,542
This is the money I've saved up
to pay you back.

293
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,504
It's the money you gave my dad,
plus interest.

294
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,047
Take this and let me go.

295
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,103
You saved up quite a lot.

296
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,065
You're very diligent and clever.

297
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,443
I guess I won't need to worry
about losing money.

298
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:13,446
I'll take it since you gave it to me.

299
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,077
Then that means we're even.

300
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,788
I'll be off now.

301
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:22,789
Okay.

302
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,667
I was actually waiting for you
so we could leave together.

303
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:26,876
Let's go.

304
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,713
I didn't plan on leaving with you.

305
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,548
You're going to leave by yourself?

306
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:32,632
Yes.

307
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,468
Okay, then.

308
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,304
Go ahead.

309
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,549
The third floor, please.

310
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,051
Okay.

311
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,421
Why?

312
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,425
Why am I still seeing ghosts?

313
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,804
I paid you back, so I shouldn't be seeing
them anymore.

314
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,889
You just paid back what you owe me.

315
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,350
And what I gave you was a birthday gift.

316
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,018
You should

317
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,104
cherish it.

318
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,397
Are you kidding me?

319
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:15,318
How do you expect me to live a normal life
when I can see ghosts?

320
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,446
Then I guess you have no choice
but to work here.

321
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,242
Return my eyes back to normal.

322
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,955
I'm going to head out. What do you say?

323
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,331
Are you going to come with me?

324
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,251
Stay here if you don't want to.

325
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,129
Let's continue our conversation

326
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,340
once we're out of here.

327
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:59,279
The new guy looks very weakhearted.
I'm starting to get worried.

328
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,865
He looks very courageous to me.

329
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:10,081
I was more scared of Ms. Jang
than the ghosts.

330
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,332
But

331
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:15,420
he seems to have no trouble
talking to Ms. Jang.

332
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,839
That's because he doesn't know
why Ms. Jang

333
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,299
is the owner of this place.

334
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,551
Hurry.

335
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:27,974
Among all the ghosts here,
she's the scariest and the most awful.

336
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,366
-This is your car, right?
-Today,

337
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,618
I'm going to drive this one.

338
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,958
Do you own all these cars?

339
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,377
I already told you
that all our guests are ghosts.

340
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,129
Do you think they drove here?

341
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,357
You have a lot of fancy cars.

342
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,401
Do I look like a human
now that you see I have a sports car?

343
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,611
I guess you earn

344
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,157
a lot of money
by comforting the dead souls.

345
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,619
You hate that you're seeing ghosts,

346
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,704
but you like fancy things
like this car, don't you?

347
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,498
Don't you want to work for me?

348
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,542
I can't understand
how you can accumulate wealth

349
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,086
by comforting them
in a supernatural sense.

350
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,548
You began to take interest
in the hotel's profit structure.

351
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,300
I should have shown you
my cars first instead of the ghosts.

352
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,677
I'm not interested.

353
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:50,765
Why are you laughing?

354
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,809
I find it funny
that a ghost wears a seat belt.

355
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,354
I will drive you to your destination.

356
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,939
But you must fix my eyes.

357
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,650
Why are you snickering?

358
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,151
I just

359
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,154
find it funny that you believe
that I'm going to fix your eyes.

360
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,781
We had a deal.

361
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,491
If you don't fix my eyes, I can't work.

362
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,659
Right, you can't go to work

363
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,703
because you need to take care
of something else now.

364
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,414
Where are we going now?

365
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,210
To catch a tiger.

366
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,505
You're kidding, right?

367
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,693
This was...

368
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,654
the tiger's life.

369
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:50,241
Can a tiger stay at your hotel?

370
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,410
It's a mystical creature, so yes.

371
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,583
This was the last Siberian tiger which was
captured on the Korean Peninsula.

372
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,044
I remember watching the news
about receiving the tiger

373
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,462
from North Korea as a gift.

374
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,423
The tiger neither got along
with other tigers,

375
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,799
nor mated with others.

376
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,927
The tiger stayed alone
until the last moment.

377
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,554
The tiger is dead,

378
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,184
but they made it look like it's alive...

379
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,604
and put it on display here.

380
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,234
I'm not dead.

381
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,819
I still haven't died.

382
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:28,738
I'm just here.

383
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,085
Sir, did you have
the same nightmare again?

384
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,691
It was the chairman of the hotel I work at
who brought the tiger from North Korea.

385
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,359
He received it
as a token of their friendship

386
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,777
during his visit a long time ago.

387
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,779
Is that so?

388
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,784
But you said
you were looking for the tiger.

389
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,745
Why did you come to eat red bean porridge?

390
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,955
Is this restaurant relevant to the tiger?

391
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,082
Red bean porridge is
the tiger's favorite food.

392
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,793
Isn't it only natural
that the porridge comes to mind

393
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,003
when I think about the tiger?

394
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,425
I don't get how that's natural.

395
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,971
You just wanted to have
red bean porridge, didn't you?

396
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,348
This restaurant was
on The Guys Who Died After Eating.

397
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,725
Kim Jun-hyun...

398
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,101
Him again.

399
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,188
He ate five balls of sticky rice cake
all at once.

400
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,566
That guy. He's not an ordinary man.

401
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,527
How many can you eat at once?

402
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,696
I told you I had to go to work.

403
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,407
I don't have time to eat this right now.

404
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,826
You must take your time
to eat this porridge.

405
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,829
If you eat this in a hurry,
the hot rice cakes will burn your mouth.

406
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,372
I gave you the money.

407
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,665
Since you accepted the money,

408
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,626
please fix my eyes.

409
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,215
A long time ago,

410
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,843
do you know why a rice cake seller
was eaten by a tiger?

411
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,139
The seller gave away the rice cake
too easily

412
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,475
when the tiger said
that it could save his life.

413
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,435
That's why he was eaten alive.

414
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,646
The seller should have negotiated first.

415
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,986
Then I would have to live
with the woman with sunglasses forever?

416
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,114
No, bring her to my hotel.

417
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,825
I can let her stay there for a few days
and send her to the afterlife.

418
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,203
Well, if she lived a good life,
she could go in a limousine.

419
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,669
THE SAMDO RIVER

420
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,587
THIS LIFE

421
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,881
THE AFTERLIFE

422
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,112
I heard that there will be
a new manager at the hotel.

423
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:57,530
Yes,

424
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,116
I will retire soon.

425
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,578
I plan to go on a lot of fishing trips.

426
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,037
You don't

427
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,874
have that much time left.

428
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:14,130
Does that mean
I don't have much time left in this world?

429
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,722
I should start
to get things in order then.

430
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,023
I won't work at your hotel.

431
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,359
I've been offered a job
from 3 of the top 100 hotels

432
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,403
listed on Forbes.

433
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,155
Hotel del Luna

434
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:43,159
doesn't need a manager
with the Harvard MBA like me.

435
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:44,994
You don't need an MBA.

436
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,663
You can see ghosts now.

437
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,082
You're perfect for my hotel.

438
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,293
And what was that? Forbes?

439
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,212
I'm sure they wanted to hire you

440
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,255
when they didn't know
you could see ghosts.

441
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,965
If you don't work at our hotel,

442
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,967
the only thing you can become is a shaman.

443
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,889
You could be a comedian if you know
how to eat the whole bread at once.

444
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,767
Will you perform an exorcism?

445
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,101
I can get used to it.

446
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,021
Once I get used to seeing ghosts,
I can get used to ignoring them.

447
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,522
Is that so?

448
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,651
Shall we check if you can...

449
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:18,861
ignore them?

450
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,557
Go get the coffee.

451
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:52,311
Just like you said,
if you can ignore all of them

452
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,814
and bring the coffee
without spilling a drop,

453
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,899
I will believe you.

454
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,786
You can barely bring a cup of coffee.

455
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,372
Do you think
those posh hotels will want you?

456
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:47,051
But when will the new manager
start working?

457
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,636
Once he starts here,

458
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,514
will you leave the hotel
right away, Mr. No?

459
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,891
He's been stuck here for a long time now.

460
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,559
Now, you'll get to live your life.

461
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,769
Come visit us sometimes

462
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,021
and tell us what's going on
in the realm of the living.

463
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,774
What good will that do for us,
the dead souls?

464
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,068
Have fun

465
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:07,071
and come back much later.

466
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,200
You should work on emptying
all your sorrows

467
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:14,703
and walk over to the afterlife
for a new beginning.

468
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:20,126
I hoped to send all of you off myself
during my time here,

469
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,670
but that was only wishful thinking.

470
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:27,299
Without you, who will help manage
her bad temper?

471
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,760
The new manager
doesn't seem trustworthy yet.

472
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:30,970
Where is everyone?

473
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:44,108
I was saying goodbye to everyone
since I'll be leaving soon.

474
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,155
Seon-bi, you passed the State Exam
when you were alive, right?

475
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,322
Yes, ma'am.

476
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,867
-Just so you know--
-Zip it.

477
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,120
Isn't that better
than the modern-day Harvard MBA?

478
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,831
The MBA doesn't even hold a candle to it.

479
00:40:58,914 --> 00:40:59,790
Ms. Choe.

480
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,001
You said you lived in a mansion
that had 99 rooms, correct?

481
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,169
Yes, ma'am.

482
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,130
I had countless employees.

483
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,173
And you?

484
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,800
I was the richest
and attended the top school

485
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,135
in the whole Gyeongseong.

486
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,387
Right? Before you guys died,

487
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,056
you were way better off
than Koo Chan-sung.

488
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:20,019
He thinks he's something
because of that joke of a Forbes list.

489
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,103
Darn it!

490
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,571
Ms. Jang, just like last time,

491
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:34,450
I'm afraid I'll have to
check into the hospital for a few days.

492
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:36,911
Are you not feeling well?

493
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,706
When will that Koo Chan-sung be here?

494
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,708
He claimed he could endure it,
so I let him.

495
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,460
He'll crack in a few days though.

496
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,338
He's just too weak, you see.

497
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,258
Now that there's another living human
to take your spot,

498
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,801
I'll let you as I agreed.

499
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:56,472
Enjoy your last moments
as a living human being

500
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,724
and move on.

501
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,866
He's been serving her for decades.

502
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,827
Would it have killed her
to seem more concerned?

503
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,220
I look forward to working with you.

504
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,805
Nice to meet you.

505
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,895
THE FOUR SEASONS OF BAEKDU MOUNTAIN

506
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,359
SIBERIAN TIGER IN BAEKDU MOUNTAIN

507
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,979
Stay calm. You just have to ignore it.

508
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,040
Mr. Koo!

509
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,544
That's right.

510
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,672
My clients are VIPs from abroad,

511
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,299
not ghosts.

512
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,658
Mr. Koo?

513
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,787
Don't make a sound.

514
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,499
If I keep quiet, she'll leave me alone
just like before.

515
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,085
Please come and say hello.

516
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,340
What do I do? I already looked at them,

517
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,883
so I can't simply turn around.

518
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,176
But if I make a sound,

519
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,470
this ghost will take her shades off
and come at me.

520
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,765
Mr. Koo?

521
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,060
How can I not answer my boss, though?

522
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,939
But I don't think I can ignore the ghost
if she takes off her sunglasses.

523
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:54,817
So...

524
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:56,985
I'll...

525
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,721
What was that?

526
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,766
I thought you were going to ignore it?

527
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,810
Instead, you splashed into the water.

528
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,564
What about the next time?

529
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,233
Will you jump off the roof?

530
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:42,489
If I do, I'll be going
to your hotel as a guest.

531
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,199
I won't go there again before then.

532
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,452
I'll ignore whatever I see.

533
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,247
What's this?

534
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,209
I guess you couldn't ignore this.

535
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,462
You're curious

536
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:59,631
about what happened
to this last Siberian tiger.

537
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,885
What happened to him?

538
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,764
Let's go find out.

539
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:24,615
Ring the bell.

540
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,327
This makes no sense.

541
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:30,162
He is the chairman
of the hotel I work for.

542
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,873
A mere employee can't just pay
a visit to his chairman's house.

543
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:33,832
Why not?

544
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,169
You said yourself
that you were scouted, right?

545
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,255
Where's your pride?

546
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:45,093
Let me call his secretary
and receive permission to-- Hey!

547
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,561
It's the first time an employee
has come to see me in my sickbed.

548
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,104
I heard you were ill, sir.

549
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,233
I wanted to show my respect.
But I apologize for visiting so abruptly.

550
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,692
No need to apologize.

551
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,237
Anyway, is she your wife?

552
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,369
Yes, she wanted to show her respect too.

553
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,913
Well, you seem to be a couple in love.

554
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:17,459
I've stayed only in my room
ever since I fell sick.

555
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,338
There was no one to talk to either,
so this is fun.

556
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,103
She must be looking for the bathroom.

557
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,273
Hey, this looks expensive.

558
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,483
Is it authentic? Tell me.

559
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:49,116
She lived abroad for so long

560
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,993
that she speaks casually with everyone.

561
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,537
Is that so?

562
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,628
You should sit back down.

563
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,260
You must have an eye for paintings.

564
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,470
This is a painting

565
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:14,099
by a famous North Korean artist.

566
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:17,102
When I visited the North,
they gave it to me as a gift

567
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,271
along with a Siberian tiger.

568
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,815
We saw the tiger on display, sir.

569
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,484
So that tiger...

570
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,824
I brought him here from North Korea,

571
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,661
but he didn't mate while he lived here

572
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,831
and ended up dying as a lonesome soul.

573
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,835
Because there's no need for him
to leave anything meaningful here.

574
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,922
Everything that is precious to him

575
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,092
lies in a place he can't go back to.

576
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,180
That's why I feel sorry for him.

577
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:56,683
I keep seeing the tiger in my dreams.

578
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,771
The one who brought him here,
should return him.

579
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,398
But the stuffed tiger has
already become a symbol

580
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,192
of exchanges between the two Koreas.

581
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,236
It's not up to me to get rid of it

582
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,572
or send it back.

583
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,957
I guess this photo will be the only proof

584
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:07,170
of the time I've spent
working at this hotel.

585
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:11,967
Will she remember
a mere human being like me

586
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,386
who's just passing by here?

587
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,912
The tiger was definitely
next to the chairman.

588
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,457
Why did you let it get away
instead of catching it?

589
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,751
It didn't want to come with me.
I can't force it.

590
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:49,254
It looks like it's waiting
until the chairman dies.

591
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,548
Is the tiger making the chairman ill?

592
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,134
If that's the case, it's really dangerous.

593
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,802
We don't have time to eat hoe right now.

594
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,930
I looked at Baekdu Mountain earlier,
so I suddenly craved hoe.

595
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:02,142
You looked at a mountain.
Why are you craving fish?

596
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:06,229
The anthem goes,
"Baekdu Mountain and East Sea."

597
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,606
They come as a set.

598
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:11,568
It's only natural to crave seafood
when you see Baekdu Mountain.

599
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,904
You just wanted to have hoe.

600
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:16,823
I don't care what it is.

601
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,326
A ghost is torturing a human.
We must go back.

602
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:20,619
Sure.

603
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,580
You do have to go back there.

604
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:26,750
Go and tell the chairman
that you can get rid of the tiger

605
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,377
in return for something.

606
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,339
In return for what?

607
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,549
The expensive painting we saw earlier.

608
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,384
In return for that.

609
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:37,928
What?

610
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:40,472
He'll give it to you if you tell him
he's sick because of the tiger.

611
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:43,934
That old geezer is loaded.

612
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,980
Now, I understand
how you make profits with your hotel.

613
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:52,943
You extort money from people
who are suffering because of ghosts.

614
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:55,278
Is it in my job descriptions
as a human manager?

615
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,363
That's right.

616
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,241
It will be your job from now on.

617
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,995
I won't scam people like that.

618
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:15,006
Is this how you conned my dad too?

619
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,929
I saved your dad's life.

620
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,390
And in exchange, I got you.

621
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:26,434
That's why I'm protecting you too.

622
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,937
Without me by your side,

623
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,273
you'll be dead.

624
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:33,817
The vengeful ghost will torture me?

625
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,821
I think you've done that enough yourself.

626
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,956
I've made good on my promise to you.

627
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,419
I'm going back to my human life.

628
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,033
Take off your sunglasses
if that's what you want.

629
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:25,410
I even saw a tiger.
Nothing can scare me now!

630
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:26,870
I'm not scared of you now.

631
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:27,871
Take them off!

632
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,191
I've been waiting and wondering
when you'd come.

633
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,818
You said you've worked there for 30 years.

634
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:02,072
Did that woman force you to work there
for 30 years?

635
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,156
No.

636
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,785
It was my decision to work at the hotel.

637
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,621
You spent half of your life
working at a place like that?

638
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:14,334
Because Hotel del Luna was worth my time.

639
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,253
I don't understand its worth.

640
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:19,673
I don't want to extort

641
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,342
billions of won from the chairman
under her instruction.

642
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:24,928
And I don't think I can either.

643
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,179
Hotel del Luna

644
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:30,350
can't be explained by the logic
of the human world.

645
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:34,270
The value of money and power
seems different at the hotel.

646
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:38,149
That's why I can't possibly judge

647
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:41,361
what Ms. Jang does for the hotel
by our human standards.

648
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,366
I'm sure you hate the hotel

649
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:49,452
and don't want to face it right now.

650
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,663
I'm sure you want to avoid it.

651
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:56,459
However, if you gather
your courage and face it,

652
00:54:57,002 --> 00:55:00,255
you might be able to find

653
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,299
the worth of the hotel, just like I did.

654
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,554
Chan-sung.

655
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,348
What are you doing there alone?

656
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,517
I'm having a conversation.

657
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,269
By yourself?

658
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,200
He must be lonely.

659
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,880
Through your job, you'll find out

660
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:46,384
a secret world that
no one else knows about.

661
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:50,388
Don't you think it will be fun?

662
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,173
Oh!

663
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,181
Mr. No.

664
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,273
Ms. Jang.

665
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,485
Mr. No is here as a guest.

666
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,377
Ms. Jang.

667
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,505
I worked here every day,

668
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,007
but it feels weird
to come here as a guest.

669
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:09,968
Are you dead?

670
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,470
I'm sorry.

671
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:16,141
I lost my life while I was out.

672
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,353
I finally let you go.

673
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,440
You probably didn't have
a chance to live like a human being.

674
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,817
As I served my guests here,

675
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:30,071
I lived a meaningful life in my own way.

676
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:35,452
A long time ago,
when I wanted to end my life...

677
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,413
If I hadn't met you that day,

678
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:43,168
my life would have been
short and pitiable.

679
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,254
I'm really glad

680
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:49,757
that I could stay at Hotel del Luna.

681
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,634
Glad, my foot.

682
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:55,597
You couldn't even make a family
who would remember you.

683
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,766
As I was the only one
who got older at this hotel,

684
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:03,563
you were my sister,

685
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,317
my daughter,

686
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,820
and my granddaughter.

687
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,868
Now that you have a reliable replacement,

688
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,579
I can leave without worries.

689
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:33,760
Since...

690
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:36,971
I can't die,

691
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,059
I can't tell you
that we'll meet again someday...

692
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,311
or something like that.

693
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,281
I hope

694
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:59,494
that your time will start running
once again someday.

695
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:29,542
I apologize for coming back
so late at night.

696
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,836
I needed to say something important.

697
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,380
Is it about the tiger?

698
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,300
The woman you were with earlier.

699
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,844
Ms. Jang Man-wol came by to see me.

700
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,512
Did she tell you

701
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,057
that the tiger was wandering around you?

702
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:50,396
I brought him here,
and he could never go back home.

703
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:54,442
I've always been sorry for him because
it felt like I was keeping his soul here

704
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,402
even after his life ended.

705
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,032
Come out.

706
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:04,327
Stop staying in that body
as if you were still alive.

707
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:06,454
Come out.

708
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,456
I'll help you leave.

709
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:13,252
As a punishment
for bringing over the tiger,

710
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,797
she said she had to take my painting.

711
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,800
I know it's hard to believe,

712
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,260
but the tiger wasn't just your dream.

713
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,597
I gave the painting to her.

714
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,644
If I could atone for what I did,

715
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,230
I could give up even more than that.

716
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,736
The painting was of Baekdu Mountain.

717
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,613
The mountain and the tiger

718
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,824
are part of a set.

719
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:46,494
I wonder why I never thought of that.

720
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:09,350
The place you wish to go to

721
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,020
no longer exists in this world.

722
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:17,024
However, the man who brought you here
provided a place for you to stay.

723
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:19,694
Go...

724
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,321
and rest in peace.

725
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:23,818
Excuse me.

726
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:30,199
I know where you should go.

727
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:35,830
I'll take you there.

728
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:51,262
I always avoided you
because I hated having you on my tail.

729
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,557
Come to think of it, I never asked you
why you were following me.

730
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,105
I thought about it.

731
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:04,817
I know you couldn't see when you were
alive, but maybe you can now.

732
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,944
Stop thinking that you can't,

733
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,613
and take another look.

734
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:26,923
See?

735
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:28,716
Your eyes are back.

736
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,064
THE FOUR SEASONS OF BAEKDU MOUNTAIN

737
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:29,235
Because there's no need for him
to leave anything meaningful here.

738
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,946
Everything that is precious to him

739
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:35,116
lies in a place he can't go back to.

740
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,751
Did the tiger return safely
to Baekdu Mountain?

741
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:48,879
I'm sorry I was mistaken about you.

742
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:57,138
That's right.

743
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:59,724
The chairman said a burden on your heart
is what makes you sick.

744
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,892
I'M SORRY I WAS MISTAKEN ABOUT YOU

745
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,602
SENT

746
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,813
There. It's a decent thing to do.

747
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:10,943
Please don't.

748
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:15,614
-You shouldn't touch things like this.
-My goodness.

749
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:16,824
I'm so sorry.

750
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,599
Just ignore it.

751
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:43,642
You can do this.

752
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:12,838
FROM KOO CHAN-SUNG

753
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,177
She's not replying.

754
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:45,371
Excuse me?

755
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,209
Is the pool still open?

756
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:55,131
Yes, ma'am. It's open
even during the nights these days.

757
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:56,924
It's this way...

758
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,969
Got it. Thank you.

759
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:16,735
If you get attacked by those
who hold deep grudges,

760
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,195
you could end up getting killed.

761
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,531
You should learn to differentiate them.

762
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,316
The tiger has returned safely
to Baekdu Mountain,

763
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:23,904
and I'm here to forgive you in person.

764
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:28,284
Thank you.

765
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:49,847
I envy trees.

766
01:11:50,764 --> 01:11:52,433
They don't have to wander around.

767
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:55,060
It must be nice to just put down roots
and settle down.

768
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:57,980
What?

769
01:11:58,188 --> 01:12:00,065
You'll build a house for me
with this tree?

770
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:02,443
Forget it.

771
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,695
I don't plan on building a house
and living with you.

772
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:32,431
You woke up.

773
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:34,808
Ms. Jang is waiting for you, Mr. Manager.

774
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:36,310
I told you I'm not the manager...

775
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,402
It's your first time here at night, right?

776
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:48,257
This is what Hotel del Luna
really looks like.

777
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:56,682
Through your job, you'll find out

778
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:59,476
a secret world that
no one else knows about.

779
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:02,354
Don't you think it will be fun?

780
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,490
Ms. Jang is here.

781
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:29,399
This is what it was like
to have a warm body

782
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:30,609
with a beating heart.

783
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:32,736
Did you cast a spell on me or something?

784
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:34,905
Is that why I dreamed about you?

785
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:38,325
Koo Chan-sung. I thought you were weak,

786
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,244
but you're actually very healthy.

787
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:43,247
Do you know what Ms. Jang was like
when she was alive?

788
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,540
Leaves have sprouted.

789
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:47,251
Your time will start flowing again.

790
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:48,877
Let's get Mr. Koo out of the hotel.

791
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:52,047
If he goes crazy
and roams around like a madman,

792
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:54,508
he won't be able to come here
even though he sees ghosts.

793
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,472
