1
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,992
It's a little kid.

2
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,667
It seems like her parents

3
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,296
already crossed the Samdo River.

4
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:33,885
How did this little girl manage
to stay alive for so long?

5
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,512
When I came to take her,

6
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,139
I was also surprised to see
that she was still alive.

7
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,227
This little girl is trying so hard
to stay alive.

8
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,354
Why don't you take a step back?

9
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:48,233
But she won't last more than a few hours.

10
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,819
You never know

11
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,531
what might happen
in that short amount of time.

12
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,431
Father, I see something over there.

13
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,516
What?

14
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,311
My gosh.

15
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,775
Hey, it's very dirty.
Don't touch anything.

16
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,735
They're dead.

17
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,445
They must be from Goguryeo.

18
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,824
I think they were killed while wandering
around after their country collapsed.

19
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,284
Let me see.

20
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,078
Let's take the wagon.

21
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,456
Thank you for the wagon. My goodness.

22
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,811
She moved.

23
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,986
Can you see me?

24
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,199
You're alive.

25
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,001
Don't be sad.

26
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:34,464
I'm sure your parents went
to the Guest House of the Moon.

27
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,842
I heard it from a granny
who sells medicine.

28
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,969
There's a place called
the Guest House of the Moon

29
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,554
somewhere in the wilderness.

30
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,060
It's where dead people go to get some rest
before they leave for the afterlife.

31
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,896
What's your name?

32
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,413
Man-wol.

33
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,584
The moon.

34
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,878
Your name means the "full moon."

35
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,632
It's pretty.

36
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,263
Do you think

37
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,101
we already met in our past lives?

38
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,899
I'm 1,300 years old.

39
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,486
I wonder how I got to meet you now.

40
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,032
Sometimes, it takes 1,300 years

41
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,243
for two people to meet each other.

42
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,332
Do you know

43
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,626
that it takes a very long time

44
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,212
for the light from the stars to reach us?

45
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:03,261
The Orion Nebula is
1,300 lightyears away from Earth.

46
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,638
That means it takes 1,300 years

47
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,934
for us to be able to see it
with our own eyes.

48
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,603
Really?

49
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,564
Where is it right now?

50
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:21,154
You can only see it during winter,
so you can't see it right now.

51
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,616
Winter?

52
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,203
Starting from the next full moon,

53
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,540
the energy of the moon
will be withdrawn from this place.

54
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,462
From now on, you won't be
getting any new guests.

55
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,922
I guess you're telling me
to close it down.

56
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,383
Your Guest House of the Moon...

57
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,180
will only exist

58
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,974
up until the next full moon.

59
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,564
It's a pity that we can only see it

60
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,691
in winter.

61
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,154
Chan-sung, is there any star
we can see right now

62
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,864
instead of the Orion Nebula?

63
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,616
Well...

64
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,329
I'm not sure.
I'm not very good with astronomy.

65
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,747
So I can't answer that question.

66
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,002
You dumbhead from Harvard.

67
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,545
You could've just pointed

68
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,215
at any one of those stars in the sky.

69
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,676
Do you think I would've corrected you
if you were wrong?

70
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,638
I would've just acted
like I was impressed.

71
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:33,976
Shall I, then?

72
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,313
Let's see.
I should pick a beautiful, shining one

73
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,190
since you like shiny things.

74
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,691
Forget it. It's too late.

75
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,908
There really is one more.

76
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,661
Another star you can see
after living through 1,300 years.

77
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,957
Me, Koo Chan-sung.

78
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,419
I told you my name means a brilliant star.

79
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,678
All right. You're all I need.

80
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,223
I don't care about the star
that I can only see in winter.

81
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,019
I'll be happy as long as I can see you.

82
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,319
Look at you, Chan-sung.
You shine so brightly.

83
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,280
Twinkle twinkle! I'm so dazzled!

84
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,285
Look at you, Man-wol.

85
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,537
You're looking so bright
like the full moon.

86
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,788
"The full moon"?

87
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,331
Or we could call you my lucky charm.

88
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,876
You deserve the nickname
as you've gotten much nicer.

89
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,837
You said I'd be reincarnated as a pig.

90
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,214
You said you'd happily be
reincarnated as chicken noodles.

91
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,676
What if that actually happens?

92
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,222
It's okay. I'll be the fresh kimchi
that goes with it.

93
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:55,808
Really?

94
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,186
-Seriously?
-Yes.

95
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,605
-You really mean it, right?
-Yes.

96
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,149
You said you'd be the fresh kimchi.
You promised me.

97
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,109
Yes, I'll really be
the fresh kimchi for you.

98
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,809
Did Mr. Kim go somewhere?

99
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,688
He went out after chatting
with those guests.

100
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:43,940
Yes.

101
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,569
Where did he go?

102
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,490
My new novel will be released.

103
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,325
It's about a perverted scholar, Kim Si-ik,

104
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,327
who passed the National State Exam
for nothing.

105
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,499
I should just leave before I must face
such humiliation.

106
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,042
I should really leave.

107
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,093
Let's not forget to say goodbye
to each other before we leave.

108
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,720
Don't leave without saying anything.
I'm serious.

109
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,306
Gosh.

110
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,269
Oh, dear.

111
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,110
Ms. Jang, I can't find Mr. Kim anywhere.

112
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,404
-He's probably with Hyeon-jung.
-No, he's not.

113
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,656
I couldn't find him anywhere in the hotel.

114
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,991
Maybe he stepped out.

115
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,952
He rarely goes outside the hotel.

116
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,704
Even when he does, he never leaves alone.

117
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,248
He still sounds like a man
living in the Joseon era, you know.

118
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,666
Apparently, he turned pale

119
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,127
and left the bar
while chatting with some guests

120
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,337
about a scholar
who aced the National State Exam.

121
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,257
A scholar
who aced the National State Exam?

122
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,885
You know about his situation, right?

123
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,223
By any chance, was his name

124
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,768
Kim Si-ik when he was alive?

125
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:09,233
Who is the guest that spoke ill

126
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,193
of Kim Seon-bi?

127
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,324
I was telling him that I died
before I could publish

128
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,619
the book I wrote
about the scholar, Kim Si-ik.

129
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,413
And the novel mocks Kim Si-ik, doesn't it?

130
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:26,042
It's a fiction I wrote
based on thorough research.

131
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,420
So that novel will actually be released?

132
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,507
I already sent the manuscript
to my publisher.

133
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:37,178
They'll publish it as my posthumous work.

134
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,473
Which publisher did you send it to?

135
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,391
And how many people have read this?

136
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,936
I still write a novel in longhand,

137
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,980
so there's only one manuscript.

138
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,900
I'm sure the editor-in-chief is
the only one who's read it.

139
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,239
I must find this publisher.

140
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,292
His handwriting is so bad as always.

141
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,795
Gosh, my eyes hurt.

142
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,548
SALACIOUS SCHOLAR, KIM SI-IK

143
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,219
Is the air conditioner on?

144
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,680
HAEGONG PUBLISHING COMPANY

145
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,978
I am not a salacious scholar.

146
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,231
This isn't fair.

147
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,448
First, try to buy the manuscript from him.

148
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,951
The money from selling the horses
will be enough.

149
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,495
But I'm worried Mr. Kim
might cause trouble before we do that.

150
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,247
If he does anything to harm humans,

151
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,457
the Grim Reaper won't let it slide.

152
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,920
Kim Seon-bi is like a crane.

153
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,755
Have you seen a crane attacking humans?

154
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,216
He won't harm anyone.

155
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,593
Still, he's been holding a grudge
for 500 years.

156
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,178
Cranes make sure their feathers stay

157
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,514
as white as snow
even when they're standing in mud.

158
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,309
Seon-bi has waited for 500 years

159
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,395
to clear his name.

160
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,413
I AM NOT SALACIOUS

161
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,345
I'm Kim Si-ik. I am not salacious.

162
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,104
I scared him too much.

163
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,607
I just want to make sure
the book won't be published.

164
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,486
Should I have gone easy on him?

165
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,116
Sir!

166
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,118
What's wrong?

167
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,328
I saw a ghost.

168
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,913
-Sorry?
-A ghost?

169
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,291
I just saw the ghost of Kim Si-ik.

170
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,919
-Hold on.
-You saw his ghost?

171
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,463
-It means the book will be a hit!
-We will hit the jackpot!

172
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,423
My gosh, sir!

173
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,927
-I was really scared.
-What a lucky dream!

174
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,262
It wasn't a dream.
I really saw him, you fool!

175
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,473
-Are we celebrating tonight?
-A team dinner will be nice!

176
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,517
-Guys, how about sushi?
-My gosh.

177
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,070
Mr. Kim.

178
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:45,533
Mr. Koo, Ms. Jang. You knew I'd be here?

179
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,076
Look at yourself.

180
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,702
Let's go back to the hotel for now.

181
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,789
I cannot go back to the hotel
for I am too humiliated.

182
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,709
I'll just take the bus here
and head to the afterlife.

183
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,170
Why are you being like this?

184
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,006
You're the ace of our hotel,
and you're like a dignified crane.

185
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,467
Cranes do not hang their heads.

186
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,843
Keep your chin up!

187
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,433
I'll get the manuscript
from the publisher no matter what.

188
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,143
Mr. Koo...

189
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,610
You're refusing to return to the hotel,
so you should stay in Chan-sung's room.

190
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,779
Thank you, Mr. Koo.

191
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,908
Only the editor-in-chief has read this,
and he hasn't even finished it yet.

192
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,911
I went through hoops to persuade him
because the author is very famous.

193
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,705
How did you persuade him?

194
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,665
I told him that Kim Si-ik is my ancestor.

195
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,919
He lied that he's your descendant,
and I spent a fortune to buy it from him.

196
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,880
Thank you so much.

197
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,341
Salacious Scholar, Kim Si-ik?

198
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,511
I suppose I'll never be able
to clear my name.

199
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,097
If it's not true,
explain and prove your innocence.

200
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,766
Could you tell us what happened?

201
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,647
Everyone called me a genius
because I passed

202
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,774
the Local State Exam at a very young age.

203
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,445
However, I failed the National State Exam
every time.

204
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,283
After the age of 40,

205
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,620
I left my hometown
and settled down in Hanyang.

206
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,997
Then I focused solely
on studying for the exam.

207
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,460
While I studied alone,
whenever I felt lonely,

208
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:24,214
watching how others lived
was the only thing that gave me joy.

209
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:28,844
I saw a young girl
looking after her blind father,

210
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:33,265
and I also saw brothers and sisters
argue with each other all the time.

211
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,892
-My gosh.
-Hey.

212
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,312
It was beautiful
to see a young couple fall in love

213
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,065
disregarding their social status.

214
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,778
Whenever I grew bored of reading books,

215
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:50,658
I came up with stories
based on what I had seen on the street.

216
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,993
Master, this is so sad.

217
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,828
What happens next?

218
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,084
Of course, back then, for scholars,

219
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,962
writing a story in something else
than Chinese characters

220
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,339
was considered unconventional.

221
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:10,177
However, the stories I wrote
weren't vulgar at all.

222
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,221
Wait, you wrote stories

223
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,848
about a dutiful daughter,
a faithful woman, and siblings...

224
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,643
Are they about Sim Cheong,
Chun-hyang, Heung-bu, and Nol-bu?

225
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,937
You wrote all of those stories?

226
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,482
They're known to be
anonymous works to this day.

227
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,860
If that's true, you're the Shakespeare
of the Joseon Dynasty.

228
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:31,365
But those stories ruined my life

229
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,451
when my life was at its peak.

230
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,788
Master, congratulations.
You'll make a glorious return.

231
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,916
Your appointment will be canceled.

232
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,671
What do you mean?

233
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,215
It's my understanding
that you wrote these stories.

234
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,551
You call yourself a scholar,

235
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,137
and yet you wrote the so-called stories

236
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,723
about lowly lives of the commoners?

237
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,516
You are a disgrace to fellow scholars!

238
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:01,103
All the scholars will step in to make sure
that someone as vulgar and nasty as you

239
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,772
is never appointed as an official.

240
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,817
I only wrote stories about people's lives.

241
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,777
How could you call these stories vulgar?

242
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,113
A story of an adulterous couple.

243
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:15,117
A story where the order
between brothers is broken.

244
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,829
A story that confuses the people
through absurd imaginations.

245
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:22,082
How can a scholar come up
with such stories?

246
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,377
Master!

247
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,300
Kim Si-ik.

248
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,510
If you have any shame,

249
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,305
do not ever dare lift up your face again.

250
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,311
Due to the petition brought
by other scholars, I was disqualified.

251
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:47,357
The son of a powerful family
took my position.

252
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,113
My father who was in my hometown
was so humiliated

253
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,366
that he refused to eat and passed away.

254
00:17:56,533 --> 00:18:00,412
I was too ashamed to face my wife
who had been supporting me.

255
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,836
As I could neither go back
to my hometown nor stay there,

256
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,755
I died

257
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,258
all by myself, feeling lost in the world.

258
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,388
I feel so wronged.

259
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:33,153
At first, he waited for
his so-called humiliating stories

260
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,447
to disappear in this world.

261
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,243
But people puffed up his stories,
and the stories spread even more.

262
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,536
Everyone in this world

263
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,956
knows the stories of Chun-hyang
and Sim Cheong.

264
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,041
I'm sure a part of him was
feeling hopeful.

265
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,419
He could have cleared his name
and felt proud instead.

266
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,631
However, there's no evidence.

267
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,176
Can you truly trust everything he says?

268
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,639
No wonder
someone would write a book about him.

269
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,766
People don't know
about the stories he wrote.

270
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,685
He just became a salacious scholar

271
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,770
who got disqualified in the end

272
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,106
because of his so-called vulgar stories.

273
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,777
I will read every page of this manuscript.

274
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,738
Mr. Kim is okay though, right?

275
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,366
He will stay in my room for now.

276
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,787
Sanchez.

277
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,712
I remember seeing you
at the dinner the other day.

278
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,090
Yes. What brings you here?

279
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,383
I have a situation,

280
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,927
so I'll be staying
in Mr. Koo's room for a while.

281
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,304
I see.

282
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,724
Then does he also work at the hotel?

283
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,351
He's the Grim Reaper.

284
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,815
He's not an easy man to meet
when you're alive.

285
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,108
Say hello.

286
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,407
But he's not here
because he has business with me, right?

287
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,702
No. I'm here to console
an old friend of mine.

288
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,170
The Grim Reaper bought me some beer.

289
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,880
Would you like to join us?

290
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,882
No, I'm good. Please go ahead.

291
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,717
Please allow me to stay for a while.

292
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,801
Sure.

293
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,637
-Hey.
-Yes?

294
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,641
As I didn't have any food for beer,
I picked some jujube in your yard.

295
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,226
If we meet in the future,

296
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,229
I'll repay you for them.

297
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,067
Sure.

298
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,946
I have peanuts. Do you want me
to bring some peanuts?

299
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,239
Excuse me.

300
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,036
I didn't know
that's what had happened to Kim Si-ik.

301
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,913
It's unfortunate,

302
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,249
but I don't want to go
against 500-year-old grudges

303
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,251
to publish the book.

304
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,794
I will get rid of it.

305
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,005
It would be a shame
to destroy it like this.

306
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,424
My manager read every page of the novel.

307
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,510
He told me the story was
quite fascinating.

308
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:05,514
If I were to overlook
the perverted scholar part,

309
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:09,559
the scholar character is quite enticing
and fascinating, from what I heard.

310
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,396
He's a noble-minded scholar
who doesn't get involved

311
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,106
in the conflict
between two major factions.

312
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:18,235
He's also a romantic scholar,
who writes to his wife once a month

313
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,362
while she waits for him at this hometown.

314
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,156
I did my research.
That's what Kim Si-ik did.

315
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,617
I'll tell you what. "Kim Si-ik decided

316
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,911
not to join the social cliques
to gain power.

317
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:28,996
As an outsider,

318
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,999
he indulged himself
in perverted, erotic stories."

319
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,334
Let's just change this part.

320
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,088
"The existing stories, written
in the Korean alphabet by unknown writers,

321
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,674
were actually written
by the scholar, Kim Si-ik."

322
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,260
You won't be able to write this
in a historical book,

323
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,929
but it would make
a very fascinating theme for a novel.

324
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,306
You're right.

325
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,766
"Shin Yun-bok was a woman."

326
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,393
There's a book with that theme too.

327
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,812
In novels, everything is possible.

328
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,022
Let's go with that then.

329
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,149
The most romantic scholar
and the best storyteller

330
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,609
in the Joseon Dynasty,
who was as noble as a crane.

331
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,736
Kim Si-ik.

332
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,282
"Crane"? This title just crossed my mind.

333
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,410
My masterpiece, The War of Cranes,

334
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,747
is followed by this beautiful novel
called A Song of a Crane.

335
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,835
A Song of a Crane. Let's sing that song.

336
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,844
Sir, write a great story.

337
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,229
What just happened?

338
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,356
A Song of a Crane!

339
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,692
You must start the song.
What are you doing?

340
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,445
This happens all the time to people
who died from overwork.

341
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,032
I forgot to mention
that he passes out within 30 seconds

342
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,076
upon grabbing his pen.

343
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,495
What? If he keeps passing out

344
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,746
every 30 seconds,

345
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,498
when will he finish his novel?

346
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,501
We must get help from another writer.

347
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,295
What? Another writer? Who?

348
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,591
We have a novelist
who wanted to work hard, but couldn't

349
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,218
before he died.

350
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,805
Sir, from what I've observed so far,

351
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,100
your writing is superb.

352
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,227
But you haven't decided

353
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,688
what to write about yet.

354
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,942
We have a great topic
as well as an excellent teacher.

355
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,276
Will you

356
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,612
complete a novel?

357
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:33,537
Does that mean I'll remain
as a character in a fictional story?

358
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,580
Kim Si-ik is recorded as a scholar

359
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,042
who got disqualified
for writing vulgar stories.

360
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,877
There's only one line.

361
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,340
That will not disappear
even if you wait for 500 years.

362
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,134
Is that so?

363
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,554
But it's not fictional

364
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,306
that you were an affectionate husband
and noble scholar.

365
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,892
Remaining in this world in a novel

366
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,145
seems good enough to me.

367
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,604
Is that so?

368
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,899
Besides, it's a novel.

369
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,944
While we're at it,
let's say that he was tall

370
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,946
and very handsome.

371
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,322
How will they know?

372
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,159
Is there anyone you think you resemble?

373
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,577
There's a guy

374
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,830
who I think resembles me a lot.

375
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,373
Okay. Who is it?

376
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:23,128
Young people call him Mr. Hip.

377
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,297
So Ji-sub?

378
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,466
Are you telling me
that you resemble So Ji-sub?

379
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,302
Come on, you...

380
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,640
You definitely look like him!

381
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,392
Yes. You look just like him.

382
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,144
I resemble him even more from this side.

383
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,896
Goodness, you're right.

384
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,314
Turn around a bit more.

385
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,858
Keep turning.

386
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,193
Yes, that's it.

387
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:49,905
The back of your head
is pitch black just like his.

388
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,574
Goodness, Mr. Kim.

389
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,368
You're a hip, handsome guy.

390
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,308
Kim Si-ik can even do martial arts.

391
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,768
He sounds pretty cool.

392
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,356
Gosh, the writer romanticized
the guy too much.

393
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,941
This will be a hit.

394
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,778
Ms. Jang. Mr. Koo.

395
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,655
The last part is complete.

396
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,823
Let's see.

397
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,125
It's good.

398
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,631
Mr. Kim.

399
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,552
There's a draft of a book
I received from a rookie writer.

400
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:58,181
Check the second shelf
of the bookcase in my writing room.

401
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:03,603
The story is about a scholar,
Kim Si-ik in the Joseon Dynasty,

402
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:07,691
and the author's name is Bae Seong-hun.

403
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,236
Yes, of course.

404
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,363
Right.

405
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:18,159
A SONG OF A CRANE

406
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,262
The book has been published,

407
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,432
and our two writers left
with smiles on their faces.

408
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:44,352
I made these cocktails
as a token of my gratitude,

409
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,979
so please enjoy them.

410
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,824
I said I'm not a fan of Tears.

411
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,785
Still, it's for a special occasion
this time,

412
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,287
so please drink up.

413
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,290
What's the meaning behind it this time?

414
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,044
They are tears of a sad goodbye.

415
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,892
I, Kim Si-ik, a scholar of Joseon,
have washed away my shame.

416
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,687
With these tears that symbolize
my reluctance to leave,

417
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,482
I will now head to the afterlife.

418
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,569
Mr. Kim...

419
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,113
We will

420
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,450
gulp down our tears with this drink...

421
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,995
and say goodbye.

422
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,920
Thank you for everything.

423
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,694
I thank you for all your hard work
and apologize for leaving first.

424
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,159
Take care, Mr. Kim.

425
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:37,549
It's been 70 years,
but you're still like a baby.

426
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,645
Goodbye, Mr. Kim.

427
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,873
I'll get going.

428
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:38,234
THE SAMDO RIVER
THIS LIFE, THE AFTERLIFE

429
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,241
Goodbye.

430
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,186
Ms. Jang.

431
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,189
Thank you for preserving my name

432
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:20,235
and letting me be remembered
as a scholar as mysterious as a crane.

433
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,739
These are the tears
I give to you as my gratitude.

434
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,575
I hope that the cold and icy moon of yours

435
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,787
will go down

436
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,248
beautifully and warmly.

437
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,313
This tastes awful.

438
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,864
Why don't you come
to the hotel these days?

439
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,492
Why would I when it'll soon be gone?

440
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,162
I came to check if Hyeon-mi had died

441
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,415
because that would mean
you'd soon be leaving too.

442
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,711
Well, Mr. Kim left.

443
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:09,260
See? You're sad because he left too.

444
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,096
That's how I'll feel if you go.

445
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,474
Please say that you'll stay.

446
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,435
It's sad

447
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,854
that he's no longer with us,

448
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,525
but we sent him off with joy.

449
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,530
Because nothing is sadder

450
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,991
than staying in this world.

451
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:35,036
What's sad about being with me?

452
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,829
Look at me and my sister.

453
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,583
Is that what you want for us?

454
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,428
Fine, leave then.

455
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,847
But I can't stay and watch you leave.

456
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,767
Kim Yu-na's parents keep telling me
to go and study abroad.

457
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,937
I think I'll just go. It's perfect, right?

458
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,606
You can go to the afterlife,

459
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,692
and I'll go abroad.

460
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,944
Let's just leave our graves behind here...

461
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,030
and say our farewell.

462
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,603
Thank you.

463
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,149
Excuse me.

464
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,615
I've seen you
watching from outside the pharmacy.

465
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:58,119
Are you perhaps a relative
of my baby's father?

466
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,289
I was once

467
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,125
a daughter-in-law of
the Yeongju Yun family.

468
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,507
My baby will never be

469
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,551
of the Yeongju Yun family.

470
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,636
It will take my surname instead.

471
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,389
If it's a son,

472
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,976
he'll be the sole heir
who'll carry on the family line.

473
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,438
And a daughter will equally
be the sole heir too.

474
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,148
They don't carry on
the family line though.

475
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,942
Once she marries, she'll become a member

476
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,611
of her husband's family and--

477
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,571
Are you from Joseon or something?

478
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,948
No one thinks like that
in this day and age.

479
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,243
If the grandparents want to see my baby,

480
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,578
then I'll let them.

481
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,956
But, whether it's a boy or a girl,

482
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,125
this baby will just be

483
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,044
my child.

484
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,193
What's wrong?

485
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,278
Why...

486
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,240
did I never think of that

487
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,243
for my daughter?

488
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,329
I feel so sorry for her.

489
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,548
This child...

490
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,427
I just hope the child inside your womb

491
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,763
will be born healthy,

492
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,933
and live a good life.

493
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,861
THE GUYS WHO DIED AFTER EATING

494
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,740
Look.

495
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,075
This.

496
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,162
And this one. Which one should I post?

497
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,288
This one is good.

498
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,039
This one? Okay.

499
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,960
You take so many photos.
Do you have any followers?

500
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:14,297
Of course. Hyeon-jung, Yu-na, and Sanchez.

501
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:15,965
That's all?

502
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,051
Your boiled egg looks much better.

503
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,888
You were taking so many pictures.

504
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,348
I thought you had
about a million followers.

505
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:28,144
You haven't even pressed "like" once.
You have no right to say that.

506
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,812
I don't do social media.

507
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,648
-Alex Ferguson once said--
-Forget it.

508
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:36,068
I'm sure he said something great.

509
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:39,197
But that's what he thinks. I will...

510
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,744
What is it now?

511
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,705
Like...

512
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,250
He pressed "like."

513
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,253
Who? Sanchez?

514
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,466
Kim Jun-hyun...

515
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,177
Kim Jun-hyun did.

516
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,181
Look at this. He pressed "like"
for the picture I posted

517
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,058
about the rice with thistle.

518
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,394
LIKE
KIM JUN-HYUN

519
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,896
He really did.

520
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,190
You only have three followers.

521
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,692
How did he find your post
and press "like"?

522
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,946
I don't wish for anything more.

523
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,823
I have been recognized
by the master gourmet.

524
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:28,079
Since when did you like
Kim Jun-hyun so much?

525
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,163
What?

526
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,045
From the first time I saw him,

527
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,838
I knew he's my cup of tea.

528
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,633
He looks like someone I know.

529
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:44,595
I was going through hard times
because of my undesirable hobby.

530
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,682
Suddenly a young guy appeared
and saved me with the game of Go.

531
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,643
He also recommended
I go on a gourmet tour.

532
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,605
He looks exactly like Kim Jun-hyun.

533
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:56,983
But that's me.

534
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:58,776
What?

535
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,070
I told you I went
to Man-wol Inn 200 years ago

536
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,321
to get the Moon flowers.

537
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,283
It was me who won the game of Go
and drew you the gourmet map.

538
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,784
It was me.

539
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,244
Don't be ridiculous.

540
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:11,706
I remember clearly.
He had a big build like Kim Jun-hyun.

541
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,125
He was very nice and kind.

542
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,878
You wouldn't even be one-fourth of
the man he is, no matter how hard you try.

543
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,380
What are you trying to do?

544
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,178
That's the way Mago changed your memories.

545
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:33,853
Now I realize that we did visit
so many good restaurants.

546
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,024
They were all good.

547
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:48,367
Lastly, there is something
you have to eat.

548
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,396
You have to

549
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,815
eat that later.

550
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,029
You have to.

551
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,828
Let's eat. Naengmyeon is getting cold.

552
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,667
Okay. Let's eat before it gets cold.

553
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,590
Do you want mustard?

554
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,427
Kim Jun-hyun said you need vinegar
when you have Pyongyang naengmyeon.

555
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,472
Wasn't that Baek Jong-won?

556
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,599
It could be.

557
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,768
You're 1,300 years old for sure.

558
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,770
You are confused about
what your favorite guy said.

559
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,189
-How much?
-Just a little.

560
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,653
It looks delicious.

561
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,905
Aren't you adding any?

562
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,283
With Pyongyang naengmyeon,
you have to taste the broth first.

563
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,763
Of all the room service staff,
you will be the only one left.

564
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,599
Most of the guests are gone too.

565
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,977
Thanks for all your work.

566
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,814
-We will be going.
-Okay.

567
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,944
Ms. Choe.

568
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:51,907
Yes.

569
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,329
I have to go to get Hyeon-mi.

570
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,790
Tae-seok contacted me.

571
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,795
Bring your sister here.

572
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,173
I'll let Ms. Jang know.

573
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,574
Hyeon-mi, I am here.

574
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,951
Hyeon-jung.

575
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,884
Hyeon-mi.

576
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,594
Hyeon-jung.

577
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,023
Do you know how long I've waited for you?

578
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,612
Let's go.

579
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,507
Yu-na.

580
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,088
You must be Hyeon-jung's sister, Hyeon-mi.

581
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:15,092
Thanks to your kind brother,
you'll leave without losing your way.

582
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:17,886
What about Yu-na?

583
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,223
Does she know you are leaving?

584
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,809
I saw her at the hospital.

585
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,487
Could you give this to her for me?

586
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,410
And...

587
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,329
Please tell her

588
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,124
that every single second she has left

589
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,752
is all so precious,

590
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,546
so she should be a good student

591
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,090
and be happy.

592
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,082
Ma'am.

593
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,795
Ma'am.

594
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:36,006
I'd be happy to give
all the time I have left.

595
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,217
Please grant me a favor.

596
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,156
Hyeon-jung.

597
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,883
Take them with you.

598
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,931
You left flowers on my grave too.

599
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,268
I got these for you.

600
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,937
I asked Mago

601
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,731
and I put myself in huge debt
to get them for you.

602
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,860
She told me that I have to live
a really good life

603
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:41,280
in order to repay her
for the favor she's done for me.

604
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,491
So you don't need to worry about me.

605
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:48,954
Thank you.

606
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,375
I won't worry.

607
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,846
Bye, Hyeon-jung.

608
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,309
Goodbye.

609
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:57,648
Why are you suddenly meeting Mi-ra's
parents? Are you planning to marry?

610
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,191
We're

611
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,735
going to get married this winter.

612
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,448
Then that's going to be
a really important event.

613
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:10,160
It's weird that you'd want to meet
her parents at a pizza restaurant.

614
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,954
We chose this place because of you.

615
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,165
You have no idea
how much my parents trust you.

616
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,000
Back when they came
to the States to take me back,

617
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,877
all of my friends helped me hide
from them,

618
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,420
but you told them where I was.

619
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,464
You scored
a lot of brownie points with them.

620
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,341
They think you're a very honest friend.

621
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:28,887
Well, it's nice to hear
that your parents think I'm trustworthy.

622
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,181
But I still don't get
why you'd want me to be here

623
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,975
when you introduce him to your parents.

624
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:36,395
If my parents end up not liking Yeong-su,

625
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,063
you should help me convince them.

626
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:41,525
Why? It's your marriage.
And I'm not even his brother.

627
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,528
I don't have a family to introduce her to,

628
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,405
so she must be really worried.

629
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,408
Sanchez, can you be his older brother?

630
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,743
You should tell them
what a great guy Yeong-su is.

631
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,161
You know what I mean, right?

632
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,497
Actually, just tell them
that I'm pregnant.

633
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:59,668
I'm not a gynecologist.
I'm just an owner of a pizza restaurant.

634
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,587
You're being really weird.

635
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:06,216
Mi-ra, you shouldn't lie
to your parents like that.

636
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,968
If they happen to disapprove of me,

637
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,220
I'll do my best to convince them.

638
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:13,682
I just don't want you to feel lonely.

639
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,393
I can't wait to become your family.

640
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,478
Mi-ra.

641
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,781
I guess they won't have any problems
getting married this winter.

642
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,372
We're so different when it comes
to choosing a refrigerator.

643
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,499
It's better to have a bigger freezer.

644
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,127
There are so many things
to store in the freezer.

645
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,546
You never eat anything
from the freezer anyway.

646
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,965
Let's just buy one
that has a big refrigerating space

647
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,300
so we can eat fresh food.

648
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,510
Honey.

649
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,472
Do you choose me
or the refrigerating space?

650
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:57,309
Your love for me should be equal
to the size of the freezer.

651
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,604
I love you as much as the size
of the North Pole.

652
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,523
So let's get a fridge
that has a lot of refrigerating space.

653
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:04,608
Done.

654
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,027
Forget it. I'm going to go
take a look at the furniture.

655
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,745
Stop right there.

656
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,248
Ms. Jang?

657
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,000
You're getting married,

658
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,335
Ms. Lee?

659
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,754
Did Chan-sung tell you?

660
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,839
Where is he? Is he here with you?

661
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,549
He went to get some milk tea,

662
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:30,967
Ms. Lee.

663
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,845
I asked if you're getting married.

664
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,808
Yes, we're getting married this winter.

665
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,644
I'll give you an invitation
once we finish printing them.

666
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,813
I'd like to give you a gift first.

667
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,314
A gift for me?

668
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,983
I wanted to give you

669
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,027
an unforgettable gift.

670
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,363
Look.

671
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:03,834
Song-hwa.

672
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,130
Song-hwa.

673
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,757
You better be good to Yeon-u.

674
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,428
If you ever make him cry,

675
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,431
I'll turn your life upside down
just like that TV.

676
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:25,939
Do you like it?

677
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,152
Yes.

678
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,779
I'll get you this TV as a wedding gift.

679
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,448
I hope whenever you look at it,

680
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,784
you'll always remember what I just said.

681
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,461
What did you say to Mi-ra?

682
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,212
I just said I hoped

683
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,923
they'll have a happy life
as they watch TV together.

684
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,724
You gave Mi-ra a wedding gift?

685
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:01,808
Yes.

686
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,394
I heard they're getting married in winter.

687
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,646
I won't be able to buy them
anything in winter

688
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,399
since I won't be here anymore.

689
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,787
Ms. Choe's leaving today.

690
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,296
The full moon will be here soon.

691
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,803
Your Guest House of the Moon

692
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,930
will only exist

693
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,933
up until the next full moon.

694
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,857
Your hands are cold.

695
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,318
Should I get you a warm drink?

696
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,611
No.

697
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,863
It's nice. It feels like winter.

698
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,200
But why did you get her a TV?

699
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,744
I noticed
that the TV could flip upside down.

700
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:04,579
What about that?

701
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,331
You don't need to know.

702
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,667
You remember

703
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,627
Yeon-u, right?

704
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,712
Who's Yeon-u?

705
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:17,217
He's no longer the person
who loves you the most.

706
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,346
I know.

707
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:23,932
It's Ms. Choe now.

708
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:45,912
The rooms

709
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,748
are all empty now.

710
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,400
Ms. Jang, I'll be off now.

711
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,696
Thank you for letting me stay here
all these years

712
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,115
and protecting me.

713
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:24,868
Thanks to you,

714
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,204
I was able to learn a big lesson

715
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,665
at a very important moment.

716
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,461
Thank you.

717
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,260
Mr. Koo.

718
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:46,890
I was the one who suggested
that we should make you enter Room 13.

719
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:50,060
I've been feeling guilty about that.

720
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,562
I'm sorry.

721
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,439
It's okay.

722
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,068
If I didn't enter Room 13 that day,

723
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,862
I wouldn't have been able
to obtain that one second.

724
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,198
Even if you ever get to obtain
an entire lifetime,

725
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:06,034
don't ever let anyone see you
wearing your tiger print suit.

726
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,911
It'll make you lose everything.

727
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,497
I'll keep that in mind.

728
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:12,832
Ms. Jang.

729
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,585
Now that we're about to say goodbye,

730
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,548
it suddenly reminds me of the day
I first came to Man-wol Inn.

731
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,636
Where do you think you're doing?

732
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:36,690
Are you stealing that knife

733
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:39,025
to kill everyone in that family?

734
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,366
My daughter...

735
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,995
The man who killed his own daughter

736
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:53,123
just welcomed a new child.

737
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,834
You won't be able to kill anyone
with that knife.

738
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:03,466
If you take this, you'll be able to kill
at least a few people.

739
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,804
After that, you'll get captured
and disappear into thin air

740
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,472
like you always wanted.

741
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,271
But the person
you actually want to kill is yourself

742
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,565
because you have failed to protect

743
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,483
your precious daughter.

744
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,654
If you stay here to go to the afterlife,

745
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,782
you'll get to live a new life.
But I know you don't want that.

746
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,243
You already hate yourself so much.

747
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:31,953
So, I'm sure

748
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,831
you'd want to throw it away
even if you have a chance.

749
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:44,299
In a way,
you may be the most suitable employee

750
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,552
for this guest house of the dead

751
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,640
since you are longing
for a perpetual death.

752
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,518
Do you long for the same thing?

753
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,648
The deity must have chained me here

754
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,152
because that's what they saw in me.

755
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,325
It started that day.

756
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:14,662
As I leaned on you while holding my grudge
and waited,

757
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,082
I wished

758
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,335
that you wouldn't change.

759
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,385
We were embracing our own hell then.

760
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:33,681
But now, we are leaving this world
in a decent way.

761
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,642
I'm glad for that.

762
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:40,146
As it's a happy occasion, let's not cry.

763
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,899
I will go with a smile.

764
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,275
Bye.

765
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,119
Ms. Choe.

766
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,331
Can I...

767
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,835
hug you?

768
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,782
I wasn't going to cry.

769
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,828
Why are you making me cry?

770
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,564
There were many times
when my heart broke for you.

771
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,150
I always wanted

772
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:10,862
to give you a hug like this.

773
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,366
Ms. Choe,

774
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,245
you have comforted me on many occasions.

775
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,374
Thank you.

776
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,271
How much time

777
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,856
do we have left?

778
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:31,901
Today,

779
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,737
around the time of a full moon,

780
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:38,157
all the energy at the hotel
will be collected.

781
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:41,411
Everything will disappear.

782
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:44,664
And Jang Man-wol must leave.

783
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,458
I've been wanting to ask you

784
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:48,960
why...

785
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:51,546
you chose me.

786
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,758
Why did you choose me?

787
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,808
I guess the flower that dreams of the moon

788
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:08,229
hasn't shown you the last dream yet.

789
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,308
I'm all alone now

790
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,647
just like how I started.

791
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,703
Ms. Jang, I wasn't dozing off.

792
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:49,455
I just closed my eyes for a second,
and my legs went weak.

793
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,917
That was a lie. I'm sorry.

794
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:57,004
We have a guest coming in.
You should go back to your office.

795
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,466
Welcome.

796
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:03,010
How long has it been
since you passed away?

797
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:06,556
Let me escort you to your room.
This way, please.

798
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:41,758
Ms. Jang,

799
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,927
the guest in Room 603 was supposed
to take the bus to the afterlife today

800
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,763
but wants to postpone it until tomorrow.

801
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:52,310
And these are steamed buns
requested by the guest in Room 1120.

802
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:55,605
The guest really misses
the steamed buns from childhood.

803
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,482
I'm going to bring these up.

804
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:22,089
Ms. Jang, I made a new cocktail.
Would you like to taste it?

805
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:26,052
Why don't you smell it at least?
Isn't the color pretty?

806
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:29,138
Come on, it does not look
like I washed rags in it.

807
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,183
And let's be honest.
Have you ever washed a rag?

808
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,227
Don't go. Stay there.

809
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,729
I'll go wash the rag and bring the water.
Let's compare them.

810
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,272
Stay right there!

811
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:31,344
You came to send off one last guest,

812
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,222
Chan-sung.

813
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:53,741
Chan-sung.

814
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,745
I feel so sleepy.

815
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:00,998
I feel like I'm falling asleep.

816
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:07,463
Maybe they want me to feel like
I'm dreaming when I leave.

817
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,354
I'll stay by your side
even if you fall asleep.

818
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:04,562
Now I've crossed

819
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:07,857
the long periods of time

820
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,817
and met you there,

821
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:13,320
embracing the flower

822
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,907
that is dreaming of the moon.

823
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:24,707
Your name means the "full moon".

824
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:26,792
It's pretty.

825
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:31,297
There's a place called
the Guest House of the Moon.

826
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,789
You're still here.

827
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,415
Because this place still exists.

828
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:08,042
How can I help you?

829
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:12,755
A long time ago, I lent a pair of scissors

830
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:16,217
to a bride who visited the hotel.
Do you remember?

831
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,388
You said you need more courage
to let go than to hold on.

832
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,307
You lent it to help her do that.

833
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:25,059
That's right.

834
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:30,147
The thing is,
I forgot to get it back from her.

835
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,565
I have it.

836
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,193
My gosh!

837
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,529
Thank goodness.

838
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:45,371
I should repay you for finding
this precious pair of scissors.

839
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:47,540
You deities never show up when I need you,

840
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,542
but you always return all favors.

841
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,043
What can I do for you?

842
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:55,965
Do you want me to cut the ties
between you and the one

843
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:57,550
who broke your heart?

844
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:01,428
Are we still connected?

845
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,473
Can you see it?

846
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:07,059
Are there still ties left to cut?

847
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,978
Well, that's...

848
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:13,107
I cannot answer that.

849
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:17,736
Forget it, then.

850
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:22,074
There's something I want.

851
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,660
I want to travel back in time.

852
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:28,038
-That's--
-I know you can do it.

853
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:29,456
You made me do it before.

854
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:32,585
That's true, but...

855
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,503
It's fine even if it's for a short moment.

856
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:36,297
Help me

857
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,008
see winter with her.

858
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:48,702
It's snowing.

859
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,254
Winter is really here.

860
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:02,549
Am I still dreaming?

861
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:07,429
This is the winter we're spending together
that you wanted.

862
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:14,979
Where did this come from?

863
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:19,191
Maybe from a time in our shared past,

864
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,443
or from a moment
we'll share in our future.

865
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:23,988
I'm not sure which one it is.

866
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:26,115
It's just winter

867
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,202
from one of the moments
we've shared or will spend together.

868
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,248
Chan-sung.

869
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:37,918
I saw you in my dream.

870
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:52,099
Man-wol. The moon.

871
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,479
Your name means the "full moon."

872
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:00,941
It's pretty.

873
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:12,870
We actually met again

874
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:16,373
after the long periods of time.

875
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:26,300
Then did this snow come from some winter
we spent together in our past?

876
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:32,389
I hope it came from our future
we'll spend together.

877
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,645
Really?

878
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:45,444
Now, the snow looks even prettier.

879
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,977
Are you going alone
without the Grim Reaper's guidance?

880
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:04,106
I've been the owner of this place
for all those years.

881
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:09,027
I will go on my own.

882
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:13,031
You're brave.

883
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:20,622
Chan-sung.

884
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,086
I've pondered...

885
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,841
countless times what I should tell you...

886
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,012
if this moment ever comes.

887
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:40,726
"I'm sorry."

888
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:43,479
"Thank you."

889
01:14:45,772 --> 01:14:47,232
"Have a good life."

890
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:54,656
I came up with a lot of cool stuff
to tell you.

891
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:58,744
Now that it's time,
I don't know what to say.

892
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,081
I just...

893
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,463
I want to stay with you.

894
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:15,677
I just want to see you.

895
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:22,601
And I don't want to leave you behind here.

896
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:32,986
I knew I would be like this.

897
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:35,781
When I'm the weak one,

898
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:37,908
I pretended to be strong in front of you.

899
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:41,495
I even made it impossible for you

900
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:45,374
to stop me from leaving.

901
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:55,759
I'm sorry.

902
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:14,278
It was right here.

903
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:17,698
You told me not to feel lonely
when I see you off.

904
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:21,243
Were you pretending to be strong?

905
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:24,913
Back then, I didn't know
I'd like you this much.

906
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:27,666
I...

907
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,504
I also didn't know
I would fall in love once again.

908
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:35,841
Like a fool.

909
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:53,942
I've never thought

910
01:16:54,901 --> 01:16:57,321
about the future before.

911
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:01,908
But the only thing I can tell you now

912
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:04,786
is this.

913
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:14,254
Let's

914
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,966
meet in our next lives again...

915
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,554
no matter what.

916
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:26,058
Okay?

917
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:29,728
Yes?

918
01:17:42,866 --> 01:17:43,992
Chan-sung.

919
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:47,746
You looked into me,

920
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,291
took care of me,

921
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:54,795
and protected me.

922
01:17:58,298 --> 01:17:59,716
And I thank you for that.

923
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:06,264
Goodbye.

924
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,562
Goodbye, Man-wol.

925
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:28,490
THE SAMDO RIVER

926
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:35,765
My dear moon disappeared
after swallowing up

927
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:37,851
all my nights and dreams.

928
01:21:39,352 --> 01:21:40,604
Goodbye.

929
01:21:49,529 --> 01:21:54,868
It's natural to feel sad and disappointed
when you let go of someone you love.

930
01:21:56,703 --> 01:22:00,874
Just like a flower dreams of
blooming again while withering away,

931
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:05,712
you'll live, meet,

932
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:08,214
and love again.

933
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,176
I hope

934
01:22:11,718 --> 01:22:14,262
that is the answer
you two, an arrogant, foolish,

935
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:16,514
and self-pitying

936
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:21,436
yet beautiful lovers, have chosen.

937
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:21,264
Merry Christmas!

938
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:22,807
It's cold.

939
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,768
Chan-sung.

940
01:24:27,437 --> 01:24:29,939
Chan-sung. It's so freezing.

941
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,399
Hey, it's gotten really cold.

942
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:34,235
New York's just as cold as Seoul,
so don't forget your winter clothes.

943
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:37,489
Can you send me my things
once I settle down there?

944
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:40,617
Sure. Take what you can
and I'll bring the rest when I visit.

945
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,077
How about lunch tomorrow?

946
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:45,080
Actually, I have other plans.

947
01:25:12,023 --> 01:25:14,275
-Have you been well, Yu-na?
-Yes.

948
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:17,153
How did you do on your exam?
Do you have a major in mind?

949
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:18,822
Hotel management.

950
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:21,366
I'm going to become a hotelier too.

951
01:25:22,408 --> 01:25:23,868
You must've gotten a good score then.

952
01:25:24,035 --> 01:25:26,079
I probably will next year.

953
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:31,417
Seeing ghosts and all that,
I couldn't focus on my studying this year.

954
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:35,046
Thanks to the medicine you gave me though,

955
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:37,215
I don't see them anymore.

956
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:40,343
It made me focus on studying.

957
01:25:40,426 --> 01:25:41,344
I'm glad to hear that.

958
01:25:41,427 --> 01:25:44,055
You also took the same medicine, right?

959
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:48,810
You don't see the ghosts now, right?

960
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:12,417
Do you think the tiger saw
what he wanted to see in the painting?

961
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:17,005
He saw the past like a dream,

962
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:19,090
a time where he could never go back.

963
01:26:19,632 --> 01:26:21,509
He got pretty lucky.

964
01:26:46,993 --> 01:26:48,870
My memory of a secretive world

965
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:51,414
others don't know about.

966
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:56,836
It is where you are.

967
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:00,590
And I...

968
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,844
still remember my promise to you.

969
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:14,956
EXISTENCE AND TIME

970
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:05,798
You're early.

971
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:08,092
I thought you'd be late.

972
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:11,429
I hurried over

973
01:29:13,056 --> 01:29:14,474
so that you wouldn't wait.

974
01:29:18,227 --> 01:29:19,437
Someday...

975
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:22,982
Someday...

976
01:29:24,817 --> 01:29:28,946
If we meet again
in some life far down the road...

977
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:35,828
When that day ever comes,
I hope to always be with you.

978
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:45,213
We will dream together
looking each other in the eye,

979
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:48,174
embrace each other, and laugh together

980
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:50,593
as we

981
01:29:51,302 --> 01:29:55,348
live happily together for a long time.

982
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:39,869
I'm about to make
an important announcement.

983
01:31:39,952 --> 01:31:41,787
Where are the rest?

984
01:31:42,038 --> 01:31:45,333
Is the sixth still living in Joseon?

985
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:47,168
Unbelievable.

986
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:51,380
Why is it that all 12 of us
are never able to congregate?

987
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:53,674
It's not like you're that busy.

988
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:57,720
You can talk to them later.

989
01:31:58,221 --> 01:31:59,722
So what's the announcement?

990
01:32:01,474 --> 01:32:04,852
I have chosen a surprising new owner

991
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:09,774
for the Guest House of the Moon.

992
01:32:11,108 --> 01:32:15,196
Wandering souls
that have nowhere else to go

993
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:19,450
must have a place to stay
in order to tell their stories.

994
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:22,245
Then, what's the name of the new hotel?

995
01:32:22,453 --> 01:32:26,415
Oh, that. Well, it's...

996
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:29,710
What was it again?

997
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:34,674
Wait. What's wrong with me?

998
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:36,884
Why can't I remember?

999
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:46,245
The moon has risen.

1000
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:49,415
Let's open our doors.

1001
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:11,354
