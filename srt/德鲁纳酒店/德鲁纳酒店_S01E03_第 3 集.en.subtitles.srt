1
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,508
Are you alive?

2
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,469
Or are you dead?

3
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,430
I'm just...

4
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,100
here.

5
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,480
I'm neither alive

6
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,108
nor dead.

7
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,319
I'm just stuck.

8
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,655
I'm confined in a time zone

9
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,242
that can't ever be turned back.

10
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,137
Let's go!

11
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,304
No!

12
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,098
You're the one
that led the group, aren't you?

13
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,475
You're the ringleader.

14
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,055
Hey.

15
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,891
You guys are thieves
from Gaori Village, aren't you?

16
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,102
That means you're a nomad from Goguryeo.

17
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,604
You get what I'm saying, don't you?

18
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,398
Hey!

19
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,816
Shut it.

20
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,864
I'm also from the same place.
Hello, brother.

21
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,283
Or should I call you "sister"?

22
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,410
"Sister"?

23
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,245
Sister.

24
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,789
Why don't you let me free now?

25
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,770
I'm just a low-class officer
in charge of escorting his superiors.

26
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,189
So you won't get much money
by holding me hostage.

27
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,024
I know how I'm going to get money.

28
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:58,983
What?

29
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:02,737
The noble lady who didn't even care
about losing her silk bundle

30
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,365
seemed to care very dearly
about something else.

31
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:24,092
I guess guarding the young lady wasn't
the only thing in your job description.

32
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,930
All I did was talk with her a few times
so she wouldn't be bored on her way.

33
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,973
I guess she couldn't help

34
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,601
but fall for me
because of this pretty face.

35
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,147
Then your face must be worth quite a bit.

36
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,027
Can I persuade you to let me go?

37
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,780
If my hands and feet were free,

38
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,949
I'm sure I would be even more persuasive.

39
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,081
If I cut off your tongue
for talking nonsense,

40
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,918
will the price for your face fall?

41
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,630
How can you say such a scary thing?

42
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,177
Darn.

43
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,754
Pull me up.

44
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,925
What are you doing? Can't you hear me?

45
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,011
How can I help you when I'm like this?

46
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,806
If my hands and feet were free,
I could help you better.

47
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,391
Throw me your sword.

48
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,147
Don't move. If you move,
you'll be sucked in faster.

49
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,902
Throw me your sword.

50
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,808
Where are you going?

51
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,477
Come back!

52
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,550
Grab it.

53
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,095
Quickly!

54
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,529
You're my hostage now.

55
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,156
The price on my head would be much higher

56
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,201
than the price
on a low-class warrior's face.

57
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:44,500
Actually, I'm not a low-class warrior.

58
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,254
The lady I was escorting
is the princess of Yeongju Castle.

59
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,798
And I'm the captain of her guards.

60
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:46,270
Are you looking at the moon
that has come up today?

61
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,732
Or the moon that came up
a thousand years ago?

62
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,901
They are all one and the same.

63
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:59,700
The flowers in the garden
have blossomed brightly.

64
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,203
You must have taken good care
of your guests so far

65
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,580
at the Guest House of the Moon.

66
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,249
I told you I changed
the name of this place.

67
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,378
It's not a guest house.
It's Hotel del Luna.

68
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,547
Stop calling me a landlady.

69
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,840
I'm the president.

70
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,884
They are the same thing.

71
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,222
I saw that the human
who had served you for a while left you.

72
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:26,143
Well, from death comes a new life.

73
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,771
I also died.

74
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,608
Why don't they take me?

75
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,318
You didn't die.

76
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,737
You are tied to the Moon Tree,

77
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,032
and the flow of life and death
has stopped for you. I told you that.

78
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,867
How long will you keep me tied up?

79
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,495
It's you who is not budging.

80
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,123
I shriveled up and died.

81
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,834
If you cut it up and burn it,

82
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,502
I will be on my way.

83
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:57,049
The leaves sprout,
and the flowers bloom and wither.

84
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,970
The time of life and death
will flow once again.

85
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:06,684
Don't you think you should leave something
pretty like this behind before you go?

86
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,939
I have nothing pretty and colorful
like that to leave behind.

87
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,693
Why don't you pick the bright flowers

88
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:19,071
and give them to pitiful spirits
when you see them off?

89
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,330
That child is still

90
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,125
filled to the brim...

91
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:39,091
I can't leave you like this forever.

92
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,160
Thank you for saving me earlier.

93
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,495
Consider yourself lucky.

94
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,748
I wouldn't have saved you
if you had been wearing other shoes.

95
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,378
They are so much better
than the tacky poop colored shoes.

96
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,506
You waited for me,
wearing the shoes that I chose for you.

97
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,426
I never waited for you.

98
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,510
Come on.

99
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,055
You sent me a text on the pretext
of that tiger, and waited for me.

100
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,390
I was just curious.

101
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,892
Of course you were curious.

102
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,769
Because you've been
thinking about me all along.

103
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,354
Did you

104
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,399
cast a spell on me or something?

105
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,401
Is that why I dreamed about you?

106
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,154
You dreamed about me?

107
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,865
Seeing ghosts like this
is already too much for me.

108
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,825
I don't want to see you in my dream.

109
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,703
Why? Did I eat you up
in your dream or something?

110
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,259
Forget it.

111
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,553
I don't think it was you in my dream.

112
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,555
If she were you,
she wouldn't have done that.

113
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,559
I forgive you.

114
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,315
You are an adult,
so you can have a dream like that.

115
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,109
What?

116
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,402
It's not that kind of dream!

117
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,950
Koo Chan-sung. I thought you were weak,

118
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,369
but you are actually very healthy.

119
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,790
Yes, I am very healthy.

120
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,583
Okay, you stay healthy.

121
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,337
If you faint like earlier again,
it will be too troublesome for me.

122
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,632
How did you bring me here?

123
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,385
Did you teleport me or something?

124
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:11,971
It was nothing.

125
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,014
Just like you brought a handcart
the other day,

126
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,266
I brought something to carry you here.

127
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,856
Get in there.

128
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,526
Let's move him.

129
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,291
Ms. Jang, I'm in him.

130
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,584
Let's go.

131
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,379
Wait for me.

132
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,675
Come on, Ms. Jang.

133
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,678
Come out of there.

134
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,263
Now that I'm in a human body,

135
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,181
may I go out and party a little?

136
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,182
Come out.

137
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,309
I really don't want
to get out of this body.

138
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,186
Ms. Jang. Please.

139
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,271
Come out!

140
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,323
That must have hurt.

141
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,283
Go.

142
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,702
Go!

143
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,167
All you need to know is
that I moved you here safely.

144
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,550
Is your neck all right?

145
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,594
Sure.

146
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:35,929
Why?

147
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,723
As long as you're fine.

148
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,349
Let's go.

149
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,685
Now that you're at my hotel,
I'll give you a tour.

150
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,738
Does this place really exist
in the real world?

151
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,323
Like I said last time,

152
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,284
our hotel is officially registered
at the Jung-gu District Office,

153
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,161
and we pay all the taxes too.

154
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,167
It does exist in the real world,

155
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,294
but its presence is very vague,

156
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,463
so the living do not notice it.

157
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,427
But it can sometimes be seen

158
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,263
when the weather is bad
or if the person has a good sixth sense.

159
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,182
I didn't know there was a hotel here.

160
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,225
You're right.

161
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,477
But it looks kind of scary. Let's just go.

162
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:31,360
But three to four times a year,
there are people who come in to check.

163
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:42,996
My goodness.

164
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,332
Our rooms are very expensive.

165
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,128
What do you do with the people
who insist on coming in?

166
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,838
I will check in.

167
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,883
We have a special room
we use for people like them.

168
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,595
Please go inside.

169
00:18:59,096 --> 00:18:59,930
Sure.

170
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,253
A number of people
have checked into this room,

171
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,797
but no one has ever checked out.

172
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,595
What did you do to them?

173
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,181
Do you want to know?

174
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,059
Do you want to go in?

175
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,298
I still have many places to show you.

176
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,592
Okay. Then let's move on to the next one.

177
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,826
Why do you need sunglasses
in the middle of the night?

178
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,815
I don't come out here very often.

179
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,233
The sun is too bright.

180
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,902
It's nighttime in the middle of Seoul.
What is this place?

181
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,988
The inside of the hotel
isn't the real world.

182
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,698
The time and space here

183
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,741
are different from the world you live in.

184
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:29,288
Maps and watches
are absolutely useless here.

185
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,355
So this isn't the real world as well?

186
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:56,815
No.

187
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,944
Nothing in this hotel
exists in the real world.

188
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,865
No matter how pretty it is,
it's not in the real world.

189
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,118
You don't exist

190
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,911
in the real world too?

191
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:17,961
No,

192
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,881
I don't.

193
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,236
Then I wouldn't die if I fell from here?

194
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,782
Be careful. You're still alive.

195
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,494
If a living human falls down, he'll die
because the human body is too weak.

196
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,846
This was what it was like
to have a warm body

197
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,682
with a beating heart.

198
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,193
You need to be alive.
You have many things to do for me.

199
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,572
Stay by my side from now on,
Koo Chan-sung.

200
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,742
If I say no,

201
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,411
are you going to push me over?

202
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,471
It may be a surreal place,

203
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,515
but I demand realistic benefits.

204
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,561
And I am going to wear
whatever shoes I like.

205
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,111
You thought I might push you over?

206
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,571
Is that why you have changed your mind?

207
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,030
I've come this far.

208
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,616
What's the use of running away now?

209
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,663
To be honest, I got curious.

210
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,249
And it looks kind of fun too.

211
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,961
I want to know more

212
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,923
about you and this hotel.

213
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,023
Good.

214
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,862
I was going to let it slide
even if you tried to run away

215
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,155
a few more times.

216
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,951
Like I told you before,
you are my cup of tea.

217
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:20,936
It was her.

218
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,022
That woman.

219
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,116
May I get a refill on my coffee?

220
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,203
Yes.

221
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,520
-Oh, right. Honey.
-Yes?

222
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,855
Let's stop by the grocery store
on the way.

223
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,899
We'd have to take a detour.

224
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,276
Let's just go next time.

225
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,535
What happened?

226
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,204
-What should we do?
-Hello?

227
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,290
-What do we do? Is she dead?
-Is this 911?

228
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,250
Someone got hit by a car.

229
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,377
No, it wasn't me.

230
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,254
She suddenly fell from an overpass.

231
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,840
Yes, can you please come quickly?

232
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,218
Oh, right. The location?

233
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,680
We're currently at...

234
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,372
911 EMERGENCY SERVICE

235
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,177
That darn loser.

236
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,014
This is driving me crazy.

237
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,641
Whatever!

238
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,443
What's going on?

239
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,031
What happened to me?

240
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,790
Who are you?

241
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,836
This is mine.

242
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,359
We have a new human hotel manager.

243
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,279
I brought him from one of the best hotels
named by Forbes.

244
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,572
So he'll do a good job.

245
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,032
I know he graduated from Harvard,

246
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,493
but the work we do here
isn't based on knowledge.

247
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,120
He needs to have some guts.

248
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,164
But he seems very weak-hearted,
and that worries me.

249
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,249
How about we leave the position
vacant for a while

250
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:15,128
and hire someone from the two candidates
you had in mind?

251
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,339
There were two other candidates?

252
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,591
Of course.

253
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,719
The top candidate even knows
how to perform an exorcism, right?

254
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,262
What's the point?

255
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,806
He left to catch some useless ghost.

256
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,478
I ask you in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

257
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,147
Why are you here? What is your name?

258
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,494
-That's enough!
-Do not interfere!

259
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:53,541
I can't go there
before I catch this ghost.

260
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,710
You should leave.

261
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,842
I ask you in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

262
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,427
What is your name?

263
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,429
Answer me!

264
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,349
-I'm more scared of him.
-Tell me your name!

265
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:14,062
I gave him the ability to see ghosts
only to see him leave to catch some ghost.

266
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,647
Won't he come back once he catches it?

267
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,982
That'll be impossible.
The ghost is really strong.

268
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,734
Park Il-do, that punk.

269
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,655
Who was the second candidate?

270
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,323
He was a fighter pilot.

271
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,117
She went all the way to the States
to find him.

272
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,203
But he eventually left in that thing.

273
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,663
In what thing?

274
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,328
I don't need the top two candidates.

275
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,996
Koo Chan-sung is here, so we're good.

276
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,539
His office is ready.

277
00:31:56,623 --> 00:32:00,168
Mr. No knew he was going to leave
and had the office cleaned up beforehand.

278
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,047
He worked here for 30 years,
but he didn't leave a single trace behind.

279
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,173
Yes, he did.

280
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,216
That over there.

281
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,427
Mr. No took that photo.

282
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,390
So many humans worked here,

283
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,100
but they're all so vague to me.

284
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,646
How many people were here
including Mr. No?

285
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,814
Ms. Jang is the only one who knows that.

286
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,109
There's been no one special.
What's the point of counting?

287
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,864
What are you doing? Get back to work.

288
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,331
He was nothing more
than the 48th human to work here.

289
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,959
And Koo Chan-sung

290
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,713
will just be the 49th human to work here.
Nothing more.

291
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,443
MANAGER KOO CHAN-SUNG

292
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,410
I caved in way too easily.
That was so not like me.

293
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,830
Why did I do that?

294
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,090
This was what it was like
to have a warm body

295
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,761
with a beating heart.

296
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,973
I got too carried away.

297
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,738
Ms. Jang told us to say hello
to the new manager.

298
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,407
If you all work here,

299
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,036
that means you're all ghosts, right?

300
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,163
I died about 500 years ago.

301
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,124
She died 200 years ago.

302
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,753
And he died 70 years ago.
He's the youngest among us.

303
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,597
I was a scholar who studied very hard
when I was alive.

304
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,974
After a long period of studying,

305
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,227
I passed the National State Exam
with the highest score.

306
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,316
But I suddenly died
right before achieving my lifelong dream.

307
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,737
And while I was wandering around,
I found Man-wol Inn.

308
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,456
I've been here the longest.

309
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,793
You said you used to study.
Then what do you do here?

310
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,504
I used to be very bright
when it came to writing poems.

311
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,047
And now,

312
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,465
I'm a bartender.

313
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,516
So you're the bartender
who's in charge of the food and beverages.

314
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:47,103
I was the eldest daughter-in-law
of a prestigious family.

315
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:52,650
But I ended up getting murdered
by my own family.

316
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,174
While staying here,

317
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:20,428
I'll make sure I see the last member
of that loathful family die

318
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,723
with my own eyes
before I leave for the afterlife.

319
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,518
You must have a deep grudge.

320
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,688
I'm in charge of the rooms.

321
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,732
I see, ma'am.

322
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,318
I died during the Korean War.

323
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,141
This was called Man-wol Hostel
at that time.

324
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,602
It wasn't doing so well back then.

325
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:14,023
I'm waiting to go with my sister
who's still alive.

326
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,735
All of us have long stories to tell.

327
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,612
As for me--

328
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,698
We all came here
as guests at first. But now

329
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,909
we're working here, extending our stays.

330
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,787
Aside from Ms. Jang,
the three of us have been here

331
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,330
the longest.

332
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:32,667
Then did Ms. Jang come here
as a guest like you,

333
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,460
and ended up staying for a long term?

334
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,544
No.

335
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,880
Ms. Jang is the owner of Hotel del Luna.

336
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,257
Owner of what?

337
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,968
She's just tied down here
for a punishment from that crone.

338
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,302
She's being tied down?

339
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,430
There's a huge tree in our garden, but--

340
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,309
Do we have a garden?

341
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,770
I think we left the front desk and the bar
unattended for too long.

342
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,730
We better go.

343
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,276
I can't be lazy at work,
or I'll be sent to the other world.

344
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,405
I'll tell you my long story at the bar
while treating you to a martini.

345
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,459
I think you're done for the day.
You can go home now.

346
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,045
Where is the garden with the huge tree?

347
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:19,880
I didn't get to see it today.

348
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,842
She probably didn't show it to you
because it's unnecessary.

349
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,430
Is there some kind of tie between Ms. Jang

350
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,931
and that tree?

351
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,145
Mr. Koo.

352
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,898
How long do you want to work here?

353
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,903
As short as possible
since I didn't come here out of choice.

354
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,115
Then, it'd be best to keep
your curiosity to a minimum.

355
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:52,538
You must mean the more I know,
the longer I'll be tied to this place.

356
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,499
The rest of us will take care
of hosting the guests.

357
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,836
All you have to do is do the work

358
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,588
related to the humans.

359
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,008
I'll do that.

360
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,670
Hey, are you going to work already?

361
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,798
No, I just got off work.

362
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:26,966
Did you have a night shift?

363
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,384
No.

364
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,594
I have to quit the hotel I'm working at.

365
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,597
-Why?
-I'm going to work at a different one.

366
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,723
Which hotel?

367
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,976
Why quit the best hotel in Seoul?

368
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,811
The hotel I'll work at

369
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:42,314
has a private beach
and a soaring rooftop bar.

370
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,692
Is there such a hotel in Seoul?

371
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,694
I want to go there too.

372
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,737
You can't.

373
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,866
If you come, you'll be in Room 404.

374
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,203
What's in Room 404?

375
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,289
Is it a suite?

376
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,126
I'm so tired.

377
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,715
Hurray!

378
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,599
Yes.

379
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,559
This is the real world.

380
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,895
I have a place to stay,
and I have a friend.

381
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,938
I have lots of other hotels
asking me to come.

382
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:24,773
Don't get confused.

383
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,322
I'm finally calming down.

384
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,824
This really helps.

385
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,101
Something strange followed me
to the real world.

386
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,079
It's a moon.

387
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,748
It's to show that it's mine.

388
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,147
Man...

389
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:32,568
Wol.

390
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,321
This is how you write it.

391
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,907
MAN-WOL

392
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,249
I'm paying you back
for giving me good wine.

393
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,902
DEL LUNA

394
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,199
She was in my dream,
and now she's calling me.

395
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,076
It's getting me confused.

396
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,956
What took you so long to pick up?

397
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,043
What is it?

398
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,381
I have your first job for you.

399
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:18,549
What is it?

400
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,844
I want to sell
the painting of Baekdu Mountain.

401
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:25,556
What?

402
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,399
The soul of the mythical creature

403
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,194
made the aura of this painting
even better.

404
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,822
I'll be able to get
twice its original price.

405
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:43,949
If we sell this,

406
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,411
what about the tiger inside?

407
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,663
The tiger has just left.

408
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,540
This is an empty painting.

409
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:52,833
The tiger has left?

410
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,211
The tiger lived in a zoo all his life.

411
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,256
He got sick of living in Baekdu Mountain
in a couple of days.

412
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,592
He went to the afterlife
after playing there for a few days.

413
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,136
I'm sure he'll be reborn in blessing.

414
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,971
Is this why you asked me
to get the painting?

415
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:06,930
To sell it?

416
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,640
Not because you cared about the tiger.

417
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,310
Of course I care about the tiger.

418
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,979
I even wore this for him.

419
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,481
Hey!

420
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,442
Make sure you get a good price for this.

421
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,818
Then as a reward,

422
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,030
I'll get you a tiger print suit like this.

423
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,658
No, thanks. Who would wear such a thing?

424
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,244
Why not? You love the poop color.

425
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:33,123
I even got the new car
in that color, just for you.

426
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,834
-A new car?
-Make sure to sell this by today.

427
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,211
I have to pick up the new car.

428
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,378
You bought a car?

429
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,923
The car I drove the other day
was also a new one.

430
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:44,218
You're right. I'm broke now
because I bought another new car.

431
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,304
Make sure you get a good price
for this painting.

432
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,306
At least twice its original price.

433
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,318
Let's go pick up my new car

434
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,614
I must've been crazy.

435
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,535
What more is there to know?
She's nothing but a money chaser.

436
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:16,083
Is he really gone? Is he not in there?

437
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:23,465
Roar.

438
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:29,263
Roar!

439
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,286
KIM YU-NA

440
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:05,507
That's not who you are.
You died right here!

441
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,268
Give my body back to me!

442
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,859
Yes, Director. Thank you
for introducing me to him.

443
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,612
Yes, I'm heading to the gallery right now.

444
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,196
I'll see you soon.

445
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,160
Give my body back to me!

446
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:42,813
Seems like Mr. Third Choice brought in
a very annoying guest.

447
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:46,066
She must have some issues.
She keeps saying she's not dead.

448
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:49,569
This isn't our first time
seeing the dead saying they're alive.

449
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,280
They always say that they're alive,
they can't die or ask why they died.

450
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,865
We hear that all the time.

451
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,867
Ms. Jang will handle it, right?

452
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,333
I told you to go sell a painting.

453
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,585
Why did you bring in an unwanted guest?

454
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:06,795
Are you a tout or what?

455
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,255
What did you say?

456
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,842
You said that you comfort souls here.

457
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:16,012
She seems like she has issues.
Why don't you come up with a solution?

458
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,724
You said you saw her other self
wandering around?

459
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,560
She said she was robbed of her body.
If it's true, we should get it back.

460
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:25,188
What you've brought is a soul
that came out of her living body.

461
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:31,319
So you're saying
that her body is out there without a soul?

462
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,988
You said she was robbed of her body.

463
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:35,157
Her body must be taken over
by another ghost.

464
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,290
What's wrong with Yu-na?

465
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,126
Yu-na bullied her the most.

466
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,295
Maybe she feels guilty
for everything she did to her.

467
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,380
She's acting like she actually feels bad.

468
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:58,847
Is this the girl's house?

469
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:02,809
Yes, Yu-na is the only child
of this household.

470
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:07,314
Their one and only daughter's body is
taken over by a ghost.

471
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,690
Of course we should get it back.

472
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,735
I think I already know the answer,

473
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,445
but are you going to force them pay you?

474
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,740
This isn't just a rich house.

475
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,618
That's the poop colored car
that I'm in love with.

476
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:23,538
It's very difficult to buy that car now,
but they already bought it before I did.

477
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,042
That means that they're filthy rich.

478
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,757
We need to find out
why this is happening, right?

479
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,966
It's because of a necklace.

480
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,177
It belongs to the dead friend
who took her body.

481
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,888
The ghost's deep grudge followed her,
stuck to the necklace.

482
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,264
Then it took over her body.

483
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,099
I thought they were friends.
Why would she do that?

484
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:46,520
Stop asking questions.
You said we need to get the body back.

485
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,855
Then that's all we need to do.

486
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,531
Go after her.

487
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,075
Hey!

488
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,547
Let me go!

489
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,259
I'm going to kill her body.

490
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:20,262
This isn't even your body.
Why are you doing this to a friend?

491
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,764
She's not a friend.

492
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,268
She's the one who killed me.

493
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:34,943
JEONG SU-JEONG

494
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,531
Give it back to me.

495
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,324
You live on social assistance,

496
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,618
and you waste your money
on something like this?

497
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,288
Do you have no conscience?

498
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,707
The money you get is for your meals.

499
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,378
This is what we call a waste of tax money.

500
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,131
Give it back.

501
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,884
Give it back!

502
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,969
Take it if you can.

503
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,889
-Here you go.
-Give it back to me!

504
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,224
Give it back!

505
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,351
Give it to me.

506
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:16,610
You little!

507
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:18,778
Let go of me!

508
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,879
I can't remember anything
after falling off the bridge.

509
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,131
When I came to consciousness,

510
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,051
I realized that I'm in her body...

511
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,180
with my necklace in her hand.

512
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:53,104
Are you here to give Yu-na her body back?

513
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,606
She killed me!

514
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,031
That's it.

515
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,575
Get me my body back with that now.

516
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,327
The grudge in here...

517
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,414
doesn't disappear that easily.

518
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,083
Just tell my parents.

519
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,835
They'll do anything for me.

520
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:18,797
Of course they should.

521
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,175
They're the ones who made you after all.

522
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,771
What is it that you wanted
to talk about our daughter?

523
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,776
Yu-na murdered someone.

524
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,281
Did you know

525
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,243
that one of Yu-na's classmates
committed suicide on an overpass?

526
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,621
That's not entirely true.

527
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,249
Your daughter killed her.

528
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:00,922
This necklace is the evidence.

529
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:10,140
What is it that you want?

530
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,645
I came to collect the price.

531
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:22,360
Do you think it's wrong of me
to kill Yu-na?

532
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,070
Let's find another way.

533
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,531
What way?

534
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:32,287
No matter what I do,
I can't come back to life.

535
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,916
I wanted to live!

536
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,046
Even when they called me a parasite,

537
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,299
I still wanted to live on.

538
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,390
Let go of me!

539
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,226
Please let go of me.

540
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,107
I can't let her return to this body

541
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,569
and live like nothing happened.

542
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,157
Please let go of me.

543
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,170
Wait, just a second.

544
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,130
I'll go get the necklace.

545
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:28,259
You should just live in this body, okay?

546
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,270
Where is the necklace?

547
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,150
We can't let her return to her body yet!

548
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,069
It'd be too unfair for that girl!

549
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:47,821
I already returned the necklace.

550
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,365
It's in the hands of her parents.

551
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:27,235
So this necklace belonged
to that dead girl, right?

552
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,155
That woman told us
this is the only evidence.

553
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:35,201
There are two ways
to pay for what she did.

554
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,203
One, take this necklace as evidence

555
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,914
to prove your daughter's wrongdoing
and punish her.

556
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,459
She should also apologize
to the dead girl's soul.

557
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,751
Two,

558
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:48,548
you buy my silence
and get rid of this necklace.

559
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,566
I'll pay as much as you want.

560
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:08,651
Please...

561
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,155
give it to us and keep it a secret.

562
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,408
So you made your decision.

563
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:21,664
You'll have to pay a big price.

564
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:34,010
Everything will go back to normal, right?

565
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,220
Of course.

566
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,889
Once that necklace is gone,

567
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,975
no one will know that you killed her.

568
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,061
No one will know, right?

569
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,606
I told you
that her grudge is very deep, didn't I?

570
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,150
Once that necklace is burned,

571
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:53,488
your chance to be forgiven for
what you did will be gone for good too.

572
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,324
It doesn't matter.

573
00:58:58,701 --> 00:58:59,619
It does.

574
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,247
You won't ever be able to go back.

575
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:03,790
Pardon?

576
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:07,710
I'm saying that your soul

577
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,756
will really die without anyone realizing.

578
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:17,387
Darn it.

579
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,857
What's done is done, she's already dead.

580
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,235
Our Yu-na should continue
to have a good life.

581
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,445
Yes, she should.

582
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,906
None of this happened.

583
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,033
But what do you think...

584
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,204
that woman meant by the last comment?

585
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:46,332
Right.

586
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:51,921
You should know that the choice you made
will kill your daughter's soul.

587
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,095
No!

588
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,559
No! What do I do?

589
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:09,897
Mom, take it out! Mom! Please!

590
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:12,275
Please take it out, Mom!

591
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:15,361
I said, take it out! Take it out!

592
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,971
You should live in that body now.

593
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,599
Although you're parasitic on the body,

594
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:48,603
try your best to survive again.

595
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:58,029
DEATH

596
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,501
She has become a true parasite.

597
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:15,338
However,

598
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:17,924
she found herself a golden host.

599
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:23,221
I bet they'll spoil her not knowing
she's only their daughter's shell.

600
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:24,639
That young girl

601
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,600
will be tortured
while watching her own shell.

602
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,268
I feel bad for her.

603
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:32,647
She's only paying for what she did.

604
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:39,362
She's just tied down here
for a punishment from that crone.

605
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,867
Are you also paying for what you did?

606
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,420
I heard you're being punished.

607
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,215
I am.

608
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,428
Someone told me
that I'm arrogant and foolish.

609
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,097
Although I don't agree with it.

610
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,018
Right.

611
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,731
What was that? Did you just say, "Right"?

612
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:16,566
Are you mocking me?

613
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:17,984
No, I'm not.

614
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,362
Sometimes. No, very rarely,

615
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,323
I feel bad for you.

616
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,673
TEXT MESSAGE

617
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:41,883
What is this?

618
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,719
They cancelled the car I pre-ordered.

619
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:49,390
What kind of bullshit is this?

620
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,102
How is this possible?
Are they looking down on me?

621
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:54,854
They're dead meat.

622
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,689
Do you take me for a fool?

623
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,399
Forget it.

624
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:00,651
Give me the one in charge.

625
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:02,737
I said, the one in charge!

626
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:10,495
When Ms. Jang gets angry,
she drinks champagne in bulk.

627
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,497
Mr. No always prepared it for her.

628
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:17,668
I didn't know I'd be required
to serve Ms. Jang alcohol.

629
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,712
You're so unlucky.

630
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,839
You were the third choice,

631
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:25,009
so we didn't expect
you'd end up as our manager.

632
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:26,511
I was the third choice?

633
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:34,894
They told me not to tell you about that.

634
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:40,608
Are you saying I was the third choice
for the job?

635
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:41,901
-No.
-This means

636
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:44,821
there were two other candidates before me.

637
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,948
You're here now, so you're the winner.

638
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,866
It's a feat that I'm not happy about.

639
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:51,828
Here it is.

640
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:58,417
What is this?

641
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,294
This sign shows
that it belongs to Ms. Jang.

642
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,129
Anything with this means it's Ms. Jang's.

643
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:05,299
It's a moon.

644
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:07,677
It's to show that it's mine.

645
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:14,684
Come this way.

646
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,704
Ms. Choe.

647
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:39,625
Do you know what Ms. Jang was like
when she was alive?

648
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:43,212
What does it mean
that she's tied down for a punishment?

649
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,965
You're just a passer-by here.

650
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:49,802
Like these people who stopped by
over the many years,

651
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,305
just consider you're only visiting
for a moment,

652
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,391
and leave this place as soon as possible
as you wish.

653
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:36,599
MAN-WOL HOSTEL

654
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,358
Why are you enduring like that
for such a long time?

655
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,039
MAN-WOL INN

656
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,339
Is this that tree?

657
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:43,040
There are no leaves.

658
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:48,671
What are you doing here?

659
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:58,597
You didn't show me the garden,
so I came by myself.

660
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:01,809
Guests cannot come here.
So you don't need to see this.

661
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,187
Is this that tree?

662
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,231
The tree that my father touched.

663
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:09,984
The reason why I was sold here.

664
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:11,068
You're right.

665
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:13,320
You're paying the price too.

666
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,159
But it didn't have to be me.

667
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:19,785
I heard I was the third one on the list.

668
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,914
I really thought it had to be me.

669
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,709
You said I am your cup of tea,
so I made a huge decision to come here.

670
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,502
But I wasn't your first or second choice.

671
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:34,550
Yes, there were first and second
candidates before you.

672
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,678
Was I really the third choice?

673
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:39,680
Wasn't I the fourth,
or the fifth one by any chance?

674
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:41,766
Who said you were the third choice?

675
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,518
-There were more before me?
-You're

676
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:46,270
the zeroth choice.

677
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:49,273
The zeroth choice.

678
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:53,069
You're right. It has to be you
because you are my cup of tea.

679
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,157
Do you want some champagne?

680
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:02,828
You said you'll sell the Baekdu Mountain
painting for a good price. So have some.

681
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:07,208
Do you think the tiger saw
what he wanted to see in the painting?

682
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,336
He probably left without complaining
because he did.

683
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:15,049
He saw the past like a dream,
a time where he could never go back.

684
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,343
He got pretty lucky.

685
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,183
I'm sure you too have
things you miss in the past

686
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:25,976
that you can never go back to.

687
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:35,444
I think I saw that.

688
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,199
I told you that I saw you in a dream.

689
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:41,867
In a dream?

690
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:44,286
You were smiling

691
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:46,038
under a huge tree.

692
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:50,918
When someone said he'd build you a house,
you said mean things just as you do now,

693
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:52,503
but you were happy.

694
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,717
The moon shined above the wilderness
where you were drinking,

695
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,262
and it was filled
with sounds of instruments,

696
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,055
along with your laughter.

697
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,565
You were full of joy and happiness.

698
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,527
You weren't alone like you are now.
You had someone by your side.

699
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:21,031
The man who taught you
how to write your name, Man-wol.

700
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,451
Is he the person you miss the most

701
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:26,704
in your past?

702
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,342
You...

703
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,638
You really...

704
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:48,100
saw him.

705
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:51,937
You have been

706
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:54,148
waiting for that person

707
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,067
over this long period of time.

708
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,834
How do you see...

709
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:40,421
such things?

710
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:42,423
I don't know.

711
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:45,175
Why do I see you?

712
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,970
I'm scared
that I may have to pay the price for it.

713
01:11:50,764 --> 01:11:52,057
Jang Man-wol.

714
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,772
Since I began to see you,

715
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:01,608
I've been thinking of you...

716
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:04,862
very much, awfully a lot.

717
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:11,827
Jang Man-wol, I'm saying...

718
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,955
you are devouring...

719
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:18,083
all my nights and dreams.

720
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:19,561
The old memories that shriveled up

721
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,772
crawled out again because of you.

722
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:24,358
So I need to check this for myself.

723
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:27,486
Chan-sung. Starting today,
you will deal with ghost guests.

724
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:30,697
There's someone she really wants to see.

725
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,616
Every single ghost has someone
that they want to see!

726
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:35,077
You said the owner was a maniac, right?

727
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:37,830
-Is that so?
-Leaves have sprouted from the dry tree...

728
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:39,248
I'm trying to take care of you.

729
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,333
I'm sorry.

730
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:44,711
Chan-sung, come to my hotel if you die.

731
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:48,966
