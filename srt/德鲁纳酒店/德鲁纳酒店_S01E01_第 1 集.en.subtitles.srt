1
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,432
You were lucky.

2
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,184
This is the only place
you can get a drink.

3
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,270
Are you from Muzu?

4
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,065
You don't exactly look like a Georan.

5
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,234
Are you from Malgal?

6
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:18,156
My goodness, I see you have a sword.
Are you a warrior?

7
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,620
The wine tastes horrible,

8
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,455
and you're very chatty.

9
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,302
Did someone die?

10
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,556
Or did you kill someone?

11
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,939
There are only two types of people
who pass by this place

12
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,523
even in this kind of weather.

13
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,734
It's either a person who killed someone

14
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,778
or a person who's on their way to die.

15
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,114
Even with that useless
and big mouth of yours,

16
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,993
you've managed to live quite a long life.

17
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,120
Should I slice off your tongue,

18
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,081
so you can safely live longer?

19
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,126
This old tongue of mine
might not be able to taste good wine,

20
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,462
but it knows how to say things
that can be of help.

21
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,758
It seems like you've been wandering
for a very long time.

22
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,511
Where are you trying to go?

23
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,140
I'm looking for a guest house.

24
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,017
I heard there's a guest house

25
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,896
somewhere in this wilderness
that consoles the souls of the dead.

26
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,608
You must be looking
for the Guest House of the Moon.

27
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,279
Do you know that place?

28
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,406
I heard it's a guest house for the dead

29
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,157
who still wander in this life.

30
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,742
Where is that place?

31
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,244
Where do I need to go?

32
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,747
You can't go there.
Only the dead are able to go there.

33
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,084
Just like them over there.

34
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,803
How many souls
have you brought in this coffin?

35
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,770
They're people who ended up
dying because of me.

36
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:17,108
And who else did you kill
for those who ended up dying?

37
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,990
Shut your mouth.
Just tell me how to get there.

38
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,994
"Full moon"?

39
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,621
It's a moon
that's filled with so many grudges.

40
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:31,914
Tell me.

41
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,750
I'm trying to take responsibility

42
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,627
for those whom I've killed.

43
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,921
You can't even handle yourself,

44
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,715
and you're trying to take responsibility

45
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,258
for other people's lives?

46
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,302
I told you I'll slice off your tongue

47
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,305
if you ever run your mouth.

48
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,348
Just tell me how to get there.

49
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,809
If that place can only be found
by the dead,

50
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,563
I'm even willing to kill myself.

51
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,565
What a poor soul.

52
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,027
You think you can compensate
for everything by sacrificing your life.

53
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,904
But that's such a futile hope.

54
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,073
My life is the only thing left

55
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,658
that I can give.

56
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,704
FULL MOON

57
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,748
The Guest House of the Moon...

58
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,127
is where the souls of the dead
gather together.

59
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:23,549
The dead souls that wander about
all end up there of their own free will.

60
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:24,777
They are also people
you've already killed.

61
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,406
Was this the place?

62
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,117
Did I kill everyone?

63
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,578
Did I become an evil ghost?

64
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,041
And come to the Guest House of the Moon
on my own?

65
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,921
Arrogant and foolish.

66
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,841
You are a pitiful human
who has fallen into self-pity.

67
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,805
You have found the place to pay
for your sins of your own will,

68
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,765
so now pay for your sins.

69
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,455
FULL MOON

70
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,296
GUEST HOUSE

71
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:44,870
The Guest House of the Moon
which will be the shelter for the dead

72
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,289
has found a new owner.

73
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,759
Why don't you all come with me

74
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,803
to a comfortable place?

75
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,372
YEAR 1998

76
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:20,925
Son.

77
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,221
It's your birthday today,
but I can't even buy you jajangmyeon.

78
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,015
It's all right. I'm not hungry.

79
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,742
-Mister.
-Hey, son.

80
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,911
-You dropped your money.
-Thank you.

81
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,582
Oh, dear. You're a good boy.

82
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,126
You have a handsome forehead
and twinkling eyes.

83
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,087
You have a very auspicious face.

84
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,547
It's your birthday today?

85
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,340
Tell me the year and hour
that you were born.

86
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,759
Hey, lady. We're not buying flowers.
Just go your way.

87
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,096
Oh, dear. Your early years were so unlucky

88
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,431
that you were born to a father like him.

89
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,850
But it's not an ill-fated relationship.

90
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,980
Having a hard life early on means
getting rid of your bad luck in advance

91
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,648
for your future good fortune.

92
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,899
What? "Bad luck"?

93
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,443
How can you talk such rubbish
just to sell flowers to a kid?

94
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,570
Son, just wait.

95
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,822
I'll make lots of money
and buy you your birthday present.

96
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,490
-Present?
-Flowers!

97
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,243
Flowers are the best present
for birthdays.

98
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,036
I'm not buying your flowers!

99
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,746
Flowers are good too.

100
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,208
You can just pluck them for me,
instead of buying them.

101
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,836
So, don't do dangerous things
just to make money.

102
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,254
My goodness.

103
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,423
You're too young
to worry about things like that.

104
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,227
Poke around the place.

105
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,562
Is there anything?

106
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,357
-Over there.
-Check there.

107
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,173
911 EMERGENCY SERVICE

108
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,186
Ms. Jang, are you up?

109
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,441
It's the full moon, so I think
we will have many guests today.

110
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,694
When the moon is bright,
they can see this place from far away.

111
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,740
So they will crawl in here
from all over the place.

112
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:16,410
All right, then.
I will light up the hotel sign.

113
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,412
Open the hotel for business.

114
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,540
I get into a bad mood
when I see the full moon.

115
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,500
And today, it's particularly worse.

116
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,961
Don't let in anyone
whose death was too gruesome.

117
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,213
We shouldn't pick guests--

118
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,423
Don't accept them.

119
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,717
They won't be in a rush
since they're already dead.

120
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,846
I will take special care,
so they won't get in your way.

121
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,354
That darn moon.

122
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,401
I'm so sick of it.

123
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:07,980
Stop right there!

124
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,314
Stop!

125
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,172
My gosh.

126
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,050
Gosh, I almost died.

127
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,995
What's that?

128
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,386
I wonder if I'll have to pay
just for going inside.

129
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,206
Are you here alone?

130
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,419
Do you remember how long it's been
since you died?

131
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,380
It's been about ten days.

132
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,267
I guess that's the elevator.

133
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,254
My gosh, this place is huge.

134
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,723
I wonder if I'll have to pay
just for sitting here.

135
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,061
Are you okay?

136
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,688
You don't look so well.

137
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,982
Where did you get so wet?

138
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,901
The Han River.

139
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,069
The Han River?

140
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,742
Did she play in the water
in the middle of the night?

141
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,619
Is this place expensive?

142
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,205
Do you think they'll make me pay
just for sitting in the lobby?

143
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,083
I don't know. This is my first time here.

144
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,464
What happened...

145
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,883
to you?

146
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,218
I fell down the stairs.

147
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,914
It's been a while since we last had
a ghost soaked in water.

148
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,832
-A ghost soaked in water?
-Yes.

149
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,043
By any chance,
does that ghost look horrible?

150
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,087
Well, a little...

151
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,255
Ms. Jang isn't feeling very well today.

152
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,425
Let's take the guest to her room quickly
so that Ms. Jang doesn't see her.

153
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,551
Okay, sir.

154
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,729
What's wrong, sir?

155
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,481
The guest that just walked by...

156
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,068
He doesn't belong here.
He came to the wrong place.

157
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,612
Does that mean

158
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,656
he isn't dead?

159
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,324
Is he alive?

160
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,952
If Ms. Jang sees him, he'll die.

161
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,746
We need to get him out of here
as soon as possible.

162
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,795
I need to hide here
for at least a couple of hours.

163
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,672
Should I hide in the bathroom?

164
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,924
Yes, good idea.
Let's hide in the bathroom.

165
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,891
Is this gold?

166
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,522
My gosh, this looks really expensive.

167
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,653
No. This isn't important right now.

168
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,575
I hope I see you again.

169
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,209
Why is there a sea here?

170
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,588
Sir, would you like to swim in the water?

171
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,507
We'll lend you a swimsuit.

172
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,176
What's your room number?

173
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:14,054
No, I'm okay.

174
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,277
Welcome.

175
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,346
I didn't know this building was this tall.

176
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,726
How weird.

177
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:04,896
That's scary.

178
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,900
A living person is here?

179
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,069
It seems like he's roaming around

180
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,530
without even knowing
what this place really is.

181
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,074
If he doesn't leave soon, he'll die.

182
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,993
The worst he'll have to face is death,

183
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,370
but we'll get scolded so much
if Ms. Jang finds out.

184
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,622
She'll make sure we don't forget
about this for 50 years.

185
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,291
You know what she always says.

186
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,004
Is this the best you can do?

187
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,924
You guys must think of me as a joke.

188
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,678
If you make this kind of mistake
one more time,

189
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:40,515
I'll put all of you on a bus
that's headed to the afterlife.

190
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:41,975
Do you understand?

191
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,522
My gosh, no way.

192
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,026
I feel like it's my fault.
What should I do?

193
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,861
Yes, it's all your fault.

194
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,863
-This one's on you.
-What?

195
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,364
I can't take responsibility for this.

196
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,991
I still have stuff to do in this life.

197
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,577
I can't get on the bus
headed to the afterlife.

198
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,203
I'm doomed.

199
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,415
Why did that dumb human
have to come here? Darn it.

200
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,334
I'm sure Ms. Jang will notice
sooner or later

201
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,003
that a living human soul is roaming
around the hotel.

202
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:14,632
If Ms. Jang finds him,
he'll never be able to leave this place.

203
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,551
He'll end up dying.

204
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,272
A thief must be here.

205
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,318
How dare anyone steal from my hotel?

206
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,723
What's this place?

207
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:14,526
Flowers?

208
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,863
Flowers are good too.

209
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,117
You can just pluck them for me,
instead of buying them.

210
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,493
This is good.

211
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,829
I'll take them to Chan-sung.

212
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,623
This looks like a dead tree.

213
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,792
But the flowers are really pretty.

214
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,242
What is this?

215
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,828
I see you're feeling pain.

216
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,706
Does that mean you're alive?

217
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:11,916
Who are you?

218
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,460
What are you doing? Move your foot.

219
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,420
You stole from me.

220
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,380
I didn't do anything.

221
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,340
I didn't steal anything here.

222
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,926
Really? Then, what is this?

223
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,477
That is...

224
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,729
You tried to steal it.

225
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:33,980
That is...

226
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,691
Do you want to get bitten to death by him?

227
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,572
I'm sorry.

228
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,740
Please forgive me.

229
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,533
I deserve to die for my sins.

230
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,493
Then, die.

231
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,662
No, I can't die now.

232
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,956
All humans have to die at the end.

233
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,542
Instead of going back and forth,

234
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,085
since you're already here,

235
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,587
die now.

236
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,132
I don't think you realized this.

237
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,551
But you are already dying.

238
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,767
What's happening to me?

239
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,977
What's going on?

240
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,942
Check his pulse and oxygen saturation.

241
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,152
Oxygen saturation is critical.

242
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,238
Get me the defibrillator.

243
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,824
Two hundred joules. Charge. Clear!

244
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,868
I can't die now.

245
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,703
Please spare me.

246
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,914
My son is waiting for me.

247
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,582
I feel sorry for your son.

248
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,716
What is this?

249
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,134
Today is my son's birthday.

250
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,053
He wanted flowers for his present.

251
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,930
So I got them from the tree.

252
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,182
I am really sorry. I mean it.

253
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,270
Flowers never bloom on this tree.

254
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,230
The flowers are from this tree for sure.

255
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,190
I didn't touch anything else.

256
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,988
You made flowers for this human

257
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,489
and gave away your branch?

258
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,619
Is it telling me to spare him?

259
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,377
This is your son's birthday present?

260
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,672
Unlike a foolish father like me,
he is a smart and loyal son.

261
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,426
If you forgive me this once,
I will never steal anything again.

262
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,386
I will raise my son as best as I can.

263
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,681
Okay.

264
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:32,932
Good.

265
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,561
I will spare you.

266
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,938
Thank you very much.

267
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,066
You go back and raise your son well.

268
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,944
Raise him well...

269
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,655
and give him to me.

270
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,073
What?

271
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,701
Since I saved the father,
the son must repay me.

272
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,369
You said he was still young, yes?

273
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:56,080
If a human is to be of any use,

274
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,500
you need to feed and raise him
for at least 20 years.

275
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:03,379
Promise me to give me your son then.

276
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,048
You want my son?

277
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,091
If you don't like it, you die tonight.

278
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,181
What? No. Wait.

279
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,144
Hurry up and make up your mind.

280
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:22,357
If you don't decide in a few minutes,
you'll die.

281
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:24,943
How can I...

282
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,863
If I die, Chan-sung will be all alone.

283
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,573
What will you do?

284
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,952
Will you give me your son, or...

285
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,703
die now?

286
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,915
I'll give you my son.

287
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,875
Please spare me.

288
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,128
Okay.

289
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,380
Good.

290
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,427
Twenty years later,

291
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,721
I will go to get your son.

292
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,602
Go.

293
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,608
Dad.

294
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,863
Chan-sung.

295
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,701
My dad is not dead.

296
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,369
What?

297
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,874
His reflex has come back,
and his vitals are okay.

298
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,792
Contact the Orthopedics

299
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,252
-and prepare for an operation.
-I will.

300
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,545
Wait here, okay?

301
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,047
Dad.

302
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,135
Chan-sung.

303
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,472
Come here.

304
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,396
Dad.

305
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,746
He left his son's birthday present.

306
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,492
FUNERAL HALL

307
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,619
That woman...

308
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,454
I don't know.

309
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,331
This is my first time here.

310
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,336
Dad, do you know that policewoman?

311
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,426
I don't know her,
but I think I saw her somewhere.

312
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,638
Is it possible that wasn't a dream?

313
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,065
I'm a policewoman.

314
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,567
I was an undercover cop,
and my identity was exposed.

315
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:12,610
And I was killed.

316
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,237
Such a pity.

317
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,323
You died doing righteous work.
So when you leave for the afterlife,

318
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,450
you will be provided
with a first-class limousine.

319
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,411
Rest for a few days here,
then take the limousine.

320
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,163
I can't leave like this.

321
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,291
Most of my guests say the same thing.

322
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,043
What would you like me to do?

323
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,461
Do you want revenge?

324
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,296
For your reference,
even if you want revenge,

325
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,006
we can't take the life of a human.

326
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,884
We can torment him a little.
But that will become a sin

327
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,178
and affect your next life negatively.

328
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:43,015
You're entitled to be reborn
as something much better.

329
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,811
But you might be reborn as a dog or a pig
if you take that revenge.

330
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,604
Please think carefully.

331
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,857
I don't want revenge.

332
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,820
The man I was chasing
can't be caught by human laws.

333
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,322
So I want to catch him.

334
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,117
You are

335
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,494
such a responsible person.

336
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,496
You have to pay with the worldly money.

337
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,623
for services related
to the world of the living.

338
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,666
Do you have

339
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,460
some money hidden in this world?

340
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,595
Okay.

341
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,889
What can we do for you?

342
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,873
Park Gyu-ho, Mayor of Beomcheon,
is with us here.

343
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,923
Now, we will begin the Businessman Award

344
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,508
for Innovative Growth of Beomcheon City.

345
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,929
The award goes to Mr. Kim Dong-hwan,
CEO of Beomin Corporation.

346
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:03,846
Congratulations!

347
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,599
-Way to go!
-Way to go!

348
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:09,310
It will be awarded by Mr. Park Gyu-ho,

349
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,562
-the Mayor of Beomcheon City.
-Kim Dong-hwan!

350
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,481
The CEO has led Beomin Corporation

351
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,857
with exceptional dedication.

352
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,360
He has been an excellent model
as a business manager.

353
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,830
-What is this noise?
-What is this?

354
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,791
-What's going on?
-What is this?

355
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,001
Hey!

356
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,677
Why isn't anyone taking photos?

357
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,732
Who's that?

358
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,533
There's a woman with a gun
in her hand walking in.

359
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,118
Why isn't anyone stopping her?

360
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,538
She has a gun right there!

361
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,956
Hey!

362
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,708
Put your gun down.

363
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,874
Mr. Mayor.

364
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,209
I've been shot.

365
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,879
Shot? What are you talking about?

366
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,590
That woman right there
shot me with her gun.

367
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,100
She really shot me.

368
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,649
Detective Lee?

369
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,151
You died.

370
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,154
Don't come near me!

371
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,198
Get away from me.

372
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,705
That's Detective Lee right there,
isn't it?

373
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,083
What are you all doing? Stop it.

374
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,459
You jerk!

375
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,336
Stop.

376
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:41,670
Don't come this way!

377
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,590
Stop taking photos.

378
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,225
She's getting away!

379
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,896
Hey! Stop it. Don't come near me.

380
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:17,081
You put her deep-seated grudge
in the heart of a man she couldn't arrest.

381
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,418
It's like trapping him in a place
that's worse than jail.

382
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,546
She'll be glued to him until she
breaks him, and after she's satisfied,

383
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,256
she'll come back to this hotel.

384
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,343
Have you found what the woman
mentioned earlier?

385
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,302
Yes.

386
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,722
I found this in a locker
at the train station.

387
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,145
They must be smuggled goods she seized
during the undercover operation.

388
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:47,069
Seems like I can drink as much champagne
as I want for the time being.

389
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:50,739
We have to pay off the debt that we have.

390
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,616
Did we have this much debt?

391
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,497
Fine, this should be enough.

392
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,792
We also need some to pay off
the future loans.

393
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,711
Are we going to borrow this much?

394
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,214
What kind of hotel management
costs this much money?

395
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,843
All the loans are for your car,
your shopping,

396
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,887
as well as champagne.

397
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,474
It doesn't cost much to run our hotel.

398
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,356
The guy that worked for me before
knew how to work with money,

399
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,442
so I never had to worry
about the finances.

400
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,903
I heard that you were starving
and completely broke

401
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,615
because of another man
that worked for you before that.

402
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,826
It angers me whenever I think of him.

403
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:40,164
Why don't you invest a little in advance
in whoever will come after me?

404
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,667
I'll pay for 20 years
of child expenses with this.

405
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:44,668
Hold on.

406
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,046
Does it really cost this much
to raise a kid?

407
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,469
Fine.

408
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,929
Give it all away.

409
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,181
When that kid grows up,

410
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,892
I'm going to have him at my beck and call.

411
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,779
100,000,000 WON TRANSFERRED

412
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,865
I guess it wasn't just a dream.

413
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,577
I guess I really sold you off.

414
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,747
I have to find the hotel.

415
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,625
I have to give this money back
and call off the deal.

416
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,628
Be careful, Dad.

417
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,271
It was somewhere around here.

418
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:49,567
Stay here. Don't move.

419
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,857
Send him flowers every birthday,

420
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,984
so that he doesn't forget about the deal.

421
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,864
Evening primrose will be perfect.

422
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:07,061
YEAR 2019

423
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,898
PRESENT

424
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:49,853
Mr. Koo Chan-sung.

425
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,440
Ms. President is here.

426
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,650
I'll walk you in.

427
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:55,943
Okay.

428
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,074
RESUME

429
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,077
You won't regret moving

430
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,704
from the Singapore hotel to ours.

431
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,623
I'm looking forward to working with you.

432
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,711
Thank you for trusting me
with such a big role.

433
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:20,050
You rejected our offer last year,

434
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,261
but you said yes right away
this year. Why?

435
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,887
Because it has been 20 years now.

436
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:27,015
I made a promise with my father

437
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:30,727
that I wouldn't come back to Korea
for 20 years.

438
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,063
Last year was the 20th year,

439
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,607
so I could come back this year.

440
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,526
He must have some reasons
to make you promise so.

441
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,446
It's nothing like being in debt
or having committed a crime.

442
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,739
He just wanted me to avoid
anything unfortunate.

443
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,033
It's a kind of superstition.

444
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,536
Old folk do that.

445
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,414
They tell you to avoid things
like getting married when you're 29.

446
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,542
But it never hurts to avoid bad luck.

447
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,882
Do you know, by any chance,
any hotel in Seoul

448
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,009
that's covered with ivy on the outside,

449
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:06,054
has a rooftop bar located
almost a hundred floors up

450
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,267
and has a pool
that's almost as wide as the sea?

451
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,352
Was there such a hotel 20 years ago?

452
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,480
Sorry?

453
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:17,900
No, right?

454
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,904
I've sent up all your belongings
to your office.

455
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:22,863
Thank you.

456
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,239
Did you find a place to stay?

457
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,241
I'll be staying at my friend's house
for now.

458
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,243
I guess that's why
your birthday present came here.

459
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,662
Happy birthday.
It's your birthday today, isn't it?

460
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,874
We've put the present at the front desk.

461
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,417
Wait.

462
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,170
Is the present...

463
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,796
It's flowers.

464
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,507
I can't remember the name...

465
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:42,966
Evening primrose.

466
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,053
I'm pretty sure.

467
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,852
It's been over 20 years.
Why am I still getting these?

468
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:03,695
Don't be scared.

469
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,364
You've been getting these all your life.

470
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,244
What is this?

471
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:11,870
"Hotel del Luna"?

472
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:19,586
DEAR KOO CHAN-SUNG

473
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,588
BE INFORMED THAT YOU'VE
BEEN HIRED BY HOTEL DEL LUNA

474
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,673
YOUR WORK STARTS TOMORROW

475
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,509
Darn it. This hotel actually exists?

476
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,636
There's even an address.

477
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,555
"Myeong-dong"?

478
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:40,941
"Myeong-dong."

479
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,568
Should I really go there?

480
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,533
DEAR KOO CHAN-SUNG, HAPPY BIRTHDAY

481
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,511
Excuse me. Let me through.

482
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:11,513
Excuse me.

483
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,889
Sorry.

484
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,669
DEAR KOO CHAN-SUNG, HAPPY BIRTHDAY

485
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,406
Are you the one?

486
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,283
Are you the one that bought me?

487
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,204
I guess you've been preparing
yourself for this.

488
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,998
I thought you'd ask me who I am first.

489
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,792
I didn't have to ask.

490
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,378
You're just like how my father described.

491
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:28,757
You're Ms. Jang Man-wol,
the owner of Hotel del Luna, right?

492
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,928
The woman who has been sending me
flowers every birthday.

493
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,390
Did you throw my flowers away every year

494
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,350
like you did today?

495
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:41,895
Every time I got them, I got scared
that what my father told me might be true.

496
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,065
I was scared that you'd come for me.

497
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:49,277
Is that why you've been moving
from one country to another?

498
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,154
So that I wouldn't be able to come
and get you?

499
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,156
I've been fleeing,

500
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,283
but I didn't expect you to really come.

501
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,286
I just thought that
everything was over last year.

502
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,747
That's what I intended.
So I came this year instead.

503
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:03,542
Now that you enjoyed
a nice one-year break,

504
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,752
come start working. Starting tomorrow.

505
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,505
My father told me
that you're a scary person.

506
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,174
Will you kill me if I say no?

507
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:16,847
You...

508
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,766
aren't scared of me, are you?

509
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:25,939
I know, I'm too pretty to look scary.

510
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:29,526
I agree.

511
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,571
So I'll keep thinking
that you're not a scary person

512
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:33,989
and reject the offer.

513
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,536
It was a bad idea to send you
flowers every birthday.

514
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,122
I should've sent beheaded birds instead.

515
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,835
DEAR KOO CHAN-SUNG

516
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,172
I'll give you something different

517
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,549
for your birthday this year.

518
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,913
You must be someone incredibly powerful

519
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,831
and your hotel must be
really great as well.

520
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,626
How can a weak human being like me
be of any use to you?

521
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,338
Can't you just give me up?

522
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:41,848
You are...

523
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:47,020
not going to make me the beheaded bird
as my birthday present, are you?

524
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,339
Don't worry,

525
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,591
"a weak human being."

526
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,845
Your neck is still intact.

527
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,225
What...

528
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:27,978
have you done to me?

529
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:29,563
I gave you a present.

530
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,109
Happy birthday.

531
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:38,029
This year's present is going to be
a very special one.

532
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,240
DEAR KOO CHAN-SUNG, HAPPY BIRTHDAY

533
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,344
Aren't you going to get off?

534
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,440
You want to spend more time with me?

535
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:23,283
I didn't mean to throw away
the flowers you sent me for my birthday.

536
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:26,745
They didn't allow me
to bring the flowers at the airport.

537
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,694
What did she do to me?

538
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,533
What is she planning to do with me?

539
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,667
Am I going to become her toy?

540
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,213
Chan-sung, run away.

541
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,925
It's a scary place.

542
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:27,263
I saw a dead person there.

543
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,228
Chan-sung, run away.

544
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,897
You have to run away

545
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,857
if you ever run into that woman.

546
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,318
Okay, Father.

547
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,532
Run away.

548
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,242
You have to run.

549
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:17,939
Sorry, I won't be able to start working
from next week.

550
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:20,692
I'll explain further by email.

551
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,640
By now, he would have received
his birthday present

552
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,727
and opened his eyes to a whole new world.

553
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,812
He probably can't help but panic

554
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:00,857
when he starts seeing the dead.

555
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,609
He must get used to it.

556
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,444
Since he has to work at this hotel,

557
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:06,529
he should be able to see the customers.

558
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,823
You said you didn't even warn him.

559
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,700
He might get into a serious accident

560
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,453
if he sees the dead
for the first time so unexpectedly.

561
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:15,413
You think so?

562
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,668
I can't let him die from shock.
That'll complicate things.

563
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,225
Excuse me, I was here first.

564
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,143
That cab is mine, okay?

565
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:42,774
You saw me standing here first all along.

566
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,529
You saw me, right?

567
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,614
I didn't.

568
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:51,699
I can't see you.

569
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,163
Happy birthday.

570
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,708
This year's present is going to be
a very special one.

571
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:04,087
I saw a dead person there.

572
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,757
Where are you?

573
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:10,718
Say something.

574
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,145
Hey, are you going to get in or not?

575
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:22,063
I'm getting in.

576
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,045
He got one of the scariest ones
for the first one.

577
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,141
Where should I go?

578
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:23,708
Don't come here. Please.

579
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,878
Why do you keep following me?

580
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,714
Go away. Go.

581
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,383
Go.

582
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:14,884
Go!

583
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,513
She's too harsh on him.

584
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,223
Go!

585
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:22,517
She'll make poor Chan-sung faint.

586
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,811
Go!

587
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,064
Don't take them off!

588
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,566
Don't take off your sunglasses.

589
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,484
I know you don't have any eyes.

590
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,653
You look too scary without them on.

591
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:37,532
Go!

592
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,490
I guess you're traveling far.

593
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,123
Yes.

594
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,709
The present I gave you this time

595
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,837
won't get caught at customs
at international airports.

596
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,505
You won't be able to get rid of it.

597
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,049
It's too bad.

598
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,885
Are you the one who sent me
that strange thing earlier?

599
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:42,513
No, I didn't send anything.
You're just able to see it.

600
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,808
You're just starting to see things

601
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,518
that you weren't able to earlier.

602
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,395
And what is that?

603
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:50,813
Ghosts.

604
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,027
Damn it.

605
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:59,405
There's a famous restaurant
around here that was on television.

606
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:00,865
Let's go there.

607
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:02,450
A restaurant?

608
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,619
The one I always wanted to go to.
So this is great.

609
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,913
What are you doing? Let's go.

610
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,500
If I don't go with you now,

611
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,711
will something like what I saw earlier
come to kill me?

612
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,004
You won't die.

613
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:18,049
What you saw earlier has no power
to kill the living.

614
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:20,760
Not unless your feeble heart
fails from being startled.

615
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,095
Happy?

616
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:25,306
That restaurant closes soon. Let's hurry.

617
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,016
Forget the restaurant.

618
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,601
Turn my eyes back to normal.

619
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,520
I won't go anywhere before you do that.

620
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:38,111
If we don't get there
before the closing time because of you,

621
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,781
I'll close your eyes for good.

622
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,744
Forever.

623
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,255
Open your eyes.

624
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:59,590
Humans die when they starve.

625
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,884
I brought you here so you won't die.

626
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:04,637
Do you know the show
The Guys Who Died After Eating?

627
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:07,890
This restaurant is where they came
to eat 30 orders of dumplings.

628
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,560
You can't eat them if you come late.

629
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,523
OUT OF INGREDIENTS

630
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:16,649
See?

631
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:19,277
If we'd been any later,
there wouldn't have been any food left.

632
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:26,033
Gosh, I better move that thing away.

633
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,903
It's the wench who shot a bullet at me.

634
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:12,663
Do I have to look at such scary things
all the time?

635
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,457
You were just unlucky.

636
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,751
You ended up seeing
one of the most hideous ones.

637
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,544
Not all of them are as scary.

638
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,715
Right. Him. Look at him.

639
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,343
Someone like him isn't so scary.

640
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,137
If you only get a glimpse,

641
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,431
you might just pass along
thinking he's a human.

642
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,268
Most of them are like him,
so don't be scared.

643
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,187
What is he doing over there?

644
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,271
Some of them wander around

645
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,565
because they don't know they're dead yet.

646
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,860
Some of them get obsessed
with what they liked

647
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,403
when they were alive.

648
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,781
Is he obsessed with dumplings?

649
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:48,407
It's hard to tell.

650
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:50,701
Why did you make me see such a thing?

651
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,121
You'll find out
when you come to Hotel del Luna.

652
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:59,210
Why didn't you come when I told you to?

653
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:01,587
Then you wouldn't have to go through
all this trouble.

654
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:03,172
Gosh, that's hot.

655
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,592
This is so hot.

656
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:09,136
How did Kim Jun-hyun eat
five of these in one bite?

657
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,305
He amazed me.

658
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:14,725
You should try it too.

659
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,562
You're the amazing one.

660
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,648
At a glimpse and even up close,
you look like a normal person.

661
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,108
Are you sure you're dead too?

662
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:26,404
I'm not dead.

663
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:28,781
I still haven't died.

664
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,158
I'm just here.

665
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:42,295
What do you mean, "still"?
Do you mean you might die one day?

666
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,921
Why do you ask?

667
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:47,508
Will you try to kill me?

668
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,474
Try eating them all at once.

669
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:58,060
If you succeed, I'll give you a chance.

670
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:04,358
I just...

671
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:08,237
want you to disappear from my sight.

672
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:24,211
Koo Chan-sung,
the one who hates the sight of me.

673
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,632
Go across the street
and buy me a milk tea.

674
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,884
After she ate that many dumplings?

675
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:32,011
Was she really amazed by Jun-hyun?

676
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:33,763
Is she really not a human?

677
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,097
Hurry up.

678
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:37,391
If it closes because you're late,
you'll die.

679
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,798
You're the one who shot me, aren't you?

680
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,257
I'm sure you shot me.

681
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,304
You look horrible just like your crimes.

682
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,766
You can look forward to your afterlife.

683
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:20,810
It'll be even worse.

684
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,274
It's all your fault.

685
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:28,901
It's your fault.

686
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,700
Die!

687
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:07,982
What's going on?

688
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,663
Were you stabbed?

689
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,292
Why is it that humans...

690
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:30,463
never think about their wrongs
and only blame others?

691
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,672
I asked if you are okay.

692
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:40,222
I don't dare mock that dirty old man.

693
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,393
I was once just as crazy...

694
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,396
and carried a sword with me.

695
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:50,566
Koo Chan-sung.

696
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:53,819
You failed to eat those dumplings all
at once, but I'll still give you a chance.

697
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:57,531
If you want to run away, go.

698
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:06,916
If you turn around and walk away now,

699
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,628
I'll disappear from your sight...

700
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:14,632
just as you wanted.

701
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:19,845
Go.

702
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:33,275
If you don't leave now, it'll be too late.

703
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:36,005
What is this?

704
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:38,215
I'll help you get up. Get on this cart.

705
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,136
I'll take you to a hospital
or Hotel del Luna.

706
01:09:42,636 --> 01:09:43,762
Hurry.

707
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,224
What are you doing?

708
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,476
I don't have the energy
to carry you in my arms.

709
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,145
This thing isn't dirty, so get on.

710
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:05,701
This is...

711
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,500
Are you okay?

712
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:14,710
Koo Chan-sung.

713
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,088
You're really...

714
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:21,926
weak, aren't you?

715
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,977
You dragged this cart over for me.

716
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,772
I like your feeble heart...

717
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:36,982
very much.

718
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:39,193
It's amazing knife stabs can't hurt you.

719
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,362
I guess this weak human wasted his time.

720
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:44,114
I'll go on my way, then.

721
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:45,908
You can't go.

722
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:06,679
What are you doing?

723
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:19,775
You...

724
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,819
Are you really trying to...

725
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:09,908
I gave you the chance to run away,
but you gave that up.

726
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:13,704
If you run away now,

727
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:17,124
I'll kill you.

728
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:06,465
What are you going
to make me do there anyway?

729
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:07,591
Exorcism?

730
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:08,801
We don't perform an exorcism.

731
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,719
We comfort them.

732
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:12,679
Wouldn't it be dangerous for me
to get too close?

733
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:15,307
Then address me properly. It's "Ms. Jang."

734
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:17,101
With the Harvard MBA--

735
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:18,185
You don't need an MBA.

736
01:13:18,268 --> 01:13:19,812
You can see ghosts now.

737
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:23,148
How do you expect me to live a normal life
when I can see ghosts?

738
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:26,318
Go and tell the chairman
that you can get rid of the tiger

739
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,319
in return for something.

740
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,821
You said they're not dangerous.

741
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:31,907
Come to Hotel del Luna.
You'll be safe if you stay by my side.

742
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,662
