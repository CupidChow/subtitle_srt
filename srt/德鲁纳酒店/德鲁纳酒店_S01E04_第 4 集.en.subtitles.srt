1
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,919
I'm sure you too have
things you miss in the past

2
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,713
that you can never go back to.

3
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,842
I think I saw that.

4
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,472
I told you that I saw you in a dream.

5
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,015
In a dream?

6
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,266
You were smiling

7
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,934
under a huge tree.

8
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,854
When someone said he'd build you a house,

9
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,773
you said mean things just as you do now,

10
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,483
but you were happy.

11
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,697
The man who taught you
how to write your name, Man-wol.

12
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,034
Is he the person you miss the most

13
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,286
in your past?

14
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,999
How do you see...

15
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,628
such things?

16
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,922
Why do I see you?

17
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,633
I'm scared
that I may have to pay the price for it.

18
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,597
What's the sorrow you're still feeling?

19
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,140
Maybe

20
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,768
I'm here by your side...

21
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,605
to help you get over that deep sorrow?

22
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,506
You didn't die.

23
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,467
You are tied to the Moon Tree,

24
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,096
and the flow of life and death
has stopped for you. I told you that.

25
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,184
The leaves sprout,
and the flowers bloom and wither.

26
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,938
Your time will start flowing once again.

27
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,401
The tree just changed.

28
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,112
You're right.

29
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,243
You might turn out to be someone
a lot more special than I thought.

30
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,847
I can't just leave like this.

31
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,600
What about my dog, Sun-dol?

32
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,144
There's nothing you can do
when it comes to death.

33
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,146
Gosh, I can't go!

34
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,814
I can't go!

35
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,821
Sun-dol, bark.

36
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,698
You need to bark to live.

37
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,659
If you don't, you'll die.

38
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,372
My goodness, come on.

39
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,751
Bark! You need to bark!

40
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,382
It's been a week,
and he still won't budge.

41
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,718
It's because he still has something
he's holding onto.

42
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,764
At times like this, it's not
a bad idea to help him out a little.

43
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,231
Sun-dol, you need to leave.

44
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,901
Go outside! Hurry up and go!

45
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,861
Will you please go outside?

46
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,782
Just leave him.
He won't wander for too long.

47
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,785
He'll find his way to Man-wol Inn.

48
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:49,080
It's called Hotel del Luna now,
not Man-wol Inn.

49
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,373
Yes, I forgot.

50
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,167
Man-wol Inn, Man-wol Hostel,
and then Hotel del Luna.

51
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,461
The name of that place
changes so frequently,

52
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,090
but the owner of the place
hasn't changed at all.

53
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,509
She hasn't changed for over 1,000 years.

54
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,720
She has no hope.

55
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,557
That's why I sent someone there.

56
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,477
Are you going to change the owner?

57
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,023
Man-wol's very stubborn,

58
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,192
so I just sent her some help.

59
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,743
Why did the tree change?

60
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,620
Why do you think? It's because of you.

61
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,205
It's because of me?

62
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,958
The old memories that shriveled up

63
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,669
crawled out again because of you.

64
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,880
What did I do?

65
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,383
All I did was tell you
about the dream I had of you.

66
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,761
I know seeing ghosts is part of my job,

67
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,971
but dreaming is not.

68
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,892
I don't want to be treated unfairly
for something I never even asked for.

69
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,269
You're going to get treated unfairly

70
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,606
because you've already provoked me.

71
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,903
The tree turned ugly because of you.

72
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,072
I get that you're twisted,
but don't distort the truth.

73
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,908
The tree looks alive and healthy.

74
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,034
That is

75
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,620
the problem.

76
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,707
You just saved something
that shouldn't have been saved.

77
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,710
Seeing that you're so angry,

78
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,047
I guess my dream
really was about your past.

79
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,425
Are you embarrassed that I saw your past?

80
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,428
Yes.

81
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,224
I'm extremely embarrassed right now.

82
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,644
So I need to check this for myself.

83
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,111
What are you doing?

84
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,244
This is wrong.

85
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,912
Stay still.

86
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,667
Stop it.

87
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,878
Chan-sung, let's sleep.

88
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,880
Jang Man-won.

89
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,508
You need to sleep
in order to have that dream.

90
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,177
I need to check for myself
if you really saw me in a dream

91
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,305
or if you're deceiving me
using all the rumors

92
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,141
you heard in this hotel.

93
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,561
Chan-sung, go to sleep.

94
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,522
I can't fall asleep like this.

95
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,774
And I can't guarantee
that I'll have that dream again

96
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,359
even if I do fall asleep.

97
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,237
Then sleep next to me
until you do have that dream.

98
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,866
I don't want to sleep next to you.

99
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,410
Be quiet and go to sleep
while I'm being nice.

100
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,248
Fine. I'll sleep.

101
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,750
You can sleep next to me
or watch me sleep.

102
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:40,835
Do as you want.

103
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,423
I'm going to kill you
if it turns out to be a lie.

104
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,216
You just want it to be a lie

105
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,469
because you don't like
that I saw your past.

106
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,388
I'm not going to tell you

107
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,348
what I see in my dreams
since you hate it so much.

108
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,225
You can kill me or let me live.
Do as you want.

109
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,525
Forget it. I'm not sleeping next to you.

110
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,679
Do the memories that I revived
pain you that much?

111
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,643
Because you can't stop thinking about him?

112
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,437
Shut your mouth unless you want
to turn all green like the tree.

113
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,980
Who is that man?

114
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:45,900
Why do you ask?

115
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,944
You think it might be you?

116
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,907
Yes, that thought did occur to me.

117
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,619
What I saw could be a memory
from my past life that I don't remember.

118
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,165
There's no way you're him.

119
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,166
Why?

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,628
You've been on my mind
ever since I had that dream.

121
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,883
You and I might go back a long way.

122
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,776
You're not him.

123
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,445
I feel nothing.

124
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,865
If you were him,
I definitely wouldn't feel this way.

125
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,787
That's a huge relief.

126
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,208
I kept wondering, "What if I'm the man
she liked in the past?"

127
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,626
It's been bothering me a lot.

128
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,046
You didn't have feelings for him?

129
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,132
You seemed to like him. A lot.

130
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,967
A lot.

131
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,135
Chan-sung.

132
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,722
If you keep spewing useless nonsense,

133
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,224
you'll get treated more unfairly.

134
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,517
More unfairly? How?

135
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,478
What? Are you not going to pay me?
I signed the contract though!

136
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,563
Chan-sung!

137
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,066
Starting today,

138
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,194
you'll deal with ghost guests.

139
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,563
How long has it been since--

140
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,488
I guess you were lost for some time.
I'll help you with your check-in.

141
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,157
I'll make sure you can use
our beauty and hair services first.

142
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,201
This way, please. Let's take the elevator.

143
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,763
What's going on? Is Ms. Jang still angry
even after drinking a case of champagne?

144
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,558
I must've upset her somehow.
I think she's livid now.

145
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,940
Well, what kind of sin
did Ms. Jang commit in the past?

146
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,151
Does it have something to do
with a love affair?

147
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,487
I'm not sure.

148
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,782
Have you heard anything about a man
she's perhaps waiting for?

149
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,409
No, nothing.

150
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,619
Really?

151
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,921
Is she not waiting for him?

152
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,297
Mr. Koo.

153
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,466
Are you concerned
about what she's thinking?

154
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,094
No, not at all.

155
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,012
She's not waiting
for the first and second choices.

156
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,140
Who cares if you were the third one?
You're here now.

157
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,266
Mr. Ji.

158
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,394
I don't care at all
about what Ms. Jang thinks.

159
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,438
Besides, I wasn't the third choice.

160
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,150
I was the zeroth choice.
I beat everyone else.

161
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,444
The zeroth choice? Sure.

162
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,571
-I'm serious.
-Okay, you were the zeroth choice.

163
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,744
It's all useless though.
She said she felt nothing.

164
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,999
What's this spooky feeling?

165
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,251
I think quite a number of guests
are coming.

166
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:33,961
Will you be all right?

167
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,551
No, I won't.

168
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:46,390
When our guests first arrive,
they're often broken and ripped.

169
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,767
Sometimes,
they have something tagging along.

170
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,229
But all the guests here are groomed,
so you'll be fine.

171
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,820
I'm now experienced enough
to handle this much.

172
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,116
Can I get a refill on my coffee?

173
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,453
We've run out of coffee beans.

174
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,663
Please give us a moment.
We'll bring it to your table.

175
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,297
How do you procure
the things that the guests

176
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,715
eat and drink here?

177
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,800
You can't get things delivered
from a store.

178
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,719
We get them from the afterlife.

179
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,890
When we treat our guests well
and help them go to the afterlife,

180
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,642
we get compensated for our work.

181
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,061
You mean, the ghosts pay you?

182
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,355
They leave good energy behind.

183
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,358
And that energy makes
the flowers in our garden bloom.

184
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,611
The less regrets they take with them,
the more beautiful the flowers are.

185
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,782
When our garden is filled with flowers,
Mago takes them

186
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:48,494
and sends us the supplies
that we need in return.

187
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,249
Then why does Ms. Jang

188
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,459
need to earn money through the ghosts?

189
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,340
It's all for her lavish lifestyle.

190
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,134
She spends all the money
on her expensive champagnes,

191
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,720
clothes, jewelry, and cars.

192
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,473
How could someone who's being punished
have such an attitude?

193
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,521
You said she's being punished.

194
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,191
Someone told me
that I'm arrogant and foolish.

195
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,819
Although I don't agree with it.

196
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,583
I saw you in a dream.

197
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,839
The leaves sprout,
and the flowers bloom and wither.

198
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,718
The time of life and death
will flow once again.

199
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,682
That wicked old hag is
pulling a silly trick on me.

200
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,855
The man who taught you
how to write your name, Man-wol.

201
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,733
Is he the person you miss the most

202
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,277
in your past?

203
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,418
Goodness.

204
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,588
A slave ran away!

205
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,506
Someone must've helped her. Find them.

206
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,800
Who ran away?

207
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,966
She's not here. Search outside.

208
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,851
I heard the market where slaves
from Goguryeo are traded, was attacked.

209
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,645
I had a feeling it might be you guys,
so I came to check.

210
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,606
Thank goodness I'm nimble.

211
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,400
I almost got killed by your dagger.

212
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,406
No, I saved you because I'm nimble.

213
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,868
I'm much obliged,

214
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,787
but what will you do about this?

215
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,582
My face is very precious.

216
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,833
How will you pay for this?

217
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,543
Too bad.

218
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,629
The young lady at the Yeongju Castle
adores your face.

219
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,798
How will you seduce her from now on?

220
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,139
Do you think she only adores my face?

221
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,853
Don't be such a baby.

222
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,814
Let go. Let go of me.

223
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,483
I said, let go!

224
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,527
Shut it! Get him over here at once.
What are you waiting for?

225
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,528
Get up!

226
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,906
You bastards, let go!

227
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,491
Let go.

228
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,575
Yeon-u.

229
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,786
Yeon-u.

230
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,457
Let go. Yeon-u. It's Yeon-u.

231
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,001
Shut your mouth!

232
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,297
If you get out, you'll get caught too.

233
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,885
I give you my word.
I'll be sure to save him

234
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,470
and bring him to you.

235
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,597
I promise.

236
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:47,960
Yeon-u.

237
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,589
Easy.

238
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,724
Yeon-u.

239
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:11,900
Are you all right?

240
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:13,902
I'm okay.

241
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,295
You have been waiting for that person

242
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,630
over this long period of time.

243
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,269
It is...

244
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,190
too green and too gaudy.

245
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,153
It looks ridiculous.

246
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,316
Yeon-u.

247
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,110
One of them was Yeon-u.

248
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,322
He was in Man-wol's gang.

249
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,802
Are you selling those flowers?

250
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,470
How much is it? I'd like to buy one.

251
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,722
No, that's fine.

252
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,183
I already gave yours.

253
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:20,237
Your dad almost died,
trying to pluck a flower for you.

254
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:25,158
Because of that incident, he stopped
stealing and lived a diligent life.

255
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,288
And he also raised a great son like you.

256
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,418
Flowers! Flowers are the best present
for birthdays.

257
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,669
Flowers.

258
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,672
Weren't you the lady...

259
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:43,302
So how is it? How's working at the hotel?

260
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,221
Did you set this up?

261
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,684
All I did was open a path.

262
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,937
Are you telling me that it wasn't
a coincidence he went to the hotel?

263
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,816
I planted a tree, you know.

264
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,987
Gosh, that tree has been growing
spiky branches

265
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,948
and unwelcoming to the others.

266
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,328
I want you to take good care of the tree.

267
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,457
Okay? If you have a hard time
looking after the tree,

268
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,917
you can come find me.

269
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:23,026
TO THE SAMDO RIVER

270
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,079
TO HEAVEN

271
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,333
Excuse me.

272
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,544
Hold on.

273
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,592
Sir.

274
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,849
Sun-dol, you brat.

275
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,809
You shouldn't be here.

276
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,896
I can't take you with me. Okay?

277
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,149
You... Goodness.

278
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:06,194
Where I'm headed is not a place for you.

279
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,287
He died all alone.
It looks like it's been a few days.

280
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,206
The door was open.
Why didn't the dog come out?

281
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,624
That's strange.

282
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,255
You shouldn't follow me there.

283
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:29,259
My goodness, you poor thing. Goodness.

284
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,513
Okay. Let's go there together, okay?
We'll go together.

285
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,365
Mago plucks the flowers

286
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,993
and hands them out to the people
who are headed to their afterlife.

287
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,246
And the souls who leave
with Mago's farewells

288
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,207
go to a good place.

289
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,043
That lady earlier...

290
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,754
is Mago?

291
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,427
PHARMACY
11-28 YAKJAE-GOLMOKGIL, GYEONGDONG MARKET

292
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:02,936
What's that?

293
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,902
Chan-sung, come on out!

294
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,029
Chan-sung!

295
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,290
Chan-sung, here.
I bought the most amazing bread.

296
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,459
Someone saw a ghost
at a bakery I regularly go to.

297
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,296
A ghost kneaded the dough
for this bread, so I waited to buy it.

298
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,299
Sanchez, don't say stuff like that.

299
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,718
I don't want to hear about ghosts
even at my own home.

300
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,346
Hey, what if the ghost who made this
followed me home?

301
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,435
Why are you here?

302
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,936
Why are you here again?

303
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,273
Chan-sung, what are you doing?
You're scaring me.

304
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,359
There's no ghost here. It's just bread.

305
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,902
Did you follow him here?

306
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,699
Did you follow the bread?

307
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,330
Chan-sung, I apologize for my silly story.

308
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,040
Let's just eat the bread. Okay?

309
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,374
I'm good. You eat it.

310
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,626
I think I have to go back to work now.

311
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:14,257
Hey. How can I eat this bread
after what you said just now?

312
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,870
Seems like Mr. Third Choice
brought back a guest who went out.

313
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,332
She went out of here,
went to a bakery, and made bread.

314
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,459
She shouldn't have done
something like that.

315
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:53,380
She's the one that was supposed
to leave in a limousine today, right?

316
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:56,216
Yes, Mr. Koo went to Ms. Jang
to get her signature

317
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,468
for postponing the limousine reservation.

318
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,805
Did she want to have bread
before leaving this world?

319
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,349
She can't even eat bread
from this world anyway.

320
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,850
She should've called for room service.

321
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,602
Why did she go to a bakery?

322
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:11,189
Hyeon-jung, can't you pay better attention
to the guests coming and leaving?

323
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,274
Do you want to get on the bus
to the afterlife?

324
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,529
I had a big group of guests yesterday,
so I was swamped.

325
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,197
Do your job right.

326
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,375
That was mean.

327
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,129
Wasn't it? How can she tell me
to take the bus?

328
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,131
Yes, that was a harsh thing to say.

329
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,841
Why is she so on edge like that?

330
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,510
Oh, it will be the 25th soon.

331
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,264
It's that day already.
We'll pass through it safely, won't we?

332
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,390
We have to.

333
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,892
If what happened 42 years ago
happens again,

334
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,520
Ms. Choe will be
dragged to the afterlife for sure.

335
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,327
A ghost can't just go around this world
stirring up trouble.

336
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,788
She didn't do anything serious,

337
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,040
so tell her to go
to the other world as planned.

338
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,667
I want to change that reservation.

339
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,586
Please sign here.

340
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:15,670
RESERVATION CHANGE

341
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,008
There's someone she really wants to see.

342
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,678
Every single ghost has someone
that they want to see!

343
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,099
She wants to see that person
because she never saw him

344
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,434
when she was alive.

345
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,728
She was blind when she was alive.

346
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,439
How can she want to see the person
when she has never seen him?

347
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,232
She doesn't even know the name.

348
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,443
Why is she looking for someone
she doesn't even know?

349
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,861
Forget it and go.

350
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,070
Stop annoying me.

351
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,989
She says her hands remember.

352
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,283
If she holds the hands,
she can feel who it is.

353
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,328
That's some nonsense a ghost is spewing.

354
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,705
Go away!

355
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,504
Is what you said also nonsense then?

356
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,757
You said you can tell by your feelings.

357
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,717
That I'm definitely not that man.

358
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,763
Then you don't know either.

359
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:09,891
You are...

360
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,065
definitely not him.

361
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,238
I'm right then, so you should sign this.

362
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,494
Darn.

363
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,106
JANG MAN-WOL

364
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,613
I'll find her that person
and then send her off.

365
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,158
She is the first guest I brought,
so I want to send her off nicely.

366
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,879
Don't try to get money off her.

367
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,463
She doesn't have any.

368
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,593
Why are you doing something
that won't get you money?

369
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,095
You're being used by that ghost.

370
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:32,640
You're so weakhearted.
Such an easy target for ghosts.

371
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,934
You're right.

372
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,812
If I'd been tougher and held out,
I wouldn't have ended up here.

373
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,565
I regret that I'm such a weak human being

374
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,774
that you like so much.

375
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,486
-Are you being sarcastic?
-I'm saying it's my fate.

376
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,907
I don't regret bringing you in

377
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,159
and complicating your life.

378
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,581
Do you really think you did that?

379
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,293
They say, "You complicate your own life."

380
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,503
Maybe it wasn't you who dragged me here.

381
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,214
Maybe I was the one who pushed myself
into the place I felt drawn to.

382
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:07,884
Drink this.

383
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,929
You should drink as much water as alcohol,
so you won't feel dry.

384
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,101
I'll bring some bread when I come back.

385
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,187
The place we're visiting
is a famous bakery.

386
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,690
It's the place that comedian
Kim Jun-hyun visited.

387
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,735
Try the Eat At Once game.

388
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,363
Why are you being nice?
You're making me nervous.

389
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,865
Are you giving me poison nicely?

390
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,117
I'm trying to take care of you.

391
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,119
If I give you water and bread,

392
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,537
who knows?

393
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,624
Leaves have sprouted from the dry tree.
Maybe flowers might bloom.

394
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,377
Don't.

395
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,338
Do you think I'm some seedling
that sprouts when you give it water?

396
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:50,218
I'm an old tree that's been dry
for over a thousand years.

397
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,429
The tree has leaves now.
I think it will be worthwhile.

398
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,224
-Stop being weird!
-Am I bothering you?

399
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,310
You said you didn't feel anything.
I guess that's not true.

400
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,776
That stupid...

401
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,987
Hey, Chan-sung.

402
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,865
Don't do this. Don't come here anymore.

403
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,742
Why? I have work to do.

404
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,369
You don't have to come here.

405
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,538
I'll let you go.

406
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,415
I have nowhere to go now.

407
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,667
Because you made me
leave the last hotel like that,

408
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,293
they hate me. I can't go back there.

409
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,129
There are other hotels on the Forbes list.

410
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,923
They liked me when they didn't know
I can see ghosts.

411
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,341
Not anymore.

412
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,428
And you have no one else except for me.

413
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,139
You were the third choice.

414
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,224
There are two other candidates,
and they're better.

415
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,851
Oh, those two.

416
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,812
They're too tough and strong for this job.

417
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:46,149
You need an easy target for ghosts
like me.

418
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,151
Someone who can resolve their grudges.

419
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,361
Here, I'm the zeroth pick.

420
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,531
Chan-sung.

421
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,535
If you keep doing this,
I really won't like you.

422
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,704
Having you like me
because I'm not bothering you.

423
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,873
Having you not like me
because I'm bothering you.

424
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,042
I prefer the latter.

425
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,170
I'll accompany the guest outside.

426
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,221
He will keep on provoking me?

427
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,559
He thinks I'm a joke
because the tree has leaves now.

428
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,058
What kind of bread are you looking for?

429
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,687
The bread that you're baking now

430
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,565
smells so nice.

431
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,953
It's chestnut bread.

432
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,670
It's warm, right?

433
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,255
And fluffy.

434
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,799
I just baked it.

435
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:38,136
Every time I went there,
he held my hand warmly.

436
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,806
My heart was thumping so hard,
I was afraid he'd know how I felt.

437
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,891
So I never got to talk to him properly.

438
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,527
You don't know his face or his name.

439
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,155
But you will know for sure
when you hold his hand, right?

440
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,576
If you approach him with those hands,

441
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,619
you will only make him scared
and fail to hold him.

442
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,917
Shall I tell them the situation
and find out?

443
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,132
Okay, I will lend my body to you.

444
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:33,357
Wow, the bread here is the best.

445
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,360
Thank you.

446
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,990
You made the bread with this hand.
It's a great hand.

447
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,337
It's not him.

448
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,799
Can you recommend a cake?

449
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,426
What about this strawberry cake?

450
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,969
The chocolate cake looks good too.

451
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,350
There's cheesecake too.

452
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,104
They're all delicious.

453
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,734
There's only one left, so it must be him.

454
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,238
Can I save points here?

455
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,365
Yes, do you have our membership card?

456
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,200
I didn't bring it.

457
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,868
Tell me your phone number.

458
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,581
Zero, one, zero...

459
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,049
What's your problem?

460
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:44,345
-This guy has been acting strange.
-Who are you?

461
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,471
Well, I...

462
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,016
Chan-sung.

463
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:50,935
What are you doing?

464
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,687
Sanchez.

465
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,523
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

466
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,442
I'm sorry.

467
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,486
Take care.

468
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,701
What did you tell them?

469
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,662
I told them you're not a weirdo
and said sorry.

470
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,872
They said you should
never come here again.

471
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,750
I'm sorry, Sanchez.

472
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,628
Why did you do that?

473
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,172
I thought you went to the hotel.
Why are you here?

474
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,216
A guest asked me
to look for someone there.

475
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,342
Jeez.

476
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,136
You could've just asked for the name

477
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,930
instead of kneading the hands
of all the employees.

478
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,308
I had my reasons.

479
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,562
You should've asked me for help.

480
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,314
I'm a regular customer here.

481
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,277
Do you remember
every employee who worked here?

482
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,528
Of course I do.

483
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,032
Let go.

484
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,289
Am I the only one who sees

485
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,416
these green things?

486
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,667
Leaves have sprouted

487
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,753
on the tree.

488
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,964
It's so beautiful. Let's take a photo.

489
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,967
We shouldn't be marveling but lamenting.

490
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,678
It's a sign
that the hotel will face hardship.

491
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:08,846
Why is that?

492
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,807
Man-wol is being punished
by being tied to this tree.

493
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,019
Such changes to the tree must mean
that her punishment is coming to an end.

494
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,854
What's so wrong with that?

495
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,939
Think about what will happen
after she leaves.

496
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,692
We're still here thanks to her,
so what will happen to us?

497
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,861
We'll have to take
the bus to the afterlife.

498
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:25,988
No way.

499
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,740
I can't leave yet.

500
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,241
Same here.

501
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,327
Why did this suddenly happen?

502
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,745
What changed?

503
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,957
We have a new manager.

504
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,883
I guess Mr. Third Choice has something
to do with this.

505
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,062
The person you're looking for is
working here now.

506
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,856
Hello, here's the coffee you ordered.

507
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,024
That's him.

508
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,860
It tastes better
if you stir thoroughly. Enjoy.

509
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,028
Thank you.

510
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,282
Would you like to hold his hand?

511
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:17,915
Excuse me.

512
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,625
Yes?

513
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,962
Hello, I was a regular customer
of the bakery you worked at.

514
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,966
Oh, I see.

515
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:30,052
I hope you come by here often too.

516
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,172
It's warm, right?

517
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,965
And fluffy.

518
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,594
I just baked it.

519
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,164
Spend some time here
and come back to the hotel.

520
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,474
Do you feel proud?

521
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,273
It was worth it.

522
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,444
Is this a new car?

523
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,656
Yes, isn't it sweet?

524
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,617
The tacky poop color is not fit for a car.

525
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,536
Bright color like this is better.

526
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,329
So you went ahead and bought one?

527
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,414
No, but I call dibs.

528
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,294
Count me out
if you're off to buy one right now.

529
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,797
I'd rather get some sleep.

530
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,215
Sure, let's go sleep.

531
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,175
Sorry?

532
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,052
Let's sleep together.

533
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,388
I'm going to see how you dream this time.

534
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:41,725
As my boss, saying you'd like to
sleep with me is inappropriate.

535
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,269
I'll let it slide just this once.

536
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,770
Would you rather get a bite to eat?

537
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:47,565
I never said I wouldn't sleep.
I'm just not sleeping with you.

538
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,234
That's not what I said.
I only asked you out for a meal.

539
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,736
Do you realize that
you're not making any sense?

540
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,530
You said you'd look after me.

541
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,782
Seeing that I sleep and eat well is
how you do it.

542
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:57,741
Chan-sung.

543
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,035
Look after me.

544
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,669
What would you like to eat?

545
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,021
This place is quite famous
on social media.

546
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,564
I wanted to try the food.

547
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,815
You knew, right?

548
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,943
You knew that this is my friend's place.

549
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,112
Will you believe me if I say no?

550
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,905
Why ask when you're not going to?

551
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,240
What's good here?

552
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,659
Why ask when you won't even order
what I recommend?

553
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,202
You know me well.

554
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,623
I'll have this.

555
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,709
You'll have this. I want to try them both.

556
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:50,669
Chan-sung!

557
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,383
Sanchez is my roommate.

558
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,843
He gets scared easily,

559
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,928
so don't mention anything about ghosts.

560
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:04,016
You must've lied to Sanchez
about where you work.

561
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,269
-Hi, Sanchez.
-Hey.

562
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,146
Did you find the man you were looking for?

563
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,314
Yes, thanks to you.

564
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,068
So this is my colleague.

565
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,196
She must be a hotelier too.

566
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,447
That's so cool.

567
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,532
We'll order number 2 and number 15.

568
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,242
Sure thing. Let's see.

569
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,244
It's a hard place to work at, isn't it?

570
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,624
Chan-sung's been stressed out
ever since he started to work there.

571
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,169
You said the owner was a maniac, right?

572
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,629
That lady...

573
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,172
What was her name again?

574
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,383
-Jang Man-wol.
-Yes, Jang Man-wol.

575
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,094
I remember because the name is so weird.

576
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,346
Anyway, from what I hear,

577
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,641
employees must badmouth their bosses
to relieve stress at work.

578
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,393
So when I serve the pizza,

579
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,269
think of it as that owner's head.

580
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,439
And enjoy your meal
while ripping her apart.

581
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,441
Rip, bite, and chew, all right?

582
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:04,451
It'll take more than one pizza
to vent all your anger.

583
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,328
Order another one.

584
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,082
I never called you a maniac.

585
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,543
I only said you were hard to reason with.

586
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:13,877
What's so wrong about it?

587
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,505
Don't we all get a little crazy sometimes?

588
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,135
Anyway, this reminds me

589
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:25,180
of the loaf of bread
you promised to get me.

590
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,476
How did it go at the bakery?

591
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,437
It all went well.

592
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,856
Her hands guided her to the right place.

593
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,858
Is that so?

594
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,486
But the memories
that ghosts have can get...

595
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,823
all mixed up sometimes.

596
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,285
Floating around so for long

597
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,371
makes them forget what's important.

598
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,630
Sometimes, they only remember

599
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,716
what they want to remember.

600
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,379
You said
that she only remembered his hands.

601
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,800
That's a beautiful memory.

602
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,347
Still, it's missing something.

603
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,391
She lived a decently long life,

604
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,727
but his hand is
the only thing she desperately remembers

605
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,313
just because he kindly picked up
bread for her?

606
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,777
What are you getting at?

607
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,238
The most important memories for a ghost

608
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:06,198
are mostly the same.

609
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,326
The memories of when they died.

610
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,956
Help me.

611
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,914
Chan-sung.

612
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,500
Come to my hotel if you die.

613
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,083
Darn it. What's your problem?

614
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,181
If you do this,
you'll turn to ashes and disappear.

615
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,682
Don't leave in vain like that.

616
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,980
I'll make sure he gets punished
for what he did.

617
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,732
I promise!

618
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:14,089
You found the guy who committed
a hit-and-run six months ago?

619
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:17,092
So you caught him by yourself
and brought him here?

620
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:20,136
Yes, he hit a blind woman
who was crossing the street

621
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,722
with his motorcycle and ran away,
leaving her for dead.

622
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,224
Oh, really?

623
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,685
Gosh, you're incredible.

624
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,523
"He hit a blind woman
who was crossing the street..."

625
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:08,268
You're the first guest
I'm sending off at this hotel.

626
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,688
I heard you go to a nice place
if you receive that flower.

627
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,399
Thank you.

628
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,403
The memory I had of his hand
was a horrible one.

629
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:21,323
But I was a fool to remember it

630
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,450
as a warm and heart-fluttering memory.

631
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,036
That's because you were probably
the kind of person

632
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,623
who always tried to remember
happy memories

633
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,292
regardless of how small they were

634
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,961
over terrible hardships you had.

635
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,703
SAMDO RIVER

636
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:48,910
Sir.

637
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,665
Would you like some more coffee?

638
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,200
Isn't this place huge?

639
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:38,043
There's a sandy beach if you go outside.

640
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:39,836
Your son will love it.

641
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,005
Thank you.

642
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:43,631
Let's go have fun in the water.

643
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,925
Come on.

644
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:50,972
Do you want me to carry you?

645
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,475
There we go.

646
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:57,729
The father and son came together
due to a car accident.

647
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,029
Gi-ung, stop!

648
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,532
Gi-ung, no!

649
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,175
He still hasn't come to his senses
even after what he saw.

650
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:32,639
Ms. Jang.

651
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,725
We saw the tree in the garden.

652
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,812
Everyone's feeling very nervous.

653
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:55,286
The tree's been dead for over 1,000 years.
Why did it suddenly come back to life?

654
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,997
Mago told me
that someone will come and help me leave.

655
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,833
I guess that person's here.

656
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,960
Is that person Mr. Koo?

657
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,336
Yes.

658
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:05,338
What did Mr. Koo say?

659
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:07,132
He told me that he'll take care of me

660
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:10,093
and that he'll try to make flowers
bloom along with the leaves.

661
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:12,971
I guess I'll be gone

662
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,223
once the flowers fall.

663
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,767
Then what about us?
What's going to happen to us?

664
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,103
How would I know?

665
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,105
That's up to you.

666
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,233
We can give up all together
and move onto the afterlife.

667
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,527
Or you can roam around
this world as vengeful ghosts

668
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,945
and turn into ashes.

669
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,072
Suit yourself.

670
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,616
We must stay at the hotel a little longer.

671
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,910
And you can't leave just yet either.

672
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:40,540
We should let go of Mr. Koo.
Besides, he was our third choice,

673
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,500
and we have the fourth candidate ready.

674
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,880
Hey. Isn't that too harsh?

675
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,218
Don't distract me and go away.

676
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,428
I'm sorry.

677
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,554
We'll go away.

678
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,972
What's gotten into her?

679
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,098
What's her deal?

680
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,391
Let's just go.

681
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,767
She's unbelievable.

682
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:08,443
A ghost has taken up her body.
And she's bold too. She's the perfect fit.

683
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,156
Right. We have another candidate.

684
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:17,285
I helped her steal the body,
so I can definitely use that against her.

685
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,121
Besides, her family is loaded too.

686
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,748
Let's let go of Mr. Koo.

687
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,501
He won't leave.

688
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,045
I told him to leave, but he said no.

689
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,255
Koo Chan-sung can see ghosts now.

690
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,381
And he's settling in too.

691
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:32,467
Even if I kick him out
with his eyes carved out,

692
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,594
he'll see ghosts and the hotel.

693
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:38,014
Mago will be able to take away
his ability to see the ghosts.

694
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:42,227
You think that old hag will do me a favor?
She's the one who sent him to me.

695
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,562
We can't kill a human,

696
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,523
but if we let him be,
we'll have to get on the bus.

697
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,733
There's a way to fix this
without killing him.

698
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,028
The guest...

699
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:56,324
who's staying in Room 13.

700
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,371
The guest in Room 13...

701
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,641
The guest in Room 13 hates
even the sound of a human's breath.

702
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,312
If a human sees the guest in Room 13,

703
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,273
the human will go crazy.

704
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:31,568
Are you suggesting
that we make him go mad?

705
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,781
Yes.

706
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:40,827
If he goes crazy
and roams around like a madman,

707
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,788
he won't be able to come here
even though he sees ghosts.

708
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:46,708
This world would isolate such people
without our involvement.

709
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,293
Mental institution.

710
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:51,546
Ms. Jang, do you approve of this?

711
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:04,809
Where is Koo Chan-sung now?

712
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:45,099
This punk keeps making my garden
look more and more hideous.

713
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,819
No one told you to chase around a ghost
without getting any sleep.

714
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:59,656
You don't have much time left
as a sane man.

715
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,116
It looks like you're wasting
your precious time sleeping.

716
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:10,416
What a shame.

717
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,335
But it's all your fault.

718
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,837
You were really my cup of tea,

719
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:17,423
but I hate that you can look into me.

720
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,361
Why are you smiling?

721
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,738
Did you come here,
so we could sleep together?

722
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,824
Are you happy
now that you watched me sleep?

723
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:45,993
You saw me in your dream again?

724
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:47,370
Do you want to know?

725
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,415
Sit down. I'll tell you

726
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,792
what you were like in my dream.

727
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,757
This is what I hate.

728
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,761
I should be saying that I'll rip
your mouth open if you don't shut up.

729
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:09,267
But for a second, I thought about
sitting down there. And I really hate it.

730
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:14,397
You haven't budged an inch
for over 1,000 years.

731
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,649
A second means a lot.

732
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:20,319
Yes, this change means a lot to me,

733
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,489
and you'll have to pay for it.

734
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:26,451
You agreed that you're the one
who complicated your own life.

735
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:29,746
Whatever happens to you,
it's all your fault.

736
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,543
If something happens to me,
I'm sure you'll protect me.

737
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:42,508
You said you were going to protect me
as I'm a weak human.

738
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,639
You were the one
who stopped the motorcycle.

739
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:52,894
No, I didn't. I couldn't care less.

740
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,188
I know that it was you.

741
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,981
I jumped in because I trusted you.

742
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:58,733
I said, it wasn't me.

743
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:01,444
I trust that you will protect me.

744
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,990
So please protect me
if something happens to me.

745
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,202
I will stay right next to you.

746
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,915
I'm going to kick you out.

747
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,137
Did it come from the dream?

748
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:54,098
That second of Man-wol?

749
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:09,238
Mr. Koo.

750
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,949
I need your help with a guest.

751
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,869
Okay. Which room is the guest in?

752
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:20,124
It's Room 13.
She's a long-term stay guest.

753
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:30,635
Burn this incense stick in Room 13.

754
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:32,720
Okay, I'll do that.

755
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,806
The guest is very picky.

756
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,850
I'm sorry for troubling you.

757
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:43,439
I'm getting used to ghost guests now.

758
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:44,899
Don't worry.

759
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:01,082
I'm sorry.

760
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,919
I feel like I'm giving up
on my virtue as a scholar.

761
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:06,837
I'm ashamed.

762
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,799
I liked him. He was like a good friend.

763
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,994
Mr. Koo is

764
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,580
on his way to Room 13 now.

765
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,765
Where is the guest?

766
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:17,815
Chan-sung!

767
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:23,988
Don't look.

768
01:11:28,742 --> 01:11:30,286
Don't let her hear your breathing.

769
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:38,669
But I hear--

770
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:40,337
Don't listen to it.

771
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:46,468
What's the matter?

772
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:54,805
Chan-sung isn't going anywhere.
I'm keeping him by my side.

773
01:13:54,888 --> 01:13:56,682
You sent me to that room
on purpose, didn't you?

774
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:58,559
I lost one of the earrings.

775
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:00,477
You'll go bankrupt at this rate.

776
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:02,604
Be kind and cut down on your spending.

777
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:06,150
She's being forced into a marriage.

778
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:07,651
You think this is the front desk?

779
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:09,653
Ma'am, you can't do this to our employee.

780
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:11,864
-I am okay with it.
-Gosh.

781
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:13,574
Please take it.

782
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:15,868
You'll actually marry her?

783
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:17,578
Jang Man-wol...

784
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,371
Do you love me too?

785
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:21,748
