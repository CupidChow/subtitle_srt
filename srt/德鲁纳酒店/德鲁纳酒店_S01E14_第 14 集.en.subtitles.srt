1
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,437
Stop.

2
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,150
What are you doing?

3
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,986
These are the belongings
of the executed men.

4
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,864
We were told to keep what's useful
and burn the rest.

5
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,047
Don't burn the belongings of the dead.

6
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,925
Gather all of them.

7
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,703
Give these to the men who survived

8
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,081
so that they can hold a proper funeral.

9
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,835
Wait.

10
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,183
I will kill you.

11
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,520
I will kill you

12
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,189
at all costs.

13
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,440
Chan-sung!

14
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,824
I was so scared you might never come back.

15
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,113
Who...

16
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,576
are you?

17
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,877
Mr. Koo!

18
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,463
-Mr. Koo!
-Mr. Koo!

19
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,257
Mr. Koo!

20
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,223
Thank goodness you're okay.

21
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,559
We were really worried.

22
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,436
My heart dropped again.

23
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,448
Ms. Jang, you must've been
really startled.

24
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,866
Do you feel unwell?

25
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,453
No, I'm fine.

26
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,586
I'm okay. I must've startled you a lot.

27
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,096
Ms. Jang must be angry.

28
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,224
She's probably just embarrassed
that she ran over here all startled.

29
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,103
Anyway, I'm relieved
that you managed to find your way out.

30
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,645
This is...

31
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,065
the end for us.

32
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,947
Who is that man?

33
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,658
Why do you ask? You think it might be you?

34
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,660
That thought did occur to me.

35
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:54,122
What I saw could be a memory
from my past life that I don't remember.

36
00:06:56,374 --> 00:07:00,128
Koo Chan-sung will eventually
bring him to you.

37
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,552
This is absurd.

38
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,138
Chan-sung can't be him.

39
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,867
It seems Man-wol will get seriously swayed

40
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,994
by this

41
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,414
small and green light.

42
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,961
You've become

43
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,298
very weak because you had to come back

44
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,924
from the afterlife.

45
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,886
And now, you're so dim.

46
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,954
This alcohol is for the living.

47
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,873
You almost crossed the threshold
of the afterlife,

48
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,875
so hurry up and drink something
from this world.

49
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,253
Thank you.

50
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,303
I'm so relieved that you didn't get lost
and found your way out.

51
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,346
Yes, I heard

52
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,391
that time runs at a different speed there
and that I could lose my memory.

53
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,519
"A man was gone for a moment
and came back,

54
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,062
and 30 years had passed."

55
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,105
Such a folktale wasn't a joke.

56
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,815
I heard this from the Grim Reaper.

57
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,902
Someone remembered his past life
on his way back from the afterlife,

58
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,196
which completely ruined his life
in the living realm.

59
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,280
His past life?

60
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,866
Did you see anything odd
when you were there?

61
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,628
I think I remember seeing
something twinkling in the dark.

62
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,546
I see.

63
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,297
What was that?

64
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,552
We don't know. We've never gone in there.

65
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,556
You got to go in there
even before we dead ones do.

66
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,350
By the way, how did you manage
to return right away?

67
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,601
I heard it's not easy.

68
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,436
Frankly, I have no recollection
whatsoever.

69
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,897
I was out of there
when I came to my senses.

70
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,775
You lost your memory.
Here, drink some more.

71
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,320
Ms. Jang.

72
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,914
I thought the kid got on the car
to the afterlife.

73
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,208
I ended up going in there,
trying to stop that.

74
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,753
Both the kid and I are fine,
so don't be mad.

75
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,298
I'm really fine.

76
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,100
You are just Chan-sung.

77
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,900
Do you still...

78
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,028
see me in your dreams?

79
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,660
No, I haven't seen you in my dreams

80
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,080
since the day I had a very long dream.

81
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,959
Then, did you see someone else?

82
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,336
I haven't told you

83
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,339
because I wasn't sure whether it was
a dream or just my imagination,

84
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,299
but I saw that man.

85
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,219
The man named Cheong-myeong.

86
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,140
He was waiting for you

87
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,018
by the lake all by himself.

88
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,856
He was holding an ornament
with your moon-shaped symbol

89
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,025
in his hands.

90
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,864
Have you

91
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,909
received such a gift?

92
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,038
No.

93
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,252
If I wasn't looking into your past,

94
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,837
what was that dream about?

95
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,387
You told me before
that perhaps you were seeing

96
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,558
memories from your past life
that you don't remember.

97
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,726
But you said that was impossible.

98
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:13,816
Yes.

99
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,652
It's impossible.

100
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,781
Are you anxious

101
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,617
because of how Song-hwa and Yeon-u
ended up together?

102
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,411
Are you worried he might return like that?

103
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,122
I won't end up like them.

104
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,125
They were...

105
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,004
Fine. It happened in their past lives,

106
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,672
so let's say it's possible for them.

107
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,258
But for me, it happened in this lifetime.

108
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,439
Seeing Yeon-u with that woman

109
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,942
made me think
some crazy thoughts for a moment.

110
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,009
-Dad.
-Hyeong-min! Yes, I'm here.

111
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,262
He fell asleep at a bus stop.

112
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,848
We brought him to the hospital
because he had a fever.

113
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,684
He took some medicine,
so the fever has gone down.

114
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,728
Thank you so much.

115
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,066
Where have you been?

116
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,109
I took the bus and went to the hotel.

117
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,530
He must've had a dream when he was asleep.

118
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,325
I went there to see Mom,
but they said she was not there.

119
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,706
When you're a little older,

120
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,710
I'll tell you where your mom is
and why she had to leave.

121
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,671
I'll tell you everything, okay?

122
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,214
Okay.

123
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,341
I'm sorry.

124
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,515
If he finds out later,
will it make him less sad?

125
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,309
That he will never see her again.

126
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,899
Does Yu-na know

127
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:23,028
that you're planning to leave
with your younger sister after she dies?

128
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:29,952
Yu-na.

129
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,956
-There's--
-Hey, Ms. Jang will yell at you

130
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,417
if you go back now,
so let's hang out a little.

131
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,918
-Well--
-I learned

132
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,629
that you get scolded less
if you wait it out a little.

133
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,299
Wait here. I need to use the ladies' room.

134
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,266
I should tell her today.

135
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,361
Ma'am, listen to this for a moment.

136
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,456
Do you like this piano melody?

137
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,374
Well...

138
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,751
Yes.

139
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,462
My friend's sister...

140
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,299
I mean, you look a lot
like my friend's grandmother.

141
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:29,219
May I take a photo of you
listening to music to show my friend?

142
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,430
Sure.

143
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,643
Thank you.

144
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,033
Well... Do you remember

145
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,702
your brother's name by any chance?

146
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,329
Yes, I do.

147
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:02,628
My brother's name is Ji Hyeon-jung.

148
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,380
You remember him?

149
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,674
Yes.

150
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,140
Hello, can I help you?

151
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,017
Hyeon-jung.

152
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,269
Yes, Hyeon-mi.

153
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,772
Were you listening to music?

154
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,566
Let's see.

155
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:28,404
Sir, are you the founder of this hospital,

156
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,073
Mr. Ji Hyeon-jung?

157
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,661
Yes. You must be Mr. Kim's daughter
who was hospitalized here.

158
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,454
Hold on.

159
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,289
You're

160
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,834
her brother?

161
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,628
Yes, I am. What's the matter?

162
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,089
But her brother, Ji Hyeon-jung,

163
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,133
died many years ago.

164
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,427
What?

165
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,683
Hyeon-jung?

166
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,394
-Where are you?
-Yes, I'm here.

167
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,563
Gosh.

168
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,410
There is someone who knows

169
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,872
that Ji Hyeon-jung is dead.

170
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,382
I told you not to bother Hyeon-mi.

171
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,634
Does that man have something
to do with your death?

172
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,054
Did he steal everything you had?

173
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,764
And he's living as you now?

174
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,725
-It's none of your business.
-That's why you couldn't leave.

175
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,395
You couldn't stand him living
a good life using your name.

176
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,649
-Just leave him be.
-How could I?

177
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,151
He stole your life.

178
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,028
Who cares? I'm already dead.

179
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,988
Look at yourself living a good life.

180
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,996
Right.

181
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,208
I stole someone's life too.

182
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,460
I was being too nosy.

183
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,836
Yu-na, that's not what I meant.

184
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,213
I'll mind my own business.

185
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,436
Hey, Sanchez.
Everything's going well, right?

186
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,687
-Yes.
-Give me that!

187
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,397
-Hey!
-What's up with all the noise?

188
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,024
Is someone else home?

189
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,485
Mi-ra had Detective Park
sleep in your room last night

190
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,403
because his leg was swollen.

191
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,447
I think he's fine now,
but Mi-ra kept saying

192
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,408
he must eat well as he's injured.
So we were eating.

193
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,952
But when we were having a meal,

194
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:43,288
Detective Park's colleagues
came over since it's their day off.

195
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,290
And then, they said I had a nice yard,

196
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,084
so they're having the watermelon
they brought.

197
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,129
Gosh, you guys look great together.

198
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,841
It's Mi-ra who invited them, right?

199
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,718
Chan-sung, it's very safe
since they're here.

200
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,222
And thanks to the incense Man-wol gave me,
it's spiritually safe too.

201
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,182
Since the detectives are here,

202
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,518
I don't need to worry
about being in danger.

203
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,021
Sanchez, put Mi-ra on the phone.
I'll talk to her.

204
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,356
Don't.

205
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,777
I'm sure she's bringing people over
in case I get depressed if I'm all alone.

206
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,405
It's nice and noisy here.

207
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,991
Chan-sung, all I could think about is
making sure

208
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,909
that they don't ruin the grass.

209
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,788
Chan-sung, you don't need
to worry about me.

210
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,749
-This is good.
-It is, right? I bought it.

211
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,293
-No, you didn't.
-I didn't?

212
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,836
I'll eat it myself.

213
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,088
Come on, you're injured.

214
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,423
My arm is fine.

215
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,468
Should I break your arm,
so you will let me feed you?

216
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,013
Here.

217
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,892
It's good, right?

218
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,980
-You can eat it yourself now.
-It's good.

219
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:51,690
Isn't it sweet?

220
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,736
I thought Mi-ra and Detective Park were
always fighting like enemies.

221
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,988
Now that I see them together,
they seem fine.

222
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,907
You don't need to worry.

223
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,658
I think she'll move out soon.

224
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,621
Chan-sung, I'll go eat
some watermelon now. Bye.

225
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,248
Sanchez.

226
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,626
Eat the melon the detectives bought.

227
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,003
-Come and join us.
-It's delicious.

228
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,087
Mi-ra.

229
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,299
That melon came from my fridge.

230
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,843
Is that so?

231
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,263
-Let's eat it.
-Things happen, you know.

232
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,098
-The melon did feel cool.
-Bring the cutting board.

233
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,600
What does it matter?

234
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:32,773
Come in.

235
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,367
Do you remember

236
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,703
that Ms. Jang invited a woman
to our hotel a while ago?

237
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,747
This is an amazing hotel.

238
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,000
And from what I've heard,
she's your friend.

239
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,377
That's right.

240
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:57,089
Did she cross paths with Ms. Jang
in her past lives?

241
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,052
I'm sure their connection was ill-fated.

242
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,680
We have never

243
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,600
tried to figure out Ms. Jang's story

244
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,853
because we always assumed
that she had no intention

245
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,523
of leaving after resolving her grudges.

246
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:19,444
But now, the tree that tied her down here
has changed.

247
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,322
And I think the changes have been brought

248
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,867
by you and the connections
you have brought.

249
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,619
Your assumption...

250
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,622
is correct.

251
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,750
Will Ms. Jang face

252
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,670
more connections from her past,
not just that lady?

253
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,589
He's already here.

254
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,466
And I'm sure

255
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,552
more will come shortly.

256
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:50,142
I'll probably end up bringing
the man to Ms. Jang like the others.

257
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:54,771
That must be why Mago brought you
to our hotel.

258
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,690
Then, you must have crossed paths

259
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,942
with Ms. Jang in your past life as well.

260
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,652
No, I have not.

261
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,112
Is that so?

262
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,031
That's odd.

263
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,533
If you have never met her
in your past life,

264
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,745
why did Mago choose you of all people?

265
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,462
I'm sure the deity must have
a reason for bringing you to her.

266
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,798
Anyway, it resulted in love.

267
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,676
I will continue

268
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,679
to stay with her.

269
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,019
My heart breaks for Ms. Jang.

270
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,729
Soon,

271
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,149
she will have to face someone

272
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,611
who pains her the most.

273
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,130
Man-wol.

274
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,800
Why are you leaving?

275
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,301
I don't want to see you.

276
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,764
Just admire the flowers you like so much
as much as you want,

277
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,390
and leave.

278
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,517
Then,

279
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,561
will you let him just pass by,

280
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,438
pretending to be clueless?

281
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,195
You have met him.

282
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,038
You can't run away from it.

283
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,249
He's already

284
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,501
by your side.

285
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,177
I finally get to give this to you.

286
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,431
It's yours.

287
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,659
But I saw that man.

288
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,828
The man named Cheong-myeong.

289
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,083
He was holding an ornament
with your moon-shaped symbol

290
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,586
in his hands.

291
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,341
Is it Chan-sung?

292
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,094
If it is him,

293
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,222
will you be able to accept it?

294
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,269
Is Chan-sung

295
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,605
that man?

296
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,611
The man you've been waiting
for over 1,000 years has finally shown up,

297
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,154
but you don't seem happy.

298
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:55,744
You were sure
that once he came to you in this world,

299
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,872
you'd kill him and vanish yourself.

300
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,542
Are you second-guessing yourself now?

301
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,340
So I asked...

302
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,219
if that man is Chan-sung.

303
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,348
You have fed the hatred of yours
for a long time.

304
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,560
Why don't you let go of your hatred
with your love that took ages

305
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,063
to reach you?

306
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,239
I have hated the man for over 1,000 years.

307
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,619
But you make me see him
as a man I fell in love with?

308
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,374
I'm curious to find out which man

309
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,834
you'll see him as.

310
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,547
Will you see him as Go Cheong-myeong
and vanish yourself?

311
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,343
Or will you see him as Koo Chan-sung
and be saved?

312
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,637
That is...

313
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,640
up to you.

314
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,781
Jang Man-wol.

315
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,623
Every sight you see with me
will look different.

316
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,293
The view is much better
now that I'm with you.

317
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,672
I'm proud of you,

318
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,382
Man-wol.

319
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,855
I told you

320
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,858
to trust me.

321
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,427
Chan-sung.

322
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,804
Ms. Jang.

323
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,478
Are you all right?

324
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,522
You look very pale.

325
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,702
A moment ago,

326
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,165
I killed Chan-sung in my thoughts.

327
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,338
He could be...

328
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,510
the reincarnation of the man
I hate the most.

329
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,428
I'm sure it isn't him.

330
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,890
Mr. Koo also said it wasn't him.

331
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,142
Right.

332
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,520
It might not be him.

333
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,273
But as long as there's the slightest
possibility that it could be him,

334
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,651
I will never be able

335
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,779
to see Chan-sung properly.

336
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,073
Now

337
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,408
what will you do?

338
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,008
I can never kill Chan-sung.

339
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,224
Mago says I have to empty out everything.

340
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,479
Now I have to think hard...

341
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,192
about how to do that.

342
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,142
I bought them at the shop you like.

343
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,020
You will feel better
if you eat something sweet.

344
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:39,981
Come and sit down.

345
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,822
What do you have in your hand?

346
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,792
It's the ornament I saw in my dreams.

347
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,256
I guess this came from your dream.

348
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,384
Mago gave it to me.

349
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,429
In my dreams,
it didn't have any blood on it.

350
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,556
I told you he died on my sword.

351
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,142
This blood

352
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,228
must be filled with the hatred of me.

353
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,606
Why did Mago give you
such an ominous thing?

354
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,067
Give it to me. I'll keep it for you.

355
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,865
I'll get rid of this myself.

356
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,576
The moon covered in blood

357
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,453
must be destroyed.

358
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,247
Mago always tells me

359
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,541
to empty the moon

360
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,794
that is filled with hatred.

361
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,129
Can you do that?

362
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,883
I have to.

363
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,388
I want to call in

364
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,641
the moon covered in blood.

365
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,066
Mr. Koo.

366
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,068
You were here.

367
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,948
The Grim Reaper is looking for you.

368
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,826
Go on.

369
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,382
I have found the vengeful ghost
that cursed you.

370
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,175
You've found Seol Ji-won.

371
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,429
Has he become more powerful as he wanted?

372
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,473
Do you think a vengeful ghost
that holds unjustifiable resentment

373
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,851
can become powerful as he wishes?

374
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:44,439
He is only hiding in the dark
like a gutter rat.

375
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,648
It's good to know

376
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:49,027
that he hasn't become
as stronger as his evil mind.

377
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,405
He's just hiding in the dark
like a coward.

378
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,576
Can you help me?

379
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,912
I heard you were good at acting as bait.

380
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,874
I won't reveal who recommended you.

381
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,417
I'm sure it's Mr. Kim.

382
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,132
I'll take it that one of my colleagues
thinks highly of my skills.

383
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:15,011
Many human managers worked here.

384
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,138
Among them, you are...

385
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,351
This is my assessment.

386
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,230
Thank you.

387
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:32,945
Were you there when the Guest House
of the Moon first opened?

388
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,781
Yes.

389
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,366
I guided a number of souls

390
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,911
from this place to the other world.

391
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,831
Take good care of your guests.

392
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,083
Especially,

393
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,085
your first guest.

394
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,422
Who was the first guest of this place?

395
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,636
Mago said that the first guest was
the most important.

396
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,180
I have not yet guided...

397
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,975
the first guest of this place.

398
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,395
Nobody in this place

399
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,525
has seen the faint light of his existence.

400
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,194
How is that possible?

401
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,363
I do not give answers.

402
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,740
I only guide them to the end.

403
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:19,826
For now,

404
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,955
let's go catch that vengeful ghost.

405
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,281
Since it has the moon-shaped symbol,

406
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,993
he must have made it for you.

407
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:08,040
And you would've been so happy
if you received it.

408
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,380
That's the most
disgusting thing about you.

409
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,564
If he would come,

410
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,610
I was going to throw him
into the hell that you made

411
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,196
and make both of you vanish.

412
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,494
But because of the scheming
of the deities,

413
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,039
I can't do that anymore.

414
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,417
I...

415
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,922
ended up falling in love again.
How ridiculous.

416
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,678
Leaning on that love,

417
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,643
I tried to ignore you.

418
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,021
But you just had to

419
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,024
drag me down again.

420
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,202
I will

421
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,704
put you in here

422
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:33,000
and dump it in a trash bin around here.

423
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,295
You will go berserk.

424
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,468
And we will vanish together.

425
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,271
Seol Ji-won.

426
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,772
Come out.

427
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,610
I know you're hiding in here.

428
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:45,239
The Grim Reaper is on his way to take you.

429
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,752
There you are.

430
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,175
So you went from being a smug jerk
to a loser.

431
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,890
I have something for you.

432
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,981
Eat this.

433
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,485
Eat it...

434
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,322
and become an evil ghost.

435
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,556
So he ended up hiding in a place
he was familiar with.

436
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,810
He's in the darkness, but he will reveal
himself once he sees you.

437
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,036
Jang Man-wol, you're here too?

438
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,081
Yes, I came earlier.

439
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,000
Did you catch him?

440
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,712
I let him go.

441
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,176
You'll be in danger soon

442
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,387
because I gave him

443
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,932
a very special gift.

444
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,480
And you'll have to take him
more seriously than before.

445
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,110
He might go crazy
with his new-found powers.

446
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,196
What are you doing?

447
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,782
Chan-sung.

448
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,662
Mago said that you're him.

449
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,884
I need to kill you,

450
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,636
but I won't be able to.

451
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,516
I just like you too much.

452
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,275
I won't protect you though.

453
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,404
I've waited
for over 1,000 years to kill you.

454
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,490
So if I protect you now,

455
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,534
I'll be making a mockery of my grudges.

456
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,877
If he becomes an evil ghost,

457
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,755
you'll vanish
because you helped him become stronger.

458
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,886
Whatever.

459
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,185
You're a human adored by Mago,

460
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,979
so they'll interfere
before the evil ghost gets to you.

461
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,232
And...

462
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,693
you'll vanish.

463
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,744
So I ended up using you.

464
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,291
It's pathetic I called it love.

465
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,772
Jang Man-wol!

466
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:03,956
What's with the hotel?

467
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,040
I don't know.

468
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,918
All the lights in the building
have gone out.

469
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,767
Mr. Koo, what happened to Ms. Jang?

470
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,561
I think there was a misunderstanding.

471
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,313
Do you know where she is?

472
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,607
She went into the garden
where the Moon Tree stands

473
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,150
and barricaded the door.

474
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,736
No one can enter.

475
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,683
We should check on our guests first.

476
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,061
I don't understand
why we're in trouble now.

477
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,409
Ms. Jang,

478
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,329
what on earth are you up to?

479
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,001
Is it true?

480
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,088
Am I truly that man from her past

481
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,882
who Ms. Jang loathes?

482
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,511
I doubt that's what she said

483
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:41,970
since he is

484
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,390
right here.

485
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,412
You've met him before, you know.

486
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:25,806
How...

487
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,475
is this him?

488
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,894
He is

489
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,523
the first guest who stayed

490
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,109
at Man-wol's Guest House of the Moon.

491
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,328
I should take him to her.

492
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,329
Actually,

493
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,584
shouldn't you stop her
from vanishing first?

494
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:58,881
Find the thing Man-wol handed over
to the evil ghost.

495
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,341
Once the evil ghost makes his move,

496
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,052
it will be irreversible.

497
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,437
Since we got the overtime pay,

498
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,813
let's grab a drink.

499
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,607
-Sure.
-Let's go.

500
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,492
I hear he cursed his wife,
wishing her dead.

501
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,161
What a piece of garbage.

502
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,746
Does he have no shame?

503
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,512
Who are you?

504
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,681
You should get out of here. Hurry.

505
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,354
Hi, my friend.

506
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,696
I was going to visit you
after I had some fun.

507
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,114
But I guess you were in a hurry.

508
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,490
How did you find me?

509
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:51,994
I found you thanks to the owner
of the thing you recently picked up.

510
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:55,664
This?

511
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,208
I came to take that back. Give it to me.

512
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,168
How are you going to do that?

513
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,255
You'll die before you can take it from me.

514
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,602
So this is

515
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,479
how you've come to face me.

516
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,347
I guess you're not going to give up.

517
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,973
Let's see how long you'll last.

518
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,060
I was just buying time.

519
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:00,270
The time has come.

520
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,648
The moon's showing itself.

521
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:12,449
Why do you think she gave that to you?

522
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,451
I told you that she will protect me.

523
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:18,872
You see that moon-shaped symbol?

524
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:22,918
Once the moon fully reveals itself,

525
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,003
you'll be doomed for having that with you.

526
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,380
Don't try to fool me.

527
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,382
I told you
that death isn't the end, didn't I?

528
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:31,718
I tried to stop you,
but you just chose to die.

529
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,350
Now, what awaits you is horrendous hell.

530
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,727
Goodbye, Seol Ji-won.

531
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,832
How dare you lie to me?

532
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,667
Just die.

533
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,592
I never lied to you.

534
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,055
You're really doomed.

535
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:56,845
I was also once
a vengeful ghost full of spite.

536
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:59,639
We've been dead for 770 years in total.

537
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,184
But you're nothing but a runt
that just died.

538
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,186
How dare you act up this way?

539
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:11,485
Take what you found,
and go back to the hotel.

540
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,112
Okay.

541
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,803
I caught him.

542
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:41,139
We did all the work.
You're just taking credit for it.

543
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:55,445
You gave yourself to the vengeful ghost
and tried to turn him into an evil one.

544
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,657
I cannot forgive you for that.

545
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:03,078
I took out the most horrid hell
that I had deep down inside me

546
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,957
and gave it to the evil spirit.

547
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,668
Then what does that make you now?

548
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,713
Are you just a heartbroken moon

549
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:17,759
that blooms and withers flowers

550
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,554
as time repeats itself?

551
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,395
Just make me vanish.

552
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,454
No!

553
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,252
I brought it back.

554
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,005
There's no reason she must vanish now.

555
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,047
Please leave.

556
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,134
Just make me vanish!

557
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:07,767
Fine.

558
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,228
Go ahead and have what you want.

559
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,066
If you must torment yourself like that,

560
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,028
I'll become the guy you hate so much.

561
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,242
Kill me.

562
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,719
I promised I'd stay by your side
even if I have to die

563
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,556
for getting in your way.

564
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:44,864
The man you've been waiting for...

565
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,244
is actually here.

566
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,167
You came all the way here.

567
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:58,670
So you should listen to
what happened to the moon...

568
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,298
covered in blood.

569
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,178
That way, you'll be able
to empty your grudges.

570
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:20,400
Is this the afterlife?

571
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:25,488
The afterlife that you'll encounter
won't be so magnificent.

572
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:29,242
But there are some people
who wish to see you before you leave.

573
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,077
Me?

574
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:33,788
Our hotel guests are waiting for you.

575
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,710
This is a special service for them.

576
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,589
This number is such a cliché.

577
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:46,051
What is this? Is it the hell?

578
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,303
You'll find out once you go inside.

579
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,303
Do you remember what you said to all of us

580
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:32,347
right before you killed us?

581
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,228
Seol Ji-won.

582
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,957
We should soundproof the hotel rooms.

583
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:21,229
YOU'RE INVITED TO HOTEL DEL LUNA

584
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:45,753
JANG MAN-WOL

585
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:54,637
YOU'RE INVITED TO HOTEL DEL LUNA
PRESIDENT JANG MAN-WOL

586
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,477
"Hotel del Luna"?

587
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,896
Mr. Koo Chan-sung works here?

588
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:06,191
Yes, the owner of the hotel invited you.

589
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:10,403
She invited the doctor too.
You two should come together.

590
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,704
DEAR MR. PARK YEONG-SU

591
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,456
Jang Man-wol?

592
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,291
DEAR MS. LEE MI-RA

593
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,459
What's that?

594
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,419
An invitation to a hotel.

595
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,713
I've already been there once
as my friend works there.

596
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:29,797
It's such a nice hotel.

597
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,007
Where is it?

598
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,634
Not everyone can go.

599
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:36,971
You can't go there without an invitation.
It's a special hotel.

600
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:38,848
Very special.

601
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,652
Welcome.

602
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,073
I'll take you to our Sky Lounge,
the pride of our hotel.

603
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,369
Wow.

604
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,539
You came to this fancy place
all by yourself?

605
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:06,292
Welcome.
We have a table ready for you inside.

606
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,460
This way, please.

607
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:12,674
Here, everyone gets drunk
and has a dream about their past lives.

608
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,676
And I'm the bartender here.

609
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,387
Today, the deities made an exception
for the two of you

610
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:21,057
and gave me permission
to let you have a taste

611
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,725
of one of your past lives.

612
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:23,977
The deities?

613
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,105
He means he'll impress us
with super delicious drinks.

614
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,857
I blacked out last time,
so I don't remember much.

615
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,985
This time, I should drink slowly.

616
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,319
Give us our drinks.

617
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,293
This is a petal.

618
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,837
It's a petal from the Moon Tree.

619
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,213
The Moon Tree?

620
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:54,757
There is such a tree?

621
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,718
I'm sure there is.

622
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,429
This is so pretty.

623
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:05,518
They're here in this hotel now.

624
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,147
You'll be able to find out...

625
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,692
more about him through them.

626
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,112
Cheong-myeong.

627
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,211
My father is looking for you.

628
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,838
Why is he looking for me?

629
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:20,426
We received a tip that you are in league
with the rebels from Dongmo Mountain.

630
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:27,684
You will die if you go see my father now.

631
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,936
So I sent some soldiers

632
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:34,232
to capture everyone in that woman's gang.

633
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,859
What do you mean?

634
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,237
Those bandits are
the remnants of Goguryeo.

635
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,531
If you capture all of them
and take them to my father,

636
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:43,116
he will no longer suspect you.

637
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:47,954
They're just wandering thieves
that steal from peddlers.

638
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,872
If you are executed as a traitor,

639
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,833
all your subordinates

640
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:55,211
as well as everyone
who is related to you will die.

641
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:58,381
Even if there are hundreds of people,

642
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:01,259
my father will kill them all
as he is afraid of a coup.

643
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:06,472
Go and capture them all.

644
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,539
Why are you taking the innocent villagers?

645
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,541
You should just capture us thieves.

646
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,668
I'm not here to catch you thieves.

647
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:19,754
I came to quell the rebels.

648
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,255
What?

649
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:24,133
I'll try to save them even if that means
they must become slaves.

650
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,760
But for me to do that,

651
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:28,304
all of you thieves must be killed
as rebels.

652
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,014
Why...

653
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,266
Why are you doing this?

654
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:38,105
I wanted to find a way
to join hands with you.

655
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:43,152
I wished to go to the new country
in Dongmo Mountain

656
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:45,947
with you.

657
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,952
But I got busted.

658
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:53,162
And now, I must take your lives

659
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,414
to cover it up.

660
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,167
After I bury all of it,

661
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:01,963
I will pay for what I did
with my own life.

662
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,257
No, don't.

663
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,138
Just save Man-wol.

664
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:13,266
And to do that,

665
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,352
you must live as a traitor
instead of telling her all the excuses

666
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,980
that you told me.

667
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,694
Then Man-wol will live.

668
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:40,126
He made a promise to Yeon-u.

669
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:54,974
He's always been here.

670
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:08,029
He was the first guest
of the Guest House of the Moon.

671
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:16,287
You're not the only one
who's been paying for the past sins here

672
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,081
all these years.

673
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,211
Thanks to you,
I made a great contribution.

674
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,595
I will kill you.

675
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,807
I will kill you...

676
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:20,768
at all costs.

677
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:25,314
If you wish to kill me,

678
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,735
you will have to stay alive.

679
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,512
You must live as a traitor.

680
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,307
Then Man-wol will live.

681
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,837
I've been waiting for you.

682
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:16,926
I hope there won't be any hesitation
when you swing your sword at me.

683
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:19,720
If so,

684
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,598
I won't hesitate

685
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,935
to throw myself at the sword.

686
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,053
You have never

687
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:06,183
uttered his name. Not even once.

688
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,859
If you call his name,

689
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,736
he will show himself.

690
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,494
Have you been here the whole time?

691
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:33,752
If so, show yourself to me.

692
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:38,632
Go Cheong-myeong.

693
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,330
Tell me if there's anything else
you wish to tell me.

694
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:54,708
I'll listen to it.

695
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,505
There's no more excuse to tell you.

696
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,050
Man-wol.

697
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:08,514
You told me in your last moment

698
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,017
that you would watch me from afar.

699
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:21,151
While I was tied down to the Moon Tree
and filled with grudges,

700
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:24,154
my words tied you down here...

701
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:29,159
and stopped you from leaving.

702
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:40,838
I...

703
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,010
have emptied everything now.

704
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:53,017
So you should stop now.

705
01:11:56,937 --> 01:11:58,397
This is really...

706
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,944
the end for us.

707
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:10,576
Yes.

708
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:14,955
It's the end.

709
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:49,216
His soul doesn't have the energy
to go to the afterlife.

710
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,761
If we leave him here, he will vanish.

711
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:56,765
He won't be able to have another life.

712
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,105
To avoid that,

713
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,358
you should

714
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:08,694
send him off.

715
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:14,533
That is the last punishment

716
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,286
you will get here.

717
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:12,818
Yeong-su.

718
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,573
Are you up?

719
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:22,077
You two got really drunk,
so Mr. Koo told me to escort you home.

720
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,537
So I called a cab.

721
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:27,040
Well, you two can go home
on your own, right?

722
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,876
-Yes.
-Goodbye then.

723
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:37,926
Gosh, this again?

724
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:43,432
When I came to the hotel last time,
she was the one who sent me home in a cab.

725
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:47,477
But this time,
I remember up to drinking the cocktail.

726
01:16:54,901 --> 01:16:56,486
Yeong-su, why are you crying?

727
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,531
I don't know. I just feel sad.

728
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:05,662
Seeing you cry like this is
making me sad too.

729
01:17:08,665 --> 01:17:10,250
This is so weird.

730
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:12,502
I'm right here. Why are you crying?

731
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:14,463
Don't cry.

732
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,393
Is he really not going to make up with me?

733
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,034
We met for the first time

734
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:46,370
on May 2nd.

735
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:14,189
I found it.

736
01:18:21,071 --> 01:18:24,199
This watch looks pretty old.

737
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:26,410
It's over 70 years old.

738
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,954
Time on that watch

739
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:31,873
has been flowing since you were alive.

740
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,625
It must be really rare.

741
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:36,044
It must've been hard to find it.

742
01:18:37,337 --> 01:18:38,338
Thank you.

743
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,633
And I'm sorry.

744
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:48,807
I wanted to remind you
that you're 70 years older than me.

745
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,143
It wasn't easy to get that watch.

746
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:54,271
So from now on,

747
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:58,400
even if I get to look older than you
like your sister,

748
01:18:58,483 --> 01:19:01,987
don't forget
that you are way older than I am.

749
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:08,535
Put it on your wrist.
I'm sure it'll look great on you.

750
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:11,705
Yu-na.

751
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:15,417
I will leave soon.

752
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:19,963
I told you that I was waiting
for my sister, Hyeon-mi.

753
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:25,594
Right now, Hyeon-mi is very sick.

754
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,139
When she leaves,

755
01:19:30,223 --> 01:19:31,850
I must go with her.

756
01:19:34,978 --> 01:19:36,104
Yu-na,

757
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:40,525
when this watch was made,

758
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:43,820
I had already been dead.

759
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:47,532
Time can't run

760
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:51,119
for the dead and for the living together.

761
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,211
I died too early.

762
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,133
It's so upsetting.

763
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:28,532
I'll see him off.

764
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:32,327
You'll be back soon, right?

765
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,121
Of course.

766
01:20:35,872 --> 01:20:37,123
I'll be back soon.

767
01:20:58,186 --> 01:20:59,521
You are coming back, right?

768
01:21:07,445 --> 01:21:08,864
Wait for me.

769
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:49,779
THE SAMDO RIVER.
THIS WORLD, THE AFTERLIFE.

770
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:11,092
A MONTH LATER

771
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:27,275
Ma'am, let me help you.

772
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:32,322
Once you go out to the beach,

773
01:22:32,405 --> 01:22:34,908
you can rent any kinds of beach supplies.

774
01:22:34,991 --> 01:22:36,076
Let's go.

775
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:38,078
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

776
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:47,253
It looks like you've made progress.

777
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:49,965
Could you read it for me?

778
01:22:55,428 --> 01:22:59,808
It's been a month since Ms. Jang left.

779
01:22:59,891 --> 01:23:01,393
Ms. Jang isn't here.

780
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:04,562
But how come
the hotel hasn't vanished yet?

781
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:08,900
It means that Ms. Jang is no longer
the owner of the Guest House of the Moon.

782
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:11,736
That's my guess.

783
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:17,283
Mr. Koo.

784
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:21,746
I think you should go see the garden.

785
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:30,422
Yesterday,

786
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:33,758
I saw a few leaves and flowers.

787
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:35,927
But the tree is completely lifeless now.

788
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,432
I guess

789
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:44,269
that means Ms. Jang can't come back
for good now.

790
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:24,726
Wait for me.

791
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:41,701
Jang Man-wol.

792
01:24:43,995 --> 01:24:45,163
Please hurry.

793
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:47,874
I'm getting...

794
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:51,711
anxious now.

795
01:24:59,552 --> 01:25:03,223
All of us are against having a new owner.

796
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:06,017
Help Ms. Jang return.

797
01:25:09,562 --> 01:25:10,855
I'm with them.

798
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,818
It took me 500 years
to get used to Ms. Jang.

799
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:17,278
Having another boss? I'm against it.

800
01:25:19,864 --> 01:25:22,992
It is up to her
whether she returns to this place or not.

801
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:26,371
There's no way she won't come back
when Mr. Koo is waiting for her.

802
01:25:28,164 --> 01:25:30,083
If she set foot on the bridge,

803
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:32,710
she might have forgotten him.

804
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:21,027
She might have let go
of all her memories of this world

805
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,280
and crossed the bridge,

806
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:27,784
following her most distant memories.

807
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:39,337
Is that why all the flowers fell?

808
01:27:39,837 --> 01:27:42,590
Then I guess the tree is really dead now.

809
01:27:43,174 --> 01:27:44,217
Right.

810
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:47,679
All the flowers fall down and disappeared.

811
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:49,973
I suppose Man-wol is

812
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:53,101
really dead now.

813
01:27:59,899 --> 01:28:02,944
Should we be expecting a new owner
of the Guest House of the Moon?

814
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:09,867
The Moon Tree is the owner
of the guest house.

815
01:28:10,076 --> 01:28:14,414
But all the flowers and leaves are gone.
It's dead now.

816
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:38,396
THE GUYS WHO DIED AFTER EATING

817
01:28:46,237 --> 01:28:48,197
This is so hot.

818
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:51,034
How did Kim Jun-hyun
eat five of these at once?

819
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,036
He amazed me.

820
01:28:54,078 --> 01:28:56,998
That's where Kim Jun-hyun sat.

821
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:58,708
Eat before it gets cold.

822
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:00,043
KIM JUN-HYUN SAT HERE

823
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:04,047
"To Ms. Jang man-wol, I love you"?

824
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:06,799
-Doesn't it make you happy?
-Are you confessing your love to me?

825
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:09,260
This is Kim Jun-hyun's autograph.
Here, "Kim Jun-hyun."

826
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:12,555
It's too heartbreaking
if I remain only as a flower petal

827
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:15,475
that's bound to vanish.

828
01:29:19,687 --> 01:29:22,440
I'LL VISIT EVERY FAMOUS RESTAURANT
IN THIS COUNTRY

829
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:23,292
Not all of the flowers vanished.

830
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:30,466
There are still some flowers left.

831
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:41,310
I put the flowers dreaming of the moon

832
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:44,230
in his heart.

833
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:17,406
