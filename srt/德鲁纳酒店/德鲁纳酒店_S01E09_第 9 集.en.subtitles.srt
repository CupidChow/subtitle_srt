1
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,893
It's not that wonderful
to be in hell together.

2
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,023
What I have is hell.

3
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,110
Goodbye.

4
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,279
Chan-sung.

5
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,535
She's gone.

6
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,403
Hey.

7
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,989
Can you see that?

8
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,827
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

9
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,578
Let's go.

10
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,457
I didn't know a place like this
existed in Myeong-dong.

11
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,501
-Me neither.
-Let's go.

12
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,783
Mr. Koo must feel very flustered.

13
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,869
He worked with us for quite some time.

14
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,413
Shouldn't you at least leave him a text?

15
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,665
I gave him something else instead.

16
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,210
I gave him a severance pay
and a dismissal notice.

17
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,758
I guess you just think of him

18
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:00,054
as the 99th human who worked for you.

19
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,267
No, Chan-sung is special.

20
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,437
I don't want to become weak-hearted.

21
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,566
I'm trying to be stronger.

22
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,403
I haven't heard
such sentimental words from you in...

23
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:20,033
No, this is the first time in 500 years.

24
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,910
Five hundred years?

25
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,580
Has it been that long since you died?

26
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,582
What are you still doing here
for 500 years?

27
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:31,669
I shouldn't be hearing that from a ghost
who's been here twice as long.

28
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,672
I can't leave
because I'm tied to the Moon Tree.

29
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,801
I can't leave because I still have
shame to clear up in this world.

30
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:42,347
I can't face my ancestors
in the afterlife like this.

31
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,808
Even if you go to the afterlife,
you won't meet your ancestors.

32
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,269
They must have reincarnated
several times already.

33
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,271
You're worrying for nothing.

34
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:54,484
I can just remain at the hotel
and continue to worry for nothing.

35
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,361
But will you be all right like this?

36
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,489
Will you be all right
giving up your chance

37
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,991
to go to the afterlife peacefully
through Mr. Koo?

38
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,913
They won't let me go peacefully.

39
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,334
In the future, try to speed up

40
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,544
and take care of your shame
left in this life.

41
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,296
There won't be much time.

42
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,509
If you can't solve it, take the bus
to the afterlife without regrets.

43
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,096
What about the guests?
Did you send them off properly?

44
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,348
We moved them with the help
of the Grim Reapers.

45
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,184
Although there was some confusion
due to the sudden move.

46
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:34,065
Those of you who have no regrets
and can leave right now.

47
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,984
Please take this bus.

48
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,653
Those of you who can't leave
because of your resentments.

49
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,446
Please standby here.

50
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,614
TO THIS LIFE, TO THE AFTERLIFE

51
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,199
You must not get confused.

52
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,244
Once you get on the bus,
you can't turn back.

53
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,663
Are you going to the afterlife?

54
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,291
My older child went to college
and is doing well now.

55
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,875
It's time to leave.

56
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,923
You went to wake up your son
in his dreams every morning.

57
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,425
I'm glad he finally went to college.

58
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,718
Have a good trip.

59
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,434
TO THIS LIFE, TO THE AFTERLIFE

60
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,689
You must choose a line.

61
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:18,651
I can't decide whether to go
to the afterlife or stay here.

62
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,195
Did you finish the novel
you were working on?

63
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:26,909
No. I couldn't finish it when I was alive.
I guess I can't finish it when I'm dead.

64
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,828
I had better go.

65
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,419
Should I stay and write it?

66
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,468
This guest can't make up his mind.

67
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,094
He won't be able to leave.

68
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,139
Finishing the novel is not the problem.

69
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,808
He can only leave when he gives up
what he can't do.

70
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,478
This bus goes to the afterlife.

71
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,730
You must be careful to choose
the right line.

72
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,356
You can't go back.

73
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,735
A few of the employees
went on the bus to the afterlife.

74
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,570
We will be shorthanded for a while.

75
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:06,616
Encourage the employees
to go to the afterlife.

76
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,368
Why are you acting
like you're closing down the hotel?

77
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,663
We've moved to a new place,
so we need to find a human manager.

78
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:13,915
No need.

79
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,334
We have Yu-na.

80
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,378
Did they move all my things?

81
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,589
Ms. Fourth Choice called a moving company

82
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,050
and took care of all your things.

83
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,762
Hey. You have to drive.

84
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,599
I've ridden a horse,
but I have yet to drive a car.

85
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,436
You haven't even learned to drive
a car for 500 years?

86
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,981
You're the weird ghost
who drives around a car.

87
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,734
Unbelievable.

88
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,280
Darn.

89
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:58,793
Why are you laughing?

90
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,878
I find it funny
that a ghost wears a seat belt.

91
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,716
I like that this is an open car.

92
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,803
This is my first time
after riding in your Pony 2.

93
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,972
It seems you like this pretentious thing.

94
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,099
Get in, and let's take this for a spin.

95
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,393
Giddy-up!

96
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,937
"Giddy-up"? What a fool.

97
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,446
The new place is in country side?

98
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,616
This is nice. It's like going on a picnic.

99
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,160
What?

100
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,454
I'm talking on the phone.

101
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,497
Just follow the navigation.

102
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,748
Okay.

103
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,794
I'd better get the driver license
to get to work.

104
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,171
Just concentrate on your school.

105
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,006
Summer break has started, stupid.

106
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,341
And I will graduate soon.

107
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:51,012
Her parents said they'll get me
a car if I go to college.

108
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,723
I have an apartment under my name too.

109
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,767
I'll get my own place
as soon as I graduate.

110
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:04,192
It's difficult to live
with her parents, right?

111
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,780
I'm just paying a very high price.

112
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,205
This is strong. Do you want a sip?

113
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,207
What?

114
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,833
Would you?

115
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,543
I'm fine.

116
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,187
What's wrong?

117
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,153
There's a woman in the car in front of us.

118
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,537
Don't look. She can be dangerous for you.

119
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,747
Help me...

120
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:06,128
Help me. Please...

121
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,799
There are many ghosts in this world.

122
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,300
Don't be too concerned about them.

123
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,887
I'm meant to be the manager
of Hotel del Luna.

124
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,723
Let's take that ghost as our guest.

125
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,641
What?

126
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,767
Sir.

127
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,228
A grey car just passed by us.

128
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,437
Can you go after it?

129
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,523
-What?
-I'll pay you extra money.

130
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,483
-Can you go faster?
-Okay.

131
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,318
You'll get in trouble.

132
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,945
You're not even a hotel manager.

133
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,697
Faster, please.

134
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,910
PHARMACY

135
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,425
Are you looking for Hotel del Luna?

136
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,803
Did you know that the hotel moved?

137
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,681
You must know where it moved.

138
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,934
If I tell you, will you go find it again?

139
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,813
You nearly died because of Man-wol.

140
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,736
I heard you embraced that potent curse.

141
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,866
If you haven't lifted that curse,
your soul is probably seriously hurt now.

142
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,748
Chan-sung, let her go.

143
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,668
Jang Man-wol protected me.

144
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,086
I'm fine.

145
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,672
Man-wol is fine thanks to you.

146
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,466
You are the one who protected her.

147
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,470
My sister chose the right person.

148
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,222
So keep up the good work.

149
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,560
Was I sent to that hotel for that purpose?

150
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,564
When the terrible fate comes to her
from the past,

151
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,400
am I supposed to block her from it?

152
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,737
You successfully carried out your mission.
Why are you angry?

153
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,865
Do you feel pity for Man-wol
you saw in your dreams?

154
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,576
Yes, I do.

155
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:05,331
I feel angry that you praise me
for not taking her side.

156
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,292
She abandoned me because I got in her way.

157
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,461
Are you telling me

158
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,838
to keep on getting in her way?

159
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,383
It's cool to take someone's side

160
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,927
while getting in the way is not.

161
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:24,225
Everyone wants
the role of embracing and consoling her.

162
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,854
The shabby role of getting in the way,
holding on, and begging

163
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,024
can only be done by a good person.

164
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,402
Don't overestimate me.

165
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,071
I don't want to take the role
that nobody wants.

166
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,489
I'm not such a good person.

167
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,867
Really? Then you can quit.

168
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,247
Just eat this.

169
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,089
What is this?

170
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,467
That medicine will take away
your ability to see ghosts.

171
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:05,224
You won't be able to see ghosts
and Hotel del Luna anymore.

172
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,272
I won't be able to see all of them?

173
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,024
She abandoned you too.

174
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,528
I have to give you the chance
to discard her too.

175
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,992
Sometimes, we can be very fair.

176
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,788
I came here for a way to find her.

177
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,209
But you give the way to never go back.

178
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,045
The results are not given by the deities.

179
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,964
It's made by humans.

180
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,259
It's always the same.

181
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,972
Thank you for giving me this chance.

182
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,934
Wait. Are you taking it now?

183
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,644
Without thinking about it?

184
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,480
Did you think I wouldn't take it?

185
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,231
Because I was a good person?

186
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,526
I told you.

187
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,946
I'm not good enough to volunteer
to take shabby roles.

188
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,658
I still hesitate...

189
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,580
only because she is in my heart.

190
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,923
Hugging and comforting her
is nowhere enough for her.

191
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,467
She's an awful woman.

192
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,929
She abandoned me because I got in her way.

193
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,599
Even if I went back,
she wouldn't welcome me.

194
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,771
And you never know
when she'll do something dangerous again.

195
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,114
I'll need to figure out
if I want to run back to her

196
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,784
despite all that.

197
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,638
If it's old,
it should at least look antique.

198
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,015
If it's tiny, it should at least be cute.

199
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:15,646
No matter how much I look at this,
it looks absolutely hideous.

200
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:19,859
This was the only piece of land
we could buy with little money.

201
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,195
But there is a cemetery
over the hills over there.

202
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,573
The land is dark and damp, so it's great.

203
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:29,118
And this place has great water,
so it's famous for makgeolli too.

204
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,787
Back when you were poor and starving
as you ran Man-wol Hostel,

205
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,540
you always had makgeolli
with radish kimchi, remember?

206
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,000
That rice wine was made here.

207
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,377
Stop talking about that time.

208
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,671
The building looks awfully ugly enough.

209
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,631
I feel like I'm as poor
as I was back then.

210
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,720
Anyway, the air is really fresh.
There's no fine dust here.

211
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,390
Fine dust? If it was around,
could you breathe it in?

212
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,935
I can't believe a ghost is
talking about fresh water and air.

213
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,900
Fine, I can just ignore the outside.

214
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,069
It's all the same once I'm inside.

215
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,659
Hurry up!

216
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,480
The lobby looks a bit smaller,
don't you think?

217
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,900
It's just your imagination.
It looks the same.

218
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:46,320
The guests complained a lot
when we sent them off in a hurry.

219
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,572
We couldn't bloom
enough flowers in the garden,

220
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,407
so of course, we became poorer.

221
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,703
It'll be the middle of the month,
so we'll have more guests.

222
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,330
We have a great location.

223
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,708
I'm thirsty.

224
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,294
I'll be in the garden
looking at the Moon Tree. Bring champagne.

225
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,923
Your stuff isn't here yet,
so we have no champagne.

226
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,758
What?

227
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,594
Why aren't they here yet?

228
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,347
Are they slacking off somewhere else?

229
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,767
Why don't we grab some makgeolli
for a change?

230
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,519
Just like the old times.

231
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,566
I just said I didn't want
to talk about that time.

232
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,570
You forgot what I just said.

233
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,199
Mr. Kim.

234
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,202
You couldn't resolve your grudges
for 500 years

235
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,122
maybe because you forgot what they are,

236
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,249
like a goldfish.

237
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,709
"A goldfish"?

238
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,171
I'm a scholar who passed
the National State Exam.

239
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,550
I could be an elegant crane,
not a goldfish.

240
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,634
A crane?

241
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,513
Both a crane and a goldfish are stupid.

242
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,482
What? "Stupid"?

243
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,819
I can't believe that mean and crude woman.

244
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,029
Calm down.

245
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,866
The outside of this hotel looks ugly,
so she's a bit ticked off.

246
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,035
Man-wol only looks okay on the outside.

247
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,828
She's definitely evil on the inside.

248
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,580
She fired Mr. Koo,

249
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,708
and she even called in a human
to do something suspicious.

250
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,420
Don't you think she sacked Mr. Koo
because of what happened that day?

251
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,424
She said she cut him off because she was
afraid she'd become weaker.

252
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,219
I'm afraid she might do
something dangerous again.

253
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,096
There is no human to stop her anymore.

254
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,932
So Mr. Koo can't see ghosts anymore?

255
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,768
Ms. Jang said so.

256
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,438
I guess she threw
a huge crude fit at Mago.

257
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,443
A goldfish?

258
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,457
Hey, I thought they would
all fall off after the move,

259
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,292
but they're still there.

260
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,547
Did you make sure that Koo Chan-sung
can't see ghosts anymore?

261
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,840
I gave him the medicine.

262
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,802
If he takes it,
he won't see ghosts any longer.

263
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,346
Okay.

264
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,516
Good.

265
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:25,395
You asked politely for the first time,
so I let you have your way.

266
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,065
But it's up to him to decide

267
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,400
to take the medicine or not.

268
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,237
What would he do?

269
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:35,989
Are you having fun?

270
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,909
I might as well ask for another favor.

271
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,911
Can you turn back these blue things?

272
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,247
I can't do anything about those.

273
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,625
That's how you feel.

274
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:51,046
It's up to you to bloom these flowers.

275
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,178
The buds look so pretty.

276
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,808
I will feel so bad for them
if they can't bloom the flowers.

277
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,603
Don't get your hopes up.
You won't see any flowers.

278
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,523
Don't even dream
about seeing any flower here.

279
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,960
Nothing changes at night either.

280
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,510
If you take the medicine,

281
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:42,264
you won't have to see
any ghosts or Hotel del Luna anymore.

282
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,184
You can't stand it?

283
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,687
Then run away from me, Chan-sung.

284
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,769
Are you looking for a hotel?

285
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,731
Hotel del Luna is not here anymore.

286
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,568
I'd love to take you there,

287
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,528
but I am not...

288
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,324
going there anymore.

289
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,409
I'm sorry.

290
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,238
Are you a human?

291
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,157
Do I look like a ghost?

292
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,243
Who are you?

293
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:27,828
What about you?

294
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,832
I'm with the real estate office.

295
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,669
This place is up for sale, so I came
to take pictures for our ads.

296
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,462
For sale?

297
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,464
They're selling this place?

298
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,010
Yes, is there a problem?

299
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,929
Yes, there are a lot of problems
in this place.

300
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,645
-Yes.
-Let's see.

301
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,106
-Yes.
-I have nothing to wear.

302
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,441
All right.

303
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,611
Ms. Jang, I got a call
from the real estate agent.

304
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,613
He asked if you paid the inheritance tax.

305
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:04,906
What tax?

306
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,825
If you didn't pay that,

307
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,161
there could be a problem
with the transfer tax.

308
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,039
I'm not really sure what he's saying.

309
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,791
How would I know?

310
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,794
Should I call Mr. Koo?

311
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,505
No. You can't call him.

312
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,216
God...

313
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,887
Is there any ghost
who would know a thing about this?

314
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,640
He used to work for the biggest law firm
in Korea, Jang and Yeong.

315
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,309
Then he died from overwork.

316
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,312
He said he used to be
a very competent lawyer.

317
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,271
Really?

318
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,609
Mr. Jang and Yeong. So what's the problem?

319
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,944
What's the deal with the inheritance tax?

320
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,447
The late Mr. No Jun-seok

321
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,532
left the building to you, Ms. Jang.

322
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,744
And he prepared all the paperwork
for you to pay the inheritance tax.

323
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,412
You can just pay it now.

324
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,206
With what?

325
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,166
Didn't you prepare the money?

326
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,585
No idea.
The guy who prepared that isn't here.

327
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,837
I have no idea if he prepared it at all.

328
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,259
If you sell your land to pay the taxes...

329
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,469
The inheritance tax,

330
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,680
the mortgage,

331
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,557
and the transfer tax...

332
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,980
There won't be much money left.

333
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,274
Why not? That's impossible.

334
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,943
I was told that land is very expensive.

335
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,278
Why wouldn't there be much money left?

336
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,864
That's how it works with taxes.

337
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:31,827
You should just pay the inheritance tax
and hold onto the land.

338
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,379
Mr. Jang and Yeong.

339
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,631
What are you doing?
You have to take care of this.

340
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,886
Mr. Jang and Yeong.

341
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,014
Because he died from overwork,

342
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,976
he faints if he reads anything
for more than five minutes.

343
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,609
What kind of ridiculous situation is this?

344
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,820
Darn it.

345
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,531
Sure thing. Please give me a call, then.

346
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,826
By the way, how did you know
about the inheritance tax?

347
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,369
I came to see the building,

348
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,289
and I ran into someone
by the name of Koo Chan-sung.

349
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,542
He's here with me right now.

350
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,628
He's there?

351
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,091
Could I speak to him?

352
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,635
God, it's all Greek to me.

353
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,054
Damn it!

354
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,640
Ms. Jang,
why don't you speak to him directly?

355
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,018
I have no clue what he's talking about.

356
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,769
And do you think I'd know?

357
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,860
Hey, Mr. Realtor.
Tell me, and make it easy and simple.

358
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,570
How much will I get out of it?

359
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,156
Don't try to swindle me.

360
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,743
I have a talented employee
who got his MBA from Harvard.

361
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,369
But you fired him.

362
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,332
Koo Chan-sung?

363
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,251
You don't know a thing about the taxes,
inheritance or transfer one, do you?

364
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,587
Why did you fire your talented employee?

365
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,299
Why are you over there?

366
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,676
Did you get hired by a realtor?

367
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,179
I came here because I was flustered
after getting fired overnight.

368
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,889
You must be regretting firing me.

369
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,312
If you just ask me to come back,

370
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,231
I can be there immediately.

371
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,779
Tell this to the realtor.

372
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,781
He should kick out anyone
that's unrelated,

373
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,783
and lock up the place well.

374
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,705
Okay. I got it.

375
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,760
Was Mr. Koo over there?

376
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,973
He must have been searching for us
all night long.

377
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,557
MANAGER KOO CHAN-SUNG

378
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,435
If he calls back,
tell him to call us when he's dead.

379
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,315
Right, Hyeon-jung and Yu-na!

380
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,360
Check if they're on their way.

381
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,028
Yes, ma'am.

382
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,851
If you don't like those, wear these.

383
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,062
No, they're not my type.

384
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,698
Wear your tacky poop colored shoes...

385
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,786
and go work at a normal hotel.

386
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,830
Okay, Chan-sung?

387
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,903
I have to lock up, so please leave.

388
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,227
Hey, where are we?

389
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,398
We got lost while chasing the other car.

390
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,901
Even the GPS can't find this road.

391
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,114
Where on earth are we?

392
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,664
What's the matter?

393
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,084
I saw someone on the road.

394
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,129
I don't see anyone.

395
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,382
There.

396
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,265
Gosh.

397
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,267
I'm sorry.

398
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,519
The car is not cooperating.

399
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,147
No.

400
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,315
I think we came to the right place.

401
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,404
I'll go out to a bigger road
to meet with the insurance agent.

402
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,197
See you later.

403
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,199
Darn it.

404
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,079
It was a man just now, wasn't it?

405
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,540
The ghost in the car earlier was a woman.

406
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,292
Let's go and see.

407
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,293
Yu-na.

408
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,628
I think it'll be too dangerous.

409
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,506
You're a ghost too.
I used to be one as well.

410
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,925
It's not that. Did you see the driver

411
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,427
of that car?

412
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,433
It was a young man wearing sunglasses.

413
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,811
There was a ghost in that man's car,

414
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,355
and when we chased after the car,
we found another ghost.

415
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,107
It feels a little...

416
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:40,320
Do you think they were killed by that man?

417
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,614
Humans can be more dangerous than ghosts.

418
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,742
If they died wrongfully,
I can't just leave.

419
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,953
I died wrongfully too.

420
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,457
I'll be careful.

421
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:57,003
Then promise me. You have to run back
to our car if you see a human.

422
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,713
-Okay?
-Okay.

423
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,843
By the way, it's usually people
who fear ghosts.

424
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,012
But we ghosts are scared of humans.

425
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,597
You're right.

426
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,642
He looked like an ordinary person.

427
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,683
This is our signature cocktail

428
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,601
the guests at the bar like the most.

429
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,857
Did you make this?

430
00:30:58,982 --> 00:30:59,983
I did.

431
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,986
They dream of life here while being drunk.

432
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,029
These might be
the last drops of their tears

433
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,031
while they dream their lives away.

434
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,995
Why would you name it in English
when you were a Confucian scholar?

435
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,663
You're trying too hard to look cool.

436
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,665
I don't think someone who named this hotel

437
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,459
with a pretentious name
like "Hotel del Luna" can criticize.

438
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:26,217
As I expected, cocktails made by ghosts
are so disgusting.

439
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,555
I heard makgeolli is famous
in this village.

440
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,015
Don't you have any?

441
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,393
You're the one who told me
to never bring it up.

442
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,436
Did you forget?

443
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,272
Since when were you so obedient
to my orders?

444
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,943
I lost my appetite
because of this cocktail.

445
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,867
I know she's bored but can't go shopping.

446
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,952
But why is she taking it out on me?

447
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,251
It's delicious to me.

448
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,880
MAIN BUILDING

449
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:07,884
BORAM MAKGEOLLI

450
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,020
It's good.

451
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:35,995
What's this?

452
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,920
Who drank all this?

453
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,683
This village makes amazing makgeolli.

454
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,812
I wonder if there's anything to snack on.

455
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,189
Is there a radish field around here?

456
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,943
This will taste great with some radish.

457
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:13,324
Let's see
Where's the radish field?

458
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:26,170
No wonder the makgeolli tasted so nice.

459
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:50,403
Are you the big tree
beyond the hill over there?

460
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:52,905
Yes.

461
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,950
You've built a very nice house.

462
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,953
That place must be
the Guest House of the Moon,

463
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,163
where souls come to rest.

464
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,622
Yes.

465
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,083
And I'm the owner.

466
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,336
I'm the Guardian of the Well
of this village.

467
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,965
This village has a deity
who protects its well.

468
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,800
No wonder the water tasted so nice here.

469
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,220
I got to taste great makgeolli
thanks to you.

470
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,701
You got fired?
Did you get fired because of me?

471
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,203
What in the world did you do

472
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,330
to cause so much trouble
at Chan-sung's hotel?

473
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,874
I can't remember.

474
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,210
I remember feeling happy
because the hotel was so nice.

475
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,128
But I can't remember
anything else after that.

476
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,089
And when I woke up,

477
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,382
I was drunk in a cab.

478
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,176
I can't remember if I drank.

479
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,428
You probably did. You love alcohol.

480
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,222
You probably got drunk and caused trouble.

481
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,349
That's your thing.
I saw it a couple times.

482
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,725
It wasn't because of Mi-ra.

483
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,769
I just got fired

484
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,897
because she thought I was a nuisance.

485
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,111
I should find a way to go back.

486
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,868
I guess Man-wol dumped Chan-sung.

487
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,329
But it's not like
they went out with each other.

488
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,373
Chan-sung liked her.

489
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:29,043
Man-wol left him with an expensive
painting, so he'd leave her alone.

490
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,838
I've seen my yacht club members
do the same thing.

491
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,173
I never thought she would do that.
She's so mean.

492
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:37,718
Are you saying that huge painting
of the mountain

493
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,804
is worth a lot of money?

494
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,598
Did she really have to give him
a painting of Baekdu Mountain?

495
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:46,060
He's going to feel sad every time
he listens to the national anthem.

496
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,073
Sir.

497
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:03,286
As I thought, you have the ability
to see dead people.

498
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,833
I saw on the news that you passed away.

499
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,043
I'm sorry I didn't get to visit you.

500
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:16,841
I wanted to see this painting
one last time before I leave.

501
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,261
Is the tiger inside this painting?

502
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,555
The tiger rested well
at the hotel I used to work at,

503
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,432
and left for the afterlife.

504
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:25,975
A hotel?

505
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:30,062
Only dead people like you
can visit that hotel.

506
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,524
You're working
at a very interesting hotel.

507
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,776
I'd like to go there too.

508
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,654
You can go there.

509
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,490
You'll be able to see it very well.

510
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,164
Are you going somewhere?

511
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,541
Yes, I'm going to the hotel.

512
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,418
I thought you can't go there anymore.

513
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,711
I found a way.

514
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,589
Let's go.

515
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,931
Chan-sung has a lot of pride.

516
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,058
I wonder if he's going there to beg her.

517
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,559
That's not like him.

518
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,062
You're really weird too.

519
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,064
Why aren't you stopping him?

520
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,191
You came all the way here
because of Chan-sung.

521
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,361
You kept interrupting their date.
Why are you just letting him go?

522
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,487
I just

523
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,364
decided to give up.

524
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,531
What?

525
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,284
I wanted to make
Chan-sung come back to me,

526
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,496
but I figured I should just give up

527
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,623
once I met Jang Man-wol.

528
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:33,709
Why? Because she's rich?
Or because she's pretty?

529
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,379
I make good money, and I'm pretty too.

530
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,926
But I have a feeling
that I'm no match for her.

531
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,762
I wonder what's wrong with me.

532
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,889
Do I owe her something
in my previous life?

533
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,100
That's possible.

534
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,686
You owe a lot of money
in this life as well.

535
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,814
I'm going to pay everything back.

536
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,776
Plus, I hold our alumni reunion
at your restaurant.

537
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,153
I should check the group chat.

538
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,324
I'm also a member of that group chat,

539
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,993
and I'm the one who gathers everyone.

540
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,662
Why is she acting like
she does all the work?

541
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,095
Are you coming back from somewhere?

542
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,138
Yes.

543
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,725
Where's all my stuff?
They're not here yet?

544
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,186
Hyeon-jung and the intern
ran into ghosts on their way here.

545
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,063
They wish to bring them here as a guest.

546
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,150
I knew it.

547
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,818
They got sidetracked.

548
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,447
Hyeon-jung must've learned that
from Mr. Koo.

549
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,660
After what happened
to our guest in Room 13,

550
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,289
Mr. Koo could never be indifferent
to wandering ghosts.

551
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,002
Yes, you're right.

552
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,598
I brought her from the public restroom.

553
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,893
Do you want the red toilet paper
or the blue toilet paper?

554
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,979
Do you want the red toilet paper
or the blue toilet paper?

555
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,482
Gosh, how long have you been saying that?

556
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,359
I think I heard it when I was young.

557
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,404
Come with me. You should take some rest.

558
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:29,575
Do you want the red toilet paper
or the blue toilet paper?

559
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,918
He was hovering by the crosswalk,
so I brought him here.

560
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,797
It's not that way. It's this way.

561
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,305
He's a coward

562
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,100
with such a soft heart.

563
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,412
Chan-sung?

564
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,053
The late chairman came to my house.

565
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,555
So I brought him here.

566
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:37,059
He told me that this hotel is
much more magnificent than mine.

567
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,436
So I thought I'd pay a visit.

568
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,482
This place is amazing.

569
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:52,283
You're here as our guest, so we'll do
our best to make you feel comfortable.

570
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:53,909
Ms. Choe.

571
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,954
Let me take you to your room.

572
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,456
Please follow me.

573
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,464
Chan-sung.

574
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,592
You really played it smart.

575
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,136
You coaxed him to find our hotel
and followed him here?

576
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,596
I did follow him here.

577
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,098
But I didn't coax him to find here.

578
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,767
I met him for another reason.

579
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:19,894
What reason?

580
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,312
Mr. Koo.

581
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,983
Call my secretary to settle things
regarding the painting.

582
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,111
They're planning to make
a memorial hall for me.

583
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,197
They'll pay you a good price for it.

584
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,117
Yes, sir.

585
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,123
What painting?

586
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,542
The painting of the Baekdu Mountain
that you gave me

587
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,211
because you thought it took up space.

588
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,545
You told me

589
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,465
that you couldn't sell it
for even a quarter of the price.

590
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,841
I just didn't sell it,

591
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,053
since the price of it would get higher
after the Chairman dies.

592
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,181
You should've told me then!
Then I wouldn't have--

593
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,349
No, you wouldn't.

594
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,102
Thanks for the severance pay.

595
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,232
You fraud.

596
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,483
I didn't lie to you.

597
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,362
I didn't expect you to abandon

598
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,863
both the painting...

599
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,325
and me.

600
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,835
-Let's split the money.
-I won't.

601
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,922
You greedy fraud from Harvard!

602
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,554
Okay, give me a quarter of the price.

603
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,638
No.

604
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,683
I'm not selling it
unless I get the full price to myself.

605
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:45,521
You had no idea how expensive it was
when you gave it to me.

606
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,027
You must have gone broke.

607
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,196
You're drinking makgeolli.

608
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,365
Whatever. Get out!

609
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,712
I'll sell the painting
and bring some cash.

610
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,922
Money is the best way to get her.

611
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,982
Welcome.

612
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:34,069
May I come in?

613
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,529
Of course.

614
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,533
Please come in.

615
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,329
What a friendly man.

616
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,372
Thank you.

617
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:45,974
Rich families must have
secret funds that nobody knows about.

618
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,810
Since they're filthy rich,

619
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,687
they often have money
that they forget to tell people about

620
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,106
before they die.

621
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:56,068
Perhaps it could be a Swiss bank account,

622
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,321
a secret account in Virgin Islands,

623
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:04,284
or maybe just a safe filled with money

624
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,704
buried in a sunflower field
or something. You got any?

625
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,583
Well, I don't know.

626
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,923
Take your time, and think carefully.

627
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,085
This is water.

628
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,256
Ms. Jang, we're in trouble.

629
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,677
Something that shouldn't be
inside the hotel is in here now.

630
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,028
The hotel is flooded with water.

631
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,155
What's come in here?

632
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,992
It passed by me when it came in.

633
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,744
It wasn't a soul of a human.

634
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:32,748
It was a deity disguised in the body
of a young man.

635
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,083
A deity?

636
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,883
I know what it is.

637
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,927
How did it get in here?

638
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,639
This area is controlled by Mago.

639
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,934
Other deities can't get inside
without permission.

640
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,865
Perhaps someone let it in.

641
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,333
I honestly thought it was
just a regular guest.

642
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,834
Who is it anyway?

643
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,003
It's the deity that takes care
of the well in this village.

644
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,421
A deity?

645
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:24,550
You mean like the mountain deity
in the folktale about golden axes?

646
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,803
Exactly. He is the Guardian of the Well.

647
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,056
How could you let such a thing in?

648
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:34,059
I had no idea.
I've never seen someone like that,

649
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,770
how was I supposed to know the difference?

650
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,733
It's because our hotel has just moved

651
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,653
and because Hyeon-jung is absent.

652
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,030
It's all your fault!

653
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,492
Yes, let's just say
that everything is my fault.

654
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:53,829
What should we do now?
Do I just tell him to get out?

655
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,748
You can't chase a deity away.

656
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,961
We can't tell him to get out
since we're the ones that let him in.

657
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,423
We have no choice but to serve him.

658
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:07,092
Why did the deity leave his well
and come all the way here?

659
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,261
Something must've bothered him.

660
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,434
It must be a disaster out there,
without the deity in his place.

661
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,103
Goodness.

662
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,524
It's going to get busy from next month.
Keep up the good work.

663
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,734
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

664
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:24,985
It's quite hot outside today.

665
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,237
Boss, the water taps aren't working.

666
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,531
What? What do you mean?

667
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,703
-Why isn't water coming out?
-Exactly.

668
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,204
This is bad.

669
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,796
The well is dry.

670
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,173
What do we do?

671
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:49,384
-What's happened?
-How can this happen?

672
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,636
What's going on?

673
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,096
-It's all dry.
-How can this happen?

674
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,450
The well is the main water source
of the area,

675
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,452
so if it dries up, so will the makgeolli.

676
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,246
Why is my hotel flooded with the water

677
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,499
that should've been used to make
the makgeolli?

678
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:24,252
My beautifully-painted walls
will all get wet.

679
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,005
My walls are going to get mold.

680
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,675
They might even rot.

681
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:34,513
Ms. Choe is checking to see
what room he's staying in.

682
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,847
We can't kick him out,

683
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,809
but maybe we can convince him
to walk out on his own.

684
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,894
I'll go talk to him when we find him.

685
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:43,355
Do you have any idea
how scary angry deities are?

686
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:46,400
Back in the days, we even had to give
human sacrifices to calm them.

687
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,984
Maybe deities didn't ask humans
to do that,

688
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,529
but people just did that in fear.

689
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,824
Mr. Koo, why are you back here?

690
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,534
Didn't you meet Mago?

691
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,623
I found him.

692
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,668
He's staying in a room
on the eighth floor.

693
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,629
Prepare drinks and some food
to make him feel better.

694
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,464
He said that he doesn't need anything

695
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,966
except for one.

696
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,803
He wants Mr. Koo to come up to his room.

697
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,889
Why does he want Chan-sung?

698
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,725
I'm the owner. I'm going up.

699
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:23,603
No, he wants a living human.

700
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,818
Is he actually expecting
a human sacrifice?

701
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,416
Where are you going?

702
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,834
To catch humans.

703
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:46,918
What?

704
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,006
He's probably angry
because of the humans in this village.

705
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:53,842
I'll catch a few of them
and make them apologize to him.

706
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,765
-It's too dangerous.
-I don't care.

707
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,683
I won't send you in there.

708
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,194
I opened the door for him.

709
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:15,280
He thanked me.
I'm sure he wouldn't harm me.

710
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:18,784
I'll go see him.

711
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,585
There's something I wanted to ask you.

712
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,337
I'll just ask.

713
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,923
Don't people usually ask, "May I ask?"

714
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:37,302
Who's the old woman
that we saw at the hospital the other day?

715
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,770
You knew her, didn't you?

716
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,483
Yes, she's my younger sister.

717
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:55,153
What? Younger sister? That old woman?

718
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,573
She may have grown old,
but she's still my cute sister

719
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,700
who always smiled when she called me.

720
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,370
"Your cute sister"?

721
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,996
What's her name?

722
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,792
Hyeon-mi.
Ji Hyeon-jung's sister, Ji Hyeon-mi.

723
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,086
Hyeon-mi.

724
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:15,924
I should visit her
and ask if she remembers Hyeon-jung.

725
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,551
No.

726
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,386
Don't do it.

727
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,055
Don't visit her. I mean it.

728
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:27,102
Hey, do you think I'm someone
who would say something bad to a sister

729
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,228
of someone I like?

730
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,780
Darn it, this is awful.

731
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:41,992
Why did I say that
in this mountain full of ghosts?

732
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,076
I'm so stupid!

733
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,537
Be careful.

734
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,664
Are you okay?

735
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,146
Hyeon-jung.

736
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,441
I found him.

737
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:17,444
-Yu-na.
-Yes?

738
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,989
I don't think he's alone.

739
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:22,699
Look.

740
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,183
The fog is really thick.

741
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,605
Just in case you just wanted
to look bold earlier,

742
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:54,856
I'll stop you this once.

743
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,984
Chan-sung, do not go inside. Go back.

744
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:02,030
I look kind of cool
now that you're trying to stop me.

745
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:05,325
Forget it. You're a coward.
You can hardly look cool.

746
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:06,910
Just run away.

747
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,162
I did you a favor and let you go.
Why did you come back?

748
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,414
You gave me your time again.

749
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:15,335
It was one, two, three.

750
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:17,796
Three seconds.

751
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:23,969
If you just ask me to come back,

752
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:25,804
I can be there immediately.

753
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:42,529
For a short moment,
you wanted me to return.

754
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,322
This time, for three seconds.

755
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,912
How could I not come?

756
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,086
Do not smile. You're making me angry.

757
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,923
You aren't angry. You're worried.

758
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:06,886
Don't worry.

759
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,765
In my experience, I could tell
that the deities like me.

760
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,142
It must be because I'm weak-hearted.

761
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,042
Chan-sung!

762
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,149
Chan-sung.

763
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,860
Answer me. Chan-sung!

764
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,314
Goodness, what is this?

765
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,448
Are you here?

766
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,492
Guardian of the Well, are you in here?

767
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,955
Yes, you let me in here,

768
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,040
so I am very delighted.

769
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,587
I'm sorry, but this place isn't for you.

770
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,422
Please return to your place.

771
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,550
I do not wish to return.

772
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,845
What made you so furious?

773
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:57,348
If you tell me,
I will try my best to resolve it.

774
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,394
I do not wish to go back.
I do not wish to go.

775
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,271
What did you say?

776
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,191
I ran away from there.

777
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,776
I am scared.

778
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:27,670
I am scared of getting abandoned.

779
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,799
I've never dried up

780
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,719
and have given the people fresh water.

781
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,641
No matter how much they took,
I was filled up again.

782
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:43,311
I gave them water to make alcohol
and let them make money.

783
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:47,524
Please let our makgeolli business
become a success.

784
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:51,194
However, I can no longer fill up

785
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:54,280
as much water as they want.

786
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,453
I am continuously getting dried up.

787
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:05,250
I ran away before I dry up completely
and get abandoned

788
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,751
like an empty pond.

789
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:11,172
I chose to abandon them first

790
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,716
while they could still miss me.

791
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:04,851
What is it like to be
at the ugly bottom of my soul?

792
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:07,812
I am saddened.

793
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,482
I am sorry that I'm in a place
where I am not welcomed.

794
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,193
But I have nowhere else to go.

795
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,916
Please help me.

796
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:55,193
I'm a lowly diety, but I'll return
the favor for your help.

797
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,698
Since you saw my fears already,

798
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,868
I'll show you yours.

799
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,537
This will help you resolve your concerns.

800
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,287
Is that the moon?

801
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:52,625
Chan-sung.

802
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:54,419
Are you okay?

803
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:58,923
I'm okay.

804
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,682
I found a way.

805
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,061
We found another one, sir!

806
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:10,995
Move out of the way.

807
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:19,212
Today, five bodies that were buried
in secret

808
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,047
were found on a hill.

809
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,758
The police believe there might be
more bodies buried,

810
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,259
and are continuing their search.

811
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,428
According to the police, it'll take

812
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:28,805
-a few more days
-Here.

813
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,598
to identify the bodies,

814
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:32,809
and it'll take over a week

815
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,269
to find the causes of deaths.

816
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:38,981
There were serial murders.
They found five bodies.

817
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:41,400
Really? Gosh.

818
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,027
Bye.

819
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,660
Wait a minute. How did they find out?

820
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,841
We brought some guests.

821
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,230
-Drink up, guys.
-Here.

822
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:21,065
-Dig in.
-It's been a while.

823
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:21,983
It's delicious.

824
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,818
-This is expensive.
-You didn't change at all.

825
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:25,152
-Do you think so?
-Here.

826
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:26,445
You don't know Mi-ra, right?

827
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,613
I know I look young.

828
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:29,282
-Right?
-It's nice.

829
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,367
-Mi-ra, you can drink soda.
-Why?

830
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,494
-It's directly from the factory.
-Watch it.

831
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:36,205
Hey, guys.

832
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:37,373
Hello, Ji-won.

833
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:38,833
Hey, Ji-won!

834
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:40,334
-It's been a while.
-Hey.

835
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,461
-It's been so long.
-Hello.

836
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,715
-It's been so long.
-Hey, Ji-won!

837
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:47,508
-What is going on?
-You're still the same.

838
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,260
How did he come here?

839
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:52,597
What? I called him
since he wasn't on the invitee list.

840
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,850
Ji-won, sit here.

841
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:03,024
It's nice to see you.

842
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,278
Long time no see, Sanchez.

843
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:08,863
Yes.

844
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,157
I didn't know you'd show up here.

845
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:16,245
There's someone I wanted to see.

846
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:19,332
I heard Chan-sung is back in Korea too.

847
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,751
Yes, he's back.

848
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,503
I didn't know
you and Chan-sung were close.

849
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:27,173
Of course we are. I know him well.

850
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:31,844
He's a smart guy who's good at everything.

851
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,516
Is he still the same? I want to see him.

852
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,831
A chairman I was close to was

853
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,751
nice enough to provide
a small spring in his villa.

854
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:05,836
You'll be at peace here.

855
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,932
The makgeolli from that village
will taste different now.

856
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,144
They'll find a different source of water.

857
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:06,272
Even if the water's taste changes,
not many will notice it

858
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,315
as long as the label doesn't change.

859
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,486
Their makgeolli used to be so good.

860
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:16,949
It's upsetting and sad to think
I won't ever get to taste it again.

861
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,035
He was sad too.

862
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:25,124
He dried up the well as a punishment
because he was cross.

863
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:26,250
Now he's sad?

864
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,587
He told me he wasn't cross.

865
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,630
If he wanted to punish them,

866
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,549
he would've called on you
since you're stronger.

867
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:35,468
Why would he call on a weak human like me?

868
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:45,644
What did you see
at the bottom of the well?

869
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,025
Fear.

870
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:52,943
"Fear"?

871
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:55,112
For seeing his weakness,

872
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:57,573
he showed me

873
01:07:58,115 --> 01:07:59,492
what I fear,

874
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,203
what I want to avoid

875
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,246
and run away from right now.

876
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:10,586
It was...

877
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:13,672
very scary.

878
01:09:48,058 --> 01:09:50,144
Like how I could look into your dreams,

879
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,520
you were able

880
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,231
to see my fears, weren't you?

881
01:09:57,234 --> 01:10:00,029
Just like how I helped the Guardian
of the Well move to a safe place,

882
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:01,614
you were

883
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,158
only trying to put me in a safe place.

884
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,751
You know what this is, don't you?

885
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,253
It looks like a medicine.

886
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:18,797
I thought it was strange
why Mago would suddenly give this to me.

887
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,467
You asked her to give it to me, right?

888
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,969
Think what you want.

889
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,306
Chan-sung.

890
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:30,142
I'll pray for your safety.

891
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:37,441
No.

892
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:44,281
I will get in danger
to make you feel uncomfortable.

893
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:46,784
What?

894
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:54,541
Chan-sung!
Do you know how precious that is?

895
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,128
Do you know
how much I had to beg to get that?

896
01:10:58,212 --> 01:10:59,380
Jang Man-wol!

897
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:02,549
No place is safe for me anymore.

898
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:07,554
I will keep getting on your nerves
and get in danger.

899
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:08,681
You must...

900
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,310
keep protecting me.

901
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:16,957
But in fact, I was hoping you'd return.

902
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:19,877
I won't let you vanish.

903
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,128
Trust me.

904
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:26,091
You brought both that woman
and Yeon-u to me.

905
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:28,802
Thank you, Chan-sung.

906
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:31,847
If Chan-sung didn't take the medicine,

907
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:34,224
then he can probably see
the connections that were cut off.

908
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:37,644
It's the past I have been hiding.
Please get rid of it.

909
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:41,106
I brought a connection
from your past again.

910
01:12:42,232 --> 01:12:44,234
