1
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,853
Chan-sung.

2
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,688
When you see me off,

3
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,484
don't feel lonely.

4
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,446
I hope you keep it up
and take good care of me

5
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,490
and then...

6
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,075
see me off.

7
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,494
That's what Mago wants.

8
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,249
What are you doing?

9
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,628
What?

10
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,799
Do you want me to go right now?

11
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,391
Don't rush it. Now isn't the right time.

12
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:44,145
Do you really think
I'll leave that easily?

13
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:48,983
I'll make you feel miserable
and get sick and tired of me.

14
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,735
When I leave,

15
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,364
you'll probably put on a big smile
and feel extremely relieved.

16
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,671
Sir.

17
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,840
You shouldn't be here.

18
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,011
Sir.

19
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,763
I know you can see me.
You can hear me, right?

20
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,599
Damn it!

21
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,769
Please don't spit on me.

22
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,147
Stop it.

23
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,566
How drunk is he?

24
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,026
I don't think he's drunk.

25
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,569
-I think he's just crazy.
-Sir!

26
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,447
-My goodness.
-There are so many weird people.

27
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,825
Calm down and follow me.

28
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,036
-My gosh.
-Poor thing.

29
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,997
Hey, be quiet. Let's not provoke him.

30
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,880
I bought you beer like I promised.

31
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,548
Thank you.

32
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,968
Go to the hotel I told you about
once you're done with the beer.

33
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,846
You'll be able to find it
if you follow the moon.

34
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,848
Okay.

35
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,811
-I can't believe this.
-This is so cool.

36
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,898
-My gosh, look at him.
-Kim Jun-hyun?

37
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,194
It's a sausage.

38
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,280
Welcome.

39
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,409
That's 1,800 won.

40
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,245
-It's really him.
-He's really fat.

41
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,622
I'm a fan of yours.
Are you shooting something nearby?

42
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,541
I really like it when you take
those huge one bites on your show.

43
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,669
-I can't believe it's him.
-Gosh, look.

44
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,795
-He's coming.
-He's coming.

45
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,755
-Hello.
-Hi.

46
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,967
-I'm a huge fan.
-Thank you.

47
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,469
Can I please get an autograph?

48
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,889
-Now is not the time to follow...
-This is so cool.

49
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,062
I can't believe
he's even popular among ghosts.

50
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,816
This restaurant was
on The Guys Who Died After Eating.

51
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,317
Kim Jun-hyun...

52
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,237
He ate five balls of sticky rice cake
at once.

53
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,573
That guy. He's not an ordinary man.

54
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,538
Jang Man-wol likes him too.

55
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,503
-I got the leg.
-You need to put that in.

56
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,005
-Yes.
-My goodness.

57
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,549
You're only going to have
the webfoot octopus?

58
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,633
Yes.

59
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,012
Ms. Fourth Choice came by today,
and she's very clever.

60
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,931
She volunteered to intern here.

61
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,433
Why don't we let her do that?

62
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,977
Let her do what she wants.

63
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,814
Then I'll put Hyeon-jung
in charge of training her.

64
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,525
I'll make sure he teaches her well
so she can take over right away

65
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,985
as soon as Mr. Koo quits.

66
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,279
By the way, did Chan-sung leave?

67
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,740
Yes, he took the afternoon off today

68
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,575
and went home early.

69
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,869
One bite!

70
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,582
KIM JUN-HYUN ATTEMPTS TO EAT
EVERYTHING IN ONE BITE

71
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,627
Are you craving that food?

72
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,923
Should I have the intern go buy some?

73
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,051
No.

74
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,179
I don't really crave anything today.

75
00:05:58,983 --> 00:05:59,984
Did you

76
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,487
find this?

77
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,617
No.

78
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,037
I thought I lost it.

79
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:16,250
Is finding it worth another leaf?

80
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,006
If I want to show him these,

81
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,926
I should start craving
the webfoot octopus.

82
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,773
Hello? Hey, Man-wol.

83
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,317
Chan-sung? He's not home yet.

84
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,361
He's not answering his phone.

85
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:47,573
Once he comes home, tell him to wait
for me. Tell him I'll be picking him up

86
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,075
in my poop colored car.

87
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,953
Man-wol, Chan-sung
might come home late tonight.

88
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,538
What? Why?

89
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,289
His girlfriend came by today.

90
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,462
What did you just say?

91
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,048
She's the girl he used to date
back when he was in the States.

92
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,008
She came to my house to meet Chan-sung.

93
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,969
But they must be meeting outside.

94
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,138
My gosh, you startled me.

95
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,181
Are you already here?

96
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,603
Chan-sung has a girlfriend?

97
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,691
Who is she? Is she pretty?

98
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,402
-Well--
-Forget it. Don't tell me.

99
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,947
Why are you telling me that?
I never said I was curious.

100
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,241
I'm not interested. At all.

101
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,828
-See you.
-But I haven't said anything yet.

102
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,664
If you want to tell me so badly, go ahead.
I'll hear you out.

103
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,668
Is she pretty?

104
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,339
I just asked if she's pretty.

105
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,344
Yes, she's pretty. She's pretty.

106
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,433
Sanchez.

107
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,438
You really are slow-witted.

108
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,234
You know nothing, do you?

109
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,320
You're so stupid.

110
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,281
Is she...

111
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,492
that pretty?

112
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,250
Yes, she's really pretty. She's smart too.

113
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,919
And she and Chan-sung make a great couple.

114
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,546
I have her picture. You want to see it?
I'll go find it. Wait here.

115
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,178
If she really turns out to be pretty,

116
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,224
I'll kill you, Sanchez.

117
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,815
Man-wol, look.

118
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,153
Man-wol? Did she leave?

119
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,909
I wonder if Chan-sung's late
because he met Mi-ra.

120
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:08,172
Their connection has lasted
for a very long time.

121
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,808
I hope he takes good care of her,

122
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,437
so that she doesn't end up
getting hurt again.

123
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,702
-Unbelievable.
-This is incredible.

124
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,704
When is Kim Jun-hyun coming?

125
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,040
My gosh, this is cool.

126
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:44,750
Excuse me.

127
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,796
Are they shooting
The Guys Who Died After Eating here?

128
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,841
Yes, are you also here
to get Kim Jun-hyun's autograph?

129
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,760
A person I know is a fan of his.

130
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,388
-His girlfriend is a fan of his.
-My mom is a huge fan.

131
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,598
My dad is a fan.

132
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,270
My boss is a fan. She likes him a lot.

133
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,813
Hey, you guys.

134
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,523
He's over there giving out his autographs.

135
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,733
-Let's go.
-Come on.

136
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,318
Sir, you should come.

137
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,921
Maybe I should've gotten his autograph.

138
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,299
She would've liked it.

139
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:40,890
Jang Man-wol?

140
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,563
What are you doing here?
Did you know that I was here?

141
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,107
I heard.

142
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,109
Did you meet?

143
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,445
Well, yes. Kind of.

144
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,572
You must've been so happy.

145
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,033
So how was it?

146
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,910
A lot leaner than I thought.

147
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,204
With a small face and great skin.

148
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,999
Why don't you go see for yourself?
I'm sure he's still there. Let's go.

149
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,834
Forget it. Why would I?

150
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,337
I came out to eat webfoot octopus.

151
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,130
Webfoot octopus?

152
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,343
You want to eat webfoot octopus
dressed like that at this late hour?

153
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:21,013
That's right. Webfoot octopus.
That's the only reason I'm here.

154
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,519
That's the earring I found.

155
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,230
Oh, yes.

156
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,441
I bought these to wear them
when I go out to eat webfoot octopus.

157
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,944
I'm headed to eat webfoot octopus
since I found these earrings.

158
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,862
You must come with me
because you found it.

159
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,323
You're just craving webfoot octopus.

160
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,951
Stop coming up with excuses
that make no sense.

161
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,120
Why? Are you sick and tired of me?

162
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,830
You can't stand me anymore?

163
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,378
If you want to eat webfoot octopus now,

164
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,755
we should go to Noryangjin.

165
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,299
Actually, no.
The west coast is famous for them.

166
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,801
You want to go to the sea?

167
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,930
Well, okay.

168
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,225
And we can see the sunrise too
while we're there.

169
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,352
I'm not sure
if we can see it on the west coast.

170
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,187
But let's go.

171
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,108
Sure.

172
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,069
We'll take that poop colored car you love.

173
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,321
Let's go have some webfoot octopus.

174
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,324
Yes, let's go.

175
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,828
By the way, are you sure
you don't want to see Kim Jun-hyun?

176
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,913
Kim Jun-hyun?

177
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,458
How can I see him?

178
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,710
Didn't you come here to see him?

179
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,670
He's filming something over there.

180
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,631
Darn it. Why didn't you tell me sooner?

181
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,260
Oh, she can run.

182
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,471
Jang Man-wol!

183
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:58,277
Those are the bowls of hangover soup
he ate here today.

184
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,906
I heard he was chosen again today
for Eat At Once.

185
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,493
I can't believe I missed it.

186
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,039
That's where Kim Jun-hyun sat,

187
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,750
so settle for having
the hangover soup there.

188
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,001
Eat before it gets cold.

189
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,837
Then why don't you show me
how much you can eat in one bite?

190
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,256
With some radish kimchi. Slurp it all in.

191
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,133
Don't overestimate me, please.

192
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,385
I'll enjoy this, in many bites.

193
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,143
This restaurant will do very well
now that Kim Jun-hyun has dined here.

194
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,440
This restaurant would've done fine
even without Kim Jun-hyun.

195
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,484
Because of her.

196
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,572
What about that baby?

197
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,783
She brings a lot of luck to this place.

198
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,285
She was born
with a tremendous amount of luck,

199
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,663
because of all the good karma
she built in her past lives.

200
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,332
Any family with such a child
becomes successful in no time.

201
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,001
You can be born with a lot of luck
when you do many good deeds.

202
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,421
Then in the opposite case...

203
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,299
You're either born dirt poor
or as a dog or a pig.

204
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,552
Then if you're reincarnated...

205
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,268
What? You just thought

206
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,271
I'd totally be reincarnated
as a dog or a pig, didn't you?

207
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,481
I'm not sure, but to be honest,
I am worried

208
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,732
because it's highly likely.

209
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,777
I've already paid for all my sins
by running the hotel

210
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,987
for over a millennium.

211
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,656
But it's not like you've treated
all the guests that well.

212
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,533
How could I have treated them better?

213
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,953
You ignored some of them,
saying they're nuisances.

214
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,955
And you took money
from the rich ones to buy booze

215
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,248
and cars for yourself.

216
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,083
I'm really worried about you.

217
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,043
It's none of your concern.

218
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,087
It is. I should be concerned.

219
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,047
I don't want you to be born
as a dog or a pig.

220
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,174
Gosh, it is none of your business!

221
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,176
Imagine you being reincarnated as a pig.

222
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,178
I don't want to meet you again
as hangover soup.

223
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,555
Be nice.

224
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:51,974
I don't want this anymore.

225
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,726
I lost my appetite because of you.

226
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,064
I saw a ghost
wandering around the area earlier.

227
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,566
I told him to go to the hotel,

228
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,902
but you should take him
since you're here anyway.

229
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:03,986
Be nice to him.

230
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,114
Chan-sung.

231
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:13,162
You always go talk to ghosts
you don't even know.

232
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,204
You really shouldn't.

233
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,915
They could be evil ghosts.

234
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,208
It's dangerous.

235
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,132
Does wandering around for a long time
make them evil ghosts?

236
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,509
Any wandering ghost turns evil
whenever it harms humans.

237
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,512
And such a ghost
can devour all other souls,

238
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,264
let alone living humans.

239
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,600
If it's caught by the Grim Reaper,

240
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,437
it certainly won't be reincarnated
as a lucky child or even as an animal.

241
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,065
Its soul will be perished on the spot.

242
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:53,118
Why didn't you report to me
that this room's guest left the hotel?

243
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,413
It was due to our human manager's mistake.

244
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,999
What can we do? She left the hotel.

245
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,047
Her soul is filled with hatred
and resentment toward humans.

246
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,342
If she causes any trouble
in the outside world,

247
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,135
I will hold the hotel accountable.

248
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,434
What a headache.

249
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,062
The Grim Reaper will manage to catch her
and bring her back.

250
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,939
If she causes trouble before she's caught

251
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,857
and turns into an evil ghost,
we'll be doomed.

252
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,194
She's a dangerous one,
but I feel so bad for her.

253
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,907
I hope the guest from Room 13
returns safely.

254
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,417
HOT NEW RELEASES. ENJOY.

255
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,006
Shall I take a quick break?

256
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,844
REAL HOT STUFF

257
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:52,970
What's this?

258
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,274
She's taking her clothes off.

259
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,862
Turn around. Let me see your face.

260
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,752
Are you enjoying this?

261
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:31,884
You like this?

262
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,762
I'm hot, aren't I?

263
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,041
ARE YOU GOING TO PICK ME UP AGAIN TODAY?

264
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,544
WHEN WILL YOU BE HERE?

265
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,672
I CAN SKIP THE AFTERNOON CLASSES

266
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,633
How dare a ghost ignore my messages?

267
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,804
I'm telling you. Yu-na is possessed.

268
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,556
I got goosebumps all over that day.

269
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,185
-How about I throw this at her?
-Good idea, try it.

270
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,395
Let's see what happens.

271
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,355
-All right, here I go.
-Do it.

272
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,234
Just a second.

273
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,695
-Did you get a text?
-No, it's not me.

274
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,530
-It's not me either.
-Same here.

275
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,865
I didn't get anything either.

276
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,450
-What is this, then?
-What's going on?

277
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,586
Other girls hate her so much.

278
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,048
I'M HERE BEHIND YOU

279
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,691
I got Ms. Jang's permission
that you can come to the hotel.

280
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,277
All right. Let's go there now, then.

281
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,404
Now? But what about your classes?

282
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,365
Didn't you see earlier?
I'm struggling to fit in anyway.

283
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,492
I might as well quit school.

284
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,830
It's because of the friends
that bully you, right?

285
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,584
They're quite annoying, but it's fine.

286
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,504
The real Kim Yu-na was a bad girl.

287
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,549
I'm actually enjoying seeing
how much Yu-na

288
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,426
is hated by others.

289
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,475
It's just that school is boring.

290
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,435
Why do you think school is boring?

291
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,771
I had so much fun
back when I was in school.

292
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,398
I studied and played sports.

293
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,567
I always came home so late from school

294
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,986
that the chief servant
had to come to get me.

295
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,073
"Chief servant"?

296
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,951
Yes, he was the chief servant in my house.

297
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,703
He was in a relationship
with my sister's nanny.

298
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,373
I remember he always fought
with my dad's driver.

299
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,583
They were in a love triangle.

300
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,924
A chief servant, a nanny,
and a driver too?

301
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,551
I guess you were a son of a nobleman
when you were alive.

302
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,473
You were born
with a golden spoon in your mouth.

303
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,892
No, it was a silver spoon.

304
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,478
All of the spoons at my house were silver.

305
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,148
You were born into a rich family
with a silver spoon in your mouth,

306
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,484
but you must've been disappointed
to have lived a short life.

307
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:26,576
Yes. I am so disappointed
that I can't seem to let it go.

308
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,496
I can't even go to school
even if I wanted to,

309
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,206
so try to have a better time at school.

310
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,381
Schools these days are so nice.

311
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,174
You guys wear nice school uniforms.

312
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,885
And you have a great piano like this one.

313
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,183
This piano is better
than the one at my house.

314
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,270
Well,

315
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,440
it sounds like you learned
how to play piano too.

316
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,777
Play it.

317
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,741
I don't know how to play it,
but I'll listen to it if you play.

318
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,242
I've probably forgotten everything.

319
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,661
Come on, rich boy. Play the piano.

320
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,876
Who are you talking to now?

321
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,341
What are you talking about?
I was playing the piano.

322
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,678
Sure. Play it then.

323
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,182
Go ahead, Yu-na.
You're good at playing the piano.

324
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,433
Play the piano.

325
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,117
-See?
-I was right.

326
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,151
Hey, she can really play.

327
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,747
You're pretty good, rich boy.

328
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,833
See? You didn't forget it.

329
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,003
I guess not.

330
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,464
I can't seem to forget this.

331
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,345
Hyeon-jung!

332
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,068
Will you ride the bicycle with me
even when you're grown up, Hyeon-mi?

333
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,570
Yes!

334
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,614
You have to ride it with me.
You made a promise to me.

335
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,992
Young Master! Over here!

336
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,535
Young Lady!

337
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,294
Don't you think it's better

338
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:07,672
if I train Ms. Fourth Choice?
Hyeon-jung is too young for this.

339
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,759
I'm sure she'll see more eye to eye
with Hyeon-jung,

340
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,053
who had been educated in the modern times.

341
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,930
You're too old for her.

342
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,766
However, Hyeon-jung is
leaning toward Mr. Third Choice.

343
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,644
Emotionally,
he's bonding more with Mr. Koo.

344
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,688
But he has a reason to stay in this world.

345
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,775
He knows that the hotel might disappear,

346
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,444
so I doubt that he will side with Mr. Koo.

347
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:33,073
You're right. He has to stay at the hotel
until that day.

348
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,242
I'm glad

349
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,827
that there aren't more changes
after the leaves grew out.

350
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,545
What's going on?

351
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,714
Ms. Jang must be angry.

352
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,758
But she's with Mr. Koo now.

353
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,469
I guess Mr. Third Choice
must have gotten her riled up.

354
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:58,640
I hope she burns with rage
so the leaves fall off the branches.

355
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,817
We must sell off the cars you don't need.

356
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,112
I need every single car here.

357
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:16,700
You said you didn't drive seven
of these fourteen cars at all last year.

358
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,952
They are decorating my parking lot.

359
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,704
Look.

360
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,915
I've put these beautiful cars
in the same color.

361
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,085
And these cars are working hard
to make my parking lot look pretty.

362
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,628
This is a huge space.

363
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,089
Imagine there are only three cars
in this big space.

364
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,925
That will look so empty.

365
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,803
That's exactly my point.
There's only one owner.

366
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,222
It makes no sense to have
such a huge parking lot like this.

367
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,851
Select only three cars
and park them near the storage.

368
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,271
And we can utilize this space
for our hotel guests.

369
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,150
Why are you doing this to me?

370
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,736
Why do you want me to sell off my cars?

371
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,905
Because your finances are a mess.

372
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,826
You'll go bankrupt at this rate.

373
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:06,916
MANAGER KOO CHAN-SUNG

374
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,839
It will be difficult to pay off

375
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,300
your next month's card bills
with the balance we have now.

376
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,468
What about the painting?

377
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,636
No one is buying.
It's not as wanted as I expected.

378
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,305
The gold bars from Kim Yu-na's parents.

379
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,557
You already bought a car with those.

380
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,893
Right. What about the black card?

381
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,103
I sent it back.

382
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,607
You have to pay for the things
you bought for the wedding.

383
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,069
Have you gone mad?
Why would you send that back?

384
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,738
Because I cannot have you reincarnated
as a dog or a pig.

385
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,659
I won't help you extort money
from people anymore.

386
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,454
Be kind and cut down on your spending.

387
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,250
Hey, Chan-sung.

388
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,836
You have nothing to lose.

389
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,713
What if I get reincarnated
as a dog or a pig?

390
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,965
I'm fine if I get reincarnated
as a chicken.

391
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,510
Even if I meet you again
as a bowl of chicken noodles,

392
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:02,097
I can say, "Hello, I'm tastier
when you eat me with fresh kimchi."

393
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,349
I'll say hello to you like this.
I mean it.

394
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,935
If you don't sell off your cars
and settle your bills,

395
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,146
you won't even have money
to buy chicken noodles next month.

396
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,614
Will I be poor again?

397
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,325
Oh, no. I hate being broke.

398
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,162
Chan-sung, you're lying, right?

399
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,581
You're just trying to scare me, right?

400
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,960
Ms. Jang wasn't always well-off.

401
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:36,131
When I came to the hotel,
things were rough.

402
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,591
Back then, things were really tough.

403
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,010
As things were chaotic,
we didn't have a human manager.

404
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:44,556
Ms. Jang went through a lot.

405
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,818
I would kill for a bowl of makgeolli
and radish kimchi.

406
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,946
When the US Army truck passes by later,

407
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,698
I'll try to get some food.

408
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,369
The newbie can speak English
since he was educated recently.

409
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,502
MAN-WOL HOSTEL

410
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,670
You're pretty good.

411
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,797
I'll keep you.

412
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,272
I hate being poor.

413
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,485
I'm going to keep eating
caviar and champagne.

414
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,032
When she didn't have enough money,

415
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,117
she managed to get by
with kimchi and makgeolli.

416
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,495
I should push her even more.

417
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,373
Then, Ms. Jang will hate you.

418
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,501
You could get kicked out at this rate--

419
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,046
You're doing a great job.
You're truly loyal to her.

420
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,633
I can take care of her current finances.

421
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,260
But can the hotel be
in a financial problem?

422
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,553
When there was a war,

423
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,306
a tremendous number of people died.

424
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,975
And none of them died
without regrets and grudges in this world.

425
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,728
But when that happened,
the door to the afterlife opened wide,

426
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,272
so not that many souls came to our hotel.

427
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,567
We managed to get past
that difficult time together.

428
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,779
You did very well too, Mr. Kim.

429
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,949
You were the one
who had the most difficult time.

430
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,993
Let's not be picky with our guests

431
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,079
and protect our hotel the best we can

432
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,206
until the day we resolve
our sorrows and grudges.

433
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,332
Here.

434
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,168
One, two, three.

435
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,419
We can do it.

436
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,530
Your Majesty.

437
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,700
It is well into the night.

438
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,486
Who's there?

439
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,530
Stand back...

440
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,325
Cut!

441
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:59,167
Mr. Yu, shouldn't the king
sound more solemn?

442
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,670
-I'm sorry.
-We'll take a short break.

443
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:06,507
You should sound like a king.
Work on it, okay?

444
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,135
Yes, ma'am.

445
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:10,845
My gosh!

446
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,316
How dare you! How dare...

447
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:27,779
Who's there?

448
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,038
What a relief.

449
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,082
Who's there?

450
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,336
How dare you!

451
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,680
-Who are you?
-Such insolence! Make way!

452
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,599
-Wasn't it Yu O?
-Yu O!

453
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,102
-My gosh.
-Yu O?

454
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,355
-Yu O!
-Wake up.

455
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,524
-Please wake up.
-Can you hear us?

456
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,692
-Do something.
-Wake up!

457
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,735
-Contact his manager. Hurry!
-Goodness.

458
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,529
-Yu O, wake up.
-Mr. Yu!

459
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:14,075
Why isn't there anyone who can hear me?

460
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,203
Yu O, come back to us.

461
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,312
Welcome!

462
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,655
A king?

463
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,784
How dare you!

464
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,421
Ms. Choe, what's happening?

465
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:12,467
A VVIP has come to our hotel.

466
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,307
"A VVIP"?

467
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,351
A king has come to our hotel.

468
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,896
I was never able to see one while I lived,

469
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,397
but now I get the chance.

470
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,400
A big score has entered the hotel.
Gather everyone.

471
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,278
We'll provide the VVIP
with the best service

472
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,363
and have him thoroughly satisfied.

473
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,172
Your Majesty!

474
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,221
It's an honor to accommodate
someone of your status.

475
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,057
I am the owner of this hotel,

476
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,852
Jang Man-wol.

477
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,483
A king?

478
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,153
Tae, Jeong, Tae, Se, Mun, Dan, Se.

479
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,697
Which King could he be?

480
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:20,868
You must be exhausted.
Allow me to escort you to your room.

481
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,536
Your Majesty,
we have brought you your meal.

482
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,678
This...

483
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,305
It's a chamber pot.

484
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,348
I know he won't need to use it,

485
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,601
but I thought
it'll bring him some comfort.

486
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,395
That is very considerate of you.

487
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,732
Now that I've served the king,
I wouldn't even mind dying...

488
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,402
Well, I'm already dead,
but that's just how delighted I am.

489
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,074
Your Majesty.

490
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:47,663
I don't want our energy disrupted here,
so don't accept any more new guests.

491
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,874
Tell them to come back
after the king leaves.

492
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:50,917
Yes, ma'am.

493
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,632
Jang Man-wol.

494
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,718
You shouldn't refuse our guests like this.

495
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,303
Well, I can.

496
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,640
I'm busy here, so go home
if you're going to nag me.

497
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,893
He's dressed like a king of Joseon.
Which one is he?

498
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,062
Some were tyrants, you know.

499
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,858
Nonsense! He didn't seem evil.

500
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,570
Then did he seem generous and wise?

501
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:21,864
Well...

502
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:26,118
Why are you nitpicking again?
What's wrong this time?

503
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,912
You must be clueless.

504
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,832
Well, it's understandable. It must be
your first time to serve a king guest.

505
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,545
Have you served one
while working at a hotel then?

506
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,755
Of course.

507
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,509
I've served a few members
of Dubai's royal family.

508
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:43,928
So?

509
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,305
Are you seriously bragging about it?

510
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,432
-That's not it--
-Enough.

511
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,685
Then you don't know jack.

512
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,769
Dismissed!

513
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,649
Chan-sung,
the painting of Baekdu Mountain...

514
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,318
Sell it at half price.

515
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,779
Don't come to work until you do.

516
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,787
They're just too excited
because of the king.

517
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,542
His Majesty's presence
will make the flowers bloom in the garden.

518
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,919
Making sure he rests well
before leaving for the afterlife

519
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:17,962
is most important.

520
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,380
Ms. Jang!

521
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,008
I had him sign the hotel register.

522
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:23,968
HOTEL REGISTER

523
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:27,138
So his name is Yi Hyeon.

524
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,765
"Yi Hyeon"?

525
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,727
Which King was Yi Hyeon?

526
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,812
It sounds somewhat familiar.

527
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,355
Let me see.

528
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:40,109
Han Suk-kyu played Yi Do,
Lee Seo-jin played Yi San,

529
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,903
-and Kim Soo-hyun played Yi Hwon.
-Soo-hyun doesn't count.

530
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,365
It was a character
made up for that particular series.

531
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:50,119
Right, a fusion historical drama.
I'm aware of that.

532
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,247
So who's Yi Hyeon? Did you look it up?

533
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:54,832
I found him.

534
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:58,336
Right? I knew he existed.

535
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,505
He's a character from a TV series.

536
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,218
Let me see that.

537
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,388
The Crowned Queen?

538
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,309
Oh, that's right.

539
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,895
The king from this series
goes by the name Yi Hyeon.

540
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,314
He is a king!

541
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:23,277
Yi Hyeon is just like
Yi Hwon from earlier.

542
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:27,281
He's a TV character
from a fusion historical drama.

543
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:29,909
What?

544
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:39,460
The Crowned Queen is about a queen

545
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,712
who hires a kisaeng who looks similar

546
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,965
to take her place in the palace
in order to stay safe.

547
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,260
Yi Hyeon is the name of the king

548
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,929
who is her husband.

549
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,556
Then who is that king that just came in?

550
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,141
Why does he say he is Yi Hyeon?

551
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:58,854
The guest who came to the hotel is
the actor Bang Tae-u.

552
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,775
The actor Bang Tae-u has

553
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,528
mostly played minor roles
and supporting roles.

554
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:09,407
The first leading role he had
was the role of King Yi Hyeon.

555
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,535
However, sadly,
before the filming even started,

556
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,995
he had a cardiac arrest while working out.

557
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,039
He died suddenly.

558
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:21,043
You mean he is not really a king.

559
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:25,005
He was an actor who put his soul
into acting to take

560
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,382
the role of a king.

561
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:30,803
The way he talked and walked
was perfectly like a king.

562
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,472
He died while he was
so immersed in the role.

563
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:37,768
I believe he thinks he is a real king.

564
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,986
This is so embarrassing.

565
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:50,197
After we serve him breakfast tomorrow,
send him off

566
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,740
to the afterlife.

567
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,554
I heard he was not a king.

568
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,432
You should have recognized it right away

569
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,058
when I voiced my suspicions.

570
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,143
Good for you.

571
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:22,313
I didn't send back the guests
who had come, just in case.

572
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,482
You see, I handled it very wisely.

573
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,108
I said, good for you!

574
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,445
When I saw him earlier,
there was a small scar on his face.

575
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,988
You didn't see it, right?

576
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,241
It was impossible for a king
to have a scar on his face

577
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,784
in Joseon Dynasty.

578
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,369
You know Deposed Queen Lady Yun, right?

579
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,330
You should know since you love dramas.

580
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,457
I know her. She was Prince Gwanghae's mom.

581
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,583
It was Prince Yeonsan's.

582
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,961
You should have checked which king he was.

583
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,005
I thought you felt the energy of ghosts.

584
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,548
But you were fooled by an actor.

585
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,761
It looked so real.

586
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,472
Do you know he put his soul
into his acting?

587
00:41:56,555 --> 00:42:00,184
Think about it.
He must have wanted that role so badly

588
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,228
that he thinks he's a king
even after he died.

589
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,939
Why do you look down on a ghost
giving such a performance?

590
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,857
How dare you? Who do you think you are?

591
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,401
I am

592
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,695
just saying I recognized
that he wasn't a king.

593
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:15,491
If a guest says he is a king,
a hotelier should treat him like one.

594
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,409
Whether he is Mansour
or a king from a drama.

595
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,411
The guests in our hotel are all kings!

596
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,336
Since when did she ever treat
our guests like kings?

597
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,057
YU O IS SUCH A BAD ACTOR.
I'M SICK OF YU'S TERRIBLE ACTING.

598
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,768
A popular star took up the role,
and his acting is terrible.

599
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,103
He is being criticized so much.

600
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,941
If he acted that role,

601
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:52,152
he would've performed
as if he was possessed.

602
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,912
Performing as if he was possessed...

603
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,290
Would that be possible?

604
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,382
I repented a lot after talking to you.

605
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,551
When you said guests were our kings,

606
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,803
I was also moved.

607
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,348
Then you should work harder in the future.

608
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,600
So I've been thinking.

609
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,103
If the guest wants to act,

610
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,730
we have to help him realize his wishes.

611
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:32,234
We hoteliers

612
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,903
will help our guests become kings
if that is what they want.

613
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,322
Whether that is Mansour

614
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,824
or a king from a drama.

615
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,086
One more time.

616
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,297
We need to upload it online.

617
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,758
Show how tasty it is.

618
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,384
Okay, one, two, three.

619
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:04,391
Yu O's fan club hired Sanchez's restaurant
to send a pizza truck to the filming set.

620
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,436
So we were able to get into the set
easily.

621
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,940
What's the use of giving
a "possessed" performance?

622
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,942
It's not like that his face
will be on screen.

623
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,612
I should be able to act
like I'm possessed after eating this...

624
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,947
-I'll do better.
-It's okay. Thanks for the pizza.

625
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,283
Tell him we'll leave
after he looks around the set

626
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,494
and the staff have some pizza.

627
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,329
Ms. Jang.

628
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,748
It's what the guest wants.

629
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,375
He's really looking forward to it.

630
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,918
-Hoteliers should--
-Hey!

631
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,878
Stop. I get it.

632
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,215
Look after the pizza truck.

633
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,758
I'll go get the shooting schedule.

634
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,138
FOOD TRUCK STAFF
THE CROWNED QUEEN

635
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,183
Excuse me. Food Truck lady?

636
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,687
Please take five pizzas
to our costumes staff.

637
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:51,772
Thank you.

638
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,065
Stop there.

639
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:57,945
Hey.

640
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,447
This is not a delivery truck.

641
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:04,201
If they want to eat,
they should come and get it themselves.

642
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:06,829
Okay.

643
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,708
How impertinent.

644
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,462
ENJOY THE PIZZA
AND ACT LIKE YOU'RE POSSESSED

645
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,715
If he could only act well...

646
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,638
Sir, it's me, Yu O.

647
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,559
Did you talk to the writer
about me not filming those scenes?

648
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,562
I am skipping the last two weeks, right?

649
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:35,274
I don't care about the plot of the drama.
It's not my concern.

650
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:38,402
Just tell them my injury is serious.

651
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:39,486
It's so uncomfortable.

652
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:44,283
How can the woman
become a queen when there is no king?

653
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,367
The money I'll get paid?

654
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,786
I don't need that few hundred million won.

655
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,371
I just want out.

656
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,206
Few hundred million won?

657
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,542
I don't care if you tell them I'm dead.

658
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,587
You can tell them Yu O is dead.
I can't do this.

659
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,214
Wait a minute.

660
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,344
Even if his face is not seen,

661
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,097
he still can get paid.

662
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,731
The king doesn't appear
as much as I thought.

663
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:21,028
He only has one scene. Let's help him.

664
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,654
With this one scene,

665
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:27,075
he will have to show how he can act
like he's possessed.

666
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,958
How did Scene 17 end?

667
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:42,216
-Then we can go from here.
-Hurry up.

668
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,800
We're starting.

669
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:49,848
"My queen, you are the only one
I've ever loved." What?

670
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,143
I'm really bad.

671
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,978
What am I going to do?

672
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,481
"You are the only one..."

673
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,110
The Queen?

674
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,321
I must ask her to help me.

675
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,619
Hello, Queen.

676
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,206
Queen, can you do this with me?

677
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,542
Ms. Queen.

678
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,426
Queen.

679
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:32,975
Can you go over the script with me?

680
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,727
The director gets so annoyed with me.
Please help me.

681
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,657
Scene 42 is an emotional scene.

682
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,700
Oh, my goodness.

683
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,162
Who are you?

684
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,333
Look me in the eye, Your Majesty.

685
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,547
Your Majesty.

686
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:35,495
Your Majesty?

687
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,877
What is it, my Queen?

688
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,425
You are the king of all the people
living in this country.

689
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,052
I am.

690
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:53,722
I am Yi Hyeon, the king of this country.

691
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,862
Your Majesty.

692
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,157
I am a fake.

693
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,660
I am not the queen.

694
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,330
Is that why you wanted to leave my side?

695
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,248
If I stay with you,

696
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,793
you will be in danger.

697
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,587
If you hide in the mountains,

698
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,048
I will cut down all the trees to find you.

699
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,800
If you go to the seas,

700
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,761
I will dry up the sea and stop you.

701
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,013
Your Majesty.

702
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,310
I command you as your king.

703
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,481
Don't leave me alone.

704
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,536
Cut! Okay!

705
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,914
Gosh, that was great!

706
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,250
You were amazing.

707
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,668
My Queen.

708
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,628
That was incredible!

709
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:17,931
You did great!

710
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,976
-This is great, isn't it?
-You did an amazing job!

711
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,228
-What just happened?
-What?

712
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,981
Are we done?

713
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,776
Great job!

714
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,369
You were amazing, Your Majesty.

715
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:55,635
His Majesty arrives!

716
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,571
Do not

717
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,991
talk to me about dethroning the Queen.

718
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:22,329
Your Majesty, Her Majesty is
a woman of lowly status.

719
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:26,708
She cannot maintain
the dignity of the royal family.

720
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:30,003
Please consider her dethronement,
Your Majesty!

721
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:32,297
How dare you?

722
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,887
Our guest agreed to help him act
until the drama ends?

723
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,017
Let's see.

724
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,521
Yes, apparently so.

725
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:51,066
Why? I thought she wanted to send him off.

726
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,362
His face might not appear on TV
even if he acts,

727
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,905
but she'll gain something else.

728
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,910
My gosh, this is unbelievable.

729
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:06,331
After I went over my lines with you,
I suddenly acted like I was possessed.

730
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,999
You know what I mean, right?

731
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:11,628
I felt like I was possessed
by someone else when I acted.

732
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,673
By any chance, are you an acting teacher?

733
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:15,924
Do you want

734
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:17,926
to keep this up?

735
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:20,470
Of course. Please do me a favor

736
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,430
and continue to help me out.

737
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:23,598
Then...

738
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,643
let's start negotiating your pay.

739
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,395
My pay?

740
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,398
Oh, sure. I guess you already know.

741
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,024
You can take everything.

742
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,193
How much do you get paid for each episode?

743
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,904
I get paid 120 million won,
and there are 4 episodes for 2 weeks.

744
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,407
So, 4 times 120 million won is
480 million won in total.

745
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,701
I guess that will be enough
to rent a house.

746
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:45,161
Go ahead and take everything.
It's fine with me.

747
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:49,165
Our guest is getting paid for his acting,

748
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,084
and he's agreed to this.

749
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,752
So I have no objections.

750
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:57,465
Hey, I didn't know actors
got paid that much money.

751
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,677
Chan-sung,
how about you start a career in acting?

752
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,346
I don't know how to act.
I'm a horrible actor.

753
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:07,767
I guess you're right.
I can tell that you'll be bad at it.

754
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,519
So, tell me.

755
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:13,315
You told me that I don't even have
enough money to buy myself

756
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:16,526
a bowl of chicken noodles.
But that was a lie, wasn't it?

757
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,737
It's true that your loan is overdue.

758
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,822
But I lied about the chicken noodles.

759
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,867
You have enough money for webfoot octopus.

760
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,619
Oh, right. Webfoot octopus.

761
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,829
I couldn't eat that because of you.

762
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,416
Yes, you're right. It's all my fault.

763
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,670
I'll forgive you
since you know you're at fault.

764
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,173
Then let's go to the west coast.

765
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:42,093
We might get lucky and see the sunrise.
We can also eat webfoot octopus.

766
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,345
What's going on?

767
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,263
Why are you being so nice?

768
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,809
Are you suddenly being nice to me

769
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,937
because I told you
I'm going to be your last guest?

770
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,689
"We'll give you everything you want."

771
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:58,026
Gosh, what an incredible hotelier.

772
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,904
I'm not that incredible.

773
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:05,408
Hoteliers aren't supposed to have
personal feelings for their guests.

774
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,203
What?

775
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:14,125
What kind of personal feelings
do you have for me?

776
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,543
The leaf.

777
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,339
You showed me that I got two leaves.

778
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,800
How do you expect me to ignore that?

779
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:29,891
Let's not go today.
I had too much champagne.

780
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,728
We can have the webfoot octopus tomorrow.

781
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,232
I need to go to the filming set tomorrow.

782
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,650
You don't need to go there.

783
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,735
I hired an intern for you.

784
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,907
THE CROWNED QUEEN

785
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,498
You're the intern?

786
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:54,582
Yes.

787
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:57,544
Feel free to quit whenever you wish.

788
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,379
I'll take your place.

789
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,965
You should be in school.

790
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,092
I'm planning to stay in school.

791
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:10,098
I'm doing it for someone
who used to love going to school.

792
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,102
School's over today,
so I can go with you, right?

793
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,854
I can't find the hotel on my own
during the day.

794
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:19,024
Let's go next time.
I have to meet someone here.

795
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:20,442
Who are you meeting?

796
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,068
A ghost?

797
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,903
No, it's a human being.
I'm meeting a friend.

798
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,490
I'm not interested in humans.
See you later.

799
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:33,830
I clearly told them to put a space
between "take" and "out."

800
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,665
-Thank you for the food.
-No problem.

801
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,293
I heard you're Man-wol's relative.
You should come often.

802
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:39,377
Okay.

803
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:41,838
Hey, Mi-ra.

804
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,591
Chan-sung's waiting for you inside.
Go on in.

805
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:09,282
I thought he was meeting a friend.
But I guess he meant his girlfriend.

806
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,164
It's been a while.

807
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,251
Yes, it has.

808
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,721
Where are you going, Ms. Jang?
You look like you're in a good mood.

809
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:33,973
Yes, I'm going to the beach.

810
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:36,518
The beach? There's a beach in our hotel.

811
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,478
You can't compare that to a real beach.

812
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,271
How is it different?

813
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,523
Our beach is...

814
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:45,819
Webfoot octopus.

815
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,196
There's no webfoot octopus here.

816
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,697
I'm on my way to eat that.

817
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,118
Should I ask Yu-na to get you some?

818
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:56,121
No, I want to eat it there.

819
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:59,165
Gosh, it'll be great
if Mr. Koo can drive you there.

820
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,416
Should I call him?

821
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,794
There's no need. He'll be here.

822
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:05,171
You're right.
We shouldn't call him to hurry

823
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,714
when he's with his girlfriend.

824
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,426
Yu-na apparently saw her.
I heard she's really pretty.

825
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:13,555
Mr. Koo's always around ghosts,

826
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,849
so he should meet a lot of humans
when he can.

827
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,852
If he ends up growing old

828
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,729
all by himself just like Mr. No did,

829
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,440
I'd feel so sorry for him.

830
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,488
Ms. Jang, I hope you eat
a lot of delicious food at the beach.

831
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,865
Hyeon-jung.

832
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,160
Tell the guests to empty
the hotel beach within 30 minutes.

833
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:37,537
I want to take a rest there.

834
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:40,248
I thought you were going to go
to a beach far away.

835
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,625
Why would I go?
They're all the same anyway.

836
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:44,419
I'm...

837
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,880
not going.

838
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:51,634
Should I buy you some webfoot octopus?

839
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,638
You acted like you were never
going to come back to Korea.

840
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:56,556
But here you are.

841
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,309
Are you nervous to see me here
since it was so unexpected?

842
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,227
I'm just glad to see you.

843
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,147
I found it weird
that you suddenly showed up,

844
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,482
so I asked around.

845
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,901
I heard you took out a loan
and your parents kicked you out.

846
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,152
It was only a small amount.

847
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:11,779
I'm a doctor.
I'm going to pay it off soon.

848
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:14,032
Is that so? That's good to hear.

849
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,451
I don't have much time,
so let's cut to the chase.

850
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,828
I want my 5,000 dollars back.

851
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:21,539
It's been ages since we last met.
Let's not talk about money.

852
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,292
I'm talking about money
because it's been a long time.

853
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:27,212
Otherwise, I would've sued you.

854
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:29,464
I don't believe you.

855
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,841
I know how much you loved me.

856
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:33,718
You'll never sue me.

857
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,514
Yes. When you told me
your family was in a pickle

858
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,432
and asked me to lend you 5,000 dollars,

859
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:43,019
I liked you so much that I even gave you
money from my tuition.

860
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,103
Chan-sung.

861
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:48,107
Try to remember
how much you liked me back then.

862
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:52,028
First, let me calculate
how much you need to pay me back.

863
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,905
Gosh, I'll pay you back.

864
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,866
But I actually called you
because I really missed you.

865
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:58,576
It's so nice to see you again.

866
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,078
I guess you're still hopeless.

867
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,496
And it's still charming, isn't it?

868
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,165
Okay, fine.

869
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,255
That's enough. You have a bad stomach.

870
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,633
You haven't changed either.

871
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:18,680
Chan-sung, I heard you're single.

872
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:19,764
Just a second.

873
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:35,613
Excuse me!

874
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,323
Wait!

875
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,599
-Yes?
-Mr. Kim Jun-hyun.

876
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:03,808
Yes?

877
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,561
Can I get an autograph?

878
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:07,937
Sure.

879
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,815
You must have run here.

880
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,193
Wait. Let me borrow your back.

881
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,529
-My back?
-Yes. It has to be flat.

882
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,906
What's your name?

883
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,034
-It's Jang Man-wol.
-Jang Man-wol.

884
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,453
She's a huge fan.

885
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:27,290
Thank her for me. What a great name.

886
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:28,666
Okay.

887
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,169
Bye.

888
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,129
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

889
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,048
Can we take a photo too?

890
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,050
She doesn't trust people easily.

891
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:41,054
She doesn't trust people? I see.
Sure, let's take one.

892
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,639
People take photos these days.

893
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,516
How should I pose? All right.

894
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,560
One, two, three.

895
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,907
MS. JANG

896
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,077
I was just about to call you.

897
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:07,372
-I just met someone.
-Chan-sung.

898
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,416
Take the day off. Don't come.

899
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,045
What about our trip to the sea?

900
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:16,923
I can go to the sea at the hotel too.

901
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,716
It's all the same, anyway.

902
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,677
I don't have to go. Take the day off.

903
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:31,104
TO MS. JANG MAN-WOL, I LOVE YOU

904
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:04,906
You're here.

905
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:07,158
How did you find me here?

906
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,243
Yeon-u told me.

907
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:15,291
You should have told me first
if you found a good place like this.

908
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,293
Don't keep it to yourself.

909
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,670
It's a good place to drink alone.

910
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,506
Get lost.

911
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:44,338
Now do you realize
the view's got better than earlier?

912
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:51,178
They are just fireflies.
What's got better?

913
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:52,763
Of course it's better.

914
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:56,767
Earlier, you were alone.
But now, I'm here with you.

915
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:03,774
Every sight you see with me
will look different.

916
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:13,242
From now on, drinking alone here
won't make you happy.

917
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,870
Mark my words.

918
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:20,875
You'll be waiting for me
to suddenly show up like today.

919
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:55,553
The tree I'm growing
at Guest House of the Moon

920
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:58,097
used to be as stiff as a rock.

921
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:00,474
But it's starting to look pretty now.

922
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:06,105
I guess the man you sent is taking
good care of the tree.

923
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,315
You sent him there
because you thought he was the remedy,

924
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:09,817
but he might turn out to be poison.

925
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:15,656
Love can be one's remedy and poison.
That's how it is.

926
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,367
But it's so hard to weave them together.

927
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,872
Darn it. It's tangled again.

928
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:25,207
Darn it. What should I do?

929
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,293
Darn it. Goodness.

930
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:37,595
RICH BOY, DO YOU WANT
TO GRAB A SANDWICH WITH ME?

931
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:41,599
No. Asking a ghost to have
a sandwich with me sounds weird.

932
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,644
What should I say?

933
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,405
What was that?

934
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,908
That felt really creepy just now.

935
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:02,453
HEY, ANYTHING FUN THESE DAYS?

936
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:03,788
SOMEBODY, SEND ME SOME FUN STUFF

937
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,206
HERE

938
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:07,708
IT'S GOING VIRAL.
BUT IF YOU'RE SCARED, DON'T OPEN IT.

939
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,544
IT'S THE FAMOUS VIDEO? I DIDN'T WATCH IT.

940
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:12,254
He's trying to scare me.

941
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:20,930
Are you enjoying this?

942
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:22,890
You like this?

943
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:26,852
I'm hot, aren't I?

944
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:01,220
Ms. Jang is on the beach by herself?

945
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,597
Yes, she told me not to let anyone in.

946
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:26,787
Is this Weather Control Department?
I'm on the beach now.

947
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,455
The sun is too strong now!

948
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:30,291
I don't want 12 p.m.

949
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:34,962
How about around 6 p.m.?
Change the setting to sundown.

950
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,311
Whether the sun is blazing or goes down,

951
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:54,773
the beach looks the same.

952
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,361
I should ask them
to make the waves stronger.

953
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:02,656
The beach will still look the same.

954
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:06,577
Why are you here?

955
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:08,704
You refused to go to the beach with me.

956
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:14,543
Because...

957
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:17,046
I found it silly.

958
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:18,297
Silly?

959
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:20,174
You and your capricious mind.

960
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:23,093
I told you to rest.
What are you doing here?

961
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:25,554
I did something silly,

962
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,766
but I can't tell you what I did
because you might laugh at me.

963
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:30,768
What did you do?

964
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:34,230
-Don't laugh.
-I'm not in the mood. What is it?

965
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,531
TO MS. JANG MAN-WOL, I LOVE YOU.

966
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:51,538
Doesn't it make you happy?

967
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:55,709
"To Ms. Jang Man-wol, I love you"?

968
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:58,629
Are you confessing your love to me?

969
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:02,258
No! I didn't write this.

970
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:05,302
This is Kim Jun-hyun's autograph.
Here, "Kim Jun-hyun."

971
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,221
Kim Jun-hyun?

972
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:11,433
It's true.

973
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:14,061
I ran after him and asked him
for an autograph on the streets

974
01:11:14,144 --> 01:11:15,521
even though I was so embarrassed.

975
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:17,189
I thought it'd make you happy.

976
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:24,905
Are you not happy?

977
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,160
I am.

978
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:34,581
I love this.

979
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:40,879
I knew you'd like it.

980
01:11:43,757 --> 01:11:45,175
I felt so shy

981
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:47,428
about asking for an autograph.

982
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:57,313
It turns out this beach is as nice
as somewhere far.

983
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,815
Although there's no webfoot octopus here.

984
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:06,447
That's okay.

985
01:12:08,615 --> 01:12:10,117
Because you're here.

986
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:19,418
The sea looks really beautiful.

987
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,216
Yes, indeed.

988
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:31,055
It makes me sad.

989
01:12:42,232 --> 01:12:43,359
I'm...

990
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:47,654
a little sad.

991
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,369
Because the sea...

992
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,456
looks more beautiful now...

993
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,045
than it did earlier.

994
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:14,992
Since you can see my past,

995
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:18,871
you'll gradually find out
how much of a horrible person I was.

996
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,164
You can't do this here, sir.

997
01:14:20,914 --> 01:14:21,999
Just leave him be.

998
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:24,418
Kill her as much as you want
until you feel better.

999
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,670
Now... Pick one.

1000
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:28,213
Lee Mi-ra.

1001
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:29,840
I invited you to the hotel.

1002
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:31,884
It's not a place you can come in a dream.

1003
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:33,302
You can come only when you're dead.

1004
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:37,139
