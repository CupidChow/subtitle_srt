1
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,226
Chan-sung!

2
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,565
Don't look.

3
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,069
Don't let her hear your breathing.

4
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,737
But I hear--

5
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,323
Don't listen to it.

6
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,455
What's the matter?

7
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,006
She's the guest staying in this room.

8
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,843
You'll go mad if you see her.

9
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,222
Don't turn around.

10
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,600
Get out of here once the door opens.

11
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:39,659
Go.

12
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,388
Ma'am.

13
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,521
You won't ever be able
to step out of that door.

14
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,441
I apologize for waking you up.

15
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,569
Why don't you go back inside
and get some sleep?

16
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,590
I guess the smell of incense
made you go crazy.

17
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,432
You've been locked up
in that closet for such a long time.

18
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,560
And you still get angry
when you see a human being?

19
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,481
Do you want to go outside
and vent your anger again?

20
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,906
You're a guest here.

21
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,742
So I won't shove you in the closet.

22
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,827
You should quietly crawl back inside
on your own.

23
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,018
Koo Chan-sung.

24
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,313
Koo Chan-sung.

25
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,864
Koo Chan-sung.

26
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,076
Koo Chan-sung.

27
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,418
Koo Chan-sung.

28
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,964
Jang Man-wol?

29
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,758
Koo Chan-sung.

30
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,095
Koo Chan-sung.

31
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,558
Stop being stupid.

32
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,477
You don't know what a coward he is.

33
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,232
No matter how many times you call him,
he won't come back.

34
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,615
Chan-sung?

35
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,286
Jang Man-wol!

36
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:14,290
Was that Mr. Third Choice
who ran out at lightning speed?

37
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,836
Even if you look with one eye closed,
it's not Mr. Koo.

38
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,881
I thought so too.
The hair was all loose and wild.

39
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,591
It's the guest in Room 13.

40
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,302
She has left the hotel.

41
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,889
Our plan has failed. This is a disaster.

42
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,198
Chan-sung.

43
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,535
That thing is not here.

44
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,287
You can let me go.

45
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,927
You...

46
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,346
saw it, didn't you?

47
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:12,974
Just a glimpse.

48
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,645
So have you gone crazy?

49
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,480
I'm not crazy.

50
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,650
I was so frightened
that I can't calm myself down now.

51
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,279
What about you? Are you hurt?

52
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,656
Are you all right, Man-wol?

53
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,662
Chan-sung.

54
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,875
Were you scared?

55
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,837
I'm not hurt.

56
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,838
I'm fine.

57
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:46,841
Why you...

58
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,552
You've gone a little crazy.

59
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,220
I was just playing around.

60
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,015
Were you really scared?

61
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,562
Then, is it really true that you go mad

62
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,022
if you see that ghost?

63
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,733
I thought you said that just to scare me.

64
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,486
Yes, it's true.

65
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,030
If you had seen it properly,

66
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,948
you would've gone completely mad.

67
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,074
Really?

68
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,370
She's really left, right?

69
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,664
Yes, she ran away.

70
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,834
I thought you'd take care of it.
How could you let her go like that?

71
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,838
Well, I didn't know some coward
would muster up the courage

72
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,466
and come running in opening the door wide.

73
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,385
What a fool.

74
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,605
What...

75
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,858
Wait for me.

76
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,489
A coward?

77
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,575
Are you calling me a coward?

78
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,244
There's no one else here.

79
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,787
You're such a fool.

80
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,498
What... A fool?

81
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,750
Nobody ever called me that
in my whole life.

82
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,545
-I have an MBA from Harvard, and world--
-Shut up!

83
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,423
That's verbal violence.
Please rephrase it.

84
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,050
-Okay. Shut it.
-Are you joking?

85
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,135
-It's a ghost!
-Where?

86
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,220
You are a coward.

87
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,017
God... I thought there was really a ghost.

88
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,440
I must've made a mistake
while burning the incense. I apologize.

89
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,901
I'm glad you are safe.

90
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,031
Yes.

91
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,742
Ms. Choe, you should take
proper care of the rooms.

92
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,787
That dangerous guest could've harmed
our manager.

93
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,753
No, I'm sorry for worrying you.

94
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,847
Do you see how I just improvised that?

95
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:03,102
Mr. Third Choice has absolutely no idea
that we put him in that room on purpose.

96
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,270
I don't know.

97
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,397
You looked rather guilty.

98
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,026
I think Mr. Koo is a fool
for not noticing that.

99
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,029
Even if he is a fool, he will notice
when Ms. Fourth Choice comes.

100
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:17,074
I should tell Hyeon-jung to postpone
bringing in Ms. Fourth Choice.

101
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,927
Yu-na, what are you doing?

102
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,221
Get out of the way.

103
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,985
-Did you just see Yu-na?
-Yes.

104
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,279
I heard she's possessed
by Su-jeong's ghost.

105
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,530
I think it's true.

106
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,324
If you call out Su-jeong, she looks back.

107
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,825
-Really?
-Really?

108
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,327
-Let's go and see.
-Let's go.

109
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,829
-You call her name.
-She really looks back?

110
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,997
That's so weird.

111
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,085
Su-jeong.

112
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,546
It must be true.

113
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,756
-That's so scary.
-It's scary.

114
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,049
-What?
-What is this?

115
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,788
Goodness.

116
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,456
-What?
-What?

117
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,626
-What's happening?
-What is that?

118
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,598
What are you doing?

119
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,809
I didn't want you to get hurt,
so I caught you.

120
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,102
It can be painful.

121
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,729
If I got hurt,
they would've looked at me as a human.

122
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,523
Now, they will call me a monster.

123
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,695
Hey.

124
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,905
Wait for me.

125
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,074
She's getting mad at me for helping her.

126
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,038
You. How did you catch me?

127
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,708
Ghosts can't catch humans.

128
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,335
I'm not an average ghost.

129
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,093
There are prayer beads and amulets
in here.

130
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,803
So get lost, you evil ghost.

131
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,054
My friend.

132
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,266
I'm not a ghost that can be
exorcised by power of religion.

133
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,101
I have the right to stay in this world.

134
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,896
I have a place I belong to,
and I also have a job.

135
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,441
Don't make me laugh.
What kind of ghost has a job?

136
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,652
I'm a hotelier. I'm from Hotel del Luna.

137
00:12:59,028 --> 00:12:59,987
Hotel del Luna?

138
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,114
You know
the owner and manager of our hotel, right?

139
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,617
They helped you live in that body.

140
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,534
So what?

141
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,244
You want me to come out of this body?

142
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,665
You are a really precious person.

143
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,125
You're our precious hope.

144
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,253
You are Ms. Fourth Choice.

145
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,796
The fourth choice?

146
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,132
You are the fourth choice
for our hotel's manager.

147
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,801
Something has happened to
Mr. Third Choice,

148
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,553
so I've come to take you,
the fourth choice.

149
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,597
I don't know what you're talking about.

150
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,974
But you are here because you need me.

151
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,059
Yes.

152
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,189
A ghost even has a mobile phone?

153
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:38,442
Of course.
I have a job, so I also have a phone.

154
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,194
I told you I have a right to stay here.

155
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,781
Your school's Wi-Fi is good.

156
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,826
Mr. Third Choice is unharmed.
Ms. Fourth Choice will be deferred.

157
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,373
Are you saying you don't need me?

158
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,209
For now.
But I might be back to take you soon.

159
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,002
So...

160
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,672
keep studying hard at school.

161
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,676
Hey!

162
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,809
Give me your number.
I want to send texts to a ghost.

163
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,687
I've never shared my number with a human.

164
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,983
So you don't want to?

165
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,276
You can't?

166
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,320
Forget it then.

167
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,672
Okay. We're now friends.

168
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,182
The manager of Hotel del Luna?

169
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,184
Sounds fun.

170
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,695
Right.

171
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,280
Wait...

172
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,198
Mr. Ji?

173
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,244
I'm glad to see you
still in your right mind.

174
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,831
Thank you for being genuinely delighted.

175
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,044
It sounds as if you all expected

176
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,296
me to turn insane in that room.

177
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,380
Gosh.

178
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,883
You didn't, and that's all that matters.

179
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,226
Ms. Fourth Choice is on standby.

180
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,103
We also discussed

181
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,689
a couple of other ways
to get rid of Mr. Third Choice.

182
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,609
HOW TO ELIMINATE MR. THIRD CHOICE

183
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,861
First, we can send him

184
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,156
to the ghost stationed
at the haunted house in Shincheon-gun.

185
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,040
Thirty years is guaranteed

186
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,084
if he stays clear
of the local Grim Reaper.

187
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,924
Next, we can use a strong vengeful ghost

188
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,634
to have him die suddenly.

189
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,718
VENGEFUL GHOST IN UIJEONGBU

190
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,223
He's an experienced killer
operating in Uijeongbu.

191
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,392
Since he's close by, we can easily--

192
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,686
No, just drop it.

193
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,111
Chan-sung isn't going anywhere.

194
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,654
I'm keeping him by my side.

195
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,240
What if the tree keeps transforming?

196
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,909
Mago sent him here on purpose.

197
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,911
You must drive him out.

198
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,707
If he was really sent by a deity,

199
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,751
then just chasing him out
won't solve anything.

200
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,461
What if flowers blossom?

201
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,380
Flowers?

202
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,425
Let them blossom.

203
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,760
Will there be a day

204
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,723
when colorful flowers blossom and
I willingly walk across the Samdo River?

205
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,642
We'll wait and see.

206
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,573
Do you think she's had a change of heart
and is ready to go to the other world?

207
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,035
No, I think she probably doesn't believe

208
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,037
that flowers will really blossom.

209
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,538
If that was the case,

210
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,541
she shouldn't have agreed
to let him in Room 13.

211
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,960
Her and her mood swings.

212
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:29,298
I'm just glad that Mr. Koo
isn't the perceptive type.

213
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:34,428
It'll be awkward if he figures out
that we led him there on purpose.

214
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,391
You sent me to that room
on purpose, didn't you?

215
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,976
You wanted me to die or lose my mind.

216
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,063
You're not as dumb as I thought.
You're right.

217
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,399
Everyone's disappointed
that you didn't go crazy.

218
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,863
How can you all do this to me?

219
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,241
I truly thought of you as my colleagues

220
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,910
and started to like you guys.

221
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,621
Isn't this considered as harassment?

222
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,582
So? Are you here to tattle on them?

223
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,542
Should I give them an earful?

224
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,961
What's the point when you were in on it?

225
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,009
You always ask questions
even though you know the answer.

226
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,261
What a weirdo.

227
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,264
Wait.

228
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,308
Where did it go?

229
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,103
Chan-sung,

230
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,438
I lost one of the earrings.

231
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,315
Check the floor for me.

232
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:29,983
Seriously?

233
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,622
Just let it slide.

234
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,998
They're simply jealous

235
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,167
because you're still alive
when they're not.

236
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,961
How dumb do you think I am?

237
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,629
What was this really about?

238
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,134
The tree changed after you came here.

239
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,763
We're worried
that our time to leave is near.

240
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,777
Why did you save me though?

241
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,946
If you hadn't, I would've gone crazy.

242
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,739
I wasn't going to intervene,

243
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,075
but a leaf changed my mind.

244
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,451
A leaf?

245
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,207
-This one?
-Yes.

246
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,544
That small leaf bothered me.

247
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,090
Are you saying,

248
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,010
I won your heart by this much?

249
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,928
You're doing it again!

250
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,806
Asking questions
when you know the answer...

251
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,600
Do they teach you that at Harvard?

252
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,811
Asking questions to induce an answer
can lead to determining the truth.

253
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,605
It's a known method by Socrates.

254
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,024
That's what the professors
at Harvard taught me.

255
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:55,360
But this isn't Harvard,
so just get back to finding my earring.

256
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,113
Is finding it worth another leaf?

257
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,156
Why you...

258
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,491
Don't bother looking for it.

259
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,535
If you find it, I'll kill you.

260
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,917
You say you'll kill me,
but you don't mean it.

261
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,252
You say you're not looking for it,
but you want to.

262
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,089
I know you're cynical,
but your words are even more cynical.

263
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,800
Is it because you've been living
as a ghost for too long?

264
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,303
No, I was born this way.

265
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,222
I've always been cynical.

266
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,640
Did you not catch that in your dream?

267
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,017
You were nice and kind.

268
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,894
Me? Seriously?

269
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,521
Yes, you cared for him with affection.

270
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,734
His name was Yeon-u, I think.

271
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,078
So you saw him too.

272
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,333
I did.

273
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,087
Yeon-u!

274
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,430
You called his name with love,

275
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,017
which is why it got stuck in my head.

276
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,561
Why?

277
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,773
Do you think you might be him?

278
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,194
The thought crossed my mind,

279
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,071
but it doesn't seem likely.

280
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,366
Yeon-u was...

281
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:29,204
the one who loved me the most.

282
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,375
Do you love me too?

283
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,648
I'm certain that I don't.

284
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,237
Leave then.

285
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,360
Yeon-u.

286
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,120
Man-wol.

287
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,045
With this tree you love,

288
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,757
I'll build the biggest house
that anyone has ever seen.

289
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,883
And you can have it.

290
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:06,927
What?

291
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,596
You'll build a house for me
with this tree?

292
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,765
Forget it.

293
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,059
I don't plan on building a house
and living with you.

294
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:19,064
We all grow old.
You should think about putting down roots.

295
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:23,068
I can't let you live under a tarp
when you become an old lady.

296
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,572
I could be captured and killed
at any moment. That's my life.

297
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,410
I don't even expect to live until I'm old.

298
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,954
But you can.

299
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,289
The fortune teller said

300
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,292
that I'll live a long life
just like this tree.

301
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,213
I'm expected to live 100 years,
so I'll give you my extra years.

302
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,758
If you do, you'll die.

303
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:48,927
You're right.

304
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,012
It's okay, though.

305
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,723
I don't mind dying for you,

306
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,517
so you can have it all.

307
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,829
This will find a human groom

308
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,332
for your dead daughter.

309
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:01,893
Whoever finds the red pocket
that holds the deceased's desires

310
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,146
shall be her soul's partner.

311
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:13,405
I hope that pocket will
find us a good man.

312
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,615
Su-min.

313
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,827
We're getting you married

314
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,496
so that you don't get lonely.

315
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,293
No!

316
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,004
I don't want to get married to a stranger.

317
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,268
You're getting off early today.

318
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,021
Yes, I'm a bit tired.

319
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,315
Well, you're the type
who makes more work for yourself.

320
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,275
It is my job to tend to the guests

321
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,860
as a hotelier.

322
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,778
I guess you've changed your mindset.

323
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,864
I thought you hated our hotel.

324
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,910
Because I won...

325
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,912
someone's heart.

326
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,291
I'm actually a bit of a softie,

327
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,126
so I repay favors by ten times the amount.

328
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,338
-Sorry?
-That means if you're nice to me,

329
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,006
I'll treat you really well.

330
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,759
So please be nice to me.

331
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,933
Did he figure anything out?

332
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,226
What did he say?

333
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,812
He used sarcasm to threaten me.

334
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,191
He said he repays favors
by ten times the amount.

335
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,695
I knew Mago wouldn't bring an easy one.

336
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,637
Are you visiting the hotel, ma'am?

337
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,139
Please help me.

338
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,312
Are you all right, ma'am?

339
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,941
You think this is the front desk?

340
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,445
Why do you keep taking the guests
to my office instead of their rooms?

341
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:18,822
She has her reasons.

342
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,116
Every ghost has their reasons.

343
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,244
And what's wrong with her? Is she drunk?

344
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,579
She's exhausted
from roaming around too much.

345
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:31,876
Ma'am, you can't do this to our employee.

346
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,294
I am okay with it.

347
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,800
Fine, then. Go ahead and hug her tight.

348
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,182
She's being forced into a marriage.

349
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,810
She doesn't want to get married
to a complete stranger,

350
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,896
and she doesn't want
to get a living person possessed.

351
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,066
Is it a ghost wedding?

352
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:02,699
It's for those who are still alive.
Why don't you just go along with it?

353
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,917
You can go up to your room
and think it over again.

354
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,003
Our hotel even has a wedding hall.

355
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,839
If you pay the price,
we can even hold a party for you.

356
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,258
Go ahead and think about it.

357
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,263
Why don't you go up to your room?

358
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,402
This won't do. Excuse me.

359
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,656
Gosh.

360
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,501
Chan-sung.

361
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,296
I see you're strong enough to carry her.

362
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,925
And you used a handcart meant for cabbages
to carry me.

363
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,227
A ghost wedding...

364
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,871
That guest was wearing
a Vera Wang wedding dress.

365
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,998
That means she's from a rich family.

366
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,878
-Get ready for the wedding.
-Yes, ma'am.

367
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,173
Then I'll need to get a new dress.

368
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,260
And I'll need new jewelry too.

369
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,428
Shoes, a purse,

370
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,805
and what else will I need?

371
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,975
Gosh, there's so much to prepare.

372
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,937
Chan-sung should

373
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,024
hurry up and get that money
for the Baekdu Mountain painting.

374
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,188
Good morning!

375
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,107
Good morning, Sanchez.

376
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,358
You're up?

377
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,277
I guess you got some sleep last night.

378
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,530
Yes, I slept well.
I didn't even dream this time.

379
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,742
Maybe it was because I was tired.

380
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,453
Did you buy a lottery ticket?
You want to have a lucky dream?

381
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,748
No, I was expecting someone in my dreams.

382
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,207
Your ex-girlfriend?

383
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,754
The ex-boyfriend of a girl I know.

384
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,881
Or her ex-boyfriends.

385
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,509
It's not a dream,
but you missed a call from your friend.

386
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,677
My friend?

387
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,471
Who?

388
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,513
Man-wol.

389
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,225
Who?

390
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,352
Man-wol, from your hotel.

391
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,562
Your phone kept ringing,
so I just answered it.

392
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,897
Man-wol

393
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,608
told me to ask you
when you'd get the money for the painting.

394
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,526
Sanchez,

395
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,781
did you really call her by her name,
Man-wol?

396
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,367
Didn't she get mad and yell at you?

397
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:36,788
She agreed to call me by my name too.
Just Sanchez.

398
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,248
We're even following each other
on our social media.

399
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,834
You know what? She's actually

400
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:45,004
quite friendly and polite. Right?

401
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,965
Maybe it's because of her job?

402
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,969
It seemed like she's used to being polite.

403
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:59,435
She must have known
that Sanchez is really rich.

404
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,897
That's why he was unharmed.

405
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,569
"Man-wol"?

406
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,406
-Put it right there.
-Yes, ma'am.

407
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,450
Hyeon-jung, you said
you know how to play the piano, right?

408
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:15,660
Practice.

409
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:16,744
Yes, ma'am.

410
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,455
It's been so long since we had a party.
I'm so excited.

411
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,666
It's better to have many guests
for the party,

412
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,377
so should I invite some guests
who are free?

413
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,754
You think it'll look like a wedding

414
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,590
if there are tons of ghosts in here?
It'll seem like a funeral.

415
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,592
As few as possible.

416
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,221
Yes, ma'am.
By the way, have we found the groom yet?

417
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:38,224
If some unlucky human
finds that red pocket,

418
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,642
he'll be the groom, I suppose.

419
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:43,187
The bride doesn't seem to want
an arranged marriage like this.

420
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,689
Mr. Koo went to find the red pocket,

421
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,483
so he could return it to her parents
and talk them out of it.

422
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,070
There won't be a wedding
if he finds it first, right?

423
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,909
Chan-sung left to find the red pocket?

424
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:00,288
Yes, he's very diligent,
so he's probably looking for it already.

425
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,416
If he finds it, it'll cause trouble.

426
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,251
Why?

427
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:11,340
Will he become the groom

428
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,301
if he finds it first?

429
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,971
He's been caring so much about ghosts.
Now he's going to marry one.

430
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,724
The bride didn't want to get married
to a complete stranger.

431
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,393
But I bet she'll be okay
with marrying Mr. Koo.

432
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,103
That's good news, Ms. Jang.

433
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,651
Ms. Jang, are you going to let him
get married?

434
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,778
Darn you!

435
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,093
I heard the red pocket fell
somewhere near the lake.

436
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,103
Chan-sung, you're still looking for it?

437
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,606
What are you looking for?
I'll help you find it.

438
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,857
No, it's okay.

439
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,069
Don't mind me, and carry on.
You should ride another lap.

440
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,654
It's going to rain soon.

441
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,782
Then I'll go for one more lap.
Let's go home once I'm done.

442
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,783
Okay.

443
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,768
What are you doing here?

444
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,562
Can't you see?

445
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,480
I'm on a picnic.

446
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,233
Why are you on a picnic? It's hot outside.

447
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,403
Fine.

448
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:59,115
Let me answer the question
that you already know the answer to.

449
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,825
I'm here to see you.

450
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,661
I don't want you to look
for that red pocket.

451
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:04,954
Just leave it.

452
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,665
Are you worried
I might have to marry her if I find it?

453
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,420
Chan-sung, I'm against this marriage.

454
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,963
I can't accept it.

455
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,632
Just let some other guy pick it up.

456
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,093
She doesn't want to marry
someone she doesn't know.

457
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,679
Whoever picks it up
will get startled. If I find it,

458
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,347
you'll take care of it for me.

459
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,145
You think I'll have your back?
Is that why you're being reckless?

460
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,863
Are you using that to find it?

461
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,866
Can you see where it is?

462
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:50,625
I see it.

463
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,588
What's wrong with the bike?

464
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,650
I found it.

465
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:20,446
Chan-sung, you'll get to eat
at your friend's wedding.

466
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,166
Sanchez!

467
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,562
What is this?

468
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,907
What the hell?

469
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,581
Sanchez!

470
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,216
Where is he?

471
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,780
Sanchez, are you okay?

472
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,908
I don't know if it's because of the rain,
but it's really cold.

473
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,535
And maybe because of the rain,

474
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,204
I saw something really weird.

475
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,208
Chan-sung, I saw a strange woman

476
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,627
in our house earlier.

477
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,506
And I think she's still here.
I'm so scared.

478
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,673
What should I do?

479
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,509
Sanchez.

480
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,895
You should go inside and get some sleep.

481
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,438
Let me figure this out.

482
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:08,906
Hello?

483
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,826
Are you Mr. Koo,
the manager at Hotel del Luna?

484
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,745
Yes, that's me.

485
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,497
I got a call from that hotel

486
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,041
saying they'd like to hold a wedding
for Su-min.

487
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,767
Did you say you got a call
from the owner of our hotel?

488
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,186
Yes.

489
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,151
Are you here because of this?

490
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:56,078
I didn't know
there was a hotel like this in Seoul.

491
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,126
Welcome.

492
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,671
I see that our manager
safely brought you here.

493
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:11,385
Now, let's start discussing
the wedding in earnest.

494
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,597
Come this way.

495
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,060
This is where the wedding will take place.

496
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,229
We can prepare a banquet

497
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,941
and provide a suite for her
just like any other wedding.

498
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:30,613
If you can do that, Su-min won't end up
dying a lonely soul.

499
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,782
Please prepare the best of everything.

500
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,534
We're doing this for our child.

501
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,995
We'll pay and give you
anything that's necessary.

502
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:42,041
By the way, who's the groom?

503
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,544
You're forcing him to marry her
against his will.

504
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:49,673
Don't you think you'd feel awkward
to meet the groom?

505
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,760
Are you going to congratulate him
or something?

506
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,554
Then I guess it'd be best not to meet him.

507
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,556
We'll entrust you with everything.

508
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,143
We'll do our best to prepare a wedding

509
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,978
that will satisfy everyone.

510
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:15,491
I knew they'd be rich.

511
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,952
This is a black card that has no limit.

512
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,831
Parents really have no limit
when it comes to loving their kids.

513
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,085
This is my cup of tea.

514
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,257
What are you planning to do?

515
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,510
I'm going to prepare a wedding.

516
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,555
Sanchez got really shocked.

517
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,931
He's practically stupefied.

518
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,559
It's because he's weak-hearted.

519
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:45,145
That's why we should hold a wedding
and make her leave as soon as possible.

520
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:48,649
Is Sanchez really going to be okay
once the wedding's over?

521
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,693
Yes.

522
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,987
It's not like they're going
to register their marriage.

523
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,115
Just think of it as a short nightmare.

524
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,036
There's so much to prepare.
We'll get so busy.

525
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,871
Chan-sung, let's hurry.

526
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,588
I wonder if this is
really going to be okay.

527
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,020
God, I want to pee so bad.

528
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,690
I'm about to burst,
but I'm too scared to go to the bathroom.

529
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,734
When is Chan-sung coming home?

530
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,157
Actually, no.

531
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,285
It's okay. I can do it.

532
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,221
So we were hurrying to go shopping?

533
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:45,057
It's a wedding after all.
It should look sparkly.

534
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,611
Are we here to buy wedding gifts?

535
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,948
Are these necessary for this wedding?

536
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,616
This one looks nice too.

537
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,369
Why do we only have ten fingers?

538
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,121
I wish I could put on more than ten.

539
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,998
Are we here to buy your rings?

540
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,917
You said we should hurry for Sanchez.

541
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,919
This is no time to look at rings.

542
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:16,296
I got my hands on a credit card
without a limit.

543
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:20,384
If you're going to nag, go wait outside.

544
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:33,480
I only have one neck,
so I can only wear one necklace.

545
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,691
Wearing several necklaces
is becoming a thing.

546
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,193
I like that.

547
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:39,903
Bring me some more.

548
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:46,285
Her parents didn't give you a credit card
to pay for your jewelry.

549
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:47,786
It's meant to be used for the wedding.

550
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,373
Exactly. I'm using their money
for the wedding.

551
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:56,044
The more money I use for this wedding,

552
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,838
the more relieved they will feel.

553
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,716
Did you arrange the wedding
so you could do this?

554
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,968
I'll return the credit card
and burn up the pocket.

555
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:03,969
Go ahead.

556
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,637
If you do that, your friend

557
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,724
will have to live
the rest of his life with the ghost bride.

558
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,519
The red pocket encompasses
a strong desire.

559
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,646
That desire tied them together
with a red thread,

560
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,231
so that they're forced to be together.

561
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,774
If you burn the pocket,

562
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,360
the bride will never get to go
to the afterlife.

563
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,781
Can't you just cut their tie?

564
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,451
I'm not the almighty.
Do you know how hard that is?

565
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:31,455
We'll just have them get married,
then send the bride to the afterlife.

566
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,457
That's what our hotel can do.

567
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,959
Ma'am, please come to this side.

573
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:39,856
Ma'am.

574
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,197
You're really here.

575
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:51,952
Who are you?

576
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:53,704
I'm...

577
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,331
I'm Koo Chan-sung from Hotel del Luna.

578
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,835
You told me to come here to look for you
when we met on the subway.

579
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,551
That wasn't me.

580
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,928
That was my eldest sister.

581
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,973
Hey!

582
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:17,477
The weather outside is amazing!

583
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,188
Who are you?

584
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,610
He came from Hotel del Luna
to find our eldest sister.

585
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,279
Hotel del Luna?

586
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:30,073
Our sister goes there often
to pick flowers, doesn't she?

587
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,035
Are you twins?

588
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,746
I mean, triplets?

589
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,876
There are more than three of us.

590
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:46,006
Why are you asking for our sister anyway?

591
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,141
There will be a ghost wedding
at Hotel del Luna?

592
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:59,353
The bride doesn't want a wedding
she never asked for,

593
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,229
and the groom is shivering in fear.

594
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,648
Is there a way to fix this?

595
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,318
Like what your boss said,

596
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,445
it'd be best to do the wedding

597
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:11,615
for the sake of those who are alive.

598
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,369
I guess we don't have a choice
but to hold the wedding.

599
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,914
I know! We could switch the groom.

600
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,582
Instead of someone living,

601
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,002
you could find someone dead as her groom.

602
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,631
Where are we going to find a dead groom?

603
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:31,468
You have a lot of guests at your hotel.

604
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,345
You're right.

605
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,513
Right?

606
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:38,684
The bride can choose a groom she likes

607
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,936
to give the red pocket.

608
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,772
The two ghosts can get together

609
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,942
and head over to the afterlife,
holding hands.

610
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:49,027
Yes, I'll try that.

611
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,946
Thank you. I'll get going.

612
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,078
Hey.

613
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,123
You must be tired from working at night.

614
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,458
You probably can't sleep well.

615
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:07,087
Try this one. I'm sure it'll help.

616
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,386
It's herb tonic tea.

617
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,637
Thank you.

618
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:26,481
I think she likes you.

619
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:29,109
That's precious medicine.

620
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:33,280
You'll feel energetic
even from a short nap.

621
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,531
Really?

622
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,117
Thank you.

623
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,330
Great.

624
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,667
I narrowed it down to guests
who died before getting married.

625
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,793
Okay.

626
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:50,547
I better visit them one by one
to ask if they're interested.

627
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,466
Let's start with Room 507.

628
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,307
I'm sorry to interrupt.

629
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,935
But are you interested
in going on a blind date?

630
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,066
We'll now start the date
between Ms. Lee Su-min

631
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,777
and her five prospect grooms.

632
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,657
Why are you sitting there?

633
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,659
Because I want to get married too.

634
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,745
Employees can't participate.
Get back here.

635
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:22,746
What?

636
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:23,872
Get over here.

637
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,248
What?

638
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,502
I even got changed for this.
This is unfair.

639
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,629
We'll start over again.

640
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,048
Due to the time limit,
we'll make it short.

641
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,801
Please greet each other
while the hourglass is running.

642
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,677
Tell her about what you did
when you were alive.

643
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,806
I hope you'll get to have
sincere conversations.

644
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:54,903
Gosh, Chan-sung is wasting his time again.

645
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,451
At least,
the bride will get to marry a groom

646
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,578
whom she can connect better with.

647
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:07,165
I don't know. I doubt there will be
a man the bride likes.

648
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,421
I like this one.

649
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,513
As you might have noticed,

650
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:24,015
my friend has a weak heart
and won't be able to do the wedding.

651
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,271
You should choose one of them
to leave for the afterlife together.

652
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,064
It's the best I can do for you.

653
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,243
Please make sure to keep time, everyone.

654
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,370
We'll start with the table number one.

655
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:49,249
Please give the red pocket
to the person you like.

656
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,376
Let's begin.

657
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:33,919
Please take it.

658
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:37,339
If I have a wedding with one of them,
I must go with him.

659
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,007
I want to go alone.

660
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:42,510
I want you, a human, to take it
so I can do that.

661
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:45,555
But...

662
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,976
If you won't,
I'll just stick to the original plan.

663
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,103
Please bring your friend.

664
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,384
What?

665
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,679
Who did she pick as her husband again?

666
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,764
She said she wants
to have a wedding with Mr. Koo.

667
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:30,392
Mr. Koo accepted it,
so they are getting ready now.

668
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,606
Will you be the officiant?

669
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,691
Hyeon-jung,

670
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,110
go to Ms. Fourth Choice right now.

671
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,319
Why?

672
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,240
Are you going to send Mr. Koo

673
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,034
to the afterlife together with the bride?

674
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,678
I don't even know what I'm doing now.

675
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,308
Okay.

676
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,436
Let's just think this is a dream.

677
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,563
This is just a meaningless dream.

678
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,690
Everything will be gone once I wake up.

679
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,247
All right.

680
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,751
I'm just going to have a short dream.

681
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,239
Ms. Jang, are you getting married?

682
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:51,783
What?

683
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,119
Aren't you the one getting married?

684
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,955
GROOM'S ROOM

685
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,504
I guess I had a dream just now.

686
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,630
Chan-sung.

687
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:08,383
How dare you decide to get married
without my permission?

688
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:11,177
Why do I need your permission
when I'm the one getting married?

689
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,889
So are you really going to marry her?

690
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:17,434
This is why you should have helped her
when she came to you,

691
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,185
saying she didn't want to get married.

692
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:24,023
Do you think she doesn't
want to get married?

693
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:28,403
No way. She's a ghost
that is mad about getting married.

694
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:35,368
The strong desires sealed here

695
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,328
belong to that woman who will never leave

696
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:38,663
before she gets married.

697
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:58,683
What a beautiful bride.

698
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:06,274
I heard there's a wedding
at Hotel del Luna, and I came by.

699
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:14,782
This is my wedding gift for the bride.

700
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:27,879
You get married to become happy.

701
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,137
Chan-sung.

702
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,016
I'll save you again.

703
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,018
You don't have to have
the unwanted wedding.

704
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:45,688
Then what do I do with this?
You said this can't be removed.

705
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,900
We should let her
have a wedding as she wishes.

706
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:53,196
I'm going to bring her real groom
whom she can never...

707
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:55,949
leave behind.

708
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,173
This lady is your girlfriend, right?

709
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,764
Your girlfriend is marrying
some other guy.

710
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,517
Hey, that's not funny.

711
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,520
I'm not kidding.
If you want to stop the wedding,

712
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,397
you need to go marry her.

713
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,046
The groom that you actually want to marry,

714
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,090
I brought him here.

715
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,179
We have such a great customer service,
don't we?

716
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:03,182
It looks like you can finally marry

717
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:06,311
the person you never got over
even after you died.

718
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,231
You must be

719
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:12,567
very happy.

720
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,074
He should be here any minute now.

721
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,718
Su-min.

722
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,127
When the wedding is over,

723
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:38,880
the man will die.

724
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:51,684
The bride will take her man
to the afterlife with her.

725
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,857
I wonder if Chan-sung noticed.

726
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:20,379
That's why the man's parents
tried to marry her off to anyone

727
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,298
through a ghost wedding.

728
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:26,010
The man's parents?
They weren't the bride's parents?

729
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,514
It was the man's parents
who requested to hold the wedding.

730
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:33,434
They were afraid the woman
would take their son with her.

731
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,858
Su-min is dead.

732
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,569
I can't let you go with her.

733
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:57,416
Why doesn't it come off?

734
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:02,463
Su-min, please let my son go. Please...

735
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,299
Please let him go!

736
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:38,541
Ms. Lee, stop. You shouldn't do this.

737
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,021
Let's be together forever.

738
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,912
Ms. Lee, he's still alive.

739
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,288
Stop right now!

740
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:20,541
Ms. Lee!

741
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:45,566
No.

742
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:51,238
We must stop.

743
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:53,908
Go back.

744
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,577
What's the matter, Su-min?

745
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:58,996
Go!

746
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:07,880
Su-min.

747
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,268
It's hard,

748
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:48,105
but sometimes it's easier
to let go than hold on.

749
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,501
I love you.

750
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,839
Please be happy.

751
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,455
This place looks cooler than I imagined.

752
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,165
I'll start working
as the manager right away.

753
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:13,584
You can't yet. We have Mr. Koo.

754
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:15,211
Then I'll be the intern for now.

755
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:17,296
Let me start training as an intern.

756
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:20,299
Listen, friend.

757
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:22,384
It's getting late.

758
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:26,347
You should go home to sleep
so you can go to school tomorrow.

759
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:28,682
Hey.

760
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:30,517
Hey.

761
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,447
I'm sorry I used you in such a vulgar way.

762
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:46,242
I'm sure you haven't survived
since the Tang Dynasty

763
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,326
to be used that way.

764
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:50,723
Mi-ra.

765
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:55,477
It's been a while.
I'm here to see Chan-sung.

766
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:05,279
Thank you for helping me
cut the tie before I leave.

767
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:07,573
I hope your journey will be comfortable.

768
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:17,124
Those scissors are
from the third crone, right?

769
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,711
Did she come to my hotel
without me knowing?

770
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:23,255
He's the one who went to see Mago.

771
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,593
Now the crones are all helping
Chan-sung together?

772
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:30,054
You're the one that Mago is helping.

773
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:35,684
He'll be the one to see you off.

774
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:52,302
I felt proud to see my guests off
at my previous hotel,

775
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:55,764
but I feel lonely here.

776
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:59,518
That's because you won't ever see them
again.

777
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:04,022
Chan-sung.

778
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:06,900
You're doing a good job.

779
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:10,195
Mago was right about you.

780
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:12,030
I get why she likes you.

781
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,117
Did you know I met with her?

782
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:22,666
She told me to take good care of you,

783
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,085
so that leaves will grow

784
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,171
and flowers will bloom.

785
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:32,593
You...

786
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,180
Do you still see me in your dreams?

787
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:58,202
Yes.

788
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:04,833
I hope you keep it up
and take good care of me

789
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:07,085
and then...

790
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,588
see me off.

791
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:11,924
That's what Mago wants.

792
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:21,099
I'll become your last guest

793
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:24,144
because you are my cup of tea.

794
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:35,697
Chan-sung.

795
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:40,285
When you see me off,

796
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:44,122
don't feel lonely.

797
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,272
He's not answering his phone.

798
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:51,356
What did you say?

799
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,275
Your Majesty!

800
01:16:53,358 --> 01:16:55,110
He's dressed like a king of Joseon.

801
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:56,403
Which one is he?

802
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,447
I'm really worried about you.

803
01:16:58,530 --> 01:16:59,698
Why are you doing this to me?

804
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:01,908
Because I cannot have you reincarnated
as a dog or a pig.

805
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:03,493
You could get kicked out at this rate--

806
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:04,745
You're doing a great job.

807
01:17:04,828 --> 01:17:06,705
One, two, three, we can do it!

808
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:08,206
I hate being poor.

809
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,709
I'm going to keep eating
caviar and champagne.

810
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:11,877
He has a girlfriend?

811
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,587
-I have her picture.
-Forget it. Don't tell me.

812
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:15,130
Why are you telling me that?

813
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:16,340
Is she pretty?

814
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,468
