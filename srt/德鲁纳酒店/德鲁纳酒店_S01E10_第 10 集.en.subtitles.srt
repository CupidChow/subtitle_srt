1
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,963
You know what this is, don't you?

2
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,465
It looks like a medicine.

3
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,009
I thought it was strange
why Mago would suddenly give this to me.

4
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,720
You asked her to give it to me, right?

5
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,139
Think what you want.

6
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,684
Chan-sung.

7
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,270
I'll pray for your safety.

8
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,108
No.

9
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,198
I will get in danger
to make you feel uncomfortable.

10
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:15,867
What?

11
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,208
Chan-sung!
Do you know how precious that is?

12
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,920
Do you know
how much I had to beg to get that?

13
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,046
Jang Man-wol!

14
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,090
No place is safe for me anymore.

15
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,221
I will keep getting on your nerves
and get in danger.

16
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,305
You must...

17
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,768
keep protecting me.

18
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,198
Does this medicine belong to you?

19
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,250
It's yours, isn't it?

20
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:10,171
Why would you pick it up
and give it back to me now?

21
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,842
I thought you dropped it,
so I brought it back as a thank-you.

22
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,970
Thank you.

23
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,223
You brought back something
that's very precious.

24
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,309
You may go ahead and rest.

25
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,858
Isn't this something
that will help you get rid of your fears?

26
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,152
Well, yes.

27
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,946
Then, I hope you take it and feel at ease.

28
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,663
See?

29
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,499
Even the deity says
you should take the medicine.

30
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,252
He's very slow-witted.

31
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:52,755
He's giving you advice as someone
who ran away and found peace.

32
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,132
Eat it.

33
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,511
You must've forgotten something.

34
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,514
If you get attacked by a ghost that holds
a deep grudge, you could even die.

35
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,976
You almost died recently because of me.

36
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,354
Don't get yourself in trouble.
Just live peacefully.

37
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,398
Eat it.

38
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,108
If I eat that,

39
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,321
I won't be able to see you anymore.

40
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,119
You also must've forgotten something.

41
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,705
I can see through you.

42
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,554
If I don't take care of you,

43
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,557
you'll only end up becoming more spiteful.

44
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,392
I'd rather get myself in trouble

45
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,062
and stop you from ending up that way.

46
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,189
I...

47
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,150
I can't let that...

48
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,111
happen to you.

49
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,538
So,

50
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,918
I'm going to stay beside you
and keep an eye on you.

51
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,464
Mr. Koo Chan-sung?

52
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,550
What is it this time?

53
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,056
What brings you to my father's villa?

54
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,818
You asked my father for a favor
back when he was alive?

55
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,989
Yes, he let me borrow the pond
in his botanical garden.

56
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,368
Did you set free a pet fish or something?

57
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,288
It's something very special.
It'll give out a lot of good energy.

58
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,834
My father told me about you
a couple of times before he passed away.

59
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,669
That you helped him out a lot.

60
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,506
We're here to take care of his belongings.

61
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,757
I see.

62
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,844
BAEKGU

63
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,098
This is mine.

64
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,768
I spent a lot of time with him here
when I was a kid.

65
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,104
-Mom.
-Yes?

66
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:16,024
Look what I found in this book.

67
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,321
My goodness, when was this?

68
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,906
Father looks so young in this photo.

69
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,328
I miss him so much.

70
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,746
If you want,

71
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,957
you can write a letter and give it to me.

72
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,792
The hotel I work at provides

73
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,795
a special service where you can send
letters to the ones you miss.

74
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,438
I thought you would've already left,
but I guess you waited for me.

75
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,565
Because I don't like driving.

76
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,905
If you don't like driving,
why did you buy so many cars?

77
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,281
Because they're pretty.

78
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,077
I'm going to buy
every single car you sold.

79
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,161
With what money?

80
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,121
You said you're willing
to go through trouble,

81
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,873
so let me be a little cheap
while I'm at it.

82
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,500
Give me the painting of Baekdu Mountain.

83
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,506
Do you think I'll give that to you?
That was my severance pay.

84
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,550
I just dropped it at your place.
It's mine, so give it back.

85
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,138
There's a famous restaurant nearby
that once aired on TV.

86
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,515
Let's go there.

87
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,850
A famous restaurant?

88
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,938
It must be baffling to hear me
talk about food in this situation.

89
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,023
You must be feeling furious.

90
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,442
That's exactly how I felt.

91
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,570
Let's go.

92
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,789
If we don't get to the restaurant
before it closes because of you,

93
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,085
that painting of Baekdu Mountain

94
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,462
will never be yours.

95
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:19,480
Your favorite celebrity,
Kim Jun-hyun, came here as well.

96
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,944
Oh, right. You should take a photo.

97
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,489
THE GUYS WHO DIED AFTER EATING

98
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,037
I'LL VISIT EVERY FAMOUS RESTAURANT
IN THIS COUNTRY

99
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:41,419
There aren't any naengmyeon restaurants

100
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,171
or any shopping malls around here.

101
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,922
Why don't you just
come back to Myeong-dong?

102
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,632
This place is too far away from my house.

103
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,968
Just work at the hotel
you used to work at.

104
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,012
The owner of that hotel

105
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,723
seemed very fond of you earlier.

106
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,852
I'm just interested in being liked
by my current boss.

107
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,979
And to make that happen,

108
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,316
I'm going to challenge myself.

109
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,530
Promise that you'll reinstate me
if I eat this in one bite.

110
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,949
Are you serious?

111
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,996
Kim Jun-hyun can eat
the entire thing in one bite.

112
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,456
You're no match for him.

113
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,626
You'll never be able to do it.

114
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,549
Just give me my job back if I succeed.

115
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,640
Don't even bother.

116
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,268
I don't watch his shows anymore.

117
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,066
You used to like him so much.
You abandoned him as well?

118
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,150
Yes.

119
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,611
So if you succeed,

120
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,864
you should become a comedian
instead of coming back to my hotel.

121
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,994
Is it that easy to give up?

122
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,663
No, not really.

123
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:03,167
He's on almost every TV channel.

124
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,340
I hope the food here
tastes really horrible

125
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,968
so that I'll never think of it again.

126
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,874
THE GUYS WHO DIED AFTER EATING

127
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,033
I told you to park the car and go.
Why are you following me?

128
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,701
To make it hard for you

129
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,578
to give up on me.

130
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,583
But right now,
I'm here to meet the chairman.

131
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,668
His granddaughter asked me
to give this to him.

132
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,919
I'll give it to him.

133
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,213
No, how can I trust you?

134
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,382
I'll give it to him myself.

135
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,427
I'm the owner of this hotel,
and you recently got fired.

136
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,012
Ms. Jang.

137
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,475
Mr. Koo, I see you also came to work.

138
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,311
He's not the manager here.
He's just visiting.

139
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,063
Go ahead and meet the chairman.

140
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,232
I have something urgent to tell you.

141
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:11,170
Are you saying the guests
you guys brought were all murdered?

142
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,840
Yes, we saw them buried in the woods.
And there were no graves.

143
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,184
I called the police from a payphone.

144
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,977
It was on the news.

145
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,689
A number of corpses have been found.
Everyone says it's serial killing.

146
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,150
Judging from what the guests are saying,

147
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,820
it seems to be true that they were
all killed by the same person.

148
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,822
They all said it was a stranger to them,

149
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,074
but they all agreed
that it was a young man.

150
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,367
It's that guy.

151
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,787
I'm sure
the owner of that car is the killer.

152
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,043
I jotted down the license plate number.

153
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,920
-Let's find him and--
-Don't get involved.

154
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,424
Hyeon-jung already called the police,

155
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,717
and the fact that the bodies were found
was on the news.

156
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,929
Since the killer is alive,
the police can catch him.

157
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:05,933
All we have to do is take good care of
the dead victims until they can see that

158
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,685
and leave at peace.

159
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,689
Make sure to install a television
if they want to watch the news.

160
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,899
Give them access to our Wi-Fi network

161
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,276
so that they can search the web.

162
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,235
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,123
Are you okay?

164
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,083
The police will catch him.

165
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,627
Hyeon-jung, you called the police,

166
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,590
so the cops must be so confused now.

167
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,511
The call was made from this payphone,

168
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,849
but no one was caught
on the security camera over there.

169
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,185
Was it a ghost?

170
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,562
It's so odd.

171
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,108
Ghosts don't exist.

172
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,070
What's odder to me is
how payphones like this still exist.

173
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,451
Do you have any change?

174
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,369
Oh, yes. Just a second.

175
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,040
Here you go.

176
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,752
Thank you.

177
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,922
I'll give you this in return.

178
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,139
It's all right.

179
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,600
Gosh, no. If you lose this,

180
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,311
you'll stay a bachelor.

181
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,689
For the rest of your life.

182
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,067
Forever.

183
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,111
You won't even be able to date anyone.

184
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,782
Don't ever lose it.

185
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,037
Hey.

186
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,623
Right, yes.

187
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,083
Wait, ma'am.

188
00:13:58,754 --> 00:13:59,880
What was that about?

189
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:07,012
For the rest of your life.

190
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,724
Forever.

191
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,528
DEAR GRANDFATHER WHOM I MISS DEARLY

192
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,196
I'M SO HAPPY I CAN WRITE YOU A LETTER

193
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,324
Your granddaughter is

194
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,910
very sad about not being by your side
in your final moments.

195
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,162
She was studying abroad at the time.

196
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,290
I get to see her like this.

197
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,125
I owe it all to you.

198
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,045
I guess you rode your motorcycle earlier.
That suits you.

199
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,590
You think so?

200
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,884
I never got to do this when I was alive,

201
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,594
thinking it'd be frowned upon.

202
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,762
Thanks to you,
I get to enjoy this as well.

203
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,140
I'm glad to see you happy.

204
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,146
Isn't my granddaughter so pretty?

205
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,650
Yes, she is.

206
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,450
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-Pardon?

207
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,661
My granddaughter doesn't have
a boyfriend yet.

208
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,706
Her name is Jeong Ji-eun. She's 25.

209
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:19,126
She's just been studying,
so she can't pick out good guys.

210
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:23,964
I always wanted to find
a nice, reliable guy for her.

211
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,802
Oh, I see.

212
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,973
I'm sure she'll meet
a wonderful man. Don't worry.

213
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,309
I'll be off, then.

214
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,656
Chan-sung doesn't have a girlfriend.

215
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,700
You seemed curious
about that nice, reliable guy.

216
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,786
Is that so?

217
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,873
Then shall I tell you more
about Chan-sung?

218
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,384
Shall I tell Chan-sung
to take care of this since he's here?

219
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,551
Forget it.

220
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,972
Ms. Jang, there you are.

221
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,098
What is it?

222
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,183
I curried favor with Chairman Wang

223
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,601
as per your order.

224
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,145
Good. So have you found out anything?

225
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,856
He entrusted me
with taking care of something

226
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,566
that is still bothering him very much.

227
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,487
Look at you. Well done, Seon-bi.

228
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,448
You sure are a capable man.

229
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,867
Once again, you proved
to be such a useful asset.

230
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,077
Chairman Wang

231
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,287
has a granddaughter
that he absolutely adores.

232
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,874
He's still upset
that he couldn't find a nice guy for her,

233
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,085
so I promised him
I'll hook her up with a nice guy.

234
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,378
You'll find a guy for her!

235
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,047
Great. If all goes well,
he'll buy you a nice suit.

236
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,384
He's a chairman. He won't stop there.

237
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,219
You're absolutely right.

238
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,346
You'll find a nice guy
for his granddaughter.

239
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,307
He'll have to take care of this
for us at the very least.

240
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,059
You have nothing to worry about now.

241
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,269
I knew it.

242
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:04,356
You're the ace of our hotel,
without a doubt.

243
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:08,485
And Chairman Wang really likes
the guy I recommended.

244
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,738
My gosh, Mr. Kim.

245
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,365
I'm sure all the work at the bar
keeps you busy enough.

246
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,118
When did you have time to go out,
meet people, and recommend someone?

247
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,122
I don't have time to meet new people.
I only know one guy.

248
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,207
What?

249
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,335
I recommended Koo Chan-sung.

250
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,883
You mean the manager of our hotel,

251
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,010
Koo Chan-sung?

252
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,220
He's no longer our manager.

253
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,222
I know it's been bothering you as well.

254
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,058
Let's marry him off to the granddaughter.

255
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,102
He won't ignore us if he marries
into that rich family thanks to us.

256
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,813
We'll get money from Chairman Wang
and Chan-sung.

257
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,315
We'll kill two birds with one stone.

258
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,151
Did he leave already?

259
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,029
I have to give him
the granddaughter's number.

260
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,364
Just trust me.

261
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,493
Where did he go?

262
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,123
That dunderhead.

263
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,670
Did Mr. Koo leave?

264
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,547
No, I didn't see him leaving.

265
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,176
That means he's still here.
All right, catch you later.

266
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,848
TO MS. JANG MAN-WOL, I LOVE YOU

267
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,185
She still has this.

268
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,495
-You're still here.
-I will leave soon.

269
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,165
Mr. Koo?

270
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,167
What is going on?

271
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,378
Is he in Ms. Jang's office?

272
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:52,965
Mr. Koo!

273
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,926
He's not here.

274
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,678
What's the matter?

275
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,804
I have to...

276
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,013
My gosh.

277
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,641
Would he be in the garden?

278
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,228
What's with him? Goodness.

279
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,820
Do we have to stay like this?

280
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,533
Why do we have to do this?

281
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,702
You don't like money, right?

282
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,537
You prefer plain things

283
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,038
over fancy things.

284
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,373
You love that tacky poop...

285
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,043
I mean, you like dull colors like brown.

286
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,587
Right?

287
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,215
Is this your way of pressuring me to
give you the painting of Baekdu Mountain?

288
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,511
Now I see.

289
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,514
You are greedy for money.

290
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,351
Yes, I am. I want to make a lot of money.

291
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,395
Is being money-grubbing
something to brag about?

292
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,314
Is that what they taught you at Harvard?

293
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,276
Yes, MBA programs teach you
how you can earn money.

294
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,527
Okay, you show-off.

295
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,279
You greedy fraud from Harvard.

296
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,448
-What--
-I hope you become filthy rich.

297
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,991
Then own a hotel!

298
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,284
Get out!

299
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:04,995
Why...

300
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,132
She's so mad at me
for not giving her the painting.

301
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,641
Jang Man-wol.

302
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,186
I'll give you back
the painting of Baekdu Mountain.

303
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,484
And as for the medicine,
you should keep it.

304
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,489
It'll be the last way

305
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,992
for me to run away

306
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,829
and for you to abandon me.

307
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,969
I'll wait for your call
to reinstate me back at the hotel.

308
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,556
And the meal we had today.

309
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,142
I enjoyed it.

310
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,104
Let's...

311
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,690
go and have another meal there.

312
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,403
My wife hasn't been home
for several days now.

313
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,113
That's why I'm calling you.

314
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,117
If she calls you,
please tell her that I'm sorry.

315
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,870
Please tell her to come back home.

316
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,747
Thank you.

317
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,261
Gosh.

318
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,597
No!

319
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,390
Honey!

320
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,017
Oh, no!

321
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,978
What happened to you? What is this? Honey.

322
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,355
What happened to you? Honey.

323
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,857
What...

324
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,942
What is this? Why...

325
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,944
Wait. Why...

326
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,827
It's just like the tip.
There's a body here.

327
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,539
You're under arrest for murdering
your wife, Lee Do-yeon.

328
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,375
-I didn't kill her.
-You have the right to remain silent.

329
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,211
And you have the right to an attorney.

330
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,548
What about the shovel?
Get the shovel. The one with dirt on it.

331
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,181
There you go. That's it.

332
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,810
You ought to arrest a serial killer.

333
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,149
Bye.

334
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,123
Darn it.

335
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,835
Why do you hate Seol Ji-won so much?

336
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,922
Did something happen
between you and him in the States?

337
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,883
Not between just the two of us.
Among three people.

338
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,177
Chan-sung was involved too?

339
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,179
It was after you went back to Korea.

340
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,683
A Korean international student
committed suicide in Boston.

341
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,894
But there was a ridiculous rumor
she killed herself because of me.

342
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,729
What? Because of you?

343
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,357
No way. Who would believe that?

344
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,483
People did.

345
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,527
That ridiculous rumor snowballed.

346
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,322
Later, people said that
I was a rich piece of trash

347
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,325
who toyed with the poor
International student and made her

348
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,411
do something nasty with foreign friends.

349
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:21,126
Afterward, on an online forum,
people started to bet

350
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,129
on whether I'd kill myself or not.

351
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,425
And the guy who set up the whole thing...

352
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,801
Seol Ji-won?

353
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,726
It's you, isn't it?

354
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,479
You're the one who spread
the rumor about Jae-in.

355
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,607
I just said

356
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,235
that I saw you invite her to the party
you had with rich European friends.

357
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,778
She...

358
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,865
She came to work as a waitress.

359
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,034
She said she needed money for her tuition,

360
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,870
-so I got her a job--
-She could have done something else.

361
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,836
Don't get so worked up
because no one will believe you.

362
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:08,215
Actually, everyone was fed up
with your righteous acts as a rich guy.

363
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:15,889
Keep your chin up.

364
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,351
I made a bet that you'd live.

365
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,858
What are you doing here?
I've been looking all over for you.

366
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,947
Let's go eat.

367
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,665
When I was in misery
and almost thought about dying,

368
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,417
Chan-sung came to me.

369
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,797
That day, he took the box with the gun
and went to see Seol Ji-won.

370
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,342
After that, Seol Ji-won went back
to Korea all of a sudden.

371
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,553
What did Chan-sung do that day?

372
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,015
I don't know that either.

373
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:45,562
Well, anyway, after that,
he always found me to have a meal with me

374
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,355
until the rumor died down.

375
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,941
That's how you two got so close.

376
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,158
Who threw these out?

377
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,452
Today's not the day. It's tomorrow.

378
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,162
I'm sorry.

379
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,874
Chan-sung, I brought
some pizza for you. Go wash up.

380
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:06,958
Thank you.

381
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,835
The recycling trash goes out on Saturdays.

382
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,721
Don't tell Chan-sung that we met
Seol Ji-won at the gathering today.

383
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,182
I don't want Chan-sung to have
anything to do with that jerk.

384
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,100
Okay. I won't tell him.

385
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:32,150
It's my loss. There's no guy
better than Chan-sung.

386
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,572
I think Chan-sung would make
the best grandson-in-law.

387
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,873
I understand that you like Chan-sung,
but you have already passed away.

388
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:50,293
How can you pass on your message
to your granddaughter?

389
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,380
That brings me to my next point.
I'd like to make

390
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,049
a special request to your hotel.

391
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,677
The bartender told me all about it.

392
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,347
I heard that your hotel provides
a dream call service

393
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,225
where the dead can talk
to the living in their dreams.

394
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,024
I heard that I could pay you
with the money from this world.

395
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,194
I just remembered an asset
I forgot to take care of.

396
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,027
Grandpa.

397
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,957
You received my photo?

398
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:17,297
The guy who gave me this photo is
really my cup of tea.

399
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,508
Mr. Koo Chan-sung?

400
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,343
That's right.

401
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:27,766
I really hope that young man
can be your husband.

402
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,643
Let me tell you about the guy.

403
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,858
Your time is up.

404
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:40,028
It was very expensive to make this call.
Is it supposed to be this short?

405
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,155
Then, why don't you make another call?

406
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,993
The rule says
you can only make a call a day.

407
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,996
You must think about other guests too.

408
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,299
But I think you told her
all the important parts.

409
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,056
Ms. Jang, will Mr. Koo really

410
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,308
marry into the wealthy family?

411
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,978
Kids these days
rarely listen to old people.

412
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,315
She never listened to her grandfather.
Why would she now?

413
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,575
My grandfather came to me
in my dream last night.

414
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,869
He told me that he received my photo.

415
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,747
Really? You must've been happy.

416
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,043
Also,

417
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,463
he told me something else.

418
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:46,052
I really hope that young man
can be your husband.

419
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,564
Use this.

420
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,362
Could you please clean this for us?

421
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,114
Thank you.

422
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,578
Mr. Koo?

423
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,621
Have you eaten?

424
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,668
I'd like to talk more
about my grandfather with you.

425
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,006
Sure, let's grab a bite to eat.

426
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,508
What do you like?

427
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,930
Here he comes!

428
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,599
Did you really murder your wife?

429
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,392
Why did you kill the others
that were buried?

430
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,227
Are there any more victims?

431
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,355
What was the reason behind these murders?

432
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,774
-Is there an accomplice?
-Are there any more victims?

433
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,193
-Please say a few words.
-Any words?

434
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,237
-Over here!
-Sir!

435
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,697
MAN ARRESTED FOR MURDERING HIS WIFE

436
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,073
That's not right.

437
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,368
The guy had a smaller build.

438
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,786
What guy?

439
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,380
I don't think this man is the killer.

440
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,550
All we have to do is find the car 0963.

441
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,135
What? 0963?

442
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,012
Did you memorize the license plate number?

443
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,096
Yes.

444
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,307
Forget it like you forget English words.

445
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,850
Darn.

446
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,065
My friend owns the place,
and the food is quite tasty.

447
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,067
-It's Mr. Koo.
-Sanchez!

448
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,319
-How have you been?
-And you?

449
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,072
-Do you know Sanchez?
-We're in the same yacht club.

450
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,282
-It's been a while.
-Really?

451
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,951
What a coincidence.

452
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,912
-I should visit there sometime.
-You won't be allowed in.

453
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,789
That's not true.

454
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,958
You could if you had a hotel of your own.

455
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,626
I was going to talk

456
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:45,421
about the car with Mr. Koo,
but he seems busy.

457
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,508
Actually, he doesn't
work at the hotel anymore.

458
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,592
What?

459
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,637
-He'll marry into a rich family.
-I can use my experience

460
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,805
as a hotel manager

461
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,307
to greet the members
and help with their baggage.

462
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,477
-That's nice.
-And see them off later.

463
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,692
KOO CHAN-SUNG

464
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,737
I'll wait for your call
to reinstate me back at the hotel.

465
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,285
Ms. Jang!

466
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:20,123
They met!

467
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,251
The blind date happened.

468
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,587
What? They met?

469
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,173
I saw Mr. Koo meeting
Chairman Wang's granddaughter.

470
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,677
I haven't seen him smile so widely before.

471
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,306
Of course.

472
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,236
Who knew he had such an ambition?

473
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,031
I'm not sure about that.

474
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,491
He's always been the friendly type.

475
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,368
You should see for yourself then.

476
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,162
They agreed to meet tomorrow as well.

477
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,873
Mr. Koo invited her over to his house.

478
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,542
That means
she's going to meet Mr. Koo's parents.

479
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,962
Mr. Koo's father passed away, remember?

480
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,757
I'm not sure about his mother.

481
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,633
Is his mother still alive?

482
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,261
How should I know?

483
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,889
You're always bitter when this comes up.

484
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,267
Anyway, wouldn't it be great
if this leads to Koo Chan-sung

485
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,810
getting his own family?

486
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,480
You know how warm he's been to our guests.

487
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:29,525
This must be the work of good karma.
And I'm so happy for him.

488
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,030
Is that so?

489
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,240
May he be full of luck then.

490
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,719
Are you cleaning
because Ji-eun is coming tomorrow?

491
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,597
Yes, it should be clean.

492
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,147
Dating someone else
will help him forget about Man-wol.

493
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,942
Still, he plays it big.

494
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:14,362
He only goes for a woman
who has a hotel of her own.

495
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,735
There's a book here
that's haunted by a ghost.

496
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,654
That's ridiculous.

497
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,115
My cousin's a librarian here,
and she told me.

498
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,244
The ghost that donated it
comes along whenever you pull it out.

499
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,829
Sounds like fun.

500
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,665
Where's the book?
Let's post it on social media.

501
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,844
-This way?
-Yes.

502
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,305
Okay, I'm filming.

503
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,141
-Pull it out.
-Got it.

504
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,356
It won't come out. I'm not kidding!

505
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,525
-Come on already.
-It really must be haunted.

506
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,205
What's wrong?

507
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,541
Seol? Are you all right?

508
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,210
Seol?

509
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,004
Hey! Are you all right?

510
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,297
EXISTENCE AND TIME

511
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,803
Are you all right? Seol, wake up!

512
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,056
Come on. Please.

513
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,058
Wake up.

514
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,855
If Chan-sung hasn't taken the medicine,

515
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,358
then he can probably see
the connections that were cut off.

516
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,902
It's the side effect of
being able to see ghosts.

517
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,906
I hear you made two incompatible souls
cross their paths.

518
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:26,869
It's always fun to make enemies
of previous lives meet again.

519
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,331
They're drawn to each other
because of leftover feelings.

520
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,001
My goodness.

521
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,879
How pretty!

522
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,680
-Are you getting in?
-Yes.

523
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,522
Excuse me.

524
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,692
Is this yours?

525
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,363
Thank you.

526
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,190
Look.

527
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,443
Just look at this.

528
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,361
This is all because of your pen.

529
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,155
This is brand new, you know.

530
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,990
I'm terribly sorry. What can I do?

531
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,366
You can pay for the dry-cleaning.

532
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,828
I'm busy today,
so give me your number instead.

533
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,121
Sorry?

534
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,751
Hold on.

535
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,421
This ink is black.

536
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,259
You're right. It's very black

537
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,970
even though it's pink on the outside.

538
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,432
Forget it then.

539
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,435
Excuse me.

540
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,276
This pen is important to me,

541
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,445
so let me pay for the cleaning
for getting it back to me.

542
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,076
May I have your number?

543
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,205
Sure thing.

544
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,433
So this is the library
the chairman established.

545
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:58,312
Yes, this must be
why my grandfather came to me

546
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,189
in my dream.

547
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:08,823
I wanted this would happen
the moment I met you too.

548
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,325
I'm sure my grandfather
will be very happy.

549
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:15,830
Shall we go?

550
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,633
Are you happy now?

551
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,302
They make a nice couple.

552
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,680
Then, as you promised,

553
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,598
I will keep that money.

554
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,017
You can keep watching them here.

555
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,974
You are so pretty.

556
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,476
You are like a princess.

557
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,560
Really?

558
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,896
-I hardly recognized you.
-Thanks.

559
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,148
How is your mother?

560
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,358
She is healthy and doing well.

561
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,736
-Good. I need to visit her.
-Yes.

562
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,821
This is Koo Chan-sung.

563
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,907
Hello.

564
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,992
Nice to meet you. I am Koo Chan-sung.

565
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:44,919
Jang Man-wol.

566
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,467
Why are you here?

567
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,719
Chairman Wang wanted to see
his granddaughter.

568
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,805
He paid a high price for the dream call,
so this is a special service.

569
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,474
You can ignore this and go.

570
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,477
Since you are here,
why don't you look around the library?

571
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,687
There are many good books

572
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,397
and nice paintings here.

573
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,690
Forget it.

574
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,442
I'm going back.

575
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,987
Come on. Take a look around the library.

576
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,948
There's a nice painting here.

577
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,250
I sold this.

578
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,169
If we waited for the memorial hall
to be built,

579
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,004
you'd probably collapse first.

580
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,884
So his granddaughter and I decided
to hang it here.

581
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,809
I came here to sell this.
What did you come to sell?

582
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,979
What kind of a deal did you make
with the chairman without me?

583
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,855
And the "high price for the dream call"?

584
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:51,944
You don't need to know.

585
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,697
There are many good paintings here?

586
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,657
Why don't we look at them?

587
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,619
How much did you rip off
from the chairman?

588
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,080
Just a little. Very little.

589
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,874
Actually,
that's the chairman's painting as well.

590
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,252
I feel a bit like committing fraud.

591
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,213
You are a greedy fraud
from Harvard anyway.

592
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,881
A fraud?

593
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,217
You keep calling me that. Take it back.

594
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,803
-I don't want to.
-You don't want to?

595
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:21,307
That's not what matters.
Take back what you said.

596
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:26,353
That guy called Chan-sung

597
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,230
seemed nice.

598
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,774
Are you seeing him?

599
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,820
I wanted to.

600
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,157
He told me there is someone else.

601
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,548
The cafeteria of this library
is not bad at all.

602
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:56,592
Isn't it?

603
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,219
I came here often with my father
when I was young.

604
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,596
The food was also good then.

605
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,473
Did you live around here back then?

606
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:06,352
Father wanted to send me
to an elementary school around here.

607
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,229
The rent in this neighborhood was so high
that we couldn't get a room.

608
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:10,939
But we came here often.

609
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,650
Because the food was cheap and tasty.

610
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,694
Did you only live with your father
from the start?

611
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,989
Yes. The reason my name is Chan-sung is

612
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:22,826
that the only person who wanted
me to be born was my father.

613
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,330
He felt bad about that
so he named me Chan-sung.

614
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:30,376
But he didn't know
Chinese characters very well.

615
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,378
So my name means a brilliant star.

616
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,176
The reason your father sold you

617
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,762
was not to save himself.

618
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,764
It was because of you.

619
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,850
Because you would be alone without him.

620
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:53,273
Of course I know that.
He was my only family.

621
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:03,242
If you are finished,
let's go and read some books.

622
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,618
Books?

623
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,205
I can't do that in this condition.

624
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:12,626
-Why?
-My clothes don't suit books.

625
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,503
What's that got to do with books?

626
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,255
It has everything to do with them.

627
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,841
Look.
I have to take a photo at the library

628
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,384
to post it on my social media.

629
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,512
What I'm wearing isn't appropriate.

630
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,680
God...

631
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,224
Have some coffee and wait for me.

632
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,059
I'll get changed and come right back.

633
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,353
There's no need for that. Sit down.

634
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,106
I didn't mean to go to read books.

635
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,358
I want us to find the ghost
attached to a book.

636
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,782
There is a rumor
that there is a ghost around here.

637
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,701
The director of the library
is very worried.

638
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,412
If there really is a ghost,
we should take it to the hotel.

639
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,914
There is a book with a ghost?

640
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,166
Yes.

641
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,710
The rumor is that the ghost
donated the book before.

642
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,880
She was an elementary school principal
and she died not long ago.

643
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,339
Her family donated her books.

644
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,175
The book must have been precious to her.

645
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:02,843
I don't know.

646
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:06,597
Most people easily throw away
things they used to care about.

647
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,057
They protect things they want
to hide with their life.

648
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,728
That ghost must have got nervous
when so many people came

649
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,855
to pull the book out because of the rumor.

650
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,773
What's there to hide in the book?

651
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,942
It's probably her emergency money.

652
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,739
Gosh.

653
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,825
She speeds up only when it's about money.

654
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,455
You're the human, so you pull it out.
The ghost won't come out if I do.

655
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,001
Existence and Time.

656
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:40,088
Nobody would want to read a book
with that title and look.

657
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,381
I read it.

658
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,925
I'm sure you did.

659
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:45,552
Since you're such a smarty-pants,
Koo Chan-sung.

660
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,638
You're so great.

661
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:51,225
Right. I read it to show off.

662
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,393
But it was difficult to understand.

663
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,480
I've been alive for over 1,000 years,
trying to kill time.

664
00:46:56,939 --> 00:47:00,609
Even I don't know
what is existence or time.

665
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,862
You've only lived for about 30 years,
so how could you know?

666
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,867
Let's see what this book tells
about the time.

667
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,870
The ghost might not appear if I'm here.

668
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,622
I'll be near the bookshelf in the back.

669
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,267
You can see me?

670
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,896
Yes, I can see you.

671
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,940
What are you doing here?

672
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,151
I don't want anyone to read this book.

673
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,238
Is there something you cherish
in this book?

674
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,700
Or is it something you want to hide?

675
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:54,830
Can you get rid of something
inside the book?

676
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,665
I will help you.

677
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,626
To do that, I have to take out the book.

678
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,756
It's the past I have been hiding.

679
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,013
My family must not find out about it.

680
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,682
Please get rid of it.

681
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,998
The lady we just saw...

682
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,836
I think she's my mother.

683
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,643
I have never seen her.

684
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,812
I didn't even know she passed away.

685
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,859
I didn't know
my father sent these photos to her.

686
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:53,365
CHAN-SUNG AND I ARE GOING TO THE US

687
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,412
It wasn't something she cherished.

688
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,415
It was something she wanted to hide.

689
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:08,922
I guess...

690
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,592
she really didn't want me to be born.

691
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,575
You volunteered to go through trouble.

692
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,618
That's why you ended up
finding out about this.

693
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,912
It's just useless and upsetting.

694
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,249
What? Am I wrong?

695
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:47,127
Are you going to say you felt happy
to see your mother?

696
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,796
Do you want to take her to the hotel,
so you could be a filial son?

697
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,924
Do you think I'd want to do that?

698
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,260
Good.

699
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,763
Give me that. Let me put it back.

700
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,183
We'll just let that ghost
stay there forever.

701
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,309
That's not...

702
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:04,811
what I want either.

703
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,314
Then what do you want?

704
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:10,400
You ended up going through this
because I made you see ghosts,

705
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,028
-I should at least do something for you.
-I'm just sad...

706
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,866
that I wasn't able to feel happy
when I got to meet my mom...

707
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,495
for the first time.

708
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,711
Just let me grieve for now.

709
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,607
Never mind. Just go.

710
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,480
Did something happen?
Why do you look so upset?

711
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,065
Well...

712
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,527
I just feel a little sad.

713
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,950
I'm glad you're here. I'll cheer you up.

714
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,077
Let's go. I'll buy you a drink.

715
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,750
Hey, you lost a button.

716
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,669
Where did you lose it?

717
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,547
You're making me feel sorry for you.

718
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,569
Was she trying to console me?

719
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,448
Sanchez.

720
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:24,743
Hey, Mi-ra. I was just about
to leave with Chan-sung.

721
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,328
What? Chan-sung's here?

722
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:30,498
I don't think you can join us today.

723
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,250
You'll have to eat alone.

724
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:35,670
I have company.
Someone will be here to eat with me.

725
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:36,922
-Really?
-Yes.

726
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,725
Gosh, this place is nice.

727
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,936
What's going on?

728
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,899
Chan-sung, say hello. He's Park Yeong-su.

729
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:55,375
I helped him find something
that means a lot to him.

730
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,751
So he's treating me to a meal.

731
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,464
He died...

732
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,842
because of you.

733
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,510
What?

734
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:10,181
I know, right? His looks are to die for.

735
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,474
My gosh, Mi-ra.

736
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:14,894
He's a cop.

737
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,565
I heard you're going to leave
with Sanchez.

738
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:19,983
See you later.

739
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,619
What's wrong? Do you know him?

740
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,330
No, I don't know him.

741
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,541
But Jang Man-wol does.

742
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,626
Man-wol?

743
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,754
Does he know her too?

744
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,548
No, he probably doesn't.

745
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,638
Sanchez, I don't think
I can drink today. I'm sorry.

746
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,640
It's okay.

747
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:04,861
Tell me if Chan-sung ever told you
anything personal about his life.

748
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,864
Does he have any relatives
that he keeps in touch with?

749
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:10,575
What about his friends? Who else is
he friends with other than Sanchez?

750
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,333
No one knows anything? Seriously?

751
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,877
Mr. Koo always stuck by your side...

752
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,214
I mean, he always spent time with you.

753
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:25,423
Don't you know anything?

754
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:30,303
It's natural that I don't know since I'm
his boss, but his colleagues should.

755
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:33,848
How can you be so indifferent
to your colleague?

756
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,478
Seon-bi.

757
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,856
You even recommended him to the chairman,
and yet you know nothing?

758
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,527
I only recommended him
because he has a kind heart--

759
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,363
Hyeon-jung,
weren't you pretty close to him?

760
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:51,407
Well, from what I remember,

761
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,660
Mr. Koo

762
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,247
likes the color brown.

763
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,748
Even I know that.

764
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,213
The Grim Reaper's here.

765
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,507
Will you stop nagging at them?

766
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,926
You don't seem to know anything either.

767
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,637
What about you then? Do you know anything?

768
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,763
You saw him very often.

769
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,854
I get that you guys are ghosts,

770
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,314
but you're all so cold-hearted.

771
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,820
Ms. Jang,
why don't you just ask him yourself?

772
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,864
He's here.

773
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,678
I thought you'd be sad for a long time.

774
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,930
I guess you're okay already.

775
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,350
I'm not okay yet.

776
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,064
But I came because of you.

777
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,276
Because of me?

778
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,696
I think...

779
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,658
I stirred up your existence and time
this time.

780
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:23,374
I met someone from your painful memory.

781
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:39,057
BEOMCHEON CENTRAL POLICE STATION

782
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,747
He used to be a thief.

783
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,377
But now, he's a cop.

784
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,847
You're living a good life again.

785
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,687
I'm glad.

786
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,233
What a relief.

787
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,331
Do you want to go

788
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,917
and talk to him?

789
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:51,588
No.

790
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,132
I'm nobody to him.

791
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,594
He was like a family to you.

792
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,430
Will you be okay?

793
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,308
I won't be okay.

794
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:06,811
It's a bit sad.

795
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,273
I brought a connection

796
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,153
from your past again.

797
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,495
Thank you.

798
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,081
Chan-sung.

799
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:35,131
-Let me see.
-Gosh. No.

800
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,707
The serial murder case.

801
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,000
You got the analysis report
on the dirt from the shovel, right?

802
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,210
Pardon?

803
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:57,004
Yes, the dirt is the same as that of
the hill where the bodies were found.

804
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,131
Right?

805
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:01,050
But why does that suspect keep denying
that he killed them?

806
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,094
This is giving me a headache.

807
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:04,637
But the thing is

808
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,849
he doesn't have any motives
other than his wife's murder.

809
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,352
He's a typical psychopath.

810
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:12,937
A murder fanatic.

811
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:37,420
The end.

812
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:18,961
So there's a problem with the stuff
the truck was carrying that day.

813
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,464
Everything arrived without a problem.

814
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,427
Check the name
of the reservation one more time.

815
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:29,388
The reservation with the truck, 3465,
was made

816
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,015
under Koo Chan-sung.

817
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:37,271
-Who?
-Isn't this Mr. Koo Chan-sung?

818
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,859
Koo Chan-sung?

819
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:45,488
No way.

820
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,373
Koo Chan-sung.

821
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,667
Koo Chan-sung.

822
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,419
Why am I running into you here?

823
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:24,652
Chan-sung.

824
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,697
Are you staying home today again?

825
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,368
-Yes.
-You're not going to the hotel?

826
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,162
You kept going there
and said you'd be reinstated.

827
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,873
I have unfinished business here.

828
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,833
I don't think

829
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,461
I can take care of the hotel guests
if I go in this state.

830
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:03,858
EXISTENCE AND TIME

831
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:14,702
Will I find an answer
once I'm done with this difficult book?

832
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:16,412
A way to console a guy

833
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:20,625
whose existence
and time he spent with his mom

834
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,627
have completely been denied.

835
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:33,387
Are you worried that the secret
you've been hiding would be exposed?

836
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:36,515
Don't worry.

837
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,977
Your son doesn't want that.

838
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:45,483
He's sad.

839
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,028
And I want to console him.

840
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,406
I need you.

841
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,160
I will

842
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,288
escort you to my hotel.

843
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:10,216
Reinstated.

844
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,302
Come to the hotel. Take Line Four.

845
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:17,932
A guest you must send off is waiting.

846
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,851
A guest I must send off?

847
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:03,060
Mr. Koo, congratulations
on your reinstatement.

848
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,021
You came back to Myeong-dong.

849
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:07,606
I like this place
way more than the other place.

850
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:19,952
I look forward to working with you again.

851
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,593
I thought he would marry
into the rich family.

852
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:38,137
He came back to this hotel of ghosts.

853
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:40,097
How could a man have no ambition?

854
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,892
Ms. Jang needs Mr. Koo.

855
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:45,895
Ambitious men aren't popular among ladies.

856
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:48,272
You're so behind the times.

857
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:52,860
Besides, I told you to stop
talking like a dinosaur.

858
01:07:58,115 --> 01:07:59,909
I did change the way I talk.

859
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:02,620
Right? Gosh.

860
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,685
I'm sorry for having kept you waiting.

861
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:32,566
Thank you for coming.

862
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,281
May I keep

863
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,827
the photos from the book?

864
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:47,832
Could you do that?

865
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,501
I'm very...

866
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:54,672
sorry.

867
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:54,315
Goodbye.

868
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:58,736
Mother.

869
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:51,747
Did you see her off?

870
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,084
Yes.

871
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:59,797
I'm sorry I took the liberty
of bringing her here.

872
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:05,552
Thank you for bringing her here.

873
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,180
Also

874
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:10,975
for telling me to return.

875
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:17,815
It's embarrassing for me to say this,
but let's get things straight.

876
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:20,776
You didn't return because I told you to.

877
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,611
You did it for me.

878
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:31,120
I could've forced you to eat the medicine
so you could never return,

879
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:34,748
but I didn't do that.

880
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,716
I thought you returned as you pleased

881
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:47,928
every time I gave you a chance
to run away.

882
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:52,349
But in fact,

883
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,812
I was hoping you'd return.

884
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:05,070
I'm glad to hear you admit
that I wasn't the only clingy one,

885
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:06,905
wanting to return.

886
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:17,833
Chan-sung.

887
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:21,503
I'm going to use you.

888
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:27,092
You brought both that woman and Yeon-u

889
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:29,762
to me.

890
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:33,390
Which means

891
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,186
you'll bring him too.

892
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:43,400
Yes, probably.

893
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,194
I'm certain that you will.

894
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:48,530
And

895
01:12:49,823 --> 01:12:51,533
I will never let him

896
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:55,120
pass by unscathed.

897
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:57,539
That's why you'll use me?

898
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:00,459
That's right. I'll be vicious and cunning.

899
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:02,503
And you may end up

900
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:06,799
being used, abused, and wrecked
because of me.

901
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:08,175
Are you...

902
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:12,346
-threatening me again to make me run--
-No.

903
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:16,433
Don't run away.

904
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:21,730
You've already made up your mind

905
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,734
to get on my nerves and get in danger.

906
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:29,822
Knowing that such danger

907
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:32,658
could lead to death,

908
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,703
stay by my side.

909
01:13:40,624 --> 01:13:41,667
Even if I...

910
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:45,587
go berserk, do crazy things,

911
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,882
and vanish one day...

912
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,055
please stay by my side.

913
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:00,602
No.

914
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,822
I won't let you vanish.

915
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:24,877
Trust me.

916
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:37,110
It must be pretty hard
to miss something you can't see.

917
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:40,781
You, I'm going easy on you
because you have a soft heart.

918
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:45,410
You probably saw the flowers.
Why aren't you saying anything?

919
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:49,498
We have to go before Ms. Jang does,

920
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:51,541
so let's prepare ourselves for that day.

921
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:55,879
They look so pretty now.
Why must they fall?

922
01:17:56,296 --> 01:17:57,506
It's sad.

923
01:17:57,756 --> 01:17:59,049
Flowers bloom

924
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:01,551
only to fall.

925
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:07,474
