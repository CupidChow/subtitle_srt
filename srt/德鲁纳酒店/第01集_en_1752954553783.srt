00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:44,969
(Episode 1)

2
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:01,898
Where are you from?

3
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:04,509
This is the only place you can get a drink.

4
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:06,539
Are you from Muzu?

5
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:10,539
You don't exactly look like a Georan.

6
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:12,449
Are you from Malgal?

7
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:17,419
My goodness, I see you have a sword. Are you a warrior?

8
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,958
The wine tastes horrible,

9
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,789
and you're very chatty.

10
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:38,639
Did someone die?

11
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:42,938
Or did you kill someone?

12
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:50,378
There are only two types of people who pass by this place...

13
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:51,819
even in this horrible weather.

14
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:54,019
It's either a person who killed someone...

15
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:56,058
or a person who's on their way to die.

16
00:03:56,218 --> 00:03:59,329
You've lived quite a long life even with that useless...

17
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:03,158
and big mouth of yours.

18
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:05,398
Should I slice off your tongue...

19
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,398
so you can safely live for longer?

20
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:11,338
This old tongue of mine might not be able to taste good wine,

21
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,838
but it knows how to say things that can be of help.

22
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:18,349
It seems like you've been wandering for a very long time.

23
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,678
Where are you trying to go?

24
00:04:24,118 --> 00:04:25,248
I'm looking for a guest house.

25
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:27,289
I heard there's a guest house...

26
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:31,019
somewhere in this wilderness that consoles the souls of the dead.

27
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:34,489
You must be looking for the Guest House of the Moon.

28
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:38,729
Do you know that place?

29
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:40,969
I heard it's a guest house for the dead...

30
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:42,339
that still wander in this life.

31
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:43,969
Where is that place?

32
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:45,669
Where do I need to go?

33
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:49,109
You can't go there. Only the dead are able to go there.

34
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,109
Just like those people standing over there.

35
00:04:58,219 --> 00:05:02,919
How much chaos have you brought in this coffin?

36
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:12,068
They're people who ended up dying because of me.

37
00:05:12,498 --> 00:05:16,339
And who else did you kill for those who ended up dying?

38
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:23,209
Shut your mouth. Just tell me how to get there.

39
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:27,479
"Full moon"?

40
00:05:27,748 --> 00:05:29,779
It's a moon that's filled with so many grudges.

41
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:31,149
Tell me.

42
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:32,948
I'm trying to take responsibility...

43
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:35,789
for those whom I've killed.

44
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:38,128
You can't even take responsibility of yourself.

45
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:40,188
You don't have the ability...

46
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:41,558
to take care of other people's lives.

47
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:43,558
I told you I'll slice off your tongue...

48
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,599
if you keep saying things that are unnecessary.

49
00:05:47,268 --> 00:05:48,599
Just tell me how to get there.

50
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,969
If that place can only be found by the dead,

51
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:54,678
I'm even willing to kill myself.

52
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,779
What a poor soul.

53
00:05:57,609 --> 00:06:00,378
You think you can compensate everything by sacrificing your life.

54
00:06:00,378 --> 00:06:02,279
But that's such a futile desire.

55
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,279
This is the only thing left...

56
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:06,818
that I can give.

57
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:12,928
The Guest House of the Moon...

58
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:17,498
is where the souls of the dead gather together.

59
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:22,739
The dead souls that wander about all end up there on their own will.

60
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:24,029
They are also people whom you've already killed.

61
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,618
Was this the place?

62
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:54,318
Did I kill everyone?

63
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:56,859
Did I become an evil spirit?

64
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:01,459
And come to the Guest House of the Moon on my own two feet?

65
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:06,329
Arrogant and foolish.

66
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:10,099
You are a pitiful human who has fallen into self-pity.

67
00:09:11,368 --> 00:09:15,079
As you have found the place to pay for your sins on your own two feet,

68
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:17,038
so now pay for your sins.

69
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:40,599
(Full Moon)

70
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:52,109
(Full Moon)

71
00:11:08,788 --> 00:11:11,628
(Guest House)

72
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:44,219
The Guest House of the Moon which will be the shelter for the dead...

73
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:46,589
has found a new owner.

74
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:58,138
Why don't you come with me...

75
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,069
to a comfortable place?

76
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:03,939
(Hotel Del Luna)

77
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:09,579
(Year 1998)

78
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:20,418
Son.

79
00:13:21,388 --> 00:13:24,618
It was your birthday today and I couldn't buy you jjajangmyeon.

80
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:27,229
It's all right. I'm not hungry.

81
00:13:39,868 --> 00:13:41,339
Let's go buy jjajangmyeon with this.

82
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,209
- Mister. - Hey, son.

83
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:48,349
- You dropped your money. - Thank you.

84
00:13:49,849 --> 00:13:52,989
My word, you're a good boy.

85
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:55,388
You have a wide forehead and twinkling eyes.

86
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:57,359
You have a very auspicious face.

87
00:13:57,589 --> 00:13:58,859
It's your birthday today?

88
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,788
Tell me the year and hour that you were born.

89
00:14:00,788 --> 00:14:03,158
Hey, lady. We're not buying flowers. Go your way.

90
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:06,368
Oh, dear. Your early years were unlucky...

91
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:08,699
so you were born to a father like him.

92
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:11,339
But it's not an ill-fated relationship.

93
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,508
Having a hard life early on means you're cleared for good fortune.

94
00:14:15,508 --> 00:14:17,079
You are washing yourself of bad luck.

95
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:18,239
What? "Bad luck"?

96
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:20,778
How can you talk such rubbish just to sell flowers to a kid?

97
00:14:21,148 --> 00:14:23,278
Son, just wait. I'll earn lots of money...

98
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:24,378
and buy you your birthday present.

99
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:25,849
- Present? - Flowers!

100
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:28,589
Flowers are for birthdays.

101
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:30,118
I'm not buying flowers.

102
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:32,189
Flowers are good too.

103
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,699
You can just pluck them for me, instead of buying them.

104
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:38,229
So don't do dangerous things just to make money.

105
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:39,729
My goodness.

106
00:14:39,898 --> 00:14:41,699
You're too young to worry about things like that.

107
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:54,648
- Look. - Poke around the place.

108
00:14:54,878 --> 00:14:55,918
Is there anything?

109
00:14:56,778 --> 00:14:59,648
- Over there. - Check there.

110
00:16:57,469 --> 00:17:00,469
Ms. Jang, are you up?

111
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:04,739
It's the full moon, so I think we will have many guests.

112
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:07,979
When the moon is bright, they can see this place from far away.

113
00:17:09,148 --> 00:17:11,918
So they will crawl in here from all over the place.

114
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:15,719
I will light up the hotel sign.

115
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:17,859
Open the hotel for business.

116
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:20,859
I get into a bad mood when I see the full moon.

117
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:22,929
And today it's getting worse.

118
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,329
Don't accept anyone who died a particularly gruesome death.

119
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:27,768
We shouldn't pick guests.

120
00:17:27,768 --> 00:17:28,939
Don't accept them.

121
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:30,998
They won't be in a rush, since they're already dead.

122
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:35,139
I will take special care so they won't get in your way.

123
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:43,518
That darn moon.

124
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:48,548
I'm so sick of it.

125
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:08,568
Stop right there! Stop!

126
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:32,459
My gosh.

127
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:37,258
Gosh, I almost died.

128
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:04,258
What's that?

129
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:20,768
I wonder if I'll have to pay just for going inside.

130
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:48,669
Are you here alone?

131
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:53,969
Do you remember how long it's been since you died?

132
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:55,879
It's been about 10 days.

133
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:07,518
I guess that's the elevator.

134
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:36,479
My gosh, this place is huge.

135
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:47,129
I wonder if I'll have to pay just for sitting here.

136
00:21:51,258 --> 00:21:53,929
Are you okay? You don't look so well.

137
00:21:54,598 --> 00:21:56,538
Where did you get so wet?

138
00:21:58,139 --> 00:21:59,308
The Han River.

139
00:21:59,308 --> 00:22:00,469
The Han River?

140
00:22:03,838 --> 00:22:05,909
Did she play in the water in the middle of the night?

141
00:22:07,949 --> 00:22:09,048
Is this place expensive?

142
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:11,619
Do you think they'll make me pay just for sitting in the lobby?

143
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:14,389
I'm not sure. This is also my first time here.

144
00:22:18,788 --> 00:22:19,959
What happened...

145
00:22:21,088 --> 00:22:22,258
to you?

146
00:22:22,298 --> 00:22:24,629
I rolled down the stairs.

147
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,389
It's been a while since we last had a ghost soaked in water.

148
00:22:53,528 --> 00:22:55,229
- A ghost soaked in water? - Yes.

149
00:22:55,229 --> 00:22:57,399
By any chance, does that ghost look filthy?

150
00:22:57,729 --> 00:22:59,369
Well, a little...

151
00:22:59,568 --> 00:23:01,699
Ms. Jang isn't feeling very well today.

152
00:23:01,699 --> 00:23:04,639
We'll have to take her to her room so that Ms. Jang doesn't see her.

153
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:05,909
Okay.

154
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,179
What's wrong, sir?

155
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:18,778
The guest that just walked by...

156
00:23:19,548 --> 00:23:22,318
He doesn't belong here. He came to the wrong place.

157
00:23:23,358 --> 00:23:25,159
Does that mean...

158
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:27,028
he isn't dead?

159
00:23:27,758 --> 00:23:28,758
Is he alive?

160
00:23:28,758 --> 00:23:31,229
If Ms. Jang sees him, he'll die.

161
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:33,768
We need to get him out of here as fast as possible.

162
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:41,038
I need to hide here for at least a couple of hours.

163
00:23:41,308 --> 00:23:43,278
Should I hide in the bathroom?

164
00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:45,379
Yes, good idea. Let's hide in the bathroom.

165
00:23:53,189 --> 00:23:54,248
Is this gold?

166
00:23:57,788 --> 00:23:59,758
My gosh, this looks really expensive.

167
00:24:03,028 --> 00:24:05,998
No, no. This isn't important right now.

168
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:11,038
I hope I see you again.

169
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:35,358
(Swimming Pool)

170
00:25:00,088 --> 00:25:02,619
Why is there a beach here?

171
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:05,828
Sir, would you like to swim in the water?

172
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:08,828
We'll lend you a swimsuit.

173
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,659
What's your room number?

174
00:25:10,828 --> 00:25:13,498
No, I'm... I'm okay.

175
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:28,909
Welcome.

176
00:25:54,008 --> 00:25:55,508
I didn't know this building was this tall.

177
00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:01,108
How weird.

178
00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:04,278
That's scary.

179
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:07,989
A living person is here?

180
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:11,459
It seems like he's roaming around the hotel...

181
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:12,959
without even knowing what this place really is.

182
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:15,528
If he doesn't leave soon, he'll die.

183
00:26:15,528 --> 00:26:17,399
The worst he'll have to face is death,

184
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:19,828
but we'll get scolded so much if Ms. Jang finds out.

185
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,028
She'll make sure we don't forget about this for 50 years.

186
00:26:22,028 --> 00:26:23,768
You know what she always says.

187
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:28,439
Is this the best you can do?

188
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,379
You guys must think of me as a joke.

189
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:36,078
If you make this kind of mistake one more time,

190
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:39,818
I'll put all of you on a bus that's headed to the afterlife.

191
00:26:40,288 --> 00:26:41,389
Do you understand?

192
00:26:45,788 --> 00:26:46,858
My gosh, no way.

193
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:50,358
I feel like it's my fault. What should I do?

194
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:52,298
Why do you always blame yourself?

195
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:54,229
- But this one's on you. - What?

196
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:55,669
I can't take responsibility for this.

197
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:57,298
I still have stuff to do in this world.

198
00:26:57,298 --> 00:26:59,909
I can't get on the bus headed to the afterlife.

199
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:01,639
I'm doomed.

200
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:04,838
Why did that dumb human have to come here? Darn it.

201
00:27:04,838 --> 00:27:06,679
I'm sure Ms. Jang will notice sooner or later...

202
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:09,449
that a living human soul is roaming around the hotel.

203
00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:13,919
If Ms. Jang finds him, he'll never be able to leave this place.

204
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:15,788
He'll end up dying.

205
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:28,498
A thief must be here.

206
00:27:30,869 --> 00:27:32,469
How dare anyone steal from my hotel?

207
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:02,798
What's this place?

208
00:28:13,048 --> 00:28:14,108
Flowers?

209
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,119
Flowers are good too.

210
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:21,288
You can pluck them for me, instead of buying them.

211
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:22,788
This is good.

212
00:28:23,588 --> 00:28:25,189
I'll take them to Chan Seong.

213
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:27,989
This looks like a dead tree.

214
00:28:28,258 --> 00:28:29,828
But the flowers are really pretty.

215
00:29:02,588 --> 00:29:03,699
What is this?

216
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:06,429
Since you still feel pain,

217
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:09,068
is this still alive?

218
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:11,369
What are you?

219
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:12,768
What are you doing? Take off your foot.

220
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,969
You stole from me.

221
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:16,808
I didn't do anything.

222
00:29:16,808 --> 00:29:19,139
I didn't steal anything here.

223
00:29:19,139 --> 00:29:21,308
Really? Then, what is this?

224
00:29:28,449 --> 00:29:29,719
That is... I mean...

225
00:29:30,788 --> 00:29:32,119
You tried to steal it.

226
00:29:32,358 --> 00:29:33,459
That is...

227
00:29:34,258 --> 00:29:35,889
You want to get bitten to death by him.

228
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:43,038
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

229
00:29:43,338 --> 00:29:44,669
I deserve to die for my sins.

230
00:29:44,998 --> 00:29:46,108
Then, die.

231
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:49,108
No, I can't die now.

232
00:29:49,108 --> 00:29:51,139
All humans have to die at the end.

233
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:53,909
Instead of going back and forth,

234
00:29:54,248 --> 00:29:55,508
since you're already here,

235
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,179
just die.

236
00:29:58,949 --> 00:30:00,389
I don't think you realize this.

237
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:02,649
But you are already dying.

238
00:30:08,229 --> 00:30:10,098
What's happening to me?

239
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,358
Why is this happening?

240
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:18,298
Check his pulse and oxygen saturation.

241
00:30:18,768 --> 00:30:20,568
Oxygen saturation is critical.

242
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:23,379
I need the defibrillator.

243
00:30:23,508 --> 00:30:25,139
200 joules. Charge. Clear!

244
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:28,209
I can't die now.

245
00:30:28,808 --> 00:30:29,979
Please spare me.

246
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:32,348
My son is waiting for me.

247
00:30:32,348 --> 00:30:33,949
I feel sorry for your son.

248
00:30:35,389 --> 00:30:36,788
Please.

249
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,558
- What is this? - Today it's my son's birthday.

250
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:46,429
He wanted to receive flowers as his present.

251
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:48,229
So I got them from the tree.

252
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,568
I am really so sorry.

253
00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:54,538
Flowers never bloom on this tree.

254
00:30:54,709 --> 00:30:56,709
The flowers are from this tree for sure.

255
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:58,538
I didn't touch anything else.

256
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:04,419
You made flowers for this human...

257
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:05,919
and also gave him your branch?

258
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:10,858
Is it telling me to spare him?

259
00:31:17,129 --> 00:31:18,429
Did you say this is your son's birthday present?

260
00:31:18,729 --> 00:31:19,869
For a foolish father like me,

261
00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:22,098
he is a smart and loyal son who is too good for me.

262
00:31:22,838 --> 00:31:25,869
If you forgive me, I will never think bad thoughts again.

263
00:31:25,939 --> 00:31:27,608
I will raise my son as best as I can.

264
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,078
Okay. Good.

265
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:35,778
I will spare you.

266
00:31:36,748 --> 00:31:38,278
Thank you very much.

267
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:41,449
You go back and raise your son well.

268
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:44,288
Raise him well...

269
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:46,989
and give him to me.

270
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,489
What?

271
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,959
Since I saved the father, the son must repay me.

272
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:52,629
You said he was still young, yes?

273
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:55,498
If a human is to be of any use,

274
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:58,669
you need to feed and raise him for at least 20 years.

275
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:02,538
Promise me to give me your son then.

276
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:04,308
You want my son?

277
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:06,248
If you don't like it, you die tonight.

278
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:12,518
What's happening to me?

279
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,489
Hurry up and make up your mind.

280
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,459
You only have few minutes to stay alive.

281
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:24,199
How can I...

282
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:28,129
If I die, Chan Seong will be all alone.

283
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:29,969
What will you do?

284
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:32,239
Will you give me your son?

285
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:33,308
Or...

286
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:35,108
will you die?

287
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:38,179
I promise.

288
00:32:38,979 --> 00:32:40,179
Please spare me.

289
00:32:42,578 --> 00:32:44,548
Okay. Good.

290
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:50,619
20 years later,

291
00:32:51,489 --> 00:32:52,959
I will go to get your son.

292
00:32:58,058 --> 00:32:59,058
Go.

293
00:33:03,939 --> 00:33:05,038
Dad.

294
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:09,879
Chan Seong.

295
00:33:12,379 --> 00:33:13,979
My dad is not dead.

296
00:33:14,748 --> 00:33:15,748
What?

297
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:21,219
His reflex has come back, and his vitals are okay.

298
00:33:21,389 --> 00:33:22,788
Contact the OS and prepare for an operation.

299
00:33:22,788 --> 00:33:24,689
- Yes, doctor. - Just wait a while.

300
00:33:26,328 --> 00:33:27,389
Dad.

301
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:31,528
Chan Seong.

302
00:33:34,768 --> 00:33:35,798
Come here.

303
00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:42,808
Dad.

304
00:33:57,288 --> 00:33:59,288
He left his son's birthday present.

305
00:34:35,028 --> 00:34:36,728
(Funeral Hall)

306
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:38,999
That woman...

307
00:34:39,798 --> 00:34:40,898
I don't know.

308
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:42,728
This is my first time too.

309
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:47,539
Dad, do you know that policewoman?

310
00:34:51,438 --> 00:34:54,679
I don't know her, but I think I saw her somewhere.

311
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,918
Is it possible that wasn't a dream?

312
00:35:07,128 --> 00:35:08,358
I'm a policewoman.

313
00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:10,798
My identity was discovered while I was working undercover.

314
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:12,128
And I was killed.

315
00:35:12,128 --> 00:35:13,568
Such a pity.

316
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:15,628
You died doing righteous work.

317
00:35:15,628 --> 00:35:17,039
So on your way to the afterlife,

318
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,938
you will be provided with a first class limousine.

319
00:35:19,499 --> 00:35:21,668
Rest a few days here, then take the limousine.

320
00:35:22,108 --> 00:35:23,478
I can't leave like this.

321
00:35:24,608 --> 00:35:26,708
Most of my guests say the same thing.

322
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:28,508
What would you like me to do for you?

323
00:35:28,508 --> 00:35:29,878
Do you want revenge?

324
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,579
For your reference, even if you want revenge,

325
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:33,449
we can't take the life of a human.

326
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:35,289
We can torment him a little.

327
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:36,318
But that will become a sin,

328
00:35:36,318 --> 00:35:38,519
and affect your next life negatively.

329
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:42,358
You can be reborn to excellent conditions.

330
00:35:42,588 --> 00:35:44,228
But you can be reborn as a dog or a pig...

331
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:46,128
if you try to satisfy your grudge in the life that is already finished.

332
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:47,929
Please think carefully.

333
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:50,269
I don't want revenge.

334
00:35:51,469 --> 00:35:55,369
The man I was chasing can't be caught by human laws.

335
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:57,708
So I want to catch him.

336
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:00,309
You are...

337
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:02,878
such a responsible person.

338
00:36:03,249 --> 00:36:04,849
For services related to this world,

339
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:06,989
you have to pay with worldly money.

340
00:36:06,989 --> 00:36:08,088
Do you have...

341
00:36:09,048 --> 00:36:10,758
some money hidden in this world?

342
00:36:19,028 --> 00:36:20,028
Okay.

343
00:36:20,728 --> 00:36:22,128
What can we do for you?

344
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:48,559
Park Kyu Ho, Mayor of Beomcheon is with us here.

345
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:56,298
Now, we will award the Businessman Award for...

346
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:58,739
Innovative Growth of Beomcheon City.

347
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:02,239
The award goes to Mr. Kim Dong Hwan, CEO of Beomin Corporation.

348
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,309
Congratulations!

349
00:37:04,438 --> 00:37:06,079
- Way to go! - Way to go!

350
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,749
It will be awarded by Park Kyu Ho...

351
00:37:08,749 --> 00:37:10,048
the Mayor of Beomcheon City.

352
00:37:10,048 --> 00:37:11,079
- Kim Dong Hwan! - Kim Dong Hwan!

353
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,978
The CEO has lead Beomin Corporation...

354
00:37:12,978 --> 00:37:14,418
with exceptional dedication.

355
00:37:14,418 --> 00:37:16,719
He has been an excellent model as a business manager.

356
00:37:27,028 --> 00:37:29,398
- What is this noise? - What is this?

357
00:37:29,898 --> 00:37:31,298
- What's going on? - What is this?

358
00:37:32,469 --> 00:37:33,508
Hold on.

359
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:42,148
Why isn't anyone taking photos?

360
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,188
Who's that?

361
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:04,898
There's a woman with a gun in her hand walking in.

362
00:38:05,168 --> 00:38:06,438
Why isn't anyone stopping her?

363
00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:09,909
She has a gun right there!

364
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:11,478
Hey!

365
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,139
Put your gun down.

366
00:38:53,148 --> 00:38:54,289
Mr. Chairman.

367
00:38:54,489 --> 00:38:56,418
I've been shot.

368
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:59,318
Shot? What are you talking about?

369
00:38:59,758 --> 00:39:01,989
That woman right there shot me with her gun.

370
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:12,639
She really shot me.

371
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:21,579
Detective Lee? You died.

372
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:24,579
Don't come near me!

373
00:39:25,048 --> 00:39:26,789
Get away from me.

374
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:34,188
That's Detective Lee right there, isn't it?

375
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,588
What are you all doing? Stop it.

376
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:37,858
You jerk!

377
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:39,728
Stop.

378
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,128
Don't come this way!

379
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:43,999
Stop taking photos.

380
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:53,778
Hold on.

381
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:58,119
Hey! Stop it. Don't come near me.

382
00:40:12,758 --> 00:40:16,599
You used the soul of the man who she couldn't arrest by herself...

383
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:19,838
and trapped him in a place that's worse than jail.

384
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:22,869
If I wear him down enough,

385
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:24,639
he'll probably return back to the hotel.

386
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:28,708
Have you found what the woman mentioned earlier?

387
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:29,778
Yes.

388
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:33,389
I found this in a locker at the train station.

389
00:40:35,648 --> 00:40:38,659
It must've been some of what she found being smuggled.

390
00:40:42,588 --> 00:40:46,599
Seems like I'm going to be drinking a lot of champagne for a while.

391
00:40:46,628 --> 00:40:50,139
We have to pay off the debt that we have.

392
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:52,068
Did we have this much debt?

393
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:57,878
Fine, this should be enough.

394
00:40:57,878 --> 00:41:01,179
We also need some to pay off for loans in the future.

395
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:03,048
Are we going to loan this much money?

396
00:41:03,949 --> 00:41:06,749
What kind of hotel management costs this much money?

397
00:41:06,749 --> 00:41:10,188
All the loans are for your car, your shopping,

398
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,489
as well as champagne.

399
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:15,728
It doesn't cost much to operate our hotel.

400
00:41:20,298 --> 00:41:23,798
The guy that worked for me before knew how to work with money,

401
00:41:23,798 --> 00:41:25,938
so I never had to worry about the finances.

402
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:28,269
I heard that you were starving and completely broke...

403
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:31,978
because of another man that worked for you before that.

404
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:35,208
It angers me whenever I think of him.

405
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:39,519
Why don't you save a little for whoever will come after me?

406
00:41:39,778 --> 00:41:43,119
I'll pay for 20 years worth of child expenses with this.

407
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,159
Hold on.

408
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:46,489
Does it really cost this much to raise a kid?

409
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:54,199
Fine. Give it all away.

410
00:41:54,869 --> 00:41:56,668
When that kid grows up,

411
00:41:56,999 --> 00:41:59,199
I'm going to have him at his beck.

412
00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:11,119
(100,000 dollars transferred)

413
00:42:11,778 --> 00:42:14,219
I guess it wasn't just a dream.

414
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:17,858
I guess I really sold you off.

415
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:21,059
I have to find the hotel.

416
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:23,898
I have to give this money back and call off the deal.

417
00:42:25,798 --> 00:42:26,999
Be careful, Dad.

418
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:44,778
It was somewhere around here.

419
00:42:45,818 --> 00:42:48,849
Stay here. Don't move.

420
00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:29,258
Send him flowers every birthday,

421
00:43:29,758 --> 00:43:31,329
so that he doesn't forget about the deal.

422
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:36,298
Evening primrose will be perfect.

423
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:06,258
(Year 2019)

424
00:44:07,128 --> 00:44:09,929
(Present)

425
00:44:48,108 --> 00:44:49,239
Mr. Ku Chan Seong.

426
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:54,048
Ms. President is here. I'll walk you in.

427
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:55,309
Okay.

428
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,188
(Resume)

429
00:45:02,818 --> 00:45:06,088
You won't regret moving...

430
00:45:06,088 --> 00:45:07,358
from the Singapore hotel to ours.

431
00:45:07,659 --> 00:45:08,989
I'm pleased to be working with you.

432
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:13,999
Thank you for trusting me with such a big role.

433
00:45:16,898 --> 00:45:19,438
You rejected our offer last year,

434
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:21,769
but you said yes to us this year. Why?

435
00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:23,239
Because it has been 20 years now.

436
00:45:23,938 --> 00:45:26,409
I made a promise with my father...

437
00:45:26,909 --> 00:45:30,108
that I won't come back to Korea for 20 years.

438
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:32,619
Last year was the 20th year...

439
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:34,989
and it has been full 20 years now, which is why I could come back.

440
00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:36,789
Something must've been up for him to make you promise so.

441
00:45:36,949 --> 00:45:39,858
It's nothing like being in debt or having committed a crime.

442
00:45:39,918 --> 00:45:42,088
It's more like a myth,

443
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:44,128
avoiding anything unfortunate.

444
00:45:45,429 --> 00:45:46,999
Elders take things like that very seriously.

445
00:45:46,999 --> 00:45:49,929
They tell you to avoid things like getting married when you're 29.

446
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:53,099
It won't do any harm to avoid bad luck.

447
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:59,239
By any chance, is there a hotel in Seoul,

448
00:45:59,378 --> 00:46:01,378
covered in ivy on the outside,

449
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:05,449
has a rooftop bar located almost a hundred floors up...

450
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:09,688
and has a pool that's almost as wide as a beach?

451
00:46:10,389 --> 00:46:11,519
Was there ever such a hotel 20 years ago?

452
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:14,028
Sorry?

453
00:46:16,228 --> 00:46:17,258
No, right?

454
00:46:19,128 --> 00:46:21,228
I've sent up all your belongings to your office.

455
00:46:21,398 --> 00:46:22,398
Thank you.

456
00:46:22,398 --> 00:46:23,739
Did you find a place to stay in Seoul?

457
00:46:23,769 --> 00:46:25,739
I'll be staying with a friend for a little bit.

458
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:27,539
I guess that's why your birthday present came here.

459
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:30,208
Happy birthday. It's your birthday today, isn't it?

460
00:46:30,909 --> 00:46:33,239
We've put the present at the front desk.

461
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:34,878
Excuse me.

462
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,648
By any chance, is the present...

463
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:39,179
It's flowers.

464
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:42,349
- I can't remember what flowers. - Evening primrose,

465
00:46:44,289 --> 00:46:45,358
I know.

466
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:53,199
It's been over 20 years already. Why am I still getting these?

467
00:47:02,139 --> 00:47:04,639
Don't be scared. You've been getting these all your life.

468
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:09,579
What is this?

469
00:47:09,849 --> 00:47:11,219
"Hotel Del Luna"?

470
00:47:18,188 --> 00:47:19,719
(Dear Ku Chan Seong,)

471
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:20,789
(Please be informed that you've been hired at Hotel Del Luna.)

472
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:22,028
(Please come to work from tomorrow.)

473
00:47:22,358 --> 00:47:24,958
Darn it. This hotel actually exists?

474
00:47:25,858 --> 00:47:26,929
There's even an address.

475
00:47:27,969 --> 00:47:29,068
Myeong-dong?

476
00:47:38,938 --> 00:47:40,309
Myeong-dong.

477
00:47:40,648 --> 00:47:41,878
Do I really have to go there?

478
00:47:47,019 --> 00:47:48,749
(Dear Ku Chan Seong, Happy Birthday)

479
00:47:54,528 --> 00:47:57,358
(Dear Ku Chan Seong, Happy Birthday)

480
00:48:07,369 --> 00:48:08,969
Excuse me. Let me through.

481
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:11,008
Excuse me.

482
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,239
Sorry.

483
00:49:09,568 --> 00:49:10,699
Are you the one?

484
00:49:11,469 --> 00:49:12,599
Are you the one that bought me?

485
00:49:14,769 --> 00:49:16,369
I guess you've been preparing yourself for this.

486
00:49:17,378 --> 00:49:19,478
I thought you'd ask me who I am first.

487
00:49:19,478 --> 00:49:21,148
I didn't have to ask.

488
00:49:21,909 --> 00:49:23,918
You're just like how my father described.

489
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:28,048
You're Jang Man Weol, the owner of Hotel Del Luna, right?

490
00:49:29,188 --> 00:49:30,318
The woman...

491
00:49:31,059 --> 00:49:32,188
who has been sending me those flowers every birthday.

492
00:49:33,389 --> 00:49:35,889
Did you throw my flowers away...

493
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,829
every year like you did today?

494
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:39,329
Every time I got them, I got scared...

495
00:49:39,999 --> 00:49:41,499
that what my father told me was true.

496
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:44,469
I was scared that you'd come for me.

497
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:48,739
Is that why you've been moving from one country to another?

498
00:49:48,938 --> 00:49:50,438
So that I wouldn't be able to come and get you?

499
00:49:51,179 --> 00:49:52,679
I've been fleeing,

500
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:54,378
but I didn't expect you to really come for me.

501
00:49:55,249 --> 00:49:57,648
I underestimated you, thinking that everything was over last year.

502
00:49:57,778 --> 00:50:00,048
That's what I expected, which is why I came this year instead.

503
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:02,789
Since I gave you a nice break last year,

504
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:05,119
come and start working for me from tomorrow.

505
00:50:05,458 --> 00:50:07,858
My father told me that you're a scary person.

506
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:10,458
Will you kill me if I say no?

507
00:50:15,068 --> 00:50:16,099
You...

508
00:50:17,269 --> 00:50:18,798
aren't scared of me, are you?

509
00:50:22,008 --> 00:50:25,208
I know, I'm too pretty to look scary.

510
00:50:27,809 --> 00:50:29,108
I agree.

511
00:50:29,778 --> 00:50:31,918
So I'll keep thinking that you're not a scary person...

512
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,179
and continue to reject your offer.

513
00:50:36,289 --> 00:50:38,659
It was a bad idea to send you flowers every birthday.

514
00:50:39,188 --> 00:50:41,188
I should've sent beheaded birds instead.

515
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:46,059
(Dear Ku Chan Seong)

516
00:50:48,068 --> 00:50:49,499
I'll give you something different...

517
00:50:50,228 --> 00:50:51,599
for your birthday this year.

518
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:19,128
(Dear Ku Chan Seong, Happy Birthday)

519
00:51:20,628 --> 00:51:22,369
You must be someone incredibly powerful...

520
00:51:22,369 --> 00:51:24,168
and your hotel must be extremely successful.

521
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:26,898
So why are you trying to get a mere ordinary man like me?

522
00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:30,739
Why can't you just let me go?

523
00:51:40,148 --> 00:51:41,148
Are you...

524
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:46,188
going to make me the beheaded bird as my birthday present?

525
00:52:12,519 --> 00:52:13,679
Don't worry.

526
00:52:14,489 --> 00:52:15,989
You're a weakling.

527
00:52:16,789 --> 00:52:19,159
Your neck is still intact.

528
00:52:23,389 --> 00:52:24,499
What...

529
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:27,329
have you done to me?

530
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:28,829
A present.

531
00:52:31,969 --> 00:52:33,398
Happy birthday.

532
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:37,168
This year's present is going to be a very special one.

533
00:52:37,809 --> 00:52:39,438
(Dear Ku Chan Seong, Happy Birthday)

534
00:52:56,128 --> 00:52:58,628
(Madeul Station)

535
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:00,628
Aren't you going to get off?

536
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,778
You want to spend some more time with me?

537
00:53:14,449 --> 00:53:15,579
(Dear Ku Chan Seong, Happy Birthday)

538
00:53:19,249 --> 00:53:22,588
I didn't mean to throw away the flowers you got for my birthday.

539
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:24,818
It's just that agro and livestock products...

540
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:26,119
are inspected at the airport.

541
00:53:33,798 --> 00:53:36,829
(Madeul Station)

542
00:53:57,489 --> 00:53:59,019
What did she do to me?

543
00:54:02,858 --> 00:54:04,758
What good comes from hiring me at her hotel anyway?

544
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:13,068
Am I going to become her toy?

545
00:54:15,438 --> 00:54:17,508
Chan Seong, run away.

546
00:54:19,978 --> 00:54:21,378
It's a scary place.

547
00:54:23,008 --> 00:54:26,519
I saw a dead person there.

548
00:54:30,188 --> 00:54:32,559
Chan Seong, run away.

549
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:35,289
Run away...

550
00:54:35,429 --> 00:54:37,128
if you ever run into her.

551
00:54:38,429 --> 00:54:39,499
Okay, Father.

552
00:54:43,628 --> 00:54:46,539
Run away. You have to run.

553
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:17,168
Sorry, I won't be able to start working from next week.

554
00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:19,969
I'll explain further by email.

555
00:55:48,668 --> 00:55:51,969
By now, he would have received his birthday gift...

556
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:54,938
and opened his eyes to a whole new world.

557
00:55:55,438 --> 00:55:57,269
He probably can't help but to panic...

558
00:55:57,269 --> 00:56:00,508
when he starts seeing the dead.

559
00:56:00,508 --> 00:56:02,008
He has to get used to it.

560
00:56:02,008 --> 00:56:03,648
He has to work here.

561
00:56:03,809 --> 00:56:05,778
He has to be able to see customers if he works at a hotel.

562
00:56:05,878 --> 00:56:08,188
You said you didn't even warn him.

563
00:56:08,389 --> 00:56:10,019
He might get into a serious accident...

564
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:12,858
if he sees the dead for the first time so unexpectedly.

565
00:56:13,889 --> 00:56:14,889
Is that so?

566
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:19,929
I can't let him die from shock. That'll complicate things.

567
00:56:32,539 --> 00:56:34,608
Excuse me, I was here first.

568
00:56:34,608 --> 00:56:36,608
The first cab that comes is mine.

569
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:42,119
You saw me standing here first all along.

570
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:46,789
You saw me, right?

571
00:56:47,688 --> 00:56:48,929
I didn't.

572
00:56:49,958 --> 00:56:50,999
I can't see you.

573
00:56:55,398 --> 00:56:56,628
Happy birthday.

574
00:56:56,628 --> 00:56:59,999
This year's present is going to be a very special one.

575
00:57:00,539 --> 00:57:03,469
I saw a dead person there.

576
00:57:05,978 --> 00:57:07,079
Where are you?

577
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:10,179
Say something.

578
00:57:17,588 --> 00:57:19,519
Hey, are you going to get in or not?

579
00:57:20,389 --> 00:57:21,458
I'm getting in.

580
00:57:43,309 --> 00:57:45,249
He got one of the scarier ones off the bat.

581
00:57:56,229 --> 00:57:57,599
Where did it go?

582
00:58:20,422 --> 00:58:23,362
Don't come here. Don't come.

583
00:59:06,373 --> 00:59:08,672
Why do you keep on chasing me?

584
00:59:10,112 --> 00:59:11,442
Go away. Go.

585
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:13,083
Go.

586
00:59:13,612 --> 00:59:14,683
Go, go!

587
00:59:16,313 --> 00:59:18,223
She's too harsh on him.

588
00:59:18,382 --> 00:59:19,953
Go away. Go.

589
00:59:19,953 --> 00:59:22,223
She'll make poor Chan Seong faint.

590
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:24,592
Go away! Go!

591
00:59:26,592 --> 00:59:29,032
Don't take them off! Don't take off your sunglasses.

592
00:59:29,793 --> 00:59:30,992
I know you don't have any eyes.

593
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:33,203
You look too scary without them on.

594
00:59:33,663 --> 00:59:35,572
Go. Go away!

595
00:59:35,902 --> 00:59:37,233
Get away from me!

596
01:00:17,712 --> 01:00:19,083
I guess you're travelling far.

597
01:00:25,753 --> 01:00:26,753
Yes.

598
01:00:27,623 --> 01:00:29,293
The present I gave to you...

599
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:32,592
won't get caught at customs at international airports.

600
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:33,992
You won't ever be able to get rid of it.

601
01:00:34,592 --> 01:00:35,592
It's too bad.

602
01:00:36,092 --> 01:00:38,603
Are you the one who sent me that strange thing earlier?

603
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,003
No, I didn't send anything. You're just able to see it.

604
01:00:43,402 --> 01:00:45,543
You're just able to see things...

605
01:00:45,902 --> 01:00:47,172
you weren't able to earlier.

606
01:00:48,143 --> 01:00:50,172
- And what is that? - The dead souls.

607
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:55,612
Darn it.

608
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:58,853
There's a famous restaurant around here that was on television.

609
01:00:59,353 --> 01:01:00,552
Let's go there.

610
01:01:01,253 --> 01:01:02,253
A restaurant?

611
01:01:02,253 --> 01:01:04,253
I wanted to go, so this is great.

612
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:06,362
What are you doing? Let's go.

613
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:09,933
If I don't follow you,

614
01:01:11,362 --> 01:01:13,262
will something like what I saw earlier come to kill me?

615
01:01:13,532 --> 01:01:14,672
You won't die.

616
01:01:15,132 --> 01:01:17,603
What you saw earlier has no power to kill the living.

617
01:01:18,172 --> 01:01:20,302
Not unless your feeble heart fails from being startled.

618
01:01:20,773 --> 01:01:21,813
Happy?

619
01:01:22,973 --> 01:01:24,942
That restaurant closes soon. We're going to be late.

620
01:01:25,512 --> 01:01:28,183
Turn it back. Turn my eyes back to normal.

621
01:01:28,413 --> 01:01:30,183
I won't go anywhere before you do that.

622
01:01:34,753 --> 01:01:37,692
If that restaurant closes because you delay us,

623
01:01:39,023 --> 01:01:41,393
your eyes will remain closed.

624
01:01:44,762 --> 01:01:46,233
Forever.

625
01:01:55,672 --> 01:01:56,973
Open your eyes.

626
01:01:57,112 --> 01:01:59,242
Humans die when they get hungry.

627
01:01:59,543 --> 01:02:01,483
I brought you here so you won't die.

628
01:02:01,853 --> 01:02:04,483
Do you know "The Guys Who Died After Eating"?

629
01:02:04,822 --> 01:02:07,382
This restaurant is where they came to eat 30 orders of dumplings.

630
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:10,092
They can't eat it anymore.

631
01:02:13,762 --> 01:02:15,233
(Out of ingredients: We ran short of what we prepared today.)

632
01:02:15,233 --> 01:02:16,262
See?

633
01:02:16,563 --> 01:02:18,703
We almost didn't get any food if we were any later.

634
01:02:23,703 --> 01:02:25,742
Gosh, I better move that.

635
01:02:58,873 --> 01:03:01,512
It's the wench who shot a bullet at me.

636
01:03:08,712 --> 01:03:12,253
Do I have to look at such scary things all the time?

637
01:03:12,382 --> 01:03:14,223
You were just unlucky.

638
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:16,393
You ended up seeing one of the more hideous ones.

639
01:03:16,652 --> 01:03:18,163
Not all of them are as scary.

640
01:03:20,293 --> 01:03:22,333
Right. Him. Look at him.

641
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:24,962
Someone like him isn't so scary.

642
01:03:25,563 --> 01:03:28,003
If you only get a glimpse,

643
01:03:28,003 --> 01:03:29,973
you might just pass along thinking he's a human.

644
01:03:31,003 --> 01:03:33,973
Most of them are like him, so don't be a coward.

645
01:03:34,473 --> 01:03:35,813
What is he doing over there?

646
01:03:36,043 --> 01:03:37,612
Some of them wander around because they died suddenly...

647
01:03:37,612 --> 01:03:39,212
and they don't realize they're dead.

648
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:42,313
Some of them get obsessed with what they liked...

649
01:03:42,313 --> 01:03:44,253
when they were alive.

650
01:03:45,183 --> 01:03:46,453
Is he obsessed with dumplings?

651
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:48,083
It's hard to tell.

652
01:03:48,353 --> 01:03:50,393
Why did you make me see such a thing?

653
01:03:51,862 --> 01:03:53,623
You'll find out when you come to Hotel Del Luna.

654
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:58,833
Why didn't you come when I told you to?

655
01:03:58,833 --> 01:04:01,203
Then you didn't have to go through all this trouble.

656
01:04:01,773 --> 01:04:02,833
Gosh, that's hot.

657
01:04:04,302 --> 01:04:06,172
This is so hot.

658
01:04:06,473 --> 01:04:08,913
How did Kim Joon Hyun have 5 of them in 1 bite?

659
01:04:09,313 --> 01:04:10,842
He amazed me.

660
01:04:13,313 --> 01:04:14,382
You should try it too.

661
01:04:15,212 --> 01:04:17,052
You're the amazing one.

662
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:20,253
At a glimpse and even up close, you look like a normal person.

663
01:04:20,253 --> 01:04:21,753
Are you sure you're dead too?

664
01:04:24,793 --> 01:04:25,992
I'm not dead.

665
01:04:27,262 --> 01:04:28,492
I still haven't died.

666
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:30,833
I'm just here.

667
01:04:38,603 --> 01:04:41,773
What do you mean, "still"? Do you mean you might die one day?

668
01:04:42,242 --> 01:04:43,512
Why do you ask?

669
01:04:44,373 --> 01:04:47,012
Will you try to kill me?

670
01:04:53,822 --> 01:04:55,023
Try having them in one bite.

671
01:04:56,023 --> 01:04:57,492
If you succeed, I'll give you a chance.

672
01:05:02,862 --> 01:05:03,933
I just...

673
01:05:05,433 --> 01:05:07,703
want you to disappear from my sight.

674
01:05:21,782 --> 01:05:23,652
Ku Chan Seong, the one who hates seeing me.

675
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:25,953
Go across the street to buy me a milk tea...

676
01:05:25,953 --> 01:05:27,223
so I can die after eating.

677
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:29,253
Doesn't she know how many dumplings she had?

678
01:05:29,793 --> 01:05:31,592
Is she sure she finds Kim Joon Hyun amazing?

679
01:05:32,123 --> 01:05:33,293
She's not a human.

680
01:05:33,793 --> 01:05:34,862
Hurry up.

681
01:05:35,233 --> 01:05:37,092
If it closes because you're late, you'll die.

682
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:08,333
You're the one who shot me, aren't you?

683
01:06:08,692 --> 01:06:10,032
I'm sure you shot me.

684
01:06:12,603 --> 01:06:13,632
Your crime was severe,

685
01:06:13,632 --> 01:06:14,973
so I guess that's why you've become a wreck.

686
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:18,302
You can look forward to your afterlife.

687
01:06:19,203 --> 01:06:20,473
It'll be even worse.

688
01:06:25,313 --> 01:06:26,913
It's all your fault.

689
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:28,583
It's your fault.

690
01:06:32,723 --> 01:06:35,353
Die!

691
01:07:12,148 --> 01:07:13,288
Who are you?

692
01:07:25,967 --> 01:07:27,898
Were you stabbed?

693
01:07:29,267 --> 01:07:31,467
Why is it that humans...

694
01:07:33,038 --> 01:07:35,738
never think about their wrongs and only blame others?

695
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,938
I said, are you okay?

696
01:07:42,347 --> 01:07:45,417
I don't dare mock that dirty old man.

697
01:07:47,887 --> 01:07:49,557
I was once just as crazy...

698
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:52,587
and carried a knife with me.

699
01:07:54,627 --> 01:07:55,797
Ku Chan Seong.

700
01:07:56,227 --> 01:07:57,557
You failed to eat those dumplings in one bite,

701
01:07:57,557 --> 01:07:58,898
but I'll give you the second chance.

702
01:08:01,267 --> 01:08:02,767
If you want to run away, go.

703
01:08:10,078 --> 01:08:12,177
If you turn around and walk away now,

704
01:08:14,078 --> 01:08:15,847
I'll disappear from your sight...

705
01:08:17,818 --> 01:08:19,818
just as you wanted.

706
01:08:24,087 --> 01:08:25,127
Go.

707
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:38,568
If you don't leave now, you'll be late.

708
01:09:40,227 --> 01:09:41,328
What is this?

709
01:09:41,368 --> 01:09:43,667
I'll help you get up. Get on this cart.

710
01:09:44,698 --> 01:09:47,408
I'll take you to a hospital or Hotel Del Luna.

711
01:09:47,938 --> 01:09:49,007
Hurry.

712
01:09:51,778 --> 01:09:52,807
What's wrong with you?

713
01:09:52,807 --> 01:09:54,578
I don't have the energy to carry you in my arms.

714
01:09:54,948 --> 01:09:56,417
This thing isn't dirty, so get on.

715
01:10:09,898 --> 01:10:10,998
This is...

716
01:10:17,667 --> 01:10:18,738
Are you okay?

717
01:10:19,007 --> 01:10:20,167
Ku Chan Seong.

718
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,307
You're really...

719
01:10:25,908 --> 01:10:27,078
a frail man, aren't you?

720
01:10:34,818 --> 01:10:37,387
You dragged this cart over.

721
01:10:37,658 --> 01:10:39,958
I like...

722
01:10:41,188 --> 01:10:42,257
your feeble heart very much.

723
01:10:42,398 --> 01:10:44,458
You're an amazing person who won't die from a knife stab.

724
01:10:44,727 --> 01:10:46,767
I guess this frail person wasted his time.

725
01:10:47,297 --> 01:10:49,568
I'll go on my way, then.

726
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:51,337
You can't go.

727
01:11:10,818 --> 01:11:11,818
What are you doing?

728
01:11:23,837 --> 01:11:24,898
You...

729
01:11:25,868 --> 01:11:26,967
Are you really trying to...

730
01:12:11,717 --> 01:12:15,087
I gave you the chance to run away, but you gave that up.

731
01:12:17,288 --> 01:12:18,788
If you run away now,

732
01:12:21,158 --> 01:12:22,358
I'll kill you.

733
01:13:04,538 --> 01:13:08,337
(Hotel Del Luna)

734
01:13:09,538 --> 01:13:11,908
What are you trying to make me do there?

735
01:13:11,908 --> 01:13:12,977
Exorcism?

736
01:13:12,977 --> 01:13:14,108
No, not an exorcism.

737
01:13:14,248 --> 01:13:15,818
It's healing.

738
01:13:16,047 --> 01:13:18,047
Wouldn't it be dangerous for me to get too close?

739
01:13:18,047 --> 01:13:20,587
Then address me properly. It's "Ms. Jang".

740
01:13:20,748 --> 01:13:22,618
I got my MBA from Harvard...

741
01:13:22,618 --> 01:13:23,658
You don't need your MBA.

742
01:13:23,658 --> 01:13:24,988
You can see ghosts now.

743
01:13:25,158 --> 01:13:28,328
How can I live normally when I can see ghosts?

744
01:13:28,828 --> 01:13:31,727
Go see the chairman and promise to get rid of the tiger...

745
01:13:31,727 --> 01:13:32,797
in return for money.

746
01:13:32,868 --> 01:13:34,127
You told me it wouldn't be dangerous.

747
01:13:34,127 --> 01:13:37,038
Come to Hotel Del Luna. You'll be safe beside me.
