1
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,503
Was...

2
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,797
Go Cheong-myeong

3
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,717
there to meet her?

4
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,847
Chan-sung, come here!

5
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,977
This came for you.

6
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,019
HOTEL DEL LUNA

7
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,646
It's from Man-wol.

8
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,106
-It's from Jang Man-wol?
-Yes.

9
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,530
THANK YOU

10
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,407
"Thank you"?

11
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,784
Don't run away.

12
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,663
Even if I go berserk, do crazy things,

13
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,833
and vanish one day,

14
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,669
please stay by my side.

15
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,216
I won't let you vanish.

16
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,094
Trust me.

17
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,764
She fired a competent guy like you,

18
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,892
but she eventually
ended up reinstating you.

19
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,768
I guess she wants to be nice to you now.

20
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,729
My sincerity touched her heart.

21
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,075
My god, what's this?
Is this a tiger print suit?

22
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,621
Make sure you get a good price for this.

23
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,958
Then as a reward,
I'll get you a tiger print suit like this.

24
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,419
God, she's unbelievable.

25
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,881
This is a luxury brand. It's really sexy.

26
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,841
You should try it on. It'll look funny.

27
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,344
No, forget it.
Who wears tiger print suits?

28
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,680
But if you don't wear it,
Man-wol will feel upset.

29
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,515
It looks really expensive.

30
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,768
And it'll upset me as well.

31
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,478
I want to see how it looks on you.

32
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,109
I didn't give her the money I got
from selling the painting.

33
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,403
Where did she get the money to buy this?

34
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,075
She wouldn't go to a luxury brand store
just to get a suit for me.

35
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,827
Hey, this is actually really nice.

36
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,664
Veronica's coming to Korea next week.
How about I buy the same suit?

37
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,667
It might make me look
really wild and different.

38
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,835
No, don't do that.
You don't want to shock her.

39
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,923
You know nothing
about being in a relationship.

40
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,759
It's necessary to surprise
your partner once in a while.

41
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:20,718
Whatever.

42
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,471
Man-wol said she was going
to a department store the other day.

43
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,014
I guess that's when she got this.

44
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,642
You met Jang Man-wol?

45
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,893
Yes, a few days ago.

46
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,689
She asked me to help her sell something
she inherited from her grandfather.

47
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,608
What? "Something she inherited
from her grandfather"?

48
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,615
They're a couple of pure Arabian horses
on a farm in Qatar.

49
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,368
I heard even the royal family
wants to have those horses.

50
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,120
Do you think you can help me sell them?

51
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,499
Sanchez, are you close to Mansour
by any chance?

52
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,625
Mansour?

53
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,504
No, I'm not.
But purebred horses are very rare.

54
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,340
So someone in my equestrian club
will want to buy them.

55
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,134
That's great news.

56
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,053
If you help me sell those horses
at a high price,

57
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,725
I'll get you a white suit
just like this one.

58
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,728
But why are you asking me for help
instead of Chan-sung?

59
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,730
I can't trust him.

60
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,814
Why not?

61
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,485
He just got reinstated,
so he's really busy.

62
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,821
Please help me with this, Sanchez.

63
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:26,075
If you ever happen to come
to my hotel in the future,

64
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,535
I promise that I'll treat you well.

65
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,288
Oh, really?

66
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,956
Of course.

67
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,833
My gosh.

68
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,048
The chairman...

69
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,181
I sold the horses for your sake.

70
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,850
By the way,
those horses are really expensive.

71
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,853
She got those horses in return
for letting him make the dream call.

72
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,563
I should never be off my guard.

73
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,441
I should always make sure
to tighten the reins.

74
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,164
Mr. Koo. All the guests are
requesting the special service.

75
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,417
They heard of this
because of Chairman Wang,

76
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,337
so many of them wish to make
a dream call to the living people.

77
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,172
This is a service

78
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,299
that Ms. Jang has only offered in secret

79
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,552
to guests who pay special fees.
What should we do?

80
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,971
We should be fair
in providing our service.

81
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,098
I'll handle this.

82
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,694
Okay.

83
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,204
Hey.

84
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,875
What? Why didn't you put it on?

85
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,711
I was looking forward to seeing you
dressed in tiger print.

86
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,171
This is my workplace.

87
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,882
If the owner says it's fine,
then it's fine.

88
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,970
See? I even bought this
to wear when you come dressed

89
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,721
like a tiger.

90
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,850
That's a horse print. A zebra.

91
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,352
What do you think? Pretty, isn't it?

92
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,728
It gets on my nerves.

93
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,480
You don't like it?

94
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,774
You're so picky.

95
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,445
Fine, if you don't like
tiger prints or zebra prints,

96
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,531
then let's go. I'll get you
something that's your cup of tea.

97
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,824
We have no time to do that.

98
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,370
We have a lot of special requests
from our guests.

99
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,705
You need to take care of them.

100
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:45,214
A dream call is only offered to those
who pay a special price.

101
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,300
You already got paid.

102
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,178
The horses. You took the horses.

103
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,804
Darn you, Sanchez.

104
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,724
I won't meddle with that money,

105
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,101
but you have to help the other guests.

106
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,394
REQUEST FOR SPECIAL SERVICE

107
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,314
Chan-sung, do you think

108
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,983
the dead will only say nice things
when they appear in a dream?

109
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,360
"I died because of you.
You have to die with me."

110
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,113
What if they resent and curse the living?

111
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,703
Resentment and cursing.

112
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,998
That's why I look into each and every one
of their cases

113
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,168
and take a special price
only when the circumstances look right.

114
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,753
It's not just about money!

115
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,132
You're right.

116
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,134
I had the wrong idea about you.

117
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,011
It wasn't because of money.

118
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,555
You were concerned.

119
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,934
Yes. It's all for my guests' sake.

120
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,603
I only do it for those
who can pull this off.

121
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,271
What do you take me for?

122
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,107
In that case,

123
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,735
I will make some rules
to single out those who can do this.

124
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,284
Seriously!

125
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,997
I'm the one who took the horses.
Why is he acting like that?

126
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,836
I'll tell you the secret
to our naengmyeon stock.

127
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,881
It's because you were
the most diligent one among my staff.

128
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,758
Listen up.

129
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,844
Naengmyeon?

130
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,638
I love naengmyeon too.

131
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,931
The secret is...

132
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,813
My gosh.

133
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,316
Is that you?

134
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,361
Thank you so much for everything.

135
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,990
Your band's music gave me
much comfort to my last breath.

136
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,659
-"Your band"?
-He must be in a band.

137
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,078
I knew your music and dance

138
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,998
would end up touching
the heart of the world.

139
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,874
That's not for someone she actually knew.

140
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,792
Look, it says...

141
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,210
I WISH TO TELL SOMEONE I LOVE...

142
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,920
I love you!

143
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,797
I'll love you forever!

144
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,933
Having fun?

145
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,561
Stay on top of everything, will you?

146
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,855
Yes.

147
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,615
He's leaving today,

148
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,992
and he wishes to talk to his wife
before he leaves.

149
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,245
Am I allowed to make only one call?

150
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,080
Yes, just one call.

151
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,543
In that case, I wish to call someone else.

152
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,548
I got into a car accident with my son.

153
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,389
I wish to talk to the man
who hit us with the truck.

154
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,601
You cannot make a call
to blame or curse someone.

155
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:44,810
Please leave.

156
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,979
It's not that I wish
to blame or curse him.

157
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,775
I wish to apologize to him.

158
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,827
I'm glad you were just put on probation.

159
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,331
Glad? Two people were
hit by my truck and died.

160
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,962
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

161
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,675
I can't do this job anymore.

162
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,470
If you quit this job,
how will you make a living?

163
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,697
You are the people I killed...

164
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,245
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,622
I'm so sorry.

166
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,542
I can't be forgiven for what I have done.

167
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,296
We're sorry.

168
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,428
It's our fault for suddenly jumping
in front of your truck.

169
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,013
It was a mistake.

170
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,142
We had bad luck,

171
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,936
but we gave you too much pain.

172
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,438
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,655
I hope

174
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,700
your life doesn't get ruined
because of us.

175
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,785
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,663
And thank you.

177
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,181
I feel much better now.

178
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,558
Son, shall we go?

179
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,021
Thank you.

180
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,081
Should we call it a day?

181
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,795
We only have a few guests left.
Let's finish up today.

182
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,130
Tell them to come in.

183
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,309
The flowers are in full bloom.

184
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,395
Let's not be too worried.

185
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,523
The flowers have finally bloomed.

186
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,651
They might stay pretty like this
for a long time.

187
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,987
Mago is trying to take Ms. Jang.

188
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,824
Flowers bloom only to fall.

189
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,703
We have to go before Ms. Jang does,

190
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,581
so let's prepare ourselves for that day.

191
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,765
Gosh, I'm so tired.

192
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:15,271
Do you know how tiring it is
to let ghosts talk to the living?

193
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,361
But thanks to you, many people will smile
when they wake up from their dreams today.

194
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,739
You've done well,
so I'll make you smile too.

195
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:27,950
What?

196
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,410
How?

197
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,745
Are you going to put on
the tiger print suit?

198
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,165
I knew it. You sent that to me
to make me look ridiculous.

199
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,502
Hey, if I put in that much money
to have a good laugh,

200
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,920
it means I tried very hard.

201
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,756
I tried very hard to make you laugh too.

202
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,467
I made a reservation
at the rice cake soup place

203
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,846
where you failed to eat
and came back angry many times.

204
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,514
Let's go.

205
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,849
What?

206
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,144
They don't take reservations. It takes
at least two hours to get a table.

207
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,688
I used my connection from Harvard.

208
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,398
Can you major in rice cake soup
at Harvard?

209
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,150
The son of that restaurant is an alumnus.

210
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,280
I reserved the entire place
at the closing time.

211
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,074
Let us hurry.

212
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,827
Hey, wait.

213
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,080
You should change into an outfit
that fits the soup.

214
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,751
This isn't an ordinary rice cake soup.
It's made with bead-shaped cakes.

215
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,961
I'll wear something special.

216
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,418
Look here.

217
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,920
I'm okay.

218
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,217
Sanchez is only three years older than me.

219
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,636
If I eat three bowls
of rice cake soup today,

220
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,888
can I talk casually to you
like Sanchez does?

221
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,390
What?

222
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,434
Sanchez calls you by your first name.

223
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,813
You want to be on a first name basis
with me?

224
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,737
Okay, just eat 1,300 bowls
of rice cake soup.

225
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,323
Even Kim Jun-hyun can't eat that much.

226
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,117
Don't underestimate Kim Jun-hyun.

227
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,327
Okay, then.

228
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,122
One rice cake will be worth one year.

229
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,374
No, one rice cake for one hundred years.

230
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,712
You fraud from Harvard!
You think you could age that easily?

231
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,339
After I eat 13 rice cakes,

232
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,341
I'll start calling you Man-wol.

233
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,386
Do as you please.

234
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,723
When a human ages 1,300 years, he dies.

235
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,934
Challenge. I'll take 200 years first.

236
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,355
It tastes better
because it's worth 200 years.

237
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,525
Being on a roll, I add 300 years more.

238
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,658
They look so pretty now.

239
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,036
Why must they fall?

240
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,330
It's sad.

241
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,744
Now I have 300 years left.

242
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,329
Are you nervous?

243
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,456
Then, I just have to eat 500 years more.

244
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,540
Are you stupid?

245
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,084
I will eat faster.

246
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,835
No, I will eat faster.

247
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,545
I now have 100 years left.

248
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,172
Add 200 years for me.

249
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,174
I was famous for eating fast at Harvard.

250
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,759
I'm already 3,500 years old.

251
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,011
-Adding 600 years.
-I'm 3,600 years old now.

252
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,055
You can't beat me. Just acknowledge it.

253
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,681
I'll also eat those earrings after this.

254
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,724
Nonsense.

255
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,018
I've found the motive for the murders.

256
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,271
It's this website called Helllo.

257
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,273
Helllo? Is it some social club?

258
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:13,110
It's "Hell" and "lo," meaning "to Hell."

259
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,821
The name is a play on words.

260
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,157
Helllo. What is the website for?

261
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,243
It's an old community
with more than 100 thousand members.

262
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,620
At first, they just shared
their problems on it.

263
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,874
But it's gradually become a real hell.

264
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,169
Now, they post curses and slanders
about other people.

265
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,088
It's like an emotional trash can.

266
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,382
-So?
-The suspect posted

267
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,217
several slanders about his wife.

268
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:41,138
He wrote comments on slanders
about six others who were killed.

269
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,056
The slanders about the victims

270
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,475
had a high number of views and comments.

271
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,689
Now you're looking
at the post and comments

272
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,191
criticizing one of the victims.

273
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,984
KILL, KILL!

274
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,361
If one uploads a slandering post
about people he hates,

275
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,698
the others curse them together.
That's what they do on the website.

276
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,701
What about the suspect?
Did he carry out the curse?

277
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,412
He thinks he's some kind of demon?

278
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,081
Except for Lee Do-yeon,
the wife of the suspect,

279
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,251
the victims were killed by someone
who they had never met.

280
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,295
They didn't even know why.

281
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,467
So this man is not the killer, right?

282
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,554
I told you. I was right.

283
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,640
The owner of that car is the killer.

284
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,226
There was a ghost in that car too.
You saw it.

285
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,437
But you can't call the police
without any evidence.

286
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,066
There's the composite sketch.

287
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,944
That thing you always see
in criminal investigation dramas.

288
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,195
Let's do that.

289
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,822
I'm good at drawing.

290
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,412
You'll get into trouble
if Ms. Jang finds out about this.

291
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:51,124
Tell me everything you remember about him.

292
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,209
Tell me anything.

293
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:57,130
81GI 0963

294
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,810
I didn't meet the Koo Chan-sung guy.

295
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,436
I moved the stuff with a high school girl.

296
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,148
I really had a hard time
because my car broke down.

297
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,443
Do you know the girl's name
or her phone number?

298
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,112
I don't know her phone number.

299
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,698
She contacted us through the SNS account.

300
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,201
Do you really work
at an entertainment agency?

301
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,495
Are you a casting director?

302
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,621
I guess.

303
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,416
She is quite attractive,
so I wanted to meet her.

304
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,377
She can't be in show business.
She's really weird.

305
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,170
What's weird about her?

306
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,089
She's soft in the head.

307
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,049
No, she's not crazy. She sees ghosts.

308
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,259
That's right.

309
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:43,844
Ghosts?

310
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,721
Yes, she sees ghosts.

311
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,889
Everyone in our schools knows.

312
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,977
You shouldn't make up rumors
about your friend like that.

313
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,813
I'm telling the truth.
She talks to herself.

314
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,107
She follows someone when there is nobody.

315
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,819
She follows ghosts?

316
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,326
That's interesting.

317
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,506
Mr. Kim, I looked at the new menu.

318
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,967
You changed the name of
our signature cocktail, Tears,

319
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,510
to Tear Wine.

320
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,472
Ms. Jang said it was too pretentious.

321
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,557
Why? It was a good name.

322
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,477
Tears and cheers.

323
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,604
It has a nice ring to it.

324
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,732
A Harvard graduate like you
thinks it's not bad, right?

325
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,109
Ms. Jang's picking on me for no reason.

326
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,861
It's the signature cocktail of our bar,

327
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,696
so I think you should work on it
a bit more.

328
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,824
Something like Angel's Tears
or Devil's Tears.

329
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,619
You think so? Angel and Devil?

330
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,205
I will make a note and give it to you.

331
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:57,250
Harvard knows how to teach
their students properly.

332
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:06,218
What are the guests doing
in the middle of the day?

333
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,471
They are those who were killed
and buried secretly.

334
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,140
I heard we had those guests.

335
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,184
I heard the killer was caught.

336
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,061
That's what I heard too.

337
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,897
But Ms. Fourth Choice keeps saying
something is not right.

338
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,656
I don't think the man
the police caught is the culprit.

339
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,617
There was a ghost in this car too.

340
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,245
The owner of this car is suspicious.

341
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,500
81GI 0963

342
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,089
Yu-na, you're still too young.

343
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,133
You shouldn't get involved
in a violent crime like this.

344
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,218
I agree. You should concentrate on school.

345
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,265
Then, let me finish the sketch
I've been drawing.

346
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,475
I'll show it to you when I finish it.

347
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,769
I'll look into it if there's any problem.

348
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,104
So you have to tell me.

349
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,230
Okay.

350
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,736
REQUEST FOR SPECIAL SERVICE

351
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,364
They are the additional service requests
we have received today.

352
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,949
Oh, dear.

353
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,703
It's such a bother.

354
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,588
You probably saw the flowers.
Why aren't you saying anything?

355
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,965
Have you all decided to get on the bus
to the afterlife?

356
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,968
We are preparing ourselves for the worst.

357
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,219
And I...

358
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:36,308
will leave after I see
that family completely destroyed.

359
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,982
You told me your daughter had to die

360
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,776
for the family to carry on
their family line.

361
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,532
No matter how impatient you feel,

362
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,077
you must not do what you did 42 years ago.

363
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,709
If you become an evil ghost and vanish,

364
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,127
your 200 years

365
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,715
of hard work at this hotel
will go down the drain.

366
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:15,639
My grudge is so deep
that I don't care about those years.

367
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,981
There will be a lunar eclipse soon.

368
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,316
Yes.

369
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,861
I hear the moon will be covered
for quite a while this time.

370
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,947
I'll prepare for it.

371
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,006
Sir.

372
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,593
Do you need anything?

373
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,596
I'm thirsty.

374
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,640
I'll bring something to drink
to your room.

375
00:25:58,848 --> 00:25:59,891
This way.

376
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,244
A long lunar eclipse...

377
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,495
Mr. Koo Chan-sung,
we need you to come with us.

378
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,016
We brought him.

379
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,980
Come closer.

380
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,447
Who are you, and why did you look for me?

381
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,291
Do you recognize me?

382
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,169
Of course.
I even saw you on today's morning paper.

383
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,298
I've been admiring you.

384
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,593
But why did you call for me?

385
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,179
I hear you're working at a hotel
that's registered

386
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,264
at the Jung-gu District Office.

387
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,895
Yes, that's right.

388
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,982
Will you take me to that hotel?

389
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,360
I'd like to meet with the owner.

390
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,154
Do you know...

391
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:20,615
my boss?

392
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,368
Hotel del Luna's Ms. Jang Man-wol.

393
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,625
I used to be

394
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,920
a manager who served Ms. Jang
at the hotel.

395
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,897
Didn't you get off work early today?

396
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,150
I brought a pleasant guest.

397
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,366
Ji Hyeon-jung,

398
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,827
do you still skip work
and leave the front desk unattended?

399
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,204
Ms. Hwang!

400
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,750
Goodness.

401
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,960
What brings you here?

402
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,590
You're not dead, are you?

403
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,050
You still can't tell the difference?
I'm alive.

404
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,677
You scared me.

405
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,265
By the way,
should I call you President Hwang now?

406
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,850
I'm only a candidate for now.

407
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,440
Mr. Kim. Ms. Choe.

408
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,192
Ms. Hwang is here.

409
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,862
My goodness. You two are still here.

410
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,071
Ms. Hwang.

411
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,449
It's been a long time.

412
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,159
It's been a while.

413
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,411
Has it been over 30 years
since we last met?

414
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,871
You've gotten old.

415
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,873
You still make
such straightforward comments.

416
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,295
Do you have a lot of guests
at the hotel right now?

417
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,963
I can't see anyone else

418
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,882
other than the hotel's employees now.

419
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,553
There are a few.

420
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,557
There's Ms. Jang.

421
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,080
Your hotel has become so big.

422
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,873
It's all thanks to you, Mun-suk.

423
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,959
Thanks to the money you made back then,

424
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,461
we were able to move to Myeong-dong
and got big.

425
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,923
It seems you've become a big shot too.

426
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,675
I saw you a lot on the phone.

427
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,636
I hear you'll become a president
of somewhere big soon.

428
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,805
I'm just a candidate for now.

429
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,182
I'm thankful you let me free.

430
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,311
Do you think I let you go
because I wanted to?

431
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:59,399
Mago thought someone talented like you
shouldn't be tied up to a place like this.

432
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,442
She gave you the medicine behind my back,

433
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,571
and you couldn't see ghosts anymore.
So I had no choice but to let you go.

434
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:08,032
I wish you had stayed
for a few more years back then

435
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,492
and made more money for me.

436
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,495
I'd have quite a lot of land
in Gangnam right now.

437
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,498
Thanks to the experience here,

438
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,500
the way I see the world

439
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,420
and the things I value
have changed greatly.

440
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,591
Sure. It seems like
you are doing a lot of good work.

441
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,843
Why are you here anyway?

442
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,346
I have a favor to ask of you.

443
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,892
A favor?

444
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,228
Of course.

445
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,106
I know there's nothing
you would miss here.

446
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,609
You must be here
because you want something.

447
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,277
Oh, right.

448
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:49,574
I brought a present
that might suit you well.

449
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,702
Gosh.

450
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,997
You shouldn't have brought such a thing.

451
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,211
Oh, my god.

452
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,590
Okay. What's the favor you want?

453
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,427
It's something trivial,
but very important.

454
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:15,475
We're getting
another big lunar eclipse after 39 years.

455
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,482
This country was seeing
an economic revival at that time.

456
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,233
And thanks to Mun-suk's appearance,

457
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,111
Ms. Jang was able to turn the poor
business into a successful one,

458
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:31,282
laying the groundwork for the wealth
and luxury she's enjoying now.

459
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,826
She worked here
for about seven to eight years.

460
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,455
I never imagined such a person
would've worked here as a manager.

461
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:41,459
Because Ms. Jang doesn't leave
any traces of the human managers

462
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,586
who used to work here.

463
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,215
However,

464
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,344
I wonder why she came here when she has
such a big event happening soon.

465
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,098
We're going to take human guests?
Is that possible?

466
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,767
Yes, because a lunar eclipse is coming.

467
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,686
Are things different with a lunar eclipse?

468
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,479
When the moon's covered during an eclipse,

469
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,524
the Guest House of the Moon's presence
is exposed.

470
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,944
That's why we get quite a few human guests
during eclipses.

471
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,990
Even humans are able to see our ghost
guests when they come into our hotel.

472
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,659
So, do we accept human guests
on the day of the lunar eclipse?

473
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,828
The front desk turns them away, of course.

474
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,246
But...

475
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,416
Did that happen in 1981?

476
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:24,127
When Mun-suk was here
during a lunar eclipse,

477
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,963
some newlyweds stayed at our hotel.

478
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:32,218
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
it's past the curfew.

479
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,470
-I'm sorry.
-Is it this way?

480
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,763
Yes. That way.

481
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,807
HOTEL DEL LUNA

482
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,767
I think this is a hotel.

483
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,690
The lunar eclipse better end soon.

484
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,612
-Excuse me.
-Do you have a room?

485
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,493
Newlyweds?

486
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,872
They came to Seoul for their honeymoon,
and now it's past curfew.

487
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,331
If we turn them away now,

488
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,876
they'll have to spend
their first night at the police station.

489
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,127
I feel bad for them.

490
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,466
Let them in, then.

491
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,442
This is your room.

492
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,738
Please go in.

493
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,490
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

494
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,908
Thank you so much.

495
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:48,377
The couple spent
their first night at our hotel.

496
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,298
At that night, a human baby was conceived
for the first time

497
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,383
at this ghost hotel.

498
00:34:56,677 --> 00:35:01,057
And that baby grew up to be
Korea's most talented soccer player.

499
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,404
Really?

500
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,241
He got conceived here?

501
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,577
Yes, apparently. I was shocked too
when I heard about it earlier.

502
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:26,666
Anyway, he's going to become
Mun-suk's son-in-law.

503
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,709
-Really?
-She went to meet her future in-laws

504
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,963
and met the newlywed couple.
They were all so surprised.

505
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,465
What an interesting coincidence.

506
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:39,220
But then again,
this place is full of unimaginable things.

507
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,098
I guess it's natural that the baby
turned out to be someone special.

508
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,350
She wants us to let her daughter
and future son-in-law

509
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:48,479
stay here for one night so they can
also experience the same thing.

510
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,943
Then, are we going to let them stay
in the room that the King stayed in?

511
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,445
No, they're humans.

512
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,281
They should stay in Room 404.

513
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,366
Room 404?

514
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,543
But no one can check out of that room.

515
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,714
The only way you can check out
of our hotel is head for the afterlife.

516
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,842
Then how are they supposed to check out
of Room 404?

517
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,180
Are you worried about them?

518
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,811
Then why don't you go in there
and check for yourself?

519
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,775
On the night of this year's lunar eclipse,

520
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,028
we'll be welcoming human guests.

521
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,699
They're newlyweds.
It'll be their honeymoon.

522
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,665
They made an official reservation
this time,

523
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,083
so get ready to treat them well.

524
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,251
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

525
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:42,260
We need to get food and decorations
that are fit for humans.

526
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,345
I'm excited to hear
that we'll be getting human guests.

527
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,555
But where's our manager?

528
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,140
He went inside Room 404.

529
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,978
Then I guess he won't be
returning tonight.

530
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:56,524
Whatever the case, I'm really excited.

531
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,036
Veronica.

532
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,580
Are you in Wai Tan in Shanghai?

533
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,625
Yes, I was in a meeting,
but I came out to eat lunch now.

534
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:18,504
-Sanchez, I'm so upset at you.
-Why? Why are you upset?

535
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,173
I miss you so much.

536
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:25,636
You really make it hard
for me to focus on work.

537
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,430
I'm going to scold you.

538
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:31,267
Veronica, I can't wait to meet you
so you can scold me.

539
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:34,895
Veronica.

540
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:39,317
I found a way to get scolded by you
forever. You can look forward to it.

541
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,571
Gosh, what are you
going to surprise me with this time?

542
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,491
I can't tell you. You can come here
and check for yourself.

543
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,868
Chan-sung's here.

544
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,037
Say hello.

545
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,831
Hey, Chan-sung.

546
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,333
Hi, Veronica.

547
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,419
Veronica, I'll call you later.

548
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,173
I love you. Goodbye, my love.

549
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,883
Bye.

550
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,886
-Is Veronica coming to Korea?
-Yes.

551
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,181
She's in Shanghai right now.
She's going to come in two days.

552
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,724
So I've been thinking...

553
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,231
I'm planning to do
something really important.

554
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,859
And I'm thinking about doing it
at your hotel.

555
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,278
My hotel?

556
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,781
Veronica's been to all kinds
of hotels all over the world.

557
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,033
When I told her that you work
at a really special hotel,

558
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,327
she wanted to take a look.
I'm also quite curious.

559
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,954
No, you can't do it at my hotel.

560
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:38,042
Chan-sung, you're not exactly working
at a decent hotel, are you?

561
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,752
-What?
-You had to invite someone

562
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,295
to our house to sell a painting.

563
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,339
And Man-wol even asked me
to sell her horses.

564
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,383
Are you guys struggling financially?

565
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,178
Yes, it's pretty bad.

566
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,389
My goodness.

567
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,935
Chan-sung, let me know
if you're having a hard time.

568
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,188
You can't just endure everything
with love.

569
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,815
Okay?

570
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:02,775
Okay.

571
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,861
Fine, let's break up.

572
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,405
My gosh.

573
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,615
Mi-ra's fighting all the time.

574
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,784
She and the cop must've been enemies
in their past lives.

575
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:12,868
They fight all the time.

576
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,787
But she always goes out to meet him.

577
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,748
What? You're not the only one who's busy.

578
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,583
I'm busy too.

579
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,169
You talk like your job is
to save the world.

580
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,046
You think you're a superhero or something?

581
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:25,965
What?

582
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,593
They were enemies in their past lives.

583
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:36,058
Sanchez, let's all eat together
when Veronica comes to Korea.

584
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,935
-She's coming in two days, right?
-Yes.

585
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,980
-That's the day of the lunar eclipse.
-Yes, I know.

586
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:44,358
I was planning on watching
the lunar eclipse at the rooftop bar

587
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,402
in your hotel that you bragged about.

588
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,028
Maybe next time.

589
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,698
I'm sorry.

590
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,036
They could get startled
if they run into other hotel guests.

591
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,997
So we should empty the adjacent rooms.

592
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,041
We already informed the guests
on the fourth floor.

593
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,668
We're moving them to other rooms.

594
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,222
You really are well prepared.

595
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,559
The dinner menu is great.

596
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,479
What kind of drink are you going to...

597
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,190
Are you going to serve them these drinks?

598
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:27,902
I took your advice
and created my own signature menu.

599
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,445
They're the Angel and Devil.

600
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,239
It's incredible.

601
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,993
But I'm not sure if humans will like them.

602
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,328
Could you try them?

603
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,537
Sure.

604
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,222
Put half of them on the dinner table
and the other half in their room.

605
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,223
Yes, sir.

606
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,686
It's a bee.

607
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,816
I guess the bee came along
since these are real flowers.

608
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,236
I guess we don't have
any bees or butterflies here

609
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,613
since the flowers here are not real.

610
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:22,831
By any chance,

611
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:27,253
are there also bug ghosts
that look like fireflies?

612
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,713
I've never heard of anything
called a bug ghost.

613
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,465
Oh, I see.

614
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,386
Then what was that?

615
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,596
Should I put this bouquet in their room?

616
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,764
Yes, sure.

617
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,558
That one looks more romantic.

618
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:42,768
Wait.

619
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,696
I'd like to put one in my office.

620
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,574
Please follow me.

621
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,844
God... I'm so tired.

622
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,481
You got a lot of special requests
again today, didn't you?

623
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,234
You're all so excited
about those human guests.

624
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,154
I'm the only one
who's taking care of our actual guests.

625
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:40,284
My gosh, the day feels so long.

626
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,162
My goodness, I'm so tired.

627
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,333
Then here's something to wake you up.

628
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,048
This is a real flower, so it smells nice.

629
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,886
We have tons of flowers in our garden.

630
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,013
None of them are real.

631
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,433
No, wait. Your flowers are real.

632
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,480
That tree of yours is
filled with beautiful flowers.

633
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,023
What's with you?

634
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,858
Are you showing off?

635
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,193
I'm entitled to show off.

636
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,195
The flowers bloomed
the moment I hugged you.

637
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,031
If I knew this was going to happen,
I should've hugged you

638
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,866
instead of buying you champagne.

639
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,746
What are you doing?

640
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,539
I never asked you to hug me.

641
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,541
Are you crazy?

642
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,086
I was asking for the phone.

643
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,800
Okay, here. I'll let you hug me.

644
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,429
Forget it.

645
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:45,349
You arrogant, greedy fraud from Harvard--

646
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,604
You look so pretty.

647
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,067
I put the additional special requests
on your desk.

648
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:58,612
You should get back to work
after you get some rest.

649
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:19,925
Darn it.

650
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,644
I won't let you vanish.

651
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,688
Trust me.

652
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,624
It's real.

653
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:54,835
You,

654
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,838
I'm going easy on you
because you have a soft heart.

655
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,677
The lunar eclipse has begun.

656
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,765
There will be special guests
coming tonight.

657
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,519
Please do your best
to get ready for the guests.

658
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,404
Everyone seems quite excited.

659
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,948
As the moon gets covered,

660
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:09,201
they can feel the hotel's presence
is shown to the world.

661
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,204
And human guests are coming as well.

662
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:16,792
That makes them
feel like they're alive again.

663
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,139
Welcome.

664
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,767
You made a reservation, right?

665
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,519
How long has it been
since you passed away--

666
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,650
I mean, how long has it been
since you got married?

667
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,824
Right, you got married today!

668
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,701
Congratulations.

669
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,703
Please follow me this way.

670
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,799
We'll take your luggage to your room.

671
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,801
You can enjoy your meals first.

672
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:13,682
These cocktails, Tears, are
our hotel's signature cocktails.

673
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,686
This beautiful one is called
the Angel's Tears.

674
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,399
And this one is called the Devil's Tears.

675
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,002
Why are you so happy?

676
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:46,548
I hated looking at the full moon.

677
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:49,009
But look, it's all gone now.

678
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,219
It feels so good watching that.

679
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:55,265
This is my favorite moment ever.

680
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,271
The whole moon is covered now.

681
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,733
The moon will be different
when it comes out again.

682
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:07,444
Perhaps it'll know how to be kind
and cut down on spending.

683
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:12,449
After our human guests
check out of the hotel,

684
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,826
would you like to go out
and see the new, kind moon?

685
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,119
You evil moon.

686
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:19,665
Do you want to die, Chan-sung?

687
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,166
I'll take that as a yes.

688
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,709
This is why I love my name.

689
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:25,170
I love how it means "yes."
It's like everyone agrees with me.

690
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,297
It's perfect.

691
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,925
Zero looks like a circle.
And "Koo" means a circle.

692
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,260
Koo Chan-sung.

693
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,973
Sure, Mr. Zeroth Choice,

694
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,267
your name is Mr. Okay Koo now.

695
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,520
What do you mean?

696
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,772
My English name is Andrew.

697
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:47,275
Chan-sung isn't just okay,
it means "agreement."

698
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,945
Agree, Andrew, whatever.

699
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,447
You're just Okay Koo to me.

700
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,532
Okay?

701
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,413
Okay Koo,
the lunar eclipse is finally complete.

702
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,420
You're right.

703
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,522
This sign means it's yours, right?

704
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:27,858
Yes.

705
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,002
I wonder if he was waiting for her.

706
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,221
Ms. Jang.

707
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:03,560
Our guests would like
to go into their room now.

708
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:07,147
Okay, the lunar eclipse is complete.

709
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,025
It's perfect. Take them to Room 404.

710
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,234
Yes.

711
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,251
Once you go inside,

712
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,630
please don't come out of the room
until you check out.

713
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:34,132
I already heard about this room
from my parents.

714
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,385
Have a good night then.

715
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,868
A world-famous soccer player
was conceived here.

716
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,203
Who do you think will be next?

717
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,622
You've been a kid for 70 years,
so you wouldn't know this.

718
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,707
But things like this
don't happen just overnight.

719
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:11,127
I know that it doesn't happen
just overnight.

720
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,343
Why are you laughing?

721
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,224
I know it all.

722
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,392
Really?

723
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,687
Don't just assume
that I don't know things.

724
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,313
We're talking about lives here.

725
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,357
It's not a conversation
a Grim Ripper could jump into.

726
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,696
I hope

727
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:40,198
that a great scholar will be conceived
this time.

728
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,367
I hope the child will receive
a Nobel Prize.

729
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,536
I hope that triplets will be conceived

730
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,663
so that they'd win three Nobel Prizes.

731
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:50,876
All the guests and employees at the hotel
are rooting for Room 404 right now.

732
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,005
Veronica hasn't arrived yet?

733
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,466
I waited for her,
thinking that her flight was delayed,

734
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,218
but the flight was never delayed.

735
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,720
She's not even picking up her phone.

736
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,100
Chan-sung,

737
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,854
do you think Veronica knew
I was going to propose

738
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,064
and is avoiding me
because she's feeling pressured?

739
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,775
Veronica loves you more than you love her.

740
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,737
No, I love her so much more.

741
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,951
Veronica has never broken
any promises with me.

742
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,080
I just got a text.
It must be from Veronica.

743
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,624
I'll call you later.

744
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:05,909
Sanchez.

745
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:08,286
Sanchez!

746
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:10,789
Sanchez!

747
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,917
An accident? What happened?

748
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,919
Veronica got hurt.

749
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,129
I think she got into a car accident
in Shanghai.

750
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,215
I have to go now.

751
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,716
How badly is she hurt?

752
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,094
I have to go and see.

753
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,346
-I'm sure she'll be fine.
-Yes.

754
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,266
Hey, I have to stay there
until she gets better.

755
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,393
Okay.

756
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,605
Where's my car key?

757
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,700
I have to go.

758
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,084
Even if you go there,

759
00:54:58,461 --> 00:54:59,587
you won't be able to see her.

760
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:04,050
Hey, don't say that.

761
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,177
You won't be able to see her.

762
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,434
It's too late.

763
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,729
What's with you?

764
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,398
It's not too late!

765
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,525
If I go now, I can see her.

766
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:35,832
Sanchez.

767
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,501
I'll let you see her.

768
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,253
What?

769
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,213
If you come to my hotel now,

770
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,591
you can meet her.

771
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:49,554
Hey. What the hell are you talking about?

772
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,849
Do you trust me? We don't have much time.

773
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,934
You won't be able to see her
if you're late.

774
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,213
Mr. Koo.

775
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,049
There is a lady guest
who'll come in right after us.

776
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,843
We'll be waiting for her
at the Sky Lounge.

777
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,346
Please bring her over

778
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:33,348
after the beauty service.

779
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,557
Sure.

780
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:08,967
Let go of me.

781
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,636
What are we going to do here?

782
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,304
You'll see once you go out there.

783
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,014
I'll tell you after you see this.

784
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,490
Hey, how are you working here?

785
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,784
This is a very special hotel.

786
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,078
It's a hotel for the dead.

787
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,621
What?

788
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,711
I have no time to explain.

789
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:48,173
You can see the dead
until the eclipse is over.

790
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:49,507
So,

791
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,011
you'll have only a little time

792
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,388
to say goodbye to Veronica.

793
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,350
What?

794
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:02,312
Stop joking around.
How could she come here?

795
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,566
Because she's dead.

796
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,412
She is here.

797
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,166
Sanchez, Veronica is dead.

798
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,104
I'm sorry...

799
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,400
I surprised you like this.

800
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:04,726
Don't cry too much...

801
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,314
for me.

802
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,319
I lived

803
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,489
a happy life thanks to you.

804
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:51,105
My awfully handsome love.

805
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,235
Goodbye.

806
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,774
Mr. Koo's friend

807
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:19,485
had to say goodbye to his love.

808
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:23,906
Such a sudden death leaves
those left behind

809
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,951
with great sorrow.

810
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,414
I only see the dead these days,

811
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:36,043
so it's been a while
since I saw the sorrow

812
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,921
of the living.

813
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,979
Yes, come in.

814
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,826
Did you have a great night?

815
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:53,329
Yes. We won't be able to forget
the time we spent

816
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:55,373
in this hotel.

817
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:58,501
Thank you. Take care then.

818
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,897
It's exactly like what my parents told me.

819
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:22,400
It's a hotel you can never find again.

820
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:25,403
When we have a baby later,

821
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:29,991
let's find the hotel and have the baby
go on their honeymoon there like we did.

822
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,410
I'd like that.

823
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:15,161
Veronica's funeral will be held in Italy.

824
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:17,830
Sanchez will stay there for a while.

825
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,124
I feel so sorry for Sanchez.

826
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,586
He couldn't even see
his girlfriend's last moments.

827
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:25,963
He didn't get to say goodbye.

828
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:29,050
He saw her. He got to say goodbye too.

829
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:32,845
He learned that death isn't the end,

830
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,098
so I'm sure Sanchez will be able
to get through it.

831
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:39,310
So he got to say goodbye.

832
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:43,606
But how did he see her?

833
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,317
Didn't she die in Shanghai?

834
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:51,948
Gosh, this coffee smells so good.
You should have another.

835
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,478
I'm sorry.

836
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:07,940
She's really tailing me.

837
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,825
Why would such a cute student follow me?

838
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:22,788
I better ask her.

839
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:30,379
I heard they really enjoyed their stay.

840
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,214
Thank you.

841
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,429
If you end up quitting your job
at Hotel del Luna, come look for me.

842
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:42,808
Ms. Jang told me
that you're quite competent

843
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,769
and recommended you to me.

844
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,230
I don't think I'll be quitting.

845
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:52,902
According to Ms. Jang,
you're going to quit soon.

846
01:07:57,198 --> 01:08:00,284
There's a guest
Chan-sung will have to send off himself.

847
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:02,661
Once he sends off that guest,

848
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,290
he'll probably leave this place.

849
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:11,754
Did she say that?

850
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:15,216
Did they come up with a new rule
for the hotel manager?

851
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:20,012
Who is the last guest
you'll be sending off?

852
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,353
It's someone...

853
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:30,731
I like a lot.

854
01:08:39,323 --> 01:08:40,908
It'll be difficult for you.

855
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:47,665
I think so.

856
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:54,421
It's too hard for me to console myself...

857
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,386
by saying I know it's coming.

858
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:46,140
What were you doing? Were you sleeping?

859
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:50,227
I'm awake.

860
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,354
I'm looking at the moon.

861
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,816
The moon?

862
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,569
How can you see the moon during the day?

863
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:00,905
I don't know.

864
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:06,660
It must be pretty hard

865
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,038
to miss something you can't see.

866
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:22,468
Where are you?

867
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:26,305
I'm on my way home.

868
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:30,392
Wait at home. I'll come to see you.

869
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:50,412
What is it, Yu-na?

870
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:54,083
81GI 0963

871
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,253
I've found that car.

872
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,427
Where are you right now? Where?

873
01:11:06,011 --> 01:11:07,263
Don't move. Stay right there.

874
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,745
Why did she follow me all the way here?

875
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:22,880
Yu-na!

876
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,926
The man in the sketch

877
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:30,179
and the owner of that car look alike.

878
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:34,350
Could he be the culprit?

879
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:43,901
What's the matter?

880
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:45,944
He looks a lot like...

881
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:48,781
someone I know.

882
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:01,877
I'll look into it now. You should go home.

883
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,504
Okay.

884
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,874
I told him to wait,
but he's making me wait.

885
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:52,511
Anyone here?

886
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:09,445
Is anybody here?

887
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:31,360
The dreaded Mago has come
instead of the one I've been waiting for.

888
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:33,070
Why?

889
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:36,865
I'm the deity you've been waiting for
the most.

890
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:38,408
Am I wrong?

891
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:46,250
You didn't care about reincarnation,
healing, and connections.

892
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:50,504
You only wished to see me and vanish.

893
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:54,591
So? Are you here to do that for me?

894
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:58,387
I've heard the flowers have bloomed.

895
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:01,139
You finally have

896
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,976
something to lose too.

897
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:08,230
Do you think
I'm afraid to see the flowers fall?

898
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:10,524
What about the one
that helped you bloom the flowers?

899
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:14,111
What if you lose him?

900
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:27,165
Long time no see, Chan-sung.

901
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,971
Man-wol, you conceited and foolish thing.

902
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:44,099
Did you say you weren't afraid
to see the flowers fall?

903
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:45,767
No.

904
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:48,979
Your flowers will begin to fall

905
01:16:49,062 --> 01:16:51,398
when you become afraid.

906
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:17,567
So the price Chan-sung needs to pay
in return

907
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:19,194
won't be fair nor reasonable.

908
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:22,781
You can stroke my hair in your room

909
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:24,491
to help me fall asleep.

910
01:18:24,574 --> 01:18:26,243
What's with you? You're too naughty.

911
01:18:26,326 --> 01:18:27,661
You were really scared.

912
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:31,123
I don't want you to pay the price,

913
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:34,251
so I'll do everything I can
to clean up after you.

914
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:36,378
Don't be afraid when you leave me behind.

915
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:39,172
This is how I, just a weak human,

916
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:42,634
love you with all my heart.

917
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:45,846
