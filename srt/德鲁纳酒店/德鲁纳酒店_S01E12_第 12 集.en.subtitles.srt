1
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,131
What about the one
that helped you bloom the flowers?

2
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,093
What if you lose him?

3
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:58,099
Man-wol, you conceited and foolish thing.

4
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,769
Did you say
you aren't afraid to see the flowers fall?

5
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,439
No.

6
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,734
Your flowers will begin to fall

7
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,028
when you become afraid.

8
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,498
Long time no see, Chan-sung.

9
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:34,135
Are you waiting for me to say,
"Why are you doing this to me?

10
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,512
I'm so scared."

11
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,806
And when I start shivering in fear

12
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,266
and the flowers slowly start to fall,

13
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,603
is that when you'll drag me
to my afterlife?

14
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,104
I'm not surprised.

15
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:49,150
I already know how cheap you guys can be.

16
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,572
There's no need to wait.

17
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,534
You should just bring him to me

18
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,661
right now.

19
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,704
We can end this once and for all,

20
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,873
and I'll finally vanish.

21
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,503
That's exactly what I've been wishing for

22
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,548
during the endless years I had to endure.

23
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,926
Koo Chan-sung

24
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,138
will eventually bring him to you.

25
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,223
Why do you keep
getting Chan-sung involved?

26
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,475
I'm not the one
who got him involved in this.

27
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,021
It's the one that wants you
to leave in peace.

28
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,526
You've been enduring
for the past 1,000 years,

29
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,403
and all you wish is to cease to exist.

30
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,781
So the price Chan-sung needs to pay
in return

31
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,409
won't be fair nor reasonable.

32
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,247
I tried to stop him.

33
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,957
He chose to stay by my side.

34
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,668
You wicked thing.

35
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,253
Yes, that's right.

36
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,046
I'm a wicked witch who made him stay

37
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,007
even when I knew
what he'd end up going through.

38
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,009
Yes, you're right. You are very wicked.

39
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,052
Because of you,

40
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:02,056
he even had to encounter the person
that hurt him the most.

41
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,445
What more do you think

42
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,072
he'll have to go through because of you?

43
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,749
You're shaking like a leaf.

44
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,044
It's very amusing to watch.

45
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,153
You're Chan-sung, right?

46
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,821
Don't you remember me?

47
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,449
I'm Seol Ji-won.
We used to study in Boston together.

48
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,160
Yes, Seol Ji-won.

49
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,412
It's you.

50
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,623
What brings you here?

51
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,500
Did Sanchez tell you about me?

52
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,960
Or was it Mi-ra?

53
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,880
No, it was someone else.

54
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,840
She told me she saw you on the street.

55
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,801
But I'm surprised that you're really here.

56
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,345
Oh, really?

57
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,275
I'm sure you didn't come here
because you missed me.

58
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,526
So, what brings you here?

59
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,823
I heard you came back to Korea
to get into law school.

60
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,032
Did you quit studying?

61
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,369
You told me your father was a judge.
Did he give up on you?

62
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,706
He didn't give up on me,
but he did pass away.

63
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,333
So I'm just doing what I like to do now.

64
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,335
And what exactly is that?

65
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,427
It must be wine.

66
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,392
Do you have a lot of good wine?

67
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,565
Can I have a glass?

68
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,485
Okay, sure.

69
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,786
Was it him?

70
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,372
Did he kill you?

71
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,207
What are you doing here?

72
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,175
What about you? What did you do here?

73
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,640
Is what you like to do...

74
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,309
murdering people?

75
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,653
Why won't he pick up his phone?

76
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,326
I need to go back to Chan-sung's place.

77
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,912
You've been there many times already.

78
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,455
He'll come.

79
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,624
He didn't show up or pick up the phone.

80
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,708
This is weird.

81
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,961
I need to know where he is to go find him.

82
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,130
I'm sure there's a reason.

83
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,965
Why are you so restless?

84
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,105
What about the one
that helped you bloom the flowers?

85
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,983
What if you lose him?

86
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,612
I heard something ominous.

87
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,911
I'm going to go find him.

88
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,412
Ms. Jang.

89
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,711
Why won't he pick up the phone?

90
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,394
-Hello?
-What am I going to do?

91
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,354
What's wrong, Yu-na?

92
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,440
I think Mr. Koo got hurt.

93
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,194
What if he died?

94
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,862
What?

95
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,532
Mr. Third Choice is dead?

96
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,244
I think he was killed when he went
to catch the murderer.

97
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,334
Ms. Jang.

98
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,794
This is bad.

99
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,549
Mr. Koo is dead.

100
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,470
What?

101
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,894
Yu-na followed some car

102
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,982
to find the murderer of the guests,

103
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,444
but Mr. Koo said
it was too dangerous for her

104
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,237
and went over himself.

105
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,621
Stop talking nonsense.

106
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,708
Why would Chan-sung die?

107
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,628
Yu-na saw him carried into an ambulance.

108
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,303
Explain the situation.

109
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,098
What happened?

110
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,602
Stop crying!

111
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,404
Mr. Koo?

112
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,917
Ji Hyeon-jung, you little... Come here.

113
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,544
-Ms. Jang! Goodness, Ms. Jang!
-You jerk!

114
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,795
Ms. Jang!

115
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,758
-You said he--
-My goodness.

116
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,094
You didn't die. I'm so relieved.

117
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,118
Goodness.

118
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,373
You're alive.

119
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,796
I thought you came as a guest.

120
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,006
What? A guest...

121
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,306
You went there to meet the murderer alone.

122
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,892
We couldn't get a hold of you
and heard someone got badly hurt.

123
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,769
I thought it was you.

124
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:19,024
I knew it could be dangerous.
I didn't go in there without any plan.

125
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,944
I had already called
a police officer I knew.

126
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,654
Freeze.

127
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,582
Great job. Then who got hurt?

128
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,792
The culprit.

129
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,964
Seol Ji-won,
you are under arrest for murder.

130
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,102
Put that down.

131
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:15,831
He's not in critical condition now,
so he will live to pay for what he did.

132
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,958
Gosh, I'm so relieved.

133
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,461
I was really shocked
because I thought you came as a guest.

134
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,421
I knew he wasn't a guest
as soon as I saw him.

135
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,715
No, you didn't. You cried.

136
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,467
I saw you wiping your tears.

137
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,135
I had a runny nose.

138
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,971
Ms. Choe, I saw your legs shaking.

139
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,769
I'm sorry that I made everyone worried.

140
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,730
And thank you for worrying about me.

141
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,566
Our dead hearts skipped a beat
thanks to you.

142
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,234
That was thrilling.

143
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,112
Ms. Jang will begin
to throw a huge fit soon,

144
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,656
so let's survive that too.

145
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,740
Okay.

146
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,749
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

147
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,963
Jang Man-wol.

148
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,510
Where did she go?

149
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,599
I brought an extra one because I knew
a few bottles wouldn't cut it.

150
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,606
Jang Man-wol, where have you been?

151
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,734
Did you go shopping?

152
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,194
Chan-sung, sit down.

153
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,373
Did you go to the pharmacy?

154
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:43,544
Yes, we don't have anything
that can treat the living.

155
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,629
Did you clean the entire pharmacy out?

156
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,464
Just sit down, will you?

157
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:48,966
Let me see.

158
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,143
You're all wounded.

159
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,357
What do I have to put on you?

160
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,901
Let's put on the most expensive one.

161
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,121
-That stings.
-It hurts?

162
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,957
Darn it. I guess
this ointment isn't a good one.

163
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,375
Let me see.

164
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,590
Wait, this is the ointment
for hemorrhoids.

165
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,674
What?

166
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,345
Sorry. I applied the ointment
for buttholes on your face.

167
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,307
Come here.

168
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,767
No, that's okay.

169
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,728
If this heals buttholes,
I'm sure it'll heal my face too.

170
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,563
Buttholes and faces aren't the same.

171
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,607
Give it back. I'll apply another one.

172
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,362
Were you scared

173
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,865
that I died
and came to the hotel as a guest?

174
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,790
How could you of all people
be confused and scared?

175
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,213
Because I was afraid.

176
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,052
Just like the world turned pitch-dark,

177
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,555
I was scared.

178
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,774
No matter how desperately I wanted money,
I never made that kind of mistake.

179
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,360
You made me look like a fool.

180
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,071
All of my employees were watching too.

181
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,115
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

182
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,661
What is this? Darn it.

183
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,455
Wait here.

184
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,834
I'll go look for a guest
who was a pharmacist.

185
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,047
You seem pretty shook up yourself.

186
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,715
Shouldn't you take some medicine?

187
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,885
Why? Do you have any pills for that?

188
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,064
You were really scared.

189
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,699
Are you a pharmacist or what?

190
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,412
I'm supposed to take care of you.

191
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,767
Your flowers will begin to fall

192
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,061
when you become afraid.

193
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,739
I have good news too.

194
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,909
Your Yeon-u...

195
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,870
Right. Detective Park Yeong-su
caught the culprit.

196
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,538
He'll probably get promoted.

197
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,717
I found all the drugs and syringes
he used to kill the victims.

198
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,888
I think he illegally smuggled in
the drugs while importing wine.

199
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,349
It's the symbol of
the website Helllo, right?

200
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,434
Did you find Seol Ji-won in the website?

201
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,228
Actually,

202
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,272
I received a tip.

203
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,526
Who?

204
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,112
You're the dead woman, Lee Do-yeon?

205
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,114
My husband isn't the culprit.

206
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,824
The murderer is right here.

207
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,701
You shouldn't make a prank call.

208
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,162
Blood. There's blood.

209
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,790
He collected samples of blood
from his victims.

210
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,917
Please come here. It's dangerous here.

211
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,045
The lead that there were traces
that the victims' blood was drawn

212
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,922
was never disclosed to the public.

213
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,925
I came here because that bothered me.

214
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,011
I really found their blood here.

215
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,472
He's really like a demon.

216
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,351
He displayed the victims' blood
among his wine bottles.

217
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,728
But who do you think gave me that call?

218
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,273
There's no way a dead woman
could have called me.

219
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,652
That's really strange.

220
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,369
You can't let a ghost
take over your body like that.

221
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:32,416
Promise me. Don't you ever do
something like that without me.

222
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,919
The ghost just helped me call it in
and gather evidence.

223
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,922
Take them with you.

224
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,049
And go home and rest for the day.

225
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,012
Now I have a lot to take home.

226
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,557
-What's this?
-A massager.

227
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,311
Put it on your neck
before going to sleep. It'll be nice.

228
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,564
There are an sleep mask
and a bottle of champagne.

229
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,692
Right. Caviar. This is really expensive,
just so you know.

230
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,943
Take your time with it.

231
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,321
You gave me things
that are very valuable to you.

232
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,825
Take one of my cars
since you have a lot...

233
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,828
Forget it.

234
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,372
You should just keep driving one.

235
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,166
Really?

236
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,336
The red one. Can I take the red one?

237
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,378
What?

238
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:24,426
Why? Do you like the color red?
You don't like it.

239
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,635
I do.

240
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,304
Is that so?

241
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,347
Really?

242
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,684
Sure.

243
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,229
There's only one red car,

244
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,356
but you can drive it.

245
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,277
You can keep it.

246
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,613
Thank you.

247
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,160
This isn't the right key.

248
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,120
It's that one. Over there.

249
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,420
Here.

250
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,090
It's nice to have a near-death experience.

251
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,383
I'll just drive this one.

252
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,635
Are you kidding me?

253
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:07,844
I was testing you.

254
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,514
The red car versus me. I won.

255
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,016
You would've lost
if it was a new poop colored car.

256
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,102
I know that your favorite is the red one.

257
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,104
I beat the red car.
It means I beat them all.

258
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,441
I had no idea you were such a sly snake.

259
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,155
I think I need to go
to the police station a few times.

260
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:30,575
To explain what happened
without involving the ghost,

261
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,994
I really have to be a sly snake this time.

262
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,455
Anyway, Yeon-u must be flustered.

263
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,875
He received two tips from ghosts.

264
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,170
He may have a fine figure,

265
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,799
but he got scared easily
and found ghosts really scary.

266
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,425
Yeon-u did?

267
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,554
You must've grown up with him
since you were young.

268
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,640
Yeon-u's mother raised me.

269
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,103
When I was very young,

270
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,606
I was dying in the wilds.

271
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,526
A merchant who was passing by
saved me, apparently.

272
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,696
And Yeon-u's mom was the one
who took me in.

273
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,243
But she passed away not long after.

274
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:18,206
Yeon-u and I were
practically brother and sister.

275
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,666
That's how we lived.

276
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:27,591
He was dexterous,
so he'd make clothes for me too.

277
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:37,434
I think he's living
a good life as a cop now.

278
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:44,024
I don't think
I've told you about my past before.

279
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,984
You haven't.

280
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:53,074
-Perhaps, the flowers are the reason.
-Maybe it's time for them to fall.

281
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,645
I should go.

282
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,442
Hey.

283
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,297
Maybe it's time for them to fall.

284
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,861
I hope you keep it up
and take good care of me

285
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,697
and then...

286
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,032
see me off.

287
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,201
That's what Mago wants.

288
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,663
You must be doing a good job.

289
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,332
I think the flower will bloom.

290
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,377
You should look after it well

291
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,380
so you can send her off.

292
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,801
Who is the last guest
you'll be sending off?

293
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,846
I'll become your last customer.

294
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,265
When you see me off,

295
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,102
don't feel lonely.

296
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,221
When will he wake up?

297
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,265
Probably in a couple of hours.

298
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,248
-Did he wake up?
-He will in a few hours.

299
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,671
-Where did he go?
-He was here a second ago.

300
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,090
Don't just stand there. Find him!

301
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,257
I'm sorry, sir!

302
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,950
Is what you like to do...

303
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,160
murdering people?

304
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,247
What are you talking about?

305
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,873
You killed...

306
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:30,959
a person.

307
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,295
Says who?

308
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,713
The person you killed...

309
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,882
is here with us.

310
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,387
You're insane.

311
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:46,474
Do you think it's over once people die?

312
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,314
Our souls remain.

313
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,070
Your seventh victim is here
with us at the moment.

314
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:03,992
And this is...

315
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,037
her blood.

316
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,505
Must I find the other six for you
to believe me?

317
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,035
-Who are you?
-I didn't find them.

318
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,536
Your victim did.

319
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,080
Don't lie to me. That's impossible.

320
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,749
You may not know this,

321
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,376
but she's been next to you
this whole time.

322
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,597
She's also telling me what you are hiding

323
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,641
behind you.

324
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,333
So, ghosts exist?

325
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,757
Will you be here soon?

326
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,843
What time?

327
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,512
That's too late.

328
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,531
DETECTIVE PARK YEONG-SU

329
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,201
Yes, Detective.

330
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,830
Mr. Koo, we need you here
at the hospital now.

331
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,404
You're here.

332
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,614
As I said on the phone,

333
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,699
Seol Ji-won will only talk to you.

334
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,075
Would that be all right?

335
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,495
Yes.

336
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,071
You're here.

337
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,619
Look at where I am thanks to you.

338
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,829
No, this is on you.

339
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,918
What brought you here is
the victim you killed.

340
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,215
You said ghosts existed.

341
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,969
Is someone aiding you right now as well?

342
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,224
Yes, I have someone protecting me
even at this moment.

343
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,774
Is this the guy?

344
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,070
Should I just push him?

345
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:10,863
No, don't.

346
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,117
He must live and suffer,
paying for what he's done.

347
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,326
Sure.

348
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,955
I don't want to go through the trouble
because of some scumbag anyway.

349
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,665
-Of course.
-Hey!

350
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,751
What are you doing?

351
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,838
I was talking to my guardian about you.

352
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,219
Damn you, Chan-sung.

353
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:36,305
My life started to fall apart
because of you, you know.

354
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,183
No, it was because of what you had done.

355
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,363
Cute.

356
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,618
Do you have proof that I sent it?

357
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,663
Also, who will believe you?

358
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:04,751
You think you're something
just because you're smart, don't you?

359
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,627
You're so full of yourself.

360
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,721
No one has to believe me

361
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,723
except for one person.

362
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:24,020
The man who knew his youngest son so well

363
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,606
that he sent the son abroad.

364
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,609
I'm talking about your father, a judge.

365
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,037
How about we have a little bet?

366
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,374
Between his son who isn't reliable at all

367
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,629
and a straight-A student
of a prestigious US university,

368
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,631
who will your father believe?

369
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,995
Before I tell your father
about everything,

370
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,664
get lost.

371
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,712
I should've just pulled
the trigger back then.

372
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,557
Do you

373
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,476
know him personally?

374
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,980
Our ill-fated relationship goes way back.

375
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,607
I thought it had been severed,

376
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,568
but we met again.

377
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,071
Because of you,

378
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,783
he even had to encounter the person
that hurt him the most.

379
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,161
What more do you think

380
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,997
he'll have to go through because of you?

381
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,878
What you've done

382
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,838
won't end with your death.

383
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,090
The only way to save your soul is

384
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,010
to stay alive and pay for your sins.

385
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,511
How are they my sins?

386
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,347
I just did what other people
asked me to do.

387
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,769
Do you have any idea
how enthusiastic people become

388
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,189
when it comes to hating
and cursing others?

389
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,734
Soccer players score goals
because that's what people want.

390
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,861
And I killed those people

391
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,822
because that was what people wanted,
so how is that my responsibility?

392
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,533
That's probably where people go
to express their filthy emotions.

393
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:46,704
But no one actually wants someone
to put their filthy thoughts into action.

394
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,331
Get down here, Ji-won!

395
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,172
I uploaded a post
to express my hatred for you.

396
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,635
I hope it receives a lot of support.

397
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,157
I guess you're able to see me now.

398
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,242
He was right.

399
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,203
Death really isn't the end.

400
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,788
Yes.

401
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,291
You're a ghost now.

402
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,466
Chan-sung probably didn't want this
to happen,

403
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,844
but I couldn't wait for you
to fall down the building and die.

404
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,599
I'm not allowed to harm
a living human being.

405
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,851
But it's a vengeful ghost like you,

406
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,395
that's not the case.

407
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,732
"A vengeful ghost"?

408
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,909
You deserve to be thrown
in a garbage truck.

409
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,079
I'll destroy you and turn you to ashes.

410
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,332
I hope you turn into trash
and head to your afterlife.

411
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,852
What was that?

412
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,688
What's protecting you?

413
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,567
It must be my resentment.

414
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,947
My hatred and curse are
making people go wild.

415
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,412
I will sacrifice my life

416
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:19,500
to curse Koo Chan-sung,
the guy who ruined my life.

417
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,503
COMPLETE

418
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,088
YOUR POST HAS BEEN UPLOADED

419
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,387
I HOPE HE DIES

420
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,514
I CURSE HIM TOO

421
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,811
These people's ugly thoughts and emotions

422
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,647
must've given you
a hideous type of strength.

423
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,650
Who are you to protect Chan-sung?

424
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,610
Shut it, you piece of trash.

425
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,529
You stink.

426
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:53,534
I'll get rid of this hideous power
that's protecting you now

427
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,619
and rip you into pieces.

428
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,122
You just wait.

429
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,710
I'm going to become
even uglier and more powerful.

430
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,780
I requested the Helllo website to delete
the posts that Seol Ji-won uploaded.

431
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:36,076
But we couldn't do anything about the ones
that already went viral on the web.

432
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,661
I'm sorry.

433
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,580
There's no need for you to apologize.

434
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,708
Is it okay if I go now?

435
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:43,959
Sure.

436
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,671
Oh, wait.

437
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,258
When you were at the wine bar,

438
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,886
were you with a woman by any chance?

439
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,597
The thing is,

440
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,934
I got a call from the wine bar.

441
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:03,979
And the woman who called told me
that she was the late Lee Do-yeon.

442
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,733
I know it doesn't make sense,
but I was just wondering--

443
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,109
It could've been her.

444
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,781
I believe that souls exist.

445
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,866
I also believe in reincarnation.

446
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,953
Oh, reincarnation? I see.

447
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,290
You draw very well.

448
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,168
You must be quite dexterous.

449
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,962
Thank you.

450
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:30,923
Okay, then.

451
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,732
Seol Ji-won

452
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,818
died.

453
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,069
I know.

454
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,862
I met him as a ghost.

455
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:00,369
He has become a vengeful ghost,
and he holds resentment toward you.

456
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,415
Yes, I know. I read the post he uploaded.

457
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,043
I'm quite shocked
at how much support he got.

458
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,298
Darn it.

459
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,551
I should've turned him to ashes
the moment he died.

460
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,512
I should've brought a gun
instead of a folding fan.

461
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,973
Was he strong enough to escape from you?

462
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,100
I want to act like it's not a big deal,

463
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,102
but it is a big deal.

464
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,522
Chan-sung.

465
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,442
Don't go home until we catch him.

466
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,235
Stay right by my side.

467
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:46,582
Do you think Ms. Jang will ban me
from coming to this hotel?

468
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,792
She probably forgot about it already.

469
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,879
Mr. Koo turned out to be okay,
so everything will be fine.

470
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,547
-Really?
-Of course.

471
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,549
But thanks to you, our hotel guests

472
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,093
were able to reveal their wrongful deaths.

473
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,304
Good job, Yu-na.

474
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,432
Gosh, what a relief.

475
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,979
We got a new guest last night,
and she asked if she could meet you.

476
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:10,564
What?

477
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:24,411
You're that woman.

478
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,752
Thank you for following me
until the very end.

479
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,264
THE LATE JEONG SU-JEONG

480
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,813
This is where I actually am.

481
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,399
But I was too scared to come here.
This is my first time.

482
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:56,110
I got murdered as well.

483
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,987
And I feel like I consoled myself

484
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,991
by helping out with the murder case.

485
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,292
I secretly brought it
from the hotel garden.

486
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:13,836
Let's put this inside.

487
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,090
-Hyeon-jung.
-Yes?

488
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:21,927
Where are you buried?

489
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,263
Somewhere in the mountain.

490
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,307
I don't have a grave.

491
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,021
Then let's share this space together.

492
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,367
That's me.

493
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:49,371
I was just practicing drawing portraits.

494
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,426
This is our grave now.

495
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,470
Do you like it?

496
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,680
Don't you like it?

497
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,434
Well, then. Just forget it.

498
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:14,188
I already told you that I liked you,
but you ignored it.

499
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,981
I didn't ignore it.

500
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,693
Yu-na.

501
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,029
Your boyfriend

502
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,323
should be someone kind

503
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,243
and alive.

504
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,745
That's why...

505
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:42,758
I like you.

506
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,845
Can't you just like me too--

507
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,165
Chan-sung.

508
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,627
Wake up.

509
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,821
Why are you sleeping
in this uncomfortable couch?

510
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,949
The only rooms
I can sleep in at this hotel

511
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,076
is Room 404 and yours.

512
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,829
If I end up in Incheon
after sleeping in Room 404,

513
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,247
I'll have a hard time coming to work.

514
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,790
Who told you to sleep in Room 404?

515
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,250
I told you to sleep in my room.

516
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,586
You'll fall asleep in no time

517
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,963
with the massager and sleep mask.

518
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,674
Do you think I'll be able to fall asleep
in your room

519
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,551
even if I had that massager?

520
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,932
You're right.
After all, you are very healthy.

521
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:19,688
Gosh, humans need to sleep well.

522
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,315
Too bad for you.

523
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,568
Let's go, then.

524
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,529
Let me sleep comfortably in your room.

525
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:30,699
I don't need that massager.
I'd rather have your arm.

526
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,243
If you let me use your arm as a pillow,

527
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,078
I don't need that sleep mask.

528
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,955
You can stroke my hair

529
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:38,957
to help me

530
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:40,792
fall asleep.

531
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,420
What's with you? You're too naughty.

532
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,424
Cool it down.

533
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,858
You cool it down. You're blushing.

534
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:10,155
I feel so stiff.
Maybe I should try the massager.

535
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,450
Gosh.

536
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:17,120
I am not blushing...

537
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,581
Chan-sung.

538
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,709
Forget the massager.
Let's go get acupuncture.

539
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,628
-What?
-Let's get acupuncture

540
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,296
and cupping therapy to let some blood out.

541
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,798
I know a good oriental clinic.

542
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:32,469
There's a famous doctor
who can even bring a dead person back.

543
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,848
You did a great job, ma'am!

544
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,141
HYOSAENG ORIENTAL CLINIC

545
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,976
Be sure to come in daily
to get acupuncture.

546
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,479
Doctor, your herbal medicine
is too expensive.

547
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:45,691
It's only because it's really effective.

548
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,318
And I even gave you
some free samples as well!

549
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,403
Thank you.

550
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,824
You mean that doctor
brought back a dead person?

551
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,369
He's keeping someone who should have died
three years ago alive.

552
00:49:58,578 --> 00:49:59,996
He must be an amazing doctor.

553
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,498
Take care, ma'am.

554
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,043
Is he a reincarnation of Hua Tuo?

555
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,336
I don't know.

556
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,004
Ma'am, don't hesitate.

557
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,048
Buy them for your family members.

558
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:13,051
I'll give you ten percent off.

559
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,136
I'll need to think about it.

560
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,929
All right, ma'am.

561
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:17,305
Take care.

562
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:21,101
Keep recommending it to her.

563
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,561
He seems

564
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:26,314
a bit greedy, though, like someone I know.

565
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,902
You have a guest, honey.

566
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,529
Thank you for coming.

567
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:33,989
Please follow me.

568
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,534
You don't look too good.

569
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:38,994
She must be his wife.

570
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,412
They look alike.

571
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:44,291
Anyway, we have to take the patient
he's been keeping alive

572
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,459
to our hotel.

573
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,586
But, isn't the patient still alive?

574
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,421
How are we supposed
to take them as a guest?

575
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,715
By killing, of course.

576
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,468
The Grim Reaper told me
to make sure to kill the patient.

577
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:58,221
You even run errands for the Grim Reaper?

578
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,682
It's not an errand!

579
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,476
It's a deal.

580
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,812
I need you to take care of someone for me.

581
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,523
I want your help.

582
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:11,234
If you couldn't handle him on your own,

583
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,528
he must be quite strong.

584
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,864
He holds a really deep grudge,

585
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,159
so one of my people could get hurt
if I'm not cautious.

586
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,664
Quietly bring him to me.

587
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,334
It's your request.

588
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,503
How can I reject it?

589
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:36,468
But you'll need to do me a favor as well.

590
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,314
Go on.

591
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,691
There's someone
who's been causing me trouble.

592
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:55,070
It's an unsolved case
that has disgraced me.

593
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,448
If you bring that person
to Hotel del Luna,

594
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,450
I'll bring that vengeful ghost...

595
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,537
to you.

596
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,498
Deal.

597
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:12,754
Is Seol Ji-won that dangerous?

598
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,925
The reason your ill-fated relationship
is haunting you

599
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,052
may be me.

600
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,721
Mago told me that.

601
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:25,141
You made the flowers bloom,
so you will have to pay the price for it.

602
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,936
The price I have to pay
for making the flowers bloom

603
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,480
is having a vengeful ghost haunt me?

604
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,233
I don't want you to pay the price,

605
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:37,112
so I'll do everything I can
to clean up after you.

606
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,907
Thank you for that.

607
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:43,702
EMERGENCY FUND

608
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,036
Mr. Koo Chan-sung?

609
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:45,954
Here.

610
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,247
Please come in.

611
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:51,459
Is my job to see
how good of a doctor he is?

612
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:56,131
Take this with you.
Tell him this is why you came.

613
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:08,184
The hepatization slowed down
your stomach contractions,

614
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:12,022
which is why you have indigestion
and a pressure on your chest.

615
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,732
It must be due to stress.

616
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,944
Yes. I do have a lot on my mind lately.

617
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,279
Is that so?

618
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,073
You can get the acupuncture treatment
and some medicine.

619
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:26,036
It's best if you take
my herbal medicine too.

620
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,997
I don't need acupuncture or medicine.

621
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,459
The reason for my stress is money.

622
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,502
That's why

623
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,339
I came here after seeing this.
I need the money.

624
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,715
EMERGENCY FUND

625
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,016
This is your number, right?

626
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:51,394
We were running short on time.
What a relief.

627
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,856
I need to check something.

628
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,407
Your palm lines look good.

629
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,035
You have a good lifeline, too.

630
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:14,292
Give me one centimeter of your lifeline.

631
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,919
If you sell me your lifeline,

632
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,339
I will give you 50 million won.

633
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,389
He buys other people's lifelines

634
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,891
and keeps a person
who should be dead alive?

635
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:32,644
I guess that doctor really is great.

636
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,189
Is it possible to buy
other people's lifelines with money?

637
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:38,441
Well, if it is a fair deal.

638
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,860
It's not a fraud. He pays well.

639
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:43,697
So that's why the Grim Reaper
couldn't do anything.

640
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:50,578
The person who sold it
wouldn't have thought it was for real.

641
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,373
They would've thought it was easy money.

642
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,583
Only the buyer is desperate.

643
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,628
I guess he uses it to make more money.

644
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,464
Do you think he sells it
to a wealthy person?

645
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:06,052
An important person, I suppose.

646
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,264
You'll be having surgery tonight,

647
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,182
so let's feed you some meat. Let's go.

648
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,226
You just want to have meat, don't you?

649
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,020
There's...

650
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,063
A restaurant Kim Jun-hyun visited
around here.

651
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,316
I know. Let's go.

652
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,577
I got someone to sell his lifeline.

653
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:33,663
I was very worried
since the one who promised me backed out.

654
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,499
What a relief.

655
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,793
That means you have to spend

656
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,629
all the money you've saved up so far.

657
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,426
Money isn't the problem.

658
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,095
As long as I can save him,
that's all right.

659
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,514
But you worked so hard to earn that money.

660
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,642
The surgery is today.

661
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,270
I must take a look.

662
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,282
Hyeon-jin is sleeping.

663
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,681
You can get surgery today.

664
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,606
It's a boy?

665
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,691
Yes.

666
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,944
The life we must take away

667
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,071
is the couple's son.

668
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:57,872
I didn't know
Man-wol could look so stunning.

669
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,291
Once the flowers fall,

670
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,002
will that be the end of the Moon Tree?

671
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,754
Yes.

672
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,799
That means the death of Man-wol...

673
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,470
who I have chained to this tree.

674
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:17,100
Man-wol will finally
be able to go to the afterlife.

675
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,269
It's been too long

676
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,064
for Man-wol
who has blossomed to the fullest

677
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:28,903
and for the guy who had to remain

678
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,781
as a small light.

679
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,839
He turned back when I was
accompanying him to the afterlife.

680
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,552
He's managed to stay here
for such a long time.

681
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,578
You should

682
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,498
get going too.

683
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:18,680
Live your life as a traitor.

684
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,307
That way, Man-wol can live.

685
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,588
I let him be
because you told me not to take him.

686
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,840
It is quite impressive

687
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:57,802
that a soul of a human can remain
for this long as a small light.

688
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:00,805
It's a curse he cast upon himself.

689
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,057
He's

690
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:07,228
staying here as a small light
because of the promise

691
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,273
he made to Man-wol.

692
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,275
Ms. Jang

693
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,320
took an assignment from me
in order to lessen the burden

694
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,530
on Koo Chan-sung
for making her flowers blossom.

695
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,493
It sounds like Man-wol doesn't know

696
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:27,123
the price Chan-sung has to pay yet.

697
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,460
Once she finds out,

698
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,421
she will be sad

699
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,758
and scared.

700
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:08,539
Are you nervous
that he might take your lifeline?

701
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,251
I guess you must want to live a long life.

702
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,796
Don't worry. You'll live a long life.

703
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,632
I was trying to figure it out.

704
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,845
How his parents must have felt
to buy someone else's lifelines

705
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:25,390
and attach them on their son.

706
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,867
That means I'll protect you,
so he can't take away yours.

707
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:48,705
I'm just protecting your lifeline.

708
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,336
They just don't want
to let go of their son.

709
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,841
They must be desperate to hold onto him.

710
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,814
You're here already.

711
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,984
Let's go to the treatment room.

712
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:27,785
It will neither hurt nor harm you.

713
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,579
I'll cut off exactly one centimeter.

714
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,670
Are you cutting my lifeline

715
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,715
to give it to your child?

716
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:49,557
Earlier today,
I heard that you have a sick son.

717
01:02:58,065 --> 01:02:59,942
My son was severely ill.

718
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,947
After hearing about the lifeline surgery
overseas,

719
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:07,950
I tried it out
because I had nothing to lose.

720
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:13,623
Like a miracle, my son lived.

721
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,043
Both of you are still young.

722
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:20,546
It must've been quite an ordeal for you.

723
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,466
My son is young,

724
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,260
but my wife and I look quite old.

725
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:29,680
People think

726
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:34,101
we are his grandparents.

727
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:34,579
Hello?

728
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,873
DEMIAN

729
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,084
Were you reading a book?

730
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,504
That's a hard book.

731
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,340
It's not that hard.

732
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:50,344
I think it's all right
to show off how intelligent you are

733
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:51,846
if you're really that smart.

734
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:53,764
I like you.

735
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,934
Ma'am, are you the Grim Reaper too?

736
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,438
On the days I had surgery,

737
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:03,983
I always saw a man dressed
in a black suit in my dream.

738
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:10,823
He and I have totally different
themes for our black outfits.

739
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,783
He's just wearing black clothes.

740
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:16,495
And I'm wearing midnight black
with a hint of dark blue.

741
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,958
Midnight black and black are the same.

742
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:22,543
Really?

743
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,420
Whatever.

744
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:27,590
I am here to do something similar
to what he does.

745
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:32,428
I can't take you against your will.

746
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,973
You're a smart boy,
so you can hear me out,

747
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,850
think about it, and make a decision.

748
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,398
You do know

749
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:47,944
that your mom and dad
suddenly aged a lot, don't you?

750
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,871
Is it because of this?

751
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:03,834
Yes.

752
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:07,213
What they've attached there is

753
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,675
the lives of your mom and dad.

754
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:14,011
You paid the price,

755
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:17,765
so your desperation
to save your child was heard.

756
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,142
You didn't buy someone else's life.

757
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,312
You gave parts of your lives
to your child.

758
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,398
That's why you two
have aged a lot quicker.

759
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:30,569
I am not sure what you know,

760
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,990
but if my son lives,
I don't care what it takes.

761
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:37,660
Sadly, the child will
have to make the decision.

762
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:41,080
Once he makes the decision,

763
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:44,875
you must let him go.

764
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,655
Hyeon-jin!

765
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:20,077
-Wake up.
-Hyeon-jin.

766
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,705
What's wrong with him, honey?

767
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:23,998
Hyeon-jin.

768
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:26,083
Honey, what's wrong with him?

769
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:29,587
No, not yet, honey. What's wrong with him?

770
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:30,671
Honey...

771
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,882
No. Hyeon-jin, no.

772
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,760
No, wake up. Hyeon-jin!

773
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:37,071
I'm glad you resolved this.

774
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,198
If you had been any later,

775
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:41,909
I would've had to take away
all three of them.

776
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:43,994
His parents

777
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:48,165
may have wanted that.

778
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:52,044
If I go with you,

779
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:56,257
it'll be more painful for my mom and dad.

780
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:00,636
That's not for you to worry about.

781
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,180
It's for those who are left behind.

782
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,909
But...

783
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:29,039
I'm really afraid of that.

784
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,397
I'm afraid...

785
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:02,865
Do not be afraid.

786
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:06,660
I will find the evil ghost
just as I promised.

787
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:12,082
Okay.

788
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,628
Find that in a hurry
so that no one won't be scared anymore.

789
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:34,605
Even if it means I must give everything,

790
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:37,441
I still cannot let go.

791
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:50,329
After I, it's N, E, S, S, not Y.

792
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:52,081
-Isn't this right?
-Come.

793
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:05,177
-You did that on purpose, right?
-Blowing on it helps?

794
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,388
What does that look like to you?

795
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:11,392
The intern and the receptionist are
dating at work.

796
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,060
My goodness.

797
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:16,188
She just started here.
I can't believe they're dating already.

798
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,065
They're young.

799
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:20,734
A man and a woman are bound
to hit it off when they're together.

800
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:23,487
I guess it doesn't matter
if it's this life or the afterlife.

801
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:24,863
Goodness.

802
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:30,077
We've been together for 200 years,
but we're still very professional.

803
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:34,164
It wouldn't happen even after 2,000 years.

804
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:36,292
You aren't my type.

805
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,085
Not even in your dreams.

806
01:11:38,168 --> 01:11:40,504
My dream? I didn't dream anything.

807
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:42,423
Hey, listen.

808
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,466
I don't like you either.

809
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:05,863
You're back already?

810
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:08,574
Yes.

811
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:27,259
Did Sanchez go crazy
after he went to the funeral?

812
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:28,719
What's with him?

813
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:35,517
Actually, I need to tell you something.

814
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:40,064
How did the funeral go?

815
01:12:40,814 --> 01:12:42,191
You should have stayed longer.

816
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:43,942
I couldn't.

817
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:47,654
Veronica is still at your hotel.

818
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:52,868
Am I right, Chan-sung?

819
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,038
She's still there, isn't she?

820
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:01,919
He sounded so desperate,
so I couldn't tell him no.

821
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:05,047
He knows that he cannot come to the hotel

822
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:07,216
or see her even if he comes there.

823
01:13:09,426 --> 01:13:11,053
But he thinks she's still at our hotel

824
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:14,056
even though he cannot see her.

825
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:19,061
I'll have a talk with him,
so please just play along.

826
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:20,479
Just until he gets better.

827
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,439
When will he get better?

828
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:40,124
Man-wol, thank you
for what you did last time.

829
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,128
I said goodbye to her thanks to you.

830
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:50,050
I'm making something that Veronica liked.

831
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:53,387
She loved it whenever I cooked it for her.

832
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:56,014
Can you bring it to her?

833
01:13:58,308 --> 01:14:00,060
Sure, let's do that.

834
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:04,148
Chan-sung.

835
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:08,318
You're really bad at acting.

836
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,696
If you're going to do it, do it right.

837
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:17,911
Sanchez, do you have anything else
other than pizza for her?

838
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:22,416
You know, the shoes or jewelry
that Veronica used to like.

839
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,209
Oh, I can take a car too.

840
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,421
Can you really take it to her?

841
01:14:27,504 --> 01:14:30,632
Of course, bring everything.
I'll take anything to her.

842
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,552
Oh, we have a sea in my hotel.

843
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:34,720
How about the yacht?

844
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:38,265
It would be great
if she plays on that yacht at the hotel.

845
01:14:38,515 --> 01:14:39,349
Jang Man-wol!

846
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:40,267
What?

847
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,646
I'm comforting him.

848
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:50,444
If Sanchez doesn't get better soon,
he'll end up giving me everything he has.

849
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:09,087
Why are you doing this?

850
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,965
It's because you didn't tell him
the truth.

851
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:14,051
I'm trying to comfort him
because he's in pain.

852
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:15,552
Do you find that silly?

853
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,888
Yes, it's ridiculous to me.

854
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,350
Parents who buy lifelines
for their almost dead son,

855
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:24,019
and your friend who's making pizza
for his dead girlfriend.

856
01:15:25,437 --> 01:15:26,939
They all look ridiculous to me.

857
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:34,780
They look pathetic and make me angry.

858
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:37,324
Don't you dare turn
into someone like them.

859
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:44,456
Why do you assume
that I won't be just like them?

860
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:48,252
I don't want to let you go.

861
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:50,629
I don't want to send you off.

862
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:53,006
The thought of not being able to see you
drives me crazy.

863
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,217
How...

864
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:00,222
How could you tell me to be okay?

865
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:10,983
You're the one who must send me off.

866
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:13,902
Tell me that you'll be okay.

867
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,873
If you don't tell me you'll be okay,

868
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:30,294
I'll be...

869
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:34,548
too scared.

870
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,101
A long time ago,

871
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,647
I told you that I was afraid
of paying the price

872
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,568
if I did stay by your side
and look into you.

873
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:01,450
I guess this is the price.

874
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,290
Becoming a nuisance...

875
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:12,711
that you despise.

876
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:21,845
Go.

877
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,557
I'll go to my friend.

878
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:34,209
She's not there anymore.

879
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:37,546
Veronica isn't there, is she?

880
01:19:29,222 --> 01:19:31,391
Your flowers will begin to fall

881
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:34,144
when you become afraid.

882
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,730
When I first met you,

883
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:24,986
the flowers around here
blossomed beautifully.

884
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:32,244
Now, all of them are gone.

885
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:38,625
That day,

886
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:43,171
you were utterly scared
after seeing a ghost.

887
01:20:51,304 --> 01:20:52,889
Today, I'm the scared one.

888
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:03,525
The flowers...

889
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:09,698
are falling off the tree.

890
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:24,796
I see.

891
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:31,720
The petals don't even remain
in this world.

892
01:21:36,016 --> 01:21:38,435
They vanish
even before touching the ground.

893
01:21:46,818 --> 01:21:48,236
I guess...

894
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,825
nothing will remain.

895
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:00,123
Maybe,

896
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,962
the flowers falling off your tree...

897
01:22:08,798 --> 01:22:11,217
are falling onto me.

898
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,805
Just like the first leaf did.

899
01:22:23,563 --> 01:22:25,357
And those petals have piled up.

900
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:29,653
So it's gotten heavier...

901
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:33,281
and painful to carry.

902
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:40,580
I'll consider shouldering the pile
as solely my responsibility.

903
01:22:48,254 --> 01:22:49,506
So...

904
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:56,346
Don't be afraid when you leave me behind.

905
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:10,902
This is...

906
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:15,323
how I, just a weak human,

907
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:22,914
love you...

908
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:31,673
with all my heart.

909
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:57,449
It's too heartbreaking
if I remain only as a flower petal

910
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,745
that's bound to vanish.

911
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:38,776
