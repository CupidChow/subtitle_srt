1
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,633
My gosh, are you that sleepy?

2
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,772
-Is it the intern?
-Yes.

3
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,441
Yu-na needs to get her homework done,

4
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,527
but she was so sleepy.
So I was trying to keep her awake.

5
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,825
Hyeon-jung.

6
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,535
Does Yu-na know

7
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,581
that you're planning to leave
with your younger sister after she dies?

8
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,001
No, she doesn't know that yet.

9
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,421
I only told her that
I was waiting for her.

10
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,674
I see.

11
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,894
-Welcome.
-Welcome, sir.

12
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:50,485
Do you remember
how long it's been since you died?

13
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,195
I can't remember for sure.

14
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,280
Maybe about two days.

15
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,449
-Then--
-Sir.

16
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,702
Let me escort you.

17
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,122
Come this way.

18
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:14,884
Sir.

19
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,220
Are you Yun Seung-beom,

20
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,056
the eldest grandson
of the Yeongju Yun family

21
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,225
who used to live in Beomcheon City?

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,269
And you're 42 years old.

23
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,063
Yes, that's right.

24
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,440
You're still single, aren't you?

25
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,693
Yes.

26
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,113
I wasn't able to get married.

27
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,782
I see.

28
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,998
Your family must be devastated

29
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,584
since the succeeding grandson
of the family died

30
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:52,213
without even having any children.

31
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,934
Ms. Choe.

32
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,062
I thought you were Ms. Jang for a second.

33
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,606
Why are you all dressed up?

34
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,109
Mr. Kim, I think
I'll be able to leave here soon.

35
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,904
I'm on my way to relieve
my 200-year-long resentment.

36
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,906
Are you saying...

37
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,117
He's dead.

38
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,581
The very last son of that family died
and came here as a guest.

39
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:27,790
The family tree

40
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,462
of that darn family
has finally come to an end.

41
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,799
I'm on my way to his funeral
so I can witness the Yeongju Yun family

42
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,220
shed tears of blood.

43
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,013
Ms. Choe.

44
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,724
You can't cause an incident

45
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,268
like 42 years ago.

46
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,354
I went there because I was furious.

47
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,565
But now, I'm going there
because I'm happy.

48
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,578
Sanchez is still at the restaurant.

49
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,458
So all I need to do is face Sanchez

50
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,585
and say that I'm sorry, right?

51
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:17,048
I can be so much more apologetic
with a shot of alcohol.

52
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,717
This is sparkling water.

53
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,012
Think of it as champagne, and drink it.

54
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,021
It's quite bubbly. Do you have soju?

55
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,482
Mix some soju in it.
Let's see if it's any good.

56
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,818
If it's good, you will drink this

57
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,653
instead of champagne.

58
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,572
Taking away champagne and caviar
from me is the same thing

59
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,534
as taking away the hot sauce and pickles
from pizza.

60
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,079
And pizza reminds me of Sanchez.
I wonder if he's doing okay.

61
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,292
All right. Fine. Let's go shopping
before the department store closes.

62
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,335
Why is this conversation ending
with shopping?

63
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,005
I'm supposed to apologize to him.
Instead of going there empty-handed

64
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,881
and saying, "I'm sorry, Sanchez,"

65
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,842
buying something beautiful

66
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,844
and saying, "I'm sorry, Sanchez"

67
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,721
would be much better.

68
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,142
You just want to go shopping.

69
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,187
All you need to tell Sanchez is
that Veronica left this world

70
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,566
and you saw her off
at the bridge to the afterlife.

71
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,151
"The bridge to the afterlife"?

72
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,322
How could I see her off at the bridge
that I haven't been to myself?

73
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,575
You've never been to the bridge
over the Samdo River?

74
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,494
I wouldn't be here if I had been there.

75
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,331
The moment you step foot on the bridge,

76
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,041
it's impossible to return from it.

77
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,834
Well,

78
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:40,256
I can tell him that his girlfriend is
crossing that bridge about now.

79
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,091
She's still on the bridge?

80
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,926
Is the bridge that long?

81
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,265
Time runs at a different speed there.

82
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,935
It doesn't take very long
to cross the bridge to the afterlife,

83
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,229
but it's equivalent
to 49 days in this world.

84
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,398
While the deceased cross the bridge,

85
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,234
they forget their memories of this world
one by one.

86
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,529
It's not that they are forced
to stay in the afterlife.

87
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,784
They don't come back
because all of their memories are gone.

88
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,791
I'm pretty sure Sanchez's girlfriend is
crossing the bridge right now,

89
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,002
and her memories about him are
getting erased one by one.

90
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,967
It's a bitter story

91
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,512
for those left behind.

92
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,851
Chan-sung.

93
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,938
I can promise you one thing.

94
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,192
I'm 1,300 years old.

95
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,320
And when I end up crossing that bridge,

96
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,572
a lot of my memories will disappear.

97
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,034
But I'll keep the memories of you
to the end.

98
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:58,751
Well, I can't promise
that I'll remember you in the afterlife.

99
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,505
But until I take my last step
on the bridge,

100
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,800
I'll remember you.

101
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,315
Okay.

102
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:28,281
I'm sure you can do it,
given your experience of 1,300 years.

103
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,032
I'll believe in you.

104
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,584
But what will you remember me by?

105
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,755
You were worried many times
that I might reincarnate

106
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,007
as a dog or a pig.

107
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,760
You sold off all of my cars,
stopped me from buying yachts,

108
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,220
and took away my credit cards.

109
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:55,308
You suggested that I should drink
sparkling water instead of champagne.

110
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:00,688
My gosh, I only remember
these absurd things.

111
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,899
I've done a lot for you.

112
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,652
And especially, I won't be able to forget
about your bragging.

113
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,322
I might remember the word Harvard

114
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,782
instead of your name,
Koo Chan-sung, in my last moment.

115
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,247
This is mine.

116
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,543
Yes, I was going to order it again
since you liked the fragrance.

117
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,212
But the seller disappeared.

118
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,922
I brought it, so I can look into it.

119
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,967
All right. I thought you stole it
from the hotel.

120
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,802
That might be the case.

121
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,389
Just in case, look around to see
if any of this stuff is yours.

122
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,643
Did you really steal from my hotel?

123
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,774
Look thoroughly
if you see your stuff here.

124
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,830
It's right here. It's yours.

125
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,129
I'm stamping this into your memory.

126
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,216
I like it when you remember me
by Harvard, a nasty manager, and such,

127
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,425
but...

128
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,887
don't forget a man
who's smiling at you now.

129
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,150
Yes.

130
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,197
Remember these moments.

131
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,498
It looks like
Sanchez will be coming home late.

132
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,042
We should go to him.

133
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,432
This is Hyeon-jung.

134
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,398
After some man came into the hotel
as our guest,

135
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,900
Ms. Choe didn't look so good.

136
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,195
I found out that the guest was
the last son of the family

137
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,031
that Ms. Choe loathes so much.

138
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,659
She went to that man's funeral?

139
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:19,785
Yes.

140
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,330
Mr. Kim is really worried about her too.

141
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,748
Ms. Jang.

142
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,877
The incident that happened 42 years ago
won't happen again, right?

143
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,425
What happened 42 years ago?

144
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,261
The room service manager, Choe Seo-hui,

145
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,264
left the hotel and almost became
an evil ghost that had to be eliminated.

146
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,600
That level-headed Ms. Choe?

147
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:46,062
Her daughter was the reason why
she loathes that family so much.

148
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,106
And that darn family
messed with her daughter's grave.

149
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,027
This is the site.

150
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,531
The grave of a girl who passed away
on the 25th of this month

151
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,909
is harming your family and your child.

152
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,702
You must dig it out and get rid of it

153
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,664
for your daughter-in-law
to give birth to a healthy baby

154
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,624
who is in an inverted position now.

155
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:11,087
You're not supposed to mess
with an old grave of a girl.

156
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,089
My family line is about to run dry.

157
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,673
Dig out the grave.

158
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,734
Stop it.

159
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:38,906
Don't you dare touch my daughter's grave.

160
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,454
I curse all of your family

161
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,457
to die. All of you.

162
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,838
I will make sure
your family line ends here.

163
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,924
Die!

164
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,729
If she had faced Mago
before the Grim Reaper got a hold of her,

165
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,482
Ms. Choe would have ceased to exist.

166
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,571
That day, the Grim Reaper
and Ms. Jang worked out a nice deal,

167
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,031
so Ms. Choe didn't get dragged
to the afterlife

168
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,950
and could continue to work at the hotel.

169
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,413
We made an offering of flowers
for ten months, right?

170
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,622
It was for twelve months.

171
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,832
Right.

172
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,126
The flowers in the garden all wilted then.

173
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,546
The manager before Ms. Hwang
lost all of Ms. Jang's money.

174
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,382
We were the poorest then.

175
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,343
You know what Ms. Jang did?

176
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:45,723
Whenever I think about Ms. Jang
digging up arrowroots with a hoe...

177
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,059
Hey.

178
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,394
Don't think about it.

179
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,353
Yes, ma'am.

180
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,522
The son who was born 42 years ago

181
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,399
died without having a son.

182
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,194
Nothing will happen even if she meets
the people from that family

183
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,445
at the funeral, right?

184
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,156
What she's been wishing for
for 200 years is happening.

185
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,116
I doubt anything will happen.

186
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,662
Then, that means Ms. Choe will leave soon.

187
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,623
Are you finished?

188
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,751
The end has come to this family.

189
00:13:56,293 --> 00:14:00,005
I'll be able to leave without any regrets.

190
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,395
You're here.

191
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,774
Yes, he's the father of my baby.

192
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,279
I thought I should at least
come to say goodbye.

193
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,035
Didn't you say he was a bachelor?

194
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,121
I guess

195
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,582
he left an offspring.

196
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,419
If the child in that woman's belly
is a boy,

197
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,589
the Yeongju Yun family line

198
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,259
will be carried on.

199
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,741
I'm sorry I left my post unattended
without informing you.

200
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,418
What happened?

201
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,670
There's still one more child
in that family.

202
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,257
Ms. Choe...

203
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,496
Is there anyone inside?

204
00:15:55,913 --> 00:16:00,501
A baby is dying. Please open the door!

205
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,713
Please open this door.

206
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,468
Please open the door.

207
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,305
No doctors will open their doors for you.

208
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,015
That baby must not live.

209
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,475
My baby...

210
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,063
Please save my child.

211
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,176
I asked the guest from the family

212
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,554
and he said that a lover he broke up with
because of his parents

213
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,347
is pregnant.

214
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,308
That's why he couldn't go straight
to the afterlife.

215
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,979
Ms. Choe must be disappointed.

216
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,273
I feel sorry for that man,

217
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,026
but no one can compare to Ms. Choe
who remained here for 200 years

218
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,028
because of the sorrow of losing her child.

219
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,366
I know the flower is withering.

220
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,249
Can't it be stopped?

221
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,006
I think Ms. Choe is more anxious
than anyone.

222
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,722
I was really worried.

223
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,683
Did you think I'd harm someone?

224
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,644
I was worried you might get hurt.

225
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,857
That's no concern of yours.

226
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,490
Where did you get that strange suit?

227
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,952
It's a tiger.

228
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,707
Where did you find such a thing?

229
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,210
I got it as a gift,
so I tried it on today.

230
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,753
What do you think?

231
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,465
You look funny. What on earth is that?

232
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,550
Take it off already.

233
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,096
I hear it's a brand name suit.

234
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,764
Who cares if it's a brand name suit?

235
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,724
You look like you are from the Serengeti.

236
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,560
Does it look that strange?
I guess I shouldn't wear it outside.

237
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,814
Of course not.
Even our dead guests will laugh at you.

238
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,234
Should I wear it
when I see our guests off?

239
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,652
They can laugh on their way out.

240
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,782
Mr. Koo, you're bringing down
our hotel's class.

241
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,786
Right. Did the guest
in Room 403 leave yet?

242
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,621
I should see him out.

243
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,457
He said he should see you before leaving.

244
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,043
Let's head to the platform.

245
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,338
You're not really going to wear that,
are you?

246
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,677
Let's go together, Ms. Choe.

247
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,970
Stay away from me.

248
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,348
I think Mr. Koo decided to look funny

249
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:05,310
to divert Ms. Choe from that family
and help her relax.

250
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,230
He said he'd never wear it,

251
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,232
but he's using it like this.

252
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,608
Ms. Jang.

253
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,320
I looked into why my matchmaking
for Mr. Koo didn't work out,

254
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,157
and it turned out
his heart belonged to someone else.

255
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,494
Someone who won the heart
of such a man must be happy.

256
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,164
Yes. I'm happy.

257
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,749
Why are you happy?

258
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,131
Now that you know,
don't do something a crane would do.

259
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,967
I'm calling you a crane because you hate
being called a birdbrain.

260
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,719
Don't act like a crane.

261
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,638
This must be a crane-like question,

262
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,183
but do you also feel...

263
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,145
You asked me
if we can't stop the flowers from falling.

264
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,689
That's not possible.

265
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,484
I wonder if it's because
I like him too much.

266
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,863
I just can't seem to stop it.

267
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,159
I feel sorry for you too, Mr. Kim.

268
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,538
The flowers are falling because of love...

269
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,665
Should I give you a glass of Tears?

270
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,752
No.

271
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,004
I don't like it.

272
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,299
It tastes really bad.

273
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,392
She's been consistently rude.

274
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,145
How did he change her?

275
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,321
Chan-sung.

276
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,700
What is this?
Why did you get changed already?

277
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,286
I was going to take a picture
of you in that suit.

278
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,165
Thanks to you, I was able to use it well.

279
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,626
But I don't want to leave a picture of it.

280
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,670
Why not? It was totally my cup of tea.

281
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:59,299
I'll buy you a zebra-print suit next time.

282
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,678
Suit yourself. You can turn me
into a tiger or a zebra.

283
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,805
You were really cool.

284
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,516
The tiger in front of Ms. Choe

285
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,227
was cooler than the Siberian tiger.

286
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:16,024
Koo Chan-sung,
you're an excellent hotelier.

287
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,197
I forgot

288
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,158
that Ms. Choe was also a guest
who needed to be consoled

289
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,411
in order for her to leave here.

290
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,834
She's a long-term guest
with a deep-rooted resentment.

291
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,215
Her resentment which is making her wait
to see the end of the Yun family

292
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,758
might turn into a curse?

293
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,389
Just as she wanted,
that family is facing a problem.

294
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,269
I told you everything comes
with a price, right?

295
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,022
For making her feel so much sorrow,

296
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,566
they received a curse.

297
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,860
But it's been 200 years already.

298
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,864
Time doesn't mean anything to the dead.

299
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:09,286
With such resentment,
one could spend 200 years,

300
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,913
or 500 years,

301
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,918
or even 1,000 years.

302
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,791
They wait for a long time

303
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,627
not knowing when their hearts
will open up again.

304
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,006
I guess it could be considered
a curse too.

305
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,885
Are you...

306
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,098
still waiting for him to come?

307
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,643
Chan-sung.

308
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,437
If he comes,

309
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,733
will you do what you did
for Ms. Choe for me too?

310
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,278
Will you become a tiger?

311
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,034
I told you to trust me.

312
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,161
Anything is possible.

313
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,790
Since I'm yours.

314
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,087
Right.

315
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,631
Then you wear that.

316
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,551
And we will go to eat beef short rib soup
that tigers love.

317
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,511
You said tigers like red bean porridge.

318
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,554
Who said that?

319
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,014
You did.
That tigers love red bean porridge.

320
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,184
No tigers like red bean porridge.

321
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,519
You think they're vegetarians?

322
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,813
You have to get them some beef at least.

323
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,191
All right. Let's go and have some soup.

324
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,407
Let's put this on.

325
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,367
I will not.

326
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,497
If you don't wear this,
I will take all your clothes off.

327
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,457
Do as you please.

328
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,129
But will you be able to handle it?

329
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,425
I don't think so.

330
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,766
Let's have the soup tomorrow.

331
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,811
I have to go home and see Sanchez.

332
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,816
What are you doing?

333
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,110
You don't have to know.

334
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,538
They are flowers that fall
because of love.

335
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,208
There are still so many flowers.

336
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,752
It took more than 1,000 years
for them to bloom.

337
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,629
I don't think they'll fall that easily.

338
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,592
Look, it's a firefly.

339
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,931
I saw it from time to time
after the tree changed.

340
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,476
See? Even a firefly comes
now that the flowers have bloomed.

341
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,604
But can something like that come in here?

342
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,564
I don't know.

343
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,817
Since it's inside the hotel,
it can't be alive.

344
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,029
Is that what Mr. Koo was talking about?

345
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:32,822
What?

346
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,532
He asked me once

347
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,744
if there could be a soul
that looks like a firefly.

348
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,332
Why is there only one? It must be lonely.

349
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:18,970
He's spent all those years,
unable to show himself.

350
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,474
He's always been with her like a dust.

351
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,227
Now finally, he will be seen.

352
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,278
The flowers have finally bloomed.

353
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:39,949
I wonder if she'll be willing to listen
to his side of the story.

354
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,499
When things in one's heart are entangled,

355
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,834
it's so hard to untangle them.

356
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,712
I will weave them properly this time.

357
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,302
I ate too much soup.

358
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,929
I feel so bloated.

359
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,765
I know that's just an excuse
to come here to see her.

360
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,104
The baby she is carrying

361
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,606
is the child of the family
Ms. Choe hates, right?

362
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,234
Right. She thought the family line
finally ended.

363
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,902
But it continues persistently.

364
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,071
And that's the baby
who disappointed Ms. Choe.

365
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,282
If only that child disappears,

366
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:24,077
Ms. Choe's deep grudge will be resolved.

367
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,125
Do you really think so?

368
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,754
If the child disappears,

369
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,840
will that solve everything?

370
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,679
Shall I get rid of that baby right now?

371
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,559
The baby doesn't seem to be
in good condition anyway.

372
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,112
Are you all right?

373
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,866
My stomach was tightening.

374
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,452
You should be careful. I will help you.

375
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,208
She is Ms. Choe's enemy.

376
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,545
Why is he helping her?

377
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,343
What is this?

378
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,724
This is a nice car. I wanted to buy this.

379
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,517
Just because you have an expensive car,

380
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,644
doesn't mean you can park it anywhere.

381
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,066
Isn't she also Mago?

382
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,569
Oh, my! Mago!

383
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:42,071
-Mago!
-Man-wol!

384
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,699
It's been such a long time.

385
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,368
You used to come to my hotel often
when Mun-suk was there.

386
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,995
Why don't you come anymore?

387
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,498
We don't get a lot of money
because you don't come.

388
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,168
-Come more often.
-Where are you poking me?

389
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,962
I'm very busy these days.

390
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,423
I'm going to an opening now.

391
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,300
I don't know where the place is,

392
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,719
but it will be a success
thanks to your help.

393
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,847
Some young people have started
a computer business

394
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,058
in a small office here.

395
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,144
-Computer business?
-Yes, computer business.

396
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,648
I think it's praiseworthy
so I'm cheering them on.

397
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,441
They are very lucky.

398
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,195
And who are you?

399
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,530
Is he the new manager?

400
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,614
Yes.

401
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,659
Nice to meet you.

402
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,454
Take her hand quickly.
She'll bring you money.

403
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,750
My name is Koo Chan-sung.

404
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,710
You're holding it so hard.

405
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:43,007
You seem very nice.
I think we'll be meeting often.

406
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,345
Take good care of your guests.

407
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,513
Especially,

408
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,431
your first guest.

409
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,892
"My first guest"?

410
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,687
One's first guest is very important.

411
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,233
That's why I'm going as their first guest
to support them.

412
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,861
Man-wol.

413
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,029
Goodbye.

414
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,993
Have a good day. I've opened
lots of champagne bottles thanks to you.

415
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,161
Right.

416
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:15,623
By the way, you're so pretty nowadays.

417
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,299
You will be rich.

418
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,759
She's a deity of wealth.
She shook your hand and said nice things.

419
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,804
Was that why you were
so excited to see her?

420
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,182
Of course. I get excited whenever I meet
good-looking guys and rich women.

421
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,519
Then you should treat me differently now.

422
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,650
Since you'll be rich,
I'll treat you as a woman.

423
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,569
Let's go, sister.

424
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,120
First guest...

425
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:03,171
There is a guest that even Ms. Jang
and the staff don't know about.

426
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:07,300
Those who don't show their existence
also have the meaning of their existence.

427
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:10,345
Letting them exist
in the way they want to exist

428
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,347
is my answer to "the existence."

429
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,849
Just say you don't know.

430
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,187
By the way,
do you know where that murderer ghost is?

431
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,565
It is not easy to find a vengeful ghost.

432
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,442
You don't know that either.

433
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:28,112
The seven guests who were murdered by him
think we will bring him in soon.

434
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,573
They're waiting for him,
refusing to get on the bus.

435
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,290
Tell them

436
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,126
that they'll get to ride
a limousine if things get delayed.

437
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,712
I guess that means
it's going to take some time.

438
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,839
Vengeful ghosts...

439
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,510
always hide themselves in darkness.

440
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:05,441
If something's dark
even when it's no place for a shadow,

441
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,819
that's where they'll be.

442
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,409
Don't be late for the movie.

443
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,245
If you're going to be late again,
don't come. Let's just break up.

444
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,959
If you think you're being watched
by someone from a dark space,

445
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,627
it's one of them.

446
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,935
Hello, Sanchez.

447
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,088
VERONICA

448
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,280
I was so close to catching him.

449
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,952
He doesn't approach Koo Chan-sung
because you're always with him.

450
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,454
It seems like he's aiming
for people around Chan-sung.

451
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,457
I'm sure I'll catch him soon,
but he should warn them

452
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,126
just in case.

453
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:32,755
Mr. Kim, does Yu-na still
hang around with Hyeon-jung?

454
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,507
She's with him even right now.

455
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,934
-That's good.
-Okay.

456
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,062
-I did well, didn't I?
-Yes, you did well.

457
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,147
I know, right?

458
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,614
My goodness.

459
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,700
Man-wol.

460
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,579
I heard you got hurt.
I brought you some medicine.

461
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,206
Thanks.

462
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,586
How did you know I got hurt?
I didn't even tell Chan-sung.

463
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,254
I have an informant.

464
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,380
Who?

465
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,133
The Grim Reaper.

466
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:22,430
I guess you also have connections
with the Grim Reaper.

467
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,308
I didn't know I was friends
with such an incredible being.

468
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,685
Light this up at home.

469
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,940
Keep it nice and bright,
and don't go anywhere dark for a while.

470
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,358
I guess I didn't get hurt

471
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,527
merely because of bad luck.

472
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:42,241
I've been to your hotel.
There's nothing I can't believe now.

473
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,910
I'll do as you say.

474
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,287
Thank you.

475
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,001
I'm sorry.

476
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,548
I should've been nice to you then
instead of being so sarcastic.

477
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,634
I didn't really think

478
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,638
you'd be able to give that pizza
to Veronica.

479
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,641
I just wanted to believe
that it's possible.

480
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:18,236
Sanchez, you're Chan-sung's best friend,
aren't you?

481
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,240
If...

482
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,409
Chan-sung

483
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,038
also goes through the same thing someday,

484
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,124
I hope you'll be there to console him.

485
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,885
I'll be off now.
There are a lot of guests at the hotel.

486
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,346
You should light up the incense
in every room.

487
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,265
In every single room?

488
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,059
I guess I should tell Mi-ra
to light one up in her room as well.

489
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,314
I forgot she lived here.

490
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,568
Sanchez, is Mi-ra also acquainted

491
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,320
with Seol Ji-won?

492
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,198
Yes, they met in the States.
Why do you ask?

493
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,827
Where is she right now?

494
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,495
Mi-ra has a boyfriend.

495
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,706
She went to the movie theater
with her boyfriend.

496
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,666
The movie theater?

497
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,877
She's just friends with Chan-sung now.

498
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,713
Mi-ra's boyfriend is really good-looking.

499
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,798
Would you like to see a photo?
Wait a second.

500
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:31,058
Movie theaters are really dark.

501
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,770
Why should I care?

502
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,025
Man-wol, look...

503
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,363
She's gone already.

504
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,866
I guess she doesn't walk
like normal people.

505
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:53,080
Mi-ra would've been in big trouble
if she didn't have a boyfriend.

506
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,921
Yeong-su, when are you coming?

507
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,548
The movie's going to start soon.

508
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,967
Stop making excuses.

509
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,556
Okay, hurry up.

510
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,314
I guess that vengeful ghost
will take care of her for me.

511
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,371
What are you doing?

512
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,331
Where have you been?

513
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,042
What?

514
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,379
I went to apologize to Sanchez.

515
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,672
You went by yourself?
You should've taken me with you.

516
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,299
I just wanted to get it over with.

517
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:47,927
You've become a nice person.

518
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,136
Not really.

519
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,640
Thank you for caring about my friend.

520
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,308
You really did become a nice person.

521
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,143
Chan-sung.

522
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,064
You made me bloom flowers.
You've changed me a lot.

523
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,274
But you can't change my roots.

524
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,026
Don't even dream of it.

525
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,279
Do I need to get in your way again?

526
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,533
No, I didn't do anything.

527
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:11,909
I'm not lying.

528
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,995
So if anything happens,
it's not because of me.

529
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,791
We have a lot of guests today,
so I'm quite busy.

530
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,752
I'll drop by after I'm done with work.
See you then.

531
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,096
Darn.

532
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,877
Su-jin!

533
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,725
Sir, I noticed that you went outside.

534
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,394
-You can't just go outside--
-Please help me.

535
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:25,149
I heard this hotel has a human manager
who helps out with human affairs.

536
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,026
What's going on?

537
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:30,029
My girlfriend's sick right now,
but no one's there to help her.

538
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,032
If no one helps her,
my child will be in danger.

539
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,245
You should go back to your room.

540
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:39,872
I will

541
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,125
take the manager there and help her out.

542
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,254
Thank you.

543
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,360
I'm not going to call Mr. Koo.

544
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:12,530
I'm going to do nothing
and watch their family line end.

545
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,076
You can do whatever you want.
I don't intend to stop you.

546
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,247
I guess it's finally going
to come to an end.

547
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,749
How about you witness

548
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,752
how their family line ends?

549
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,799
I know where she is.

550
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,343
You just need to go there and watch.

551
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,387
You don't need to do anything.

552
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,228
Someone once told me

553
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,188
that seeing it

554
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,983
won't resolve my resentment.

555
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,322
I want you to prove

556
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,201
that they're wrong.

557
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,269
My baby...

558
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,110
My baby...

559
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,240
My baby...

560
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,076
My baby...

561
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,253
My baby...

562
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,257
My baby...

563
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,821
Please tell Mr. Koo

564
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,992
that this woman is in danger.

565
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:39,468
911 EMERGENCY SERVICE

566
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,106
Ms. Choe, the woman was taken

567
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,024
to a hospital quickly by ambulance.

568
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,318
The mother and baby

569
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,195
are both okay.

570
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,417
I was

571
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,628
married to the eldest son
of the Yun family.

572
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:19,133
I wasn't able to bear a child
until I was quite old.

573
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,513
The child I finally gave birth to...

574
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,475
was a girl.

575
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,535
No.

576
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,833
My husband had to use
someone else's stomach

577
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,502
to bear a son who would
carry on the family name.

578
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:59,256
I had to leave my newborn daughter behind

579
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:02,384
to go pray at a famous temple

580
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:06,763
for the child in that woman's stomach
to be a son.

581
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,475
But...

582
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,479
To make sure
the child in her belly is a boy,

583
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,356
you need to get rid of the girl
that was born earlier.

584
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:18,233
According to my fortune-telling,

585
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:22,029
that girl is getting in the way
of all the men in this family.

586
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,240
If a family has a girl
with such a bad fortune,

587
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,702
that family will never give birth
to any boys.

588
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,713
My baby didn't get any water for days.

589
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,882
They didn't even change her diapers.

590
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,717
She was neglected like that.

591
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,471
By the time I ran over to her
after hearing about that,

592
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,807
the child was close to death.

593
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,436
Please open the door.

594
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,313
My baby is dying.

595
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,065
Is there anyone inside?

596
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,110
Please open the door!

597
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:05,572
No doctors will open their doors for you.

598
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,783
That baby must not live.

599
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,828
My baby...

600
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,831
My child died,

601
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,459
but there was nothing I could do.

602
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:18,919
There, there.

603
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,505
I started to lose my mind.

604
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,593
Their family will dry up.

605
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:31,098
She used to be clean and tidy.
What happened to her?

606
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,851
That Yun family was too harsh on her.

607
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,604
How could they turn someone like that?

608
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,616
Don't touch her!

609
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,202
Don't touch my baby!

610
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,746
Don't touch her!

611
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,040
Don't touch my baby!

612
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,722
The Yun family

613
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,308
will die out.

614
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,185
Even after I die,

615
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,564
I'll watch that happen.

616
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,235
I'll make sure...

617
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,381
That's how I swore I'd get my revenge.

618
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,347
But earlier, I couldn't bear to watch

619
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,351
that baby die until the end.

620
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:07,003
If the child disappears,
will that solve everything?

621
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,340
Do you really think so?

622
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,022
YEONG-SU

623
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,151
I'm running a little late.
Go ahead and watch it. I'll go in later.

624
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:31,987
POWER OFF

625
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,979
What you said was right.

626
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:12,027
I was wrong, so I'll tell you something.

627
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,362
Your friend...

628
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,785
Lee Mi-ra might be in danger.

629
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,502
Her phone is turned off.

630
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,545
This has to be the closest theater
to our house.

631
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:33,131
Don't be so dramatic.

632
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:36,218
That vengeful ghost won't be
strong enough to kill someone.

633
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:40,222
At most, she'll get a burn or a cut.

634
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,933
Did you keep this to yourself
so you could see Mi-ra get hurt?

635
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,601
Then why are you telling me now?

636
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:53,276
Did you change your mind
after watching Ms. Choe?

637
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:56,321
Yes. My heart is shaking.

638
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,031
Chan-sung.

639
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:00,867
Mi-ra.

640
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,203
What is this? Are you two here
to watch a movie?

641
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:04,663
What about you?

642
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,957
How darn lucky.

643
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,417
I got stood up.

644
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,212
I felt too offended
to sit there alone, so I left.

645
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,298
I guess he didn't come here.
Thank goodness.

646
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,259
What are you saying?

647
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,553
I was mad
because my boyfriend didn't show up,

648
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:23,265
then a pervert behind me went, "Hello."

649
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,145
I guess he did come after all.

650
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,816
What about Yeong-su?
Are you sure he didn't come here?

651
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,429
Are you looking for me?

652
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,768
This is interesting.

653
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,228
Keep looking for me.

654
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,080
Yeon-u.

655
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,456
Yeong-su!

656
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,587
Yeong-su, are you okay? Get up.

657
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,964
Yeong-su.

658
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,467
Yeong-su.

659
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,553
Are you okay?

660
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:31,977
Are you okay, Yeong-su?

661
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,603
I'm fine.

662
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:37,148
I work out on a regular basis,
so this is not a problem.

663
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:39,734
I'm glad nothing broke.

664
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,445
I got a good rest thanks to you.
I'll get going now.

665
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:44,280
No.

666
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:48,284
You can rest a little longer. Relax.

667
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,578
This is Chan-sung's room.

668
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,248
This is the cleanest room in our house.

669
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,083
Mi-ra, this is not "our" house.

670
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:57,127
That would mean your room is
extremely dirty.

671
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,295
Yeong-su, how are your teeth?

672
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,090
What about your tongue?
Did you not bite it?

673
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,758
I'm fine, Mi-ra.

674
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:07,137
Sanchez, go get some more ice water.

675
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,141
Okay.

676
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,524
Should I check your face?

677
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,568
-Let me see.
-I told you, I'm fine.

678
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:22,986
What about your back?

679
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,155
What is it? What's wrong?

680
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:26,865
That part hurts the most.

681
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,409
-Really? What about the other side?
-That side too.

682
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,544
How are Yeon-u and Song-hwa

683
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,630
together?

684
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,716
He's not Yeon-u. He's Park Yeong-su.

685
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,509
And she's not Song-hwa. She's Lee Mi-ra.

686
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,305
The two of them are dating.

687
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:53,099
I met Yeong-su through Mi-ra.

688
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,563
I thought it might make things
complicated for you,

689
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,399
so I didn't tell you about them.

690
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,860
Because they're the people you despise

691
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,155
and care dearly for.

692
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:20,376
To you, she may be an object
of an unresolved grudge.

693
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,128
To her,

694
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,590
you're a piece of her previous lives
that she doesn't even remember.

695
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,676
Just let her pass by.

696
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,053
Are you feeling confused?

697
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:17,934
The person I cared dearly for and
the person I hated the most are dating.

698
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:22,272
Killing a person I wish to kill
won't relieve my resentment.

699
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,277
Were you not able

700
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,822
to kill him then?

701
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,410
He died.

702
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,789
He died that day.

703
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:52,987
You survived.

704
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,699
I survived

705
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:00,703
to keep my promise to kill you.

706
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,291
I'm proud of you,

707
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,835
Man-wol.

708
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:19,639
FULL MOON

709
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:22,183
You memorized the letters well.

710
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,814
Did Yeon-u engrave it for you?

711
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,904
He was dexterous indeed.

712
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,702
I guess the blade of this sword...

713
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:44,789
carries Yeon-u's grudges too.

714
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:51,129
There are many who have grudges
against you.

715
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,717
You need to learn of them all,

716
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:59,095
and die in pain and misery.

717
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,644
What about ours?

718
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,984
I'm just happy to see you again.

719
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:25,246
As a beautiful bride,
you would welcome me,

720
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,667
and I'd say that I missed you

721
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,920
while stroking your face.

722
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,010
Shut your mouth.

723
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,108
FULL MOON

724
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,105
This is...

725
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,235
the end for us.

726
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:31,372
I won't let your people survive.

727
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,334
I'm going to burn down this castle.

728
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:39,005
Our last moment together

729
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:41,257
is this.

730
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:47,013
You have to die after seeing all of that.

731
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:53,728
Man-wol.

732
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,399
I'll keep you in my heart

733
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,987
and become the moon that never falls...

734
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,200
to watch you from afar.

735
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:11,097
After he died that day,
I was blinded by my desire to get revenge

736
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:13,850
and killed a lot of people.

737
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:20,231
Then I put my people's belongings
in a coffin and searched everywhere

738
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:23,359
to find the Guest House of the Moon.

739
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:31,409
I killed whoever got in my way.

740
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:35,705
When I finally arrived
at the Guest House of the Moon,

741
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:37,999
what I faced

742
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,002
was myself covered in blood.

743
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:56,392
My sins are heavy,
and my grudges are deep.

744
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,480
That's the real me.

745
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:09,655
I have...

746
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:14,493
waited for the man for so long,

747
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,705
planning to vanish

748
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:20,416
after bringing him down with me

749
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,002
to the rock bottom.

750
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,556
I came to you instead.

751
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,020
I...

752
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:44,190
cannot make you

753
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:46,817
forget your painful memories,

754
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:49,904
but I want to lift you out of them.

755
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,308
Does this bus go to Myeong-dong, sir?

756
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:02,643
Yes, it does.

757
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,479
Are you alone? Where's your mom?

758
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,189
I'm going to meet my mom.

759
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:10,818
Do you know about Hotel del Luna
in Myeong-dong?

760
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,362
That's where my mom is.

761
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:28,252
Ms. Choe!

762
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,258
Are you leaving now?

763
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,844
How could you not even say goodbye?

764
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:39,138
We've been working together
for the last 200 years!

765
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:44,602
I'm hurt.

766
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:48,939
I'm not leaving.

767
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:52,526
I was only cleaning the car
because the Grim Reaper asked me to.

768
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:56,197
Is that right?

769
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:02,745
Why does he always ask you
to clean the car? It's not our job.

770
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:03,996
I'm done.

771
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:08,793
Are you not leaving then?

772
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:11,087
I don't even know
if the child is a boy or a girl.

773
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,338
I have to see that first.

774
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,800
I ran all the way over here for nothing.

775
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:17,259
Mr. Kim,

776
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:22,723
please make me the Tears.

777
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:23,849
A strong one, please.

778
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,684
Sure. Let's go.

779
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:30,356
-Did you cry?
-No.

780
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:33,859
-That's a tear.
-I told you I didn't.

781
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,820
-I think it is.
-No.

782
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:38,405
Be good to me while you have the chance.

783
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:40,241
I will.

784
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:44,995
I hid a present for you in here.

785
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,747
Find it. You have one chance.

786
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:48,582
How can I do that in one try?

787
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,167
I'll give you a hint.

788
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:51,502
Sure.

789
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:57,383
The room number is the same
as the day we first met.

790
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,052
-The day we first met?
-Yes.

791
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:04,056
How am I supposed to remember that?

792
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:07,393
How can you not?

793
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:11,438
Do you not remember the date
of our first kiss either?

794
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:14,275
Don't say it out too loud.

795
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:17,444
Only ghosts will hear us anyway.

796
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:20,573
Think harder. When did we first meet?

797
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:25,995
It was when flowers were blooming,

798
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:28,914
-so maybe June?
-June?

799
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,167
-No, that's not right.
-June?

800
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,836
-Maybe May?
-Which day in May?

801
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:37,464
-May...
-Which day? Tell me.

802
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:41,177
-It's not May 5th, is it?
-May 5th?

803
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,553
I know that's wrong.

804
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:53,981
It's a child.

805
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,942
We rarely see a child come here alone.

806
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,657
Are you here alone?

807
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,035
Yes. I'm here to see my mom.

808
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:10,164
Did you follow your mom here?

809
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,630
You are not dead...

810
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:22,760
He's alive.

811
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,811
You saw this place in your dream, you say?

812
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,231
Mom said that she was all good here.

813
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,610
It's a side effect of a dream call.

814
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:44,448
There's a living child in here,
looking for his dead mom.

815
01:10:44,531 --> 01:10:46,492
Please take him home safely.

816
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,828
Is his mom still here?

817
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,539
She already left for the afterlife
yesterday.

818
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:55,376
Please talk to the child
and get him out of here.

819
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:03,842
Where did he go?

820
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:11,809
Where's the child?

821
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:14,061
You were the one watching him.

822
01:11:14,144 --> 01:11:16,522
I went to bring some ice cream for him.

823
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,775
We have to find him. Let's split.

824
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:21,652
My goodness.

825
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:23,862
Hey, kid.

826
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,115
Where could he have gone?

827
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:28,826
Hey, kid.

828
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:32,454
Hey, kid.

829
01:11:34,915 --> 01:11:36,000
Hey, kid.

830
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:42,923
Hello, have you seen
a little child around here?

831
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:46,677
The kid? I saw him heading
to the platform.

832
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:49,722
What?

833
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:02,026
Hold on!

834
01:12:27,968 --> 01:12:32,431
THE SAMDO RIVER

835
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:36,560
THIS WORLD, THE AFTERLIFE

836
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:40,439
What? A living kid came in here?

837
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,609
Yes. He disappeared,
so we're looking for him right now.

838
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:46,195
How could the front desk not catch him?

839
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:04,713
Was this tunnel always so long?

840
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:29,279
Am I trapped?

841
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,333
I found him!

842
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:43,293
I found him.

843
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,004
He was in front of the platform.

844
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,881
We could've been in serious trouble.

845
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,634
Bring Hyeon-jung here

846
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:52,845
and tell Chan-sung to take him home.

847
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,058
This isn't a place for you.

848
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,894
You could've ended up
in a very scary place.

849
01:14:01,311 --> 01:14:03,730
But I saw a man walking in there.

850
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:09,111
What? What did you just say?

851
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:10,779
Who did you see?

852
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,990
A man in a suit walked in.

853
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,242
I was waiting to see if he was coming out,

854
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:16,743
but he didn't.

855
01:14:17,744 --> 01:14:19,788
I think Mr. Koo went in there.

856
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:22,708
If he did, he'll get lost in there
and never--

857
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:14,319
Chan-sung...

858
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,364
Chan-sung?

859
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:46,620
Chan-sung!

860
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:04,388
I was so scared you might never come back.

861
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:14,559
Who...

862
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:22,150
are you?

863
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:19,708
If he had come, I was going to throw him

864
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:22,794
into the hell that you made
and make both of you vanish.

865
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,005
I can't do that anymore.

866
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:29,050
I ended up falling in love again.
How ridiculous.

867
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,096
Eat this.

868
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:36,016
Eat it and become an evil ghost.

869
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:41,771
Just die.

870
01:21:42,188 --> 01:21:44,149
I told you that she will protect me.

871
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:50,030
