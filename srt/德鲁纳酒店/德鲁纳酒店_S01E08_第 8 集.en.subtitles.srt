1
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,755
Cheong-myeong, is that you?

2
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,359
You look happy,

3
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,028
Princess Song-hwa.

4
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,793
FULL MOON

5
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,300
Why are you here?

6
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,176
Why do you think?

7
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,139
Do you think I came here
to congratulate your wedding?

8
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,351
I shouldn't have shown you
mercy back then.

9
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,063
The big smile you had on your face earlier

10
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,691
was very beautiful.

11
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,069
What a pity.

12
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,947
The groom is never going to see it.

13
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,744
I'll greet him in your stead.

14
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,039
My smile might not look beautiful, though.

15
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,040
Chan-sung.

16
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:10,959
Hey, Mi-ra.

17
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,634
She's my friend.
I wonder how she knew I'd be here.

18
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,136
Chan-sung.

19
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,599
You brought her here.

20
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,436
I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable.

21
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,147
This is why you came.

22
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,528
They had no intention of letting me go...

23
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,073
from the beginning.

24
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,992
Jang Man-wol.

25
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,077
Is there something wrong?

26
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,751
She's smiling again...

27
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,547
right in front of me.

28
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,228
Gosh, Mi-ra!

29
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,583
Go look after her.

30
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,627
That is your job.

31
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:52,727
Here.

32
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,860
-Hey, Chan-sung.
-Oh, sorry.

33
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,112
-Hold my hand.
-Okay.

34
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,926
Here.

35
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,220
Thanks.

36
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,346
Well...

37
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,973
I did come to bother you,

38
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,559
but I didn't know
I'd end up doing it this way.

39
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,896
Drink this.

40
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,607
You drank seawater earlier.
It'll refresh you.

41
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,115
Was her name Jang Man-wol?

42
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,700
Your boss. Did she leave because of me?

43
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,911
Do you know her by any chance?

44
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,704
No, I've never seen her before.

45
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,706
Why do you ask? Did she say she knows me?

46
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,292
Did I see her at the hospital?

47
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,672
Anyway, I'm being such a nuisance.

48
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,091
By the way,
that was not intentional at all.

49
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,844
The wind blew suddenly
as if someone was pushing me.

50
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,138
My gosh, that was so scary.

51
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,897
Was it she who did that?

52
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,944
Nothing's been going my way.
I must be cursed or something.

53
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,779
Should I go see a shaman?

54
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,531
You need to sprinkle salt.

55
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,201
You must purify yourself
when evil ghosts are bugging you.

56
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,955
Don't stay out until late at night
just in case, and try not to be alone.

57
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,624
You sound just like my grandma right now.

58
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,669
She always used to say
that I must be careful at all times

59
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,172
because of my bad karma
from my past lives.

60
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,467
She gave me this.
She said it'll protect me.

61
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,510
You still wear that bracelet?

62
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,305
You remember it.

63
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,641
Chan-sung, I think bad ghosts are
following me around.

64
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,478
-Stay with me at night.
-I have to work at night.

65
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,771
I called a cab for you,
so just go home when it comes.

66
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,773
I lost my purse though.

67
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,275
I've already paid for the cab ride.

68
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,068
I'll put it on your tab, so pay me back.

69
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,322
Don't forget that you're in debt,
which is even scarier than ghosts.

70
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,701
Gosh.

71
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,871
My gosh.

72
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,542
Chan-sung.

73
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,462
You brought her here.

74
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,131
This is why you came.

75
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,387
I wonder if she's okay.

76
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,289
LEE MI-RA

77
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,750
"Lee Mi-ra."

78
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,874
She's the girl he used to date
back when he was in the States.

79
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,758
What a cruel twist of fate.

80
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,387
Enough is enough, please.

81
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,264
DELETE ONE IMAGE

82
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,567
Gosh, how much longer
will you folks keep that up?

83
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,487
Let's go!

84
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,830
I have a lot on my mind right now.

85
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:26,167
Those ridiculous dance moves are
really getting on my nerves.

86
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,711
Enough, okay?

87
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,381
This is nice!

88
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,216
My gosh, so nice!

89
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,686
Next news.

90
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,898
Ms. Park Heung-ja,
the oldest living person in the country...

91
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,399
You folks can

92
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,819
take a break and start dancing away again
after I get off.

93
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,698
She was the only living person
in the country born in the 19th century.

94
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,743
Ms. Park lived to be 120
and led a happy life

95
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,246
with her children and grandchildren,
always offering positive words of wisdom

96
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,581
with a smile on her face.

97
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,834
She led a great life
and passed away with no regrets.

98
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,300
IN MOURNING

99
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,849
You've enjoyed a fortunate life
for over a century,

100
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,726
so you can leave with no regrets.

101
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,569
You're going to leave like this?

102
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,538
Your great-grandson's wife is due
quite soon.

103
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:49,959
Wait a couple of months, and you can meet
your great-great-grandchild.

104
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,169
She lived for 120 years.

105
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,464
She has 8 children and 24 grandchildren.

106
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,925
It'd be foolishly greedy of her
to stay just to meet

107
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,760
her great-great-grandchild.

108
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:03,556
Your great-great-grandchild will be
so adorable.

109
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,767
You'll be incredibly sad
if you don't get to meet this baby.

110
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,978
I said, she lived for 120 years.

111
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,398
You have nothing to be sad about.

112
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,246
Why stop a soul
who is ready to rest in peace?

113
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,708
I stopped her?
No, her great-great-grandkid did.

114
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,419
She has witnessed three centuries

115
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,755
and experienced everything
humans could possibly experience

116
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,299
in one lifetime.

117
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,551
And because of you, that special soul will

118
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,595
wander around the realm of the living now.

119
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,890
They won't let such a special soul
wander around.

120
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,603
Look, that nosy woman is already here.

121
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,502
Her children are great cooks.

122
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,670
This funeral food is really delicious.

123
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,465
Hey, try some.

124
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,929
I can tell right away
it came out of frozen ready meals.

125
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,140
If you have to cook yourself
for the funeral,

126
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,060
your family will never be at peace.
That's how it is these days.

127
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:36,190
I guess her family's motto is
to take the easy way.

128
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,401
This is why her family was so happy.

129
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,239
Did you interrupt

130
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,783
that soul's journey
to the afterlife just to see me?

131
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,078
I'm kind of regretting it.

132
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,996
It's too much of a hassle.

133
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,916
I should have gone to her right away.

134
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,878
To that woman, Song-hwa.

135
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,635
No, in this life, she's Lee Mi-ra.

136
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,013
While you were shriveled up
and your time stopped,

137
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,518
she came back to this life
as a human after living many lives.

138
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,772
You have met due to the connection
in your previous life.

139
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,691
Just let her pass by.

140
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,611
How could I just let her pass by?

141
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,702
To you, she may be an object
of an unresolved grudge.

142
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,829
To her,

143
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,624
you're a piece of her previous lives
that she doesn't even remember.

144
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,129
You wanted me to let her pass by.

145
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,508
That's why you made me meet her
through Chan-sung.

146
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,097
You cannot harm that girl.

147
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,814
Only if I let her pass by,
I could leave this world peacefully.

148
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:04,570
Just like the warmhearted Mago wants.

149
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,708
To give you some relief,

150
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,503
I'll go back to the hotel
without causing trouble and stay there.

151
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,306
Drop me off on your way.

152
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,517
Or you can take me to the Samdo River.

153
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,615
Will...

154
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,243
he come too?

155
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,316
For a flower to blossom,
she needs to feel the wind

156
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,318
and face the rain too.

157
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,663
Do you know where Ms. Jang is?

158
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,041
She hasn't come back yet.

159
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,918
Did anything happen on your outing?

160
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,421
She got mad all of a sudden
and disappeared.

161
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,549
Ms. Jang's sudden change of mood
isn't special.

162
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,925
It happens all the time.

163
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,886
When she gets mad, she usually
goes shopping or to a restaurant.

164
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,889
She's probably at a department store
or at a famous restaurant now.

165
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,642
She probably can't do that
because her credit card's maxed out.

166
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,103
Then, she must be livid.

167
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,397
I should stay away from her today.

168
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,191
When she gets livid,
does she vanish into thin air

169
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,484
and not come back to the hotel?

170
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,944
That never happens.

171
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,238
Ms. Jang has to come back to the hotel.

172
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,532
No matter how far she runs away,
the hotel will chase after her.

173
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,826
The hotel will chase after her?

174
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,875
Are there more secrets
in this hotel I'm not aware of?

175
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,668
If Ms. Jang didn't tell you,

176
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,545
-you don't--
-I don't have to know?

177
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:32,134
I'm not here to stay
just temporarily anymore.

178
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,012
If all the hotel staff knows what it is,

179
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,680
I must know too.

180
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,353
You said that she was tied down
to this hotel for a punishment.

181
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,398
Does her punishment follow after her
when she runs away from it?

182
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,691
That's right.

183
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,988
Ms. Jang can never leave this hotel.

184
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,931
She can't go to the afterlife.

185
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,518
And she can't live in this world either.

186
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:27,064
It looks like she tried several times
to run away at first.

187
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,483
But it never worked.

188
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,324
Ms. Jang is the Moon Tree.

189
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,786
And the energy of the Moon Tree
is creating this space.

190
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,417
Wherever she goes,
the Moon Tree will put down roots there.

191
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,130
And there stands
the Guest House of the Moon.

192
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,608
When she stays away from the hotel
for more than a day,

193
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,279
the Moon Tree follows her to where she is.

194
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,614
That's why she must return.

195
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,784
It's impossible for her to escape from it.

196
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,330
That means

197
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,333
she's been locked up in this hotel.

198
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,257
But why was she tied down here?

199
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,802
I heard
that she almost became an evil ghost,

200
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,638
but Mago brought her here
and tied her down to this place.

201
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,516
You've seen what happened

202
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,644
to the vengeful ghost
who harmed humans in this life.

203
00:19:55,235 --> 00:20:00,157
To Ms. Jang, this may be her prison,
but it's also a fence.

204
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,619
It's safe for her to stay here.

205
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,799
Here.

206
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,468
Thank you.

207
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,428
You were lucky. No one took your bag.

208
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,638
Thank you so much.

209
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,270
How did this end up on the bus?

210
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:33,899
Wait.

211
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,362
My photo is missing.

212
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,409
Amusement park.

213
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,372
It looks like Lee Mi-ra was happy.

214
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,591
Chan-sung?

215
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,322
Mr. Koo told me to prepare this for you.

216
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,161
He was quite worried
when you didn't come back

217
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,913
after you disappeared without a word.

218
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,793
I met someone,

219
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,629
and I needed some time to think alone.

220
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,964
As he was worried,

221
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:43,844
I told him why you had no choice
but to come back to the hotel.

222
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,141
You did?

223
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,144
Where's Chan-sung now?

224
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,287
Is she okay?

225
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,835
Your friend.

226
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,546
I made her fall into the water.

227
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,214
Did she drown?

228
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,967
She's fine.

229
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,427
Too bad.

230
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,647
Why aren't you asking me

231
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,735
why I made her fall into the water

232
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,695
and what I saw in her face?

233
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,281
You should ask me millions of questions,
scold me, and stop me.

234
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,785
If I try to stop you, will that work?

235
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,209
I really don't know.

236
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,754
You call yourself a really bad person.

237
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,799
And seeing how you've been stuck here
for 1,000 years,

238
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,926
I guess you did something very serious.

239
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,972
When I saw you in my dream,

240
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,517
you were just in love.

241
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,650
So what did you do earlier?

242
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:23,902
What?

243
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,656
Where did you go after ditching me?

244
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,492
There's nothing much for you to do
with a maxed-out credit card.

245
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:36,039
I don't need you or my credit card
to have fun, you know.

246
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,041
I attended a dance party

247
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,961
and ate nice food at a feast.

248
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,421
A dance party?

249
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:47,509
Yes, the dance moves were
really mysterious.

250
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,972
And you went there alone?

251
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,599
You could've invited me. Unbelievable.

252
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,019
If you were there,

253
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,438
it would've been a sight.

254
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,777
Let's do nice things together.

255
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:10,240
It's better to see
and eat good things together.

256
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:17,122
The view is much better
now that I'm with you.

257
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,733
Whatever it is you're going to do,

258
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,985
just don't forget this.

259
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:52,157
I don't care if this is
your prison or your fence.

260
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,743
I will...

261
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,246
stay here with you.

262
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,395
Doctor.

263
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,196
Sir, it's raining.

264
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,953
I'm always happy whenever it rains

265
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,080
because I'll be with you.

266
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,585
I'm not your doctor, miss.

267
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,339
Please stay with me until the song ends.

268
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:37,906
Honey?

269
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:51,878
Honey?

270
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,102
Hey.

271
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,019
Hey.

272
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,401
What's that?

273
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,821
You're the one who said
she should stay with us.

274
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,824
Me? To whom?

275
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,033
Me.

276
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,996
What are you doing here?

277
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,582
I was scared to be alone.

278
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,793
You have no idea what happened to me.

279
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,296
-What happened?
-I found the purse I had lost

280
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,756
on an express bus

281
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,093
when I never got on one.

282
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:44,556
Hold on. Does this mean
that it got on the bus itself?

283
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:45,974
My gosh!

284
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,184
Stop it, both of you.

285
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,270
When I'm home, I'd like a rest
from the supernatural.

286
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,564
But this can't be explained
scientifically.

287
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:56,151
Someone must've taken your purse
and left it on the bus.

288
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,988
Yes, that's possible. You're right.

289
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,366
Didn't you lose anything?
Money or credit cards?

290
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,076
I never carried around any.

291
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,829
That being said, can I borrow some money?

292
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,083
Sanchez!

293
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,838
I'll let her stay here for now,
just in case.

294
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,302
You're opening
the hotel's amusement park again?

295
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,389
Yes, someone seems to have had
some fond memories of an amusement park.

296
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,368
Whoever it is,
the guest will have fun here.

297
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,037
So when will that guest arrive?

298
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,581
I'll invite her soon.

299
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,834
Escort her with care.

300
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:55,919
Yes, ma'am.

301
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,839
By the way, where did you send
Mr. Kim and Ms. Choe?

302
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,716
To seek out some land.

303
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,726
It's eerie and full of negative energy.

304
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,853
There aren't any buildings
in the way either.

305
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:14,896
I like this place.

306
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,273
There aren't
any shopping malls or restaurants

307
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,608
within a 15-minute drive.

308
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,276
Ms. Jang won't like it.

309
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:21,569
Let's leave

310
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:25,073
and head over to the next candidate,
a sauna building.

311
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,784
Why is she suddenly looking to buy land?

312
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:31,079
It seems she can barely
pay off her credit card bills.

313
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,957
You're right.
Unless she sells the land she has.

314
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,503
No way. Ms. Jang loves that land.

315
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,464
It's very close to a department store
and naengmyeon restaurants.

316
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,052
But then again, Chan-sung is being
too tight with money.

317
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,887
So it might be possible.

318
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,224
She chose that land
after much consideration.

319
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,393
There's no way she'd sell it. Let's go.

320
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,396
Eunseong Sauna.

321
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,605
EUNSEONG SAUNA

322
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:04,028
You're very quick
to master new features on devices.

323
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,656
You get the hang of it
after clicking here and there.

324
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,367
I can't, since I'm from
the Joseon Dynasty.

325
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,286
I am from that era, too.

326
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,246
You should correct how you speak first.

327
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,541
Until when will you use archaic phrases?

328
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,256
I'll try my best.

329
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,341
Wait for me.

330
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,843
Hold up.

331
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,595
Thank you for the tour!

332
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,268
Thanks, man.

333
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,146
We'll totally contact you
after talking to our boss.

334
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,827
The hotel opened up an amusement park?

335
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,288
Yes, you should check it out.

336
00:31:56,497 --> 00:32:00,376
It'll be fun to go there
with my boyfriend.

337
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,836
Did you get a boyfriend?

338
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,299
Rumors about me having one are
all over the school.

339
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,635
Is that so? Good for you.

340
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,095
You have a boyfriend now,
so keep up with your studies

341
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,056
and go to classes on time. Okay?

342
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,265
Whatever!

343
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,393
You really liked to go to school.
How could you become a total idiot?

344
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,438
What's wrong with telling you
to study hard at school?

345
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,065
It would be nice to study hard

346
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,652
and become a cool doctor
just like Mr. Koo's girlfriend.

347
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:30,198
Ms. Jang told me to keep an eye on her
and find out what people think of her.

348
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,908
Can I eat a lot of onion?

349
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,035
-Sure.
-Let's have it together.

350
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,245
-Okay.
-Add a lot of onion please.

351
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,414
She likes onions.

352
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,174
Onion starts with an "o."

353
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,806
Stop showing off, rich boy.

354
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,103
ONION

355
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,732
Ms. Jang is kinder than I thought.

356
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,610
She is taking care of humans
around Mr. Koo as well.

357
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,737
Do you really think she is being kind?

358
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,991
Can you be kind to my boyfriend?

359
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,244
Why? Is your boyfriend mean?

360
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,414
Right.

361
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,750
My boyfriend is so mean and a total idiot.

362
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,881
Is Dr. Han all right?

363
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,842
-He isn't.
-I see.

364
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,385
He scares me to death every night.

365
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,805
He sang in his study last night.

366
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:36,889
What?

367
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,774
-You want to go in?
-Yes.

368
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,068
I need to find something
to report to Ms. Jang.

369
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,278
Listen to this.

370
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,572
Shall I pretend to be
a cute next-door neighbor

371
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,198
who's come to borrow a screwdriver?

372
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,160
No, don't you have other ideas?

373
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,413
There's something strange in this house.

374
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,539
What is it?

375
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,085
That's not a human, right?

376
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,969
Mi-ra borrowed my Qing Dynasty ceramic.

377
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,388
Well, she already took it
before I agreed to lend it, though.

378
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,848
Anyway, I let her borrow it.

379
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,392
She'll sell it and use all the money.
You won't get it back.

380
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,769
I'll get it back for you.

381
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,396
It's okay. If she doesn't return it,
I'll seize her salary.

382
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,190
You can't do it, but I can.

383
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,527
I should have seized her salary
or something

384
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,613
for all the money she took from me.

385
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:38,701
You said you won't stay for long
at that hotel, right?

386
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,454
Veronica's father recently

387
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,539
took over a hotel in Sydney.

388
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,833
Two of my father's restaurants will open
there.

389
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:46,959
It's a five-star hotel.

390
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,795
Would you like to work there?

391
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,715
I don't plan to leave this hotel.

392
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:58,096
Is there a special reason
why you have to stay at Man-wol's hotel?

393
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,350
You have a good career background,
and you enjoy showing off.

394
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,853
But it's a nameless hotel
without even a proper name card.

395
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,231
You are always working overtime there.

396
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,566
I find it very strange.

397
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:15,279
Sanchez, do you think I'd work
at an average hotel?

398
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:20,409
My hotel has world-class facilities.

399
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,744
You can't even imagine

400
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,205
how special the guests are.

401
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,582
There is only one shortcoming.

402
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,835
And that is I can't boast about it.

403
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:32,797
I see.

404
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,757
I thought you were working
for that crappy hotel

405
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,634
because you have feelings for Man-wol.

406
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:37,718
What?

407
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,264
I got you right on the spot.

408
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,021
You look like a pushover,
but you are cold.

409
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,691
-You seem slow, but you are sharp.
-Yes.

410
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,652
Right. It's just like how I look
like a pizza place owner,

411
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,737
but I'm a millionaire, right?

412
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,657
Veronica is now fully in love
with that side of me.

413
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,117
I'll get you more soda.

414
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,451
Okay.

415
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,623
LEE MI-RA

416
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,964
Did you sell Sanchez's ceramic?

417
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,174
Chan-sung.

418
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,719
Is there an available room
in your hotel right now?

419
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,814
I can't take a photo of a ghost
with my phone.

420
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,322
I can't take a picture of you either.

421
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,493
You can, if I let myself be seen
like I did at your school.

422
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,120
Although I can't do it for long.

423
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,038
Do it now.

424
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,166
Come on, let yourself be seen.

425
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,754
There you are.

426
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:55,922
I'm taking the picture now.

427
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,258
What are you guys doing here?

428
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,261
Mr. Koo?

429
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,471
What are you doing here?

430
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:07,475
We followed your doctor girlfriend.

431
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,559
Mi-ra?

432
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:09,936
Why?

433
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,604
I told them to.

434
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,365
Did you come to attach a ghost
to Mi-ra to torment her?

435
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,699
I thought you didn't care.

436
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,743
But you seem worried
I might do something to her.

437
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,870
Are you here to stand guard
over your girlfriend's house?

438
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,207
This is not her house.
It's her friend's house.

439
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,669
Mi-ra is staying with me.

440
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,630
At Sanchez's?

441
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,134
So you're living together.

442
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,097
Are you going to keep following her?
Do I have to keep guard?

443
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,016
I just wanted to know
what a good life she has.

444
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,436
Where are you going?

445
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,063
You have to take the ghost.

446
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,023
I didn't put it there.

447
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,693
I didn't even know
you were living with her.

448
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,529
If I had known,
I would've released 108 ghosts.

449
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,323
Either way, it means
there is a ghost in this house.

450
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,200
Let's take her to the hotel.

451
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,370
Ms. Jang.

452
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,164
Ms. Jang.

453
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:15,459
You only call me that
when you want something from me.

454
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,590
I heard from Mi-ra

455
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:24,260
that you keep hearing strange noises

456
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,511
and see strange things.

457
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:28,180
You want to stay at a hotel
for a while, right?

458
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,891
I got this house from my parents.
It's quite old,

459
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,894
so it's not properly soundproofed.
Maybe that's the reason.

460
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,355
I told him everything.

461
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,607
You can't even sleep after you moved in.

462
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,778
We could have just gone to your hotel.
You didn't have to come.

463
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:45,823
I came to see who the guest is.

464
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:49,201
We don't accept average guests.

465
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,371
Is that why your boss is with you?

466
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,373
Yes.

467
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,460
You can only come to our hotel
when you have Ms. Jang's invitation.

468
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,795
You have many doctors in your family.

469
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,090
Your hotel must run
on some sort of membership.

470
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,426
We just need an ordinary hotel.

471
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:08,929
Then you do that.

472
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,016
Excuse me.

473
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,268
Ms. Jang.

474
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,103
We have to take the guest to the hotel.

475
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,229
Forget it.

476
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,565
Why should I take care
of this house's ghost?

477
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,567
It's the house of my friend's friend.

478
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,112
I don't like your friend, and I don't
like you since you're her friend.

479
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,413
Is this the sound?

480
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,664
Do you hear it too?

481
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,459
We are not crazy, right?

482
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,879
We have a special service in our hotel.

483
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:43,881
You should get the service.

484
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,105
Her name is Gyeong-a
and she is dressed in retro style.

485
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,815
She is waiting for a doctor.

486
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,735
Could she be looking for
the dead father of this house?

487
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,278
Maybe.

488
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,447
If she sees you, she might run away.

489
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,032
I will go in first.

490
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,119
Aren't you scared?

491
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:15,913
No, I have you.

492
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,771
Gyeong-a?

493
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:43,774
Min?

494
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,114
Min.

495
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,494
I'm all right.

496
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,540
Min, you came back.

497
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:00,749
Min.

498
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,752
Who is Min?

499
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,144
I'm sorry I hurt you.

500
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,024
But my heart

501
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,610
already belongs to the doctor.

502
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,822
So, Min and the doctor are
different people.

503
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,826
Are you sick?

504
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:40,498
Min, I don't have a lot of time.

505
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,750
I can't share that time with you.

506
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,878
But I'll let you give me a goodbye kiss.

507
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,221
Gyeong-a, is this your diary?

508
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,682
Suk-hui, stop it!

509
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,769
Don't touch my things!

510
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,979
I must be Suk-hui.

511
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,942
It's not my fault
you couldn't win Min's heart.

512
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,528
Stop your mean jealousy.

513
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,490
What are all these postcards and letters?

514
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,414
Min, you ask her.

515
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,921
Gyeong-a, what are all these postcards?

516
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:35,511
I'm very weak, so I can't go outside.

517
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:36,804
And I don't have any friends.

518
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,722
So I sent my story to a radio station,

519
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,141
and all these people
sent me postcards wishing me well.

520
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,815
"I hope you recover soon.

521
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,733
I also wish you good luck
with your romance.

522
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,861
From Hui, an avid listener
from Ssangmun-dong

523
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,613
who's also lovestruck just like you."

524
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,865
This is actually real.

525
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,287
Hyeok must be here.

526
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,087
There must be someone named Hyeok.

527
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:13,841
Judging from the look on her face,
Hyeok must like her as well.

528
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:20,306
So that means Hyeok, Min,
and the doctor all like Gyeong-a

529
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,724
except for Suk-hui.

530
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,310
I guess Suk-hui is the only villain here.

531
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,228
I'll keep pretending I'm Min.

532
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,105
And we should take her to the hotel.

533
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,650
Gyeong-a can't be a guest at our hotel...

534
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,031
because she isn't a soul of a human being.

535
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,881
She's not a ghost then?

536
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:58,135
Didn't you feel something weird
when she hugged you earlier?

537
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,221
Come to think of it,
I didn't feel cold at all.

538
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,266
I always felt a chill every time
I touched a ghost at our hotel.

539
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,143
But that wasn't the case with Gyeong-a.

540
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,937
That's an imaginary soul
that was created by a human.

541
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:10,939
"An imaginary soul"?

542
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,900
Yes, it's imaginary.

543
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:18,197
Gyeong-a was created
in someone's imagination.

544
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,575
Someone created her?

545
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,119
She had an incurable illness,

546
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,705
was loved by Hyeok and Min,

547
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,166
and she even had a love affair
with a doctor.

548
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,753
The diary is real, and someone did send
a story to the radio station.

549
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,089
But the problem is
that it wasn't Gyeong-a.

550
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,966
They were done by the human
who created her.

551
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,345
Who could that be?

552
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:44,181
If we find that person,
we can get rid of Gyeong-a.

553
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:49,311
Who is this delusional person
that's so immersed in this sad love story?

554
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,146
What's wrong with you guys?

555
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,649
-Mother, they're here to help us.
-Please leave.

556
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,110
-What's going on?
-Mother, wait.

557
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,032
What are you doing in my study?

558
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,284
Everything here belongs to me.

559
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,164
I see.

560
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,131
May I ask your name, ma'am?

561
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,675
Lee Bok-hui.

562
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,637
You should wait downstairs.

563
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,648
Do you know a lady named Gyeong-a?

564
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:46,410
I'm Gyeong-a.

565
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,883
I married my husband

566
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,511
when I was 22
through an arranged marriage.

567
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,223
I never got to date anyone.

568
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,893
And that's when...

569
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,731
I created Gyeong-a.

570
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,693
I was so happy to be able to experience

571
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:23,363
a pure, affectionate,
and passionate love as Gyeong-a,

572
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:27,743
just like my favorite movie character.

573
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:31,955
The strong imaginary soul you created
still exists.

574
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,000
It's like an old movie.

575
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,836
I see.

576
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,797
You don't seem startled.

577
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:44,051
If you live for this long,
you don't get startled that easily.

578
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,093
On top of that,

579
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,763
I was once so delusional
that I created Gyeong-a.

580
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,434
Gyeong-a called me Min.

581
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,102
You look just like him.

582
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:57,314
She actually liked Min the most.

583
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,360
What about the doctor?

584
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,029
She must've been a huge flirt.

585
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:08,784
Do I need to get rid of Gyeong-a?

586
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,870
Your son and wife are suffering
because of her.

587
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:15,958
I see.

588
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:21,255
I was able to forget about Gyeong-a
thanks to my son.

589
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:46,697
She got married to a stranger
whom she didn't love.

590
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,906
It must've been hard for her.

591
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,826
Whether it was imaginary or delusional,

592
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:54,538
I'm sure it still helped her cope
with her situation.

593
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,668
Changing one's reality
by creating an imaginary soul...

594
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,338
That's a good idea.

595
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:08,760
She asked us to join her for dinner.
What should we do?

596
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,179
She said goodbye to Gyeong-a,
so she must feel lonely.

597
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,432
So you stay as Min
and console her over dinner.

598
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,434
Suk-hui is a villain,
so I'm going to leave.

599
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:17,728
Okay, then.

600
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,192
It's burning beautifully.

601
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:27,821
You're right.

602
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,034
It's beautiful.

603
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,336
Ma'am, you don't need to prepare
too many dishes.

604
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,340
Min, just wait here quietly.

605
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:51,845
Excuse me.

606
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,097
Did Mi-ra leave?

607
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,058
Yes, she probably went back
to the hospital.

608
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,520
By the way, thank you
for inviting us to the hotel.

609
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,064
Pardon?

610
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:05,525
Your boss gave us invitations
to the hotel.

611
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,402
Invitations?

612
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,821
We'll make sure we visit. I can't wait.

613
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:14,951
By any chance, did she give
an invitation to Mi-ra as well?

614
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,171
I didn't know there was a hotel here.

615
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,049
Chan-sung is working
at an incredible hotel.

616
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,689
Welcome.

617
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,440
Ms. Jang is waiting for you.

618
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:46,983
Oh, thank you.

619
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,068
This way.

620
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:03,834
Please follow me.

621
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:07,713
Ms. Jang prepared something very special
for you. Let me take you there.

622
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,631
This hotel is amazing.

623
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,616
Welcome.

624
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,746
Welcome to Hotel del Luna.

625
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,123
Thank you for inviting me.

626
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,417
The pleasure's mine.

627
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,918
I just couldn't...

628
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:52,048
let you pass by.

629
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,763
This place is really nice.

630
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,935
But why is this place empty?

631
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,563
It's not empty.

632
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,982
You just can't see anything

633
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:11,818
because of that.

634
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,076
This?

635
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,120
You can't see them because of that.

636
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,957
Earlier, you couldn't hear
anything either.

637
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:29,878
Is this the sound?

638
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,129
We're not crazy, right?

639
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,812
If I take this off,
will I be able to see some other things?

640
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,907
Why don't you let me hold onto it for you?

641
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,507
Do you like it?

642
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:44,054
Yes, I love amusement parks.

643
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,556
Is that so? I thought so too.

644
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,936
You seem happy in the photo.

645
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,193
You found this.

646
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,195
Thank you.

647
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,906
When I was young,

648
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,743
I went to the amusement park
with my family and took this photo.

649
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:08,328
That's right.

650
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:18,129
You from that day are standing over there.

651
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,303
They're my parents and my sister.

652
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,264
I'm happy.

653
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:29,975
I really hate

654
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,019
that you are

655
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,188
happy.

656
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,109
That's why

657
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,571
I'm going to breathe sadness
into that girl.

658
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,243
And I'll give her to you as a gift.

659
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:27,449
Hello.

660
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,706
You don't have a happy family.

661
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,084
Your mother said this to you all the time.

662
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,132
"You should have never been born.
I regret giving birth to you."

663
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,593
Your dad got angry whenever he saw you.

664
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,763
"Nothing is working out
all because of you, you witch."

665
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,141
After your annoying sister was born,

666
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,685
your parents loved only her.

667
00:55:56,811 --> 00:56:00,148
Look at this.
The day you came to the amusement park,

668
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,651
your family left you here and went home.

669
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:11,034
It was the saddest day of your life.

670
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:23,213
Mom. Dad. Don't abandon me.

671
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:42,690
All right. Go.

672
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:47,320
Go to her and fill every day of her life

673
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,699
with sad memories of a girl
who should've never been born.

674
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:15,241
Thank you, Chan-sung.

675
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,119
Thanks to you, I got to meet her.

676
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,331
And thanks to you, I've found a great way.

677
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,083
So...

678
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,545
I was able to resolve my grudge a bit.

679
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,214
Don't do it.

680
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,216
I already did.

681
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:34,761
This is...

682
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:39,891
way stronger than
the imaginary soul Bok-hui created.

683
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,269
Because I created it.

684
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,734
It's a curse.

685
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:17,053
-Stop it.
-You can't stand it?

686
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,598
Then run away from me, Chan-sung.

687
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,183
I'll let you go.

688
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,231
I won't.

689
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,192
Protect me.

690
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:04,225
Chan-sung, let her go.

691
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:28,333
Whatever it is you're going to do,

692
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,501
just don't forget this.

693
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:35,548
I don't care if this is
your prison or your fence.

694
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:38,384
I will...

695
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,095
stay here with you.

696
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:57,403
Aren't you scared?

697
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,032
No, I have you.

698
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:34,899
You woke up.

699
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,443
Who are you?

700
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:41,114
Ms. Jang asked me to take you home
because you were too drunk.

701
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,782
I was drunk?

702
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,118
Yes. The hospital is
in Myeongnyun-dong, right?

703
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,537
-Sir, let's get going.
-Sure.

704
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,889
Everything will be okay now.

705
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,019
You ruined everything.

706
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,452
I really don't know.

707
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,121
When I saw you in my dream,

708
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,374
you were just in love.

709
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:24,759
This is the last time we'll look
at this scenery together.

710
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,427
I'm leaving with my people.

711
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,806
Are you planning to join the rebellion?

712
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:34,018
They wish to set this country right.

713
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,938
It's much better than living
as a thief here and getting caught

714
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,273
and killed eventually.

715
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,108
Come to the palace.

716
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,111
I can keep you safe.

717
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:59,836
Are you telling me
to desert my people and go to you?

718
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,342
I can't.

719
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,054
Then shall I go to you?

720
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:24,777
If you beg me to come,
I will risk my life and go with you.

721
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,532
Don't.

722
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,494
There is no way

723
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:36,163
we can be together.

724
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,257
Right.

725
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,430
I suppose I won't need
to come here ever again.

726
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:59,437
You were a great drinking buddy,

727
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:02,815
so I will miss you.

728
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,324
Everyone's ready. When should we leave?

729
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,243
He was here.

730
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:39,787
He's probably there now.

731
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,832
Let me go see him for one last time.

732
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,126
Man-wol.

733
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:47,795
Will you come back?

734
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:51,090
Yes. Of course, I'll be back.

735
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,769
You don't need to come back.

736
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:06,188
I'll be fine either way,

737
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:08,232
so do as you wish.

738
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:10,026
No, I will come back.

739
01:07:11,318 --> 01:07:12,862
Let me see him just once more.

740
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,073
Wait for me.

741
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,852
All of your people will die
because of you.

742
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:46,849
Thanks to you,
I made a great contribution.

743
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,489
You were the one who took me there

744
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:06,911
and bought me enough time.
It's all thanks to you.

745
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:10,039
Hence, I will spare your life.

746
01:10:11,123 --> 01:10:12,583
I will kill you.

747
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,586
I will kill you...

748
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,505
at all costs.

749
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,009
If you wish to kill me,

750
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:25,846
you will have to stay alive.

751
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:55,602
Yeon-u...

752
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,062
Yeon-u.

753
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,232
Yeon-u!

754
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:03,819
No, Yeon-u.

755
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:05,863
Let go of me!

756
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:13,912
Yeon-u.

757
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:15,956
Yeon-u!

758
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:18,917
Yeon-u.

759
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:23,130
Yeon-u.

760
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:10,844
Since you helped the general
make a great contribution,

761
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,930
I will show mercy on you.

762
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:37,621
FULL MOON

763
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:21,165
I will kill you

764
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:23,333
at all costs.

765
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,036
Chan-sung.

766
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,002
Are you all right?

767
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:52,339
What happened?

768
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:54,341
Man-wol brought you home.

769
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,802
And you've been sleeping for several days.

770
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:59,137
"Several days"? What do you mean?

771
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:01,098
You've been sleeping
for three days straight.

772
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:10,816
Why is that painting here?

773
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:12,859
Man-wol left it here.

774
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:15,112
That...

775
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:17,447
She said it was taking up space,
so she left it here.

776
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:19,992
By the way, is she going somewhere?

777
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:14,588
Wherever she goes,
the Moon Tree will put down roots there.

778
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:17,758
And there stands
the Guest House of the Moon.

779
01:17:20,844 --> 01:17:22,179
She's gone.

780
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:05,722
When you see me off, don't feel lonely.

781
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:24,449
Whether...

782
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:29,079
this place is a fence

783
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,373
or prison for me...

784
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,587
what I have is hell.

785
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:44,302
It's not that wonderful...

786
01:18:48,348 --> 01:18:49,975
to be in hell together.

787
01:19:01,945 --> 01:19:02,946
Goodbye.

788
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,367
Chan-sung.

789
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,904
