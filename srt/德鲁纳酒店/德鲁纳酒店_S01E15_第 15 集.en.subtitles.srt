1
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,465
If I knew Ms. Jang was never
going to come back here,

2
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,342
I should've at least said goodbye to her.

3
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:55,680
It's good that she was able to leave
after she got rid

4
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,558
of her old, deep grudges.

5
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,312
Let's not forget to say goodbye
to each other before we leave.

6
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,773
Don't leave without saying anything.
I'm serious.

7
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,316
Promise me.

8
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,905
You too.

9
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,747
But what do you think is
going to happen to this hotel?

10
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,792
As always, the Grim Reaper
didn't give us a straight answer.

11
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,796
But it seems like Mago is getting ready
to welcome a new owner.

12
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,820
I should let this sit to ferment
until the next full moon.

13
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,532
Now, I just need to add

14
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,243
the most important ingredient,
the Moon Flower.

15
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,383
Oh, dear.

16
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,511
We're out of Moon Flowers.

17
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,140
I heard you asked your sister
at the chemist's shop

18
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,017
to start making a new batch of wine

19
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,270
for the new owner
of the Guest House of the Moon.

20
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,314
The wine is currently being fermented.

21
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,108
It will taste bitter and horrible

22
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,527
to someone who holds a deep grudge.

23
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,238
When Man-wol first drank that wine,

24
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,199
she told me that she'd like
to pluck out my tongue.

25
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,203
Whoever drinks that wine
will be influenced

26
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,705
by the power of the moon

27
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,332
and will no longer be
a part of life or death.

28
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,837
The Moon Tree will suck in
their remaining life

29
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,256
and replace the body.

30
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,342
And the person's soul will be tied
down to the Moon Tree

31
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,220
and become the owner
of the Guest House of the Moon.

32
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,935
The wine will be ready
by the next full moon.

33
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,772
But we're out of the most important
ingredient, the Moon Flower.

34
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,399
I'll look for them.

35
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,902
Where can I find them?

36
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:19,157
They only bloom in the garden
of the Guest House of the Moon.

37
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,992
But there's not a single flower here.

38
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,870
But I do recall seeing a flower bloom

39
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,497
at the garden that existed 200 years ago.

40
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,626
Then I should go to the Guest House
of the Moon that existed 200 years ago.

41
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,252
You don't need to go.

42
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,715
I'll send someone else there.

43
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,818
You came to work early again.

44
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,570
I just wanted to check

45
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,614
if she came back.

46
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,788
I have something for you, Mr. Koo.

47
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,049
I heard this medicine will get rid
of your ability to see ghosts.

48
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,717
Ms. Jang

49
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,221
once asked me for a favor.

50
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,519
If you think

51
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,731
Chan-sung should no longer come here
anymore,

52
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,775
I want you to give him this.

53
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,528
Why are you giving that to me?

54
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,574
I'm giving it to you just in case

55
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,495
because I trust you the most.

56
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,458
Up until now,
I trusted that she would come back.

57
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,544
But now,

58
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,506
I think...

59
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,636
it's time to give you this.

60
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:16,107
I guess you think
that she isn't going to return.

61
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,985
Ms. Jang has left this medicine for you

62
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,821
because she wanted you
to start living in reality,

63
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,535
instead of staying here
where she no longer exists.

64
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,559
Chan-sung.

65
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,730
Ta-da.

66
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,816
Guess what I'm about to go eat.

67
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,909
God, you have no clue at all.

68
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,535
It's obviously rice with thistle.

69
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,121
This is thistle,
the white part is rice, the sauce,

70
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,372
and the spoon.

71
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,624
Okay?

72
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:15,958
Let's go.

73
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,961
Oh, wait. My phone.
I have to take pictures.

74
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,856
Why are you staring at me like that?
You're way too naughty.

75
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,118
What is this?

76
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,578
Did you bring
those special service requests again?

77
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,124
Okay, fine. Bring those to me.

78
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,458
Give me those.

79
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,128
What will a ghost have to do
in the bedroom all night long?

80
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,214
I can just work
and look into other people's dream calls.

81
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,342
Harvard? What do they teach there?

82
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,511
Do they only make you study?

83
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,346
I don't even want to see you. Leave.

84
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:35,580
Chan-sung, once you leave our hotel,

85
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,875
you'll become an even greater person
than Hwang Mun-suk.

86
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,754
You'll live long,
and you'll become very rich too.

87
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,506
This hotel guarantees it.

88
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,471
But you can't show off like that already.

89
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,891
Hey.

90
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,143
What are you staring at?

91
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,658
Is Jang Man-wol here?

92
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,869
I have to ask you to do something.

93
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,584
What is it?

94
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:07,296
You have to stop by Man-wol Inn.

95
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,215
Man-wol Inn?

96
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,010
Isn't that Del Luna's name
in the Joseon Dynasty?

97
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,846
You're right. You need to go there for me.

98
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,768
In the garden of Man-wol Inn,

99
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,814
you'll find medicinal flowers
that shine under the moonlight.

100
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,774
You can bring some of them to me.

101
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,401
It's not a big deal.

102
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,655
You can go there yourself.
Why are you asking me to do it?

103
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,116
Because I thought you might like it.

104
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,326
If you go there,

105
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,038
you can get a good look
at the old Man-wol Inn.

106
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,375
Then will I get to meet

107
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,128
Jang Man-wol of that time?

108
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,130
Probably.

109
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,425
If you don't want to do it,
then forget it.

110
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,343
I'll do it.

111
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,475
I'll go.

112
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,315
Once you go around the tree,

113
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,151
you'll see the entrance to Man-wol Inn.

114
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,779
You can return the opposite way.

115
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:21,287
Once you get there,
do not eat or drink anything.

116
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:25,499
If you do, you won't be able to return.

117
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:35,236
MAN-WOL INN

118
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,835
You're the one
who ratted on me, aren't you?

119
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,795
I just told the truth. What now?

120
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,172
You couldn't just die alone, huh?

121
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,050
-No, I couldn't!
-Kill me again, and see what happens!

122
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,593
-Do you really want to die?
-Yes! Kill me!

123
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,429
-That's Ms. Choe.
-Darn you!

124
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,472
-You little...
-Please don't do this.

125
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,059
Please calm down and come this way.

126
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,478
My goodness.

127
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,488
Excuse me, is this the liquor
for Madam Jang?

128
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,865
Yes.

129
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,496
I cannot believe how much she's drinking.

130
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,914
That's Mr. Kim.

131
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,939
Who goes there?

132
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,871
You are alive. How did you get in here?

133
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,042
Are you here to steal?

134
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,547
You are dressed oddly.

135
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,674
Where are you from?

136
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,385
Jang Man-wol...

137
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,556
How do you know my name?

138
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,809
Are you...

139
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,110
Oh from Dangyong sent you here, right?

140
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,322
You probably came here
after you saw the IOU I gave him.

141
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,368
Go and tell Oh Chung-hwan

142
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,371
that I will be there myself
in a month to pay him back.

143
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,383
I came from a place
much further than that.

144
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,094
You cannot

145
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,680
recognize me at this moment.

146
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,642
You can

147
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,311
see ghosts.

148
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,315
Who gave you that ability?

149
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,365
Man-wol!

150
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,910
-Darn it.
-I came back for you!

151
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,787
-You came again.
-I didn't even die

152
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,664
-and came back.
-Madam Jang isn't here.

153
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,207
-What's wrong?
-I came yesterday,

154
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,669
I'm here today,
and I'll come tomorrow too.

155
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,921
Damn it, that lousy old hag.

156
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,007
She's here again.

157
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,342
Man-wol, I'm here again.

158
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,344
Isn't that Mago?

159
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,429
Bring some rice!

160
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,431
-You know her?
-We don't have any.

161
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,473
Yes.

162
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,602
I've met her five other sisters so far.

163
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,395
But I haven't met her.

164
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,774
Are you close to Mago?

165
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,612
Her sisters treated me nicely.

166
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,946
Is that so?

167
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,242
Do you want a drink?

168
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,173
You've probably just started working here.

169
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,468
Yes, it's been less than two years.

170
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,055
This drink is from this world.

171
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,599
It's been a while
since we had a living guest.

172
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,769
Don't you have a human manager?

173
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,853
"A manager"?

174
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,648
You must mean a human steward.

175
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,734
He died a short while ago
so we don't have any at the moment.

176
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,905
Are you the new steward
brought in by Mago?

177
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,366
No, I'm not.

178
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,412
She mistook me
for someone Oh from Dangyong sent.

179
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,622
Who is that?

180
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,750
Dangyong is the gambling den,
and Oh is the money lender.

181
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,418
Gambling den...

182
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,921
Does Jang Man-wol gamble?

183
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,551
After the death of the human steward
who took care of her for a long time,

184
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,055
we thought she went out at nights
because she was feeling empty.

185
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,017
But it turned out that she was gambling.

186
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,108
What should I do?

187
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,904
I'm all in.

188
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,241
If you are scared, just croak.

189
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,785
-I'm all in.
-Here's my house deed.

190
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,373
Okay, show me.

191
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,630
This is good enough.

192
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,048
Wait!

193
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,552
I'm sorry about this.

194
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:55,431
How much is all this?

195
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,433
She worked with a ghost gambler.

196
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,518
So she raked in all the money at first.

197
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,021
Then Mago found out about it.

198
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,441
After that,
the Mago who brings in poverty,

199
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,067
comes here every day.

200
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,821
So Man-wol's storeroom is about
to be completely empty.

201
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,990
She is gambling with the help
of a ghost gambler.

202
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,660
The situation here is worse.

203
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,496
We might have to sell
the farmland and this house.

204
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,584
We need a proper human steward.

205
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,204
Please enjoy yourselves.

206
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,594
Jang Man-wol.

207
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,930
Do you gamble?

208
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,143
I was bored,
so I only played it as a game.

209
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,311
A game?

210
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,940
If you lived in my world,
you would have gone to prison.

211
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,900
I am planning to stop.

212
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,361
After I get back all the money I lost.

213
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,905
If you think like that,
you will never be able to stop.

214
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,407
I have to get back the money
to take care of the guests.

215
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,326
You don't need money
to take care of your guests.

216
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,664
Is there anything you don't know?

217
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,001
All right.

218
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,296
It seems you have some relationship
with the Mago sisters.

219
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,091
Go and tell that old beggar woman you saw

220
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,634
to leave this place.

221
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,803
You can't drive deities out
just like that.

222
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,056
That's right.

223
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,644
That's why I can't just kick
that beggar out.

224
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:06,812
Neither can I refuse her.

225
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,148
She comes here every day
wanting me to gamble with her.

226
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,649
I'll never win.

227
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,110
I'll become a beggar myself at this rate.

228
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,907
I once persuaded a deity to leave a place.

229
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,826
Really?

230
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,494
If I persuade her,

231
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,705
will you never gamble again?

232
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,707
Never.

233
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,585
I will put my hand on the line.

234
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,643
Oh, gosh.

235
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,062
It tastes

236
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,481
horrible.

237
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,027
Did you

238
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,738
enjoy your meal?

239
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,573
Who are you?

240
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,908
I am here for the Moon Flower.

241
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,660
My name is Koo Chan-sung.
Your sister sent me.

242
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,829
My big sister sent you?

243
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,333
You came from a very faraway place.

244
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,002
I know you are punishing Jang Man-wol
for what she did.

245
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,631
But can't you please stop now?

246
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,092
I plan to make her go broke.

247
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,594
Please go easy on her.

248
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,680
I don't like to see her suffer too much.

249
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,474
Why not?

250
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,519
If you don't like it,

251
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,898
will you play a round

252
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,067
with me?

253
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,695
You can choose the game.

254
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,367
How about a game of Go?

255
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,952
A game of Go?

256
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,704
I like that.

257
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,767
What's going on? Is he winning?

258
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,603
It's a very close game.

259
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,772
This young man is doing quite well
against a deity.

260
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,233
He was so sure of himself.

261
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,528
He said something about Harvard.
Do you know Harvard?

262
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,154
He studied there.

263
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,865
He said he had a great brain,
if nothing else.

264
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,909
I guess he wasn't lying.

265
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,661
You are so noisy.

266
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,599
Oh, no.

267
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,318
I lost.

268
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,947
Go away right now.

269
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,449
Don't ever come back.

270
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,411
-I'm going.
-Quickly.

271
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,207
Well done.

272
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,508
I WILL NEVER ENTER A GAMBLING DEN AGAIN

273
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,552
Are you happy now?

274
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,304
Please sign it.

275
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,849
Write your name.

276
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,770
How fastidious.

277
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,900
I noticed you had too many horses
in the stable.

278
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,402
Keep only three, and sell the rest
to pay off your debt.

279
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,445
Just three?

280
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,572
You'll say you want
to make the stable look good.

281
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,824
But that's not acceptable.
Pay off your debt first.

282
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,870
Or I'll call the old beggar again.

283
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:55,290
All right. I will sell them. Okay?

284
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,753
JANG MAN-WOL

285
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,798
There. We're done with this, right?

286
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,054
Don't go to gambling dens if you're bored.

287
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,472
Find a new hobby.

288
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,105
Look.

289
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,615
Joseon is shaped like a tiger.

290
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,492
A tiger?

291
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,830
Bibimbap is delicious in Jeonju.

292
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,040
And in winter, here.

293
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,459
Pohang is famous for half-dried herrings.

294
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,046
You will love
the Pyongyang naengmyeon up there.

295
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,883
Are you telling me
to go on a gourmet tour?

296
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,468
Have you eaten all of them?

297
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,053
Yes, I have.

298
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,930
With someone.

299
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,231
Will it be more fun than gambling?

300
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,524
You will like it

301
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,112
so much that you'll enjoy it
for the next 200 years.

302
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,031
Do you want to go with me?

303
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,663
Hey.

304
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,041
Would you be interested in working
as a steward here?

305
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,919
I like you.

306
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,273
Stay by my side here.

307
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,323
Once you get there,

308
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,075
do not eat or drink anything.

309
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,622
If you do, you won't be able to return.

310
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,545
If I stay here with you,
I won't have to worry

311
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,674
about you vanishing.

312
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,302
There.

313
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,472
Drink up, Chan-sung.

314
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,580
I have to go back.

315
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,042
There's a woman I must wait for.

316
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,588
Is she your lover?

317
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,800
Yes.

318
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,387
She's someone I love so much.

319
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,725
It's too bad.

320
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,734
I guess I might regret it once I go back.

321
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,014
If you leave,

322
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,142
their memories about you,
who traveled back in time,

323
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,977
will disappear.

324
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,522
Did you come to check up on me
because you were worried I wouldn't leave?

325
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,900
It's your choice whether you go back

326
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,444
or stay.

327
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,531
If you stay here, you'll probably become

328
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:03,288
Man-wol's 85th human steward
before you die.

329
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,001
Will you go back to being someone
who'll send her off,

330
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,545
or will you remain here
as someone passing by?

331
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:11,921
That's

332
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,299
for you to decide.

333
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:29,476
Thank you for bringing these for me.

334
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,729
I can see why you sent me there.

335
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,899
You helped me realize how I should feel

336
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,818
while waiting for her.

337
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,862
For now,

338
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,531
you should be happy.

339
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,409
Man-wol has come back.

340
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,114
She must be here.

341
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,174
I'm sorry I'm late.

342
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,386
It was a short period of time there,

343
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,264
but you must've waited for a long time.

344
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,516
Ms. Jang!

345
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,268
-Ms. Jang!
-Ms. Jang.

346
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,727
Ms. Jang!

347
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,111
Ms. Jang.

348
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,865
Ms. Jang.

349
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,512
I'm glad Ms. Jang is back.

350
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,349
I was upset since we started
talking about a new owner.

351
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,559
Ms. Jang must've taken a while

352
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,353
because she had to see him off
on the bridge to the afterlife.

353
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,857
But because she stepped on the bridge,

354
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,818
Ms. Jang has lost a lot of her memories.

355
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:50,783
Her memories of the person
she sent off is almost gone.

356
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,912
Do older memories disappear first?

357
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,040
The memories that have bothered us
for the longest time

358
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,417
will disappear first.

359
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:04,714
It seems so futile,
but it gives me a sense of relief.

360
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,885
Don't worry.

361
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,971
I didn't forget anything about you.

362
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,519
Is that so? Then should I test you?

363
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,980
You're so fastidious.

364
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,150
The red car or me?

365
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,527
You. Happy?

366
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,030
Okay, that's the most important thing.

367
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,449
Do you remember
how many cars you have left?

368
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,617
Three...

369
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,746
Hey! You didn't sell them off
while I was away, did you?

370
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,331
I didn't sell your cars,

371
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,417
although I asked the horse to be sold off.

372
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,129
Do you remember Oh from Dangyong?

373
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,343
How do you know Oh Chung-hwan?

374
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,680
Even your memories
from 200 years ago are safe.

375
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,056
That's good.

376
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,600
Did Mr. Kim tell you?

377
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,185
I'm sure he did.

378
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,020
You guys must have talked behind my back.

379
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,313
What else did he say?

380
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,731
Have a drink.

381
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,734
I refused a drink from a woman
just a while ago.

382
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,027
So I need this now.

383
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,990
"A woman"? Why are you lying?

384
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,283
There's no way
you would have another woman.

385
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,286
Are you upset because I made you wait?

386
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,872
But I do. She's someone really beautiful.

387
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,877
Chan-sung, don't underestimate me.

388
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,797
I don't get jealous at all.

389
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,717
I'd just kill you. Die.

390
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,885
I see your hands are intact.

391
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,512
It looks like you kept your promise.

392
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,559
I went to Man-wol Inn to meet Madam Jang.

393
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,145
-Me?
-Mago sent me there.

394
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,397
And I was the one who saved you

395
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,607
from losing everything on gambling.

396
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,318
I don't have such a memory.

397
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,112
I was told that you wouldn't remember.

398
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:55,992
I only went there briefly
to find the Moon Flowers.

399
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,996
"Moon Flowers"?

400
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,665
Did she need them?

401
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,959
She told me she was making some wine.

402
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,670
-Do you know about it?
-Yes.

403
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,674
I had a taste of it a long time ago.

404
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,968
It was disgusting.

405
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,684
I guess Mago is making the wine again.

406
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,692
But her brother, Ji Hyeon-jung,

407
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,153
died many years ago.

408
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,550
Hyeon-jung!

409
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,468
Tae-seok!

410
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,387
Hey, give me a ride.

411
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,513
Where's your bike?

412
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,764
I left it at home.

413
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,266
-Hop on.
-Nice.

414
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,684
Just kidding.

415
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,768
My gosh.

416
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:52,400
So, the old man was
your friend from school.

417
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,778
Then I guess he's not a bad person
who stole your life.

418
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,699
He's a good friend who's been taking care
of your sister for you.

419
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:06,372
I did some research on Dr. Ji Hyeon-jung.

420
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,374
Look.

421
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,210
He did a lot of good deeds as a doctor.

422
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,046
And it seems
that a lot of people respect him.

423
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,674
He lived a really good life
with your name.

424
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,178
Yes, he lived a very diligent life.

425
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,598
He's taking care of your sister
at the hospital he founded,

426
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,141
so wouldn't your sister

427
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,060
be able to live
for at least ten more years?

428
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,985
Hey, I got a text
from your sister's caregiver.

429
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,612
What?

430
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,364
I got her number that day.

431
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,584
Hyeon-jung.

432
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,485
Fortunately, she's stable again.

433
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,821
Like always, she managed
to overcome the worst.

434
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,074
Thank you for everything.

435
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,367
Bye, then.

436
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,875
Hyeon-mi's okay again.

437
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,423
You must be very disappointed.

438
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,650
Young lady.

439
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,659
Did you take my photo?

440
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,786
What photo?

441
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:12,331
You once talked to me
about Hyeon-jung last time.

442
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,167
You took the photo of me
and Hyeon-jung, didn't you?

443
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,628
You have a photo of Hyeon-jung?

444
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,965
I guess you really were friends.

445
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:26,762
You're his friend, so make sure
his sister stays alive for a long time.

446
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,516
Hyeon-jung's always watching you.

447
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,476
He was also watching you

448
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,770
just a while ago.

449
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,447
Wait. Is Hyeon-jung alive?

450
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,284
Did he leave his sister with me
and make me live like this

451
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,119
when he's still alive?

452
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,998
Where is Hyeon-jung? Where's he now?

453
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,421
My goodness, you really used to be
an elite student, Hyeon-jung.

454
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,340
I was also really popular.

455
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,675
I can imagine.
Even the ghosts here told me

456
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,969
their hearts fluttered
every time you smiled at them.

457
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,763
I'm sure you were popular.

458
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,433
Back when I passed
the National State Exam at a young age

459
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,893
and was known as a genius,

460
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,354
all the young ladies in the neighborhood

461
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:20,191
gathered around my house
so they could hear me read out loud.

462
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,443
I guess it was because
they could hear your voice

463
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,195
but couldn't see your face.

464
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,906
You do have a nice voice, Mr. Kim.

465
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:30,618
A man should have a nice voice.
Don't you agree, Mr. Koo?

466
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,913
But he has good looks
as well as a nice voice.

467
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,668
The person next to you
must be your school friend.

468
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:44,006
Yes, he's the person
who's taking care of my sister Hyeon-mi

469
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,466
right now.

470
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:55,393
And thanks to him,
Hyeon-mi was able to stay alive today.

471
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,441
It seems like
Hyeon-jung will be leaving soon.

472
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,193
So I've been thinking...

473
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:07,321
How about we hold a special event for him
before he leaves

474
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,532
with his sister once she comes here?

475
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:13,160
Hyeon-jung never got to spend
much time with his sister.

476
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,079
So how about we open up an amusement park

477
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,706
so they could have fun together
even for a little while?

478
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,917
An amusement park?

479
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:24,255
And I don't mind
turning the bar into a kid-friendly cafe.

480
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,842
He's been kindly waiting
for his sister for 70 years.

481
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,761
He should at least get to talk
to his sister for a short while.

482
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:36,142
Do you really think
his sister is the only reason

483
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,227
he's been staying here?

484
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,897
He may be a pure and kind young man,

485
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,233
but do you really think
he's been waiting here

486
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:47,570
for 70 years just because he was
worried about his sister?

487
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,117
Have you all forgotten?

488
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,662
He came here after he got shot.

489
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,137
If you didn't want to come
to the event for them,

490
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,015
you could've just stayed quiet
instead of ruining the mood.

491
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,475
I once

492
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,228
shot someone with this gun.

493
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:26,567
I shot the ghost's enemy
with a bullet filled with her grudges...

494
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,363
so that he could live in agony forever.

495
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,618
Are you saying you're going to do the same

496
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,244
to the guy who killed Hyeon-jung?

497
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,665
Hyeon-jung already shot his enemy

498
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,210
with a bullet filled with his own grudges.

499
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,879
What do you think that bullet is?

500
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,469
It's Hyeon-mi.
I'm talking about his sister, Ji Hyeon-mi.

501
00:41:56,972 --> 00:42:01,018
His little sister is almost blind
and mentally ill.

502
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:06,065
And he kept her beside his enemy
and made him suffer forever.

503
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,736
It's true that Hyeon-jung has been
waiting here for 70 years

504
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:11,946
for his sister to come.

505
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:16,075
But it's also true that he's used her
to harass the guy who killed him

506
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,910
for 70 whole years.

507
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,204
The person who killed Hyeon-jung

508
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,707
is his friend
that's taking care of his sister?

509
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,053
Yu-na.

510
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,596
Hyeon-jung.

511
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:41,892
I brought someone
who really wished to meet you.

512
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,644
Me?

513
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,074
Hyeon-jung.

514
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:12,339
Ms. Jang, Hyeon-jung's so-called friend
just came.

515
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,383
Yu-na brought him here.

516
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,762
I guess he's here to ask him
for forgiveness.

517
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,233
Hyeon-jung ran away
as soon as he saw the old man.

518
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,819
I guess he doesn't want to meet him.

519
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,322
I didn't bring him here for him.

520
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:40,743
Hyeon-jung can get his stolen life back,
even if only a little,

521
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,414
only while he's still alive.

522
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,374
That's why I brought him here.

523
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,296
Hyeon-jung needs to decide for himself.

524
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:16,153
During the war,
a bombing killed both his parents.

525
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:19,573
And Hyeon-jung barely managed
to save his little sister.

526
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,547
Eat slowly.

527
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:38,884
Is it good?

528
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,430
Hyeon-mi, once we get
to our uncle's place in Busan,

529
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,015
you can eat a lot of good food

530
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,643
and get treated
so that you aren't in pain anymore.

531
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,854
His sister was badly hurt,

532
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,606
so he was in a rush.

533
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:54,650
Instead of going with the refugees,

534
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,486
he decided to take shortcuts
through the mountains.

535
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,215
Do not move.

536
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,274
Hyeon-jung?

537
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,818
Tae-seok.

538
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:40,946
That's where he met a runaway soldier,

539
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,115
who turned out to be his friend.

540
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,290
Eat slowly.

541
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,711
My sister is badly hurt.

542
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,464
Do you know the shortcut?

543
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,970
We're headed to our uncle's place
in Busan.

544
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,264
Come with us, Tae-seok.

545
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,480
Take off your uniform.

546
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,316
Take it off!

547
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,819
I'll get shot and die if I'm wearing this,

548
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,363
so take that off.

549
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,576
Tae-seok.

550
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,922
You can't take this.
Hyeon-mi's medicine is in here,

551
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,507
and she'll die without it.

552
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,183
Let it go before I shoot you.

553
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,089
Hyeon-jung.

554
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,675
Hyeon-jung!

555
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,635
Hyeon-jung!

556
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,221
-Hyeon-jung!
-Hyeon-jung.

557
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,724
I didn't do this on purpose.
You know that, right?

558
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,518
-Hyeon-jung!
-Damn it.

559
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,687
-Hyeon-jung!
-I'm sorry.

560
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,731
JI HYEON-JUNG

561
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,402
-Hyeon-jung!
-Take my sister with you.

562
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,028
Hyeon-jung!

563
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,864
Take my sister with you.

564
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,866
-Hyeon-jung!
-Please.

565
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,007
Hyeon-jung!

566
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:31,408
His friend took Hyeon-mi
and went to his uncle's house.

567
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,492
JI HYEON-JUNG

568
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,995
They recognized Hyeon-mi,

569
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,539
so they naturally thought
the one who brought her there

570
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,542
was Hyeon-jung.

571
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,837
Ever since that time,
he has lived as Ji Hyeon-jung.

572
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:54,640
Ms. Jang said Hyeon-mi is the bullet
he shot his enemy with.

573
00:48:56,141 --> 00:49:00,312
Hyeon-jung always talked about his sister
with a smile on his face.

574
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,898
He probably couldn't help
but loathe him as he watched

575
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,901
his friend taking care
of his precious sister.

576
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:18,497
Hyeon-jung, why are you sulking here?

577
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:26,254
Goodness, the leaves
and flowers are all gone,

578
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,006
so it looks really shabby.

579
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,550
And it looks even worse
with a guy sitting here

580
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,928
looking like a dog
who got caught in the rain.

581
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,063
This isn't fair.

582
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,650
It was really hard to see
how he got to do everything

583
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,026
that I dreamed of doing.

584
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,406
I'll never forgive him.

585
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,617
How can you forgive someone
who punched a hole in your chest?

586
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,371
Just go and hear him out.

587
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,748
I'm sure he didn't come here to show off

588
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,625
that he had a good life
after he killed you.

589
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:07,713
He's probably here to tell you that
his life has been tough and harsh too.

590
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,261
But it's not too bad
to hear out someone's excuses.

591
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,555
You feel a little better too.

592
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:21,268
Did that happen to you too?

593
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,561
Yes.

594
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,566
That's how I could finally see him off

595
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,860
as he turned around and left.

596
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:35,449
You said you didn't remember
the firefly incident.

597
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,910
Are you nitpicking about my memory now?

598
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,830
If you're going to sit here and sulk,

599
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,790
I'll go send him away.

600
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,628
Goodness, Yu-na did all that for nothing.

601
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:59,431
It will make him feel relieved
for the rest of his life.

602
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,016
However,

603
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:04,561
since Yu-na brought him here,
go talk to him.

604
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:11,151
A girl you like is trying very hard
to do something for you.

605
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,623
I guess bringing you here

606
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,751
made Hyeon-jung feel more tormented.

607
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,212
Please leave.

608
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,714
Well, in that case,

609
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,427
can you give this to him?

610
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:46,728
JI HYEON-JUNG

611
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,941
Hyeon-jung loved going to school.

612
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,497
Mr. Oh Tae-seok.

613
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:09,459
Hyeon-jung said he will see you.

614
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,845
He wants to see you in this room.

615
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,471
Please go on in.

616
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:07,100
You still look the same, Hyeon-jung.

617
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:13,064
I kept an eye on you as you grew older.

618
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,941
Tae-seok.

619
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,163
OH TAE-SEOK

620
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:43,595
JI HYEON-JUNG

621
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,973
You left Hyeon-jung with his enemy.
Why aren't you worried?

622
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,309
Because Hyeon-jung is good-natured.

623
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,979
And he's been keeping his eye on him.

624
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:56,066
I'm sure he's already
forgiven him a little since Mr. Oh has

625
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,776
never given up on Hyeon-mi.

626
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,362
Since the nice Hyeon-jung
has forgiven him a little,

627
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:04,407
the wicked owner will make him pay
the compensation.

628
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,286
Are you going to take money from him?

629
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,414
Hyeon-jung's friend is filthy rich.

630
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:16,419
I should throw a party
for our little kid before he leaves.

631
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,884
You donated a lot of money
and even founded a hospital

632
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,803
under Ji Hyeon-jung's name.

633
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:28,515
I've spent all my life
trying to atone for what I did.

634
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,310
Then do one more thing while you're at it.

635
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:36,648
Please buy a school
under Ji Hyeon-jung's name.

636
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,318
If you can, the prestigious school
Hyeon-jung used to attend.

637
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:42,195
Please buy it for us.

638
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:47,951
DONGSEON HIGH SCHOOL

639
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:49,953
We're so thankful

640
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:54,040
Dr. Ji Hyeon-jung donated
such a large sum to the school.

641
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,711
However, are you sure you're okay

642
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,171
with such a small event
in the middle of the night?

643
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,466
All Mr. Ji Hyeon-jung wants is
an honorary high school diploma.

644
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,553
Also, the nighttime is more convenient
for those attending today.

645
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:10,306
And the person receiving the diploma is
Ji Hyeon-jung.

646
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,600
He has the same name as Dr. Ji?

647
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,646
He's a student
who loved going to this school.

648
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,774
There he is.

649
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,073
CEREMONY FOR JI HYEON-JUNG'S
HONORARY DIPLOMA

650
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,367
They must be his family.

651
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,788
Yes, they are.

652
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,422
Is everyone here?

653
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:46,176
Yes. So many people came.

654
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,934
Why did you have to bring everyone here?

655
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,604
Hyeon-jung is popular, you know.

656
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,899
The Grim Reaper provided us with a bus,

657
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,776
so you don't have to worry.

658
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,162
Here is your honorary diploma.

659
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,802
Congratulations on your graduation.

660
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,845
Thank you.

661
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,645
Thank you for coming, everyone.

662
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,737
For...

663
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,489
-Hyeon-jung!
-Hyeon-jung!

664
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,200
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

665
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,162
Chan-sung.

666
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,957
All of them are ghosts?

667
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:02,752
Yes. The people you can see
have been ghosts for a long time,

668
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,003
so they can show themselves.

669
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:07,006
Show themselves?
That must be a high-level ability.

670
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,300
Aside from that table,

671
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,469
this whole place is
filled with our employees.

672
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,932
That table is full,
and this table is full too?

673
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:21,104
Sanchez, if this is too hard for you,
it's okay to stay outside.

674
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:23,064
No, I'm okay.

675
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,733
When else will I get to see
ghosts having dinner?

676
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,735
I want to thank everyone...

677
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:31,656
Hey, are you sure Man-wol's cousin
isn't a human?

678
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:32,991
It's a long story.

679
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,618
She was a ghost,
then she possessed someone else's body--

680
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,620
Forget it. They even possess people.

681
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:40,331
I'll look after everyone
and work even harder from now on.

682
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,417
-Thank you!
-Good luck!

683
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,044
-Let's go!
-Bravo.

684
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,633
Chan-sung, do you like those ghosts?

685
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,261
It's our first time
having a meal together.

686
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:55,847
It feels good when you have
a meal with your colleagues, right?

687
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,811
Sanchez, don't drink too much.

688
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,855
Some mischievous ghosts

689
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:06,149
like to possess drunk people.

690
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,193
Are you serious?

691
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,905
The one sitting at that table

692
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,491
has been looking at you for a while.

693
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:16,910
Be careful.

694
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:23,124
Ghosts must like good-looking people
like me. Am I right?

695
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,769
DASHCAM SETTINGS

696
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:51,027
Goodness. Is that a ghost?

697
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,071
I must be able to see them now.

698
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:01,079
Here. He was recorded clearly.
It's not a ghost.

699
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,206
You startled me.

700
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,458
I guess he's not a ghost.

701
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:10,213
There's no need to be so scared.
Ghosts used to be people too.

702
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:13,550
It's normal to be scared.
You're the one who became strange.

703
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,555
Chan-sung, I think you're going too far.

704
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,933
I'm worried you might completely move on
to the other side.

705
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,520
I understand your concern,

706
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:29,357
but the people
you saw today are all going to leave.

707
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,317
Man-wol, too?

708
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,862
Yes.

709
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,490
Jang Man-wol, too.

710
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,628
I gave Mr. Koo the medicine

711
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,214
while you were away.

712
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,223
He didn't take it.

713
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:04,976
I see.

714
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:08,062
Mr. Koo must have trusted

715
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,731
you'd return.

716
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,112
I guess you didn't.

717
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,574
I was glad you were freed from this place.

718
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,159
But,

719
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,703
you returned.

720
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,956
I didn't return because I'm tied
to the Moon Tree like before.

721
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,793
A new owner will be coming.

722
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,171
Mago is working on it.

723
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,716
Does Mr. Koo know about this?

724
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,887
Yes. He does.

725
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:43,723
Although neither of us talks about it.

726
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:50,104
I want to send off Mr. Kim,
Hyeon-jung, and you

727
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,983
while I'm here.

728
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:56,611
But...

729
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,448
I'm not sure if I will have enough time.

730
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:22,053
Ms. Jang is inside.

731
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:23,554
Ms. Choe.

732
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,932
I paid a visit to that woman

733
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,267
we found at the pharmacy,

734
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,395
and she'll be giving birth soon.

735
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,024
If the baby ends up carrying on
the family name,

736
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,112
will you continue to stay behind?

737
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:43,616
Are you afraid

738
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,576
that I'd wander around

739
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,328
after Ms. Jang is gone

740
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,831
and Hotel del Luna disappears?

741
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,834
So you know.

742
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,920
I just found out.

743
01:01:57,505 --> 01:02:01,634
Ms. Jang is no longer tied down
to the Moon Tree.

744
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:05,972
She could have gone
to the afterlife if she wanted.

745
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:11,227
What has her tied down here must be you,

746
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,813
Mr. Koo.

747
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:16,649
Are you worried that I'd become

748
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:18,818
another Moon Tree?

749
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,195
I'm reminded of something

750
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:24,866
Mago said to that bride

751
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,827
who had a ghost wedding here.

752
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,246
She said that

753
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:34,542
it's hard, but sometimes
it's easier to let go than hold on.

754
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:05,448
Gosh, it's so heavy. It's so heavy.

755
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,166
What are these?

756
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:18,044
I take them out from time to time.

757
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,755
There's so much dust.

758
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,431
It's so strong. Open it.

759
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:45,947
-It's a camera.
-Yes.

760
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:51,452
I used it to take all these pictures.

761
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,455
It looks quite old.

762
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:58,668
Did your previous managers
take those pictures for you?

763
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:00,461
Let's see...

764
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,215
That's the one. The one
who took this photo of Man-wol Hostel

765
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:06,300
ran away after using up all of my money.

766
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:10,179
So I chased after him, and it turned out
his wife was close to giving birth.

767
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:11,848
I just let him go.

768
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:16,227
You already know Hwang Mun-suk
from Hotel del Luna.

769
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:19,230
And way before this one...

770
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,314
There it is.

771
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:26,195
The manager at that time was
really handsome.

772
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,365
They say if a man is handsome,
you should call him honey.

773
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:31,951
He was more than just a honey.

774
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,245
I don't believe you.

775
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,123
Mr. Kim told me everything.

776
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,458
Of all the managers
he saw in the last 500 years,

777
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:43,379
I'm the most handsome one.

778
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:48,384
He told me you fell in love with me
because of my looks.

779
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,596
Why would you talk about such a thing
with Mr. Kim?

780
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:53,556
When did you two get so close?

781
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,767
That's why you should've taken
these pictures

782
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,769
with the people who were with you
at that time.

783
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,438
Then you'd have a proof.

784
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:02,440
Back then,

785
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:06,611
I thought they were just passing me by
and meant nothing to me.

786
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:11,115
But looking at these with you,

787
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:16,120
it's too bad I didn't leave
any records behind.

788
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:20,583
Would you like to leave a record right now

789
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:22,543
with that camera?

790
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:31,093
Hyeon-jung got his honorary diploma,
but he didn't get to take any pictures.

791
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,512
We should all get together
to take a picture.

792
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:34,889
I'll take it for you.

793
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:56,285
I've never taken a picture before.
I wonder if I'll be visible.

794
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:59,497
You will. I took a picture
with a phone before.

795
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,917
We should have put on more blush.

796
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,919
We look pale like ghosts.

797
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,004
It's okay.

798
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,382
What's so wrong with looking like ghosts
when we're ghosts?

799
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:13,260
Hyeon-jung, don't open your mouth
when we take the picture.

800
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:16,180
Mr. Kim, don't blink.

801
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:22,478
All right.

802
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:24,647
I'll take it now.

803
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:28,567
One, two, three...

804
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,540
Mr. Koo, you should join us.

805
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:44,000
Yes, hurry over.

806
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,751
Come over, Mr. Koo.

807
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,501
How can I put it away
when you're sitting on it?

808
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,128
Get off now.

809
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,006
Lift me off of it.

810
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,470
Just try it.
I won't move until you lift me.

811
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:40,389
Forget it. You can put it away then.

812
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:49,106
To the room.

813
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:06,415
We took a picture.
Now, let's go eat jajangmyeon.

814
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:11,504
Darn it.

815
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:17,718
You took a picture.

816
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,179
It was a lot of fun.

817
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:23,349
Why didn't you call me?

818
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:27,645
We took it with Mr. Koo
to remember this moment

819
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:30,689
before Ms. Jang leaves
and the hotel disappears.

820
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,359
Is the hotel going to disappear? Why?

821
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:38,531
Mago is preparing to make
a new Guest House of the Moon.

822
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:43,619
Then Ms. Jang's Hotel del Luna

823
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,621
will disappear.

824
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:46,914
What about you?

825
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:51,377
Are you going to leave
if the hotel disappears?

826
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,619
It's fermenting really well.

827
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:32,168
I heard Mago is preparing
the wine for the next hotel owner.

828
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,545
I'll drink it and become the owner.

829
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:37,214
It's Mago who decides the next owner.

830
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:40,593
Then Ms. Jang should drink it
and continue to be the owner.

831
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,637
Do you think Mago would do that?
After everything that's happened?

832
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,223
When is Mago coming?

833
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,391
Where can I find her?

834
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:50,728
She's not someone you can meet
just because you want to.

835
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:52,980
Then nobody here can meet with her?

836
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:58,277
I think Mr. Koo has the permission
to enter Mago's pharmacy.

837
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:02,072
He said he brought the firefly
from her shop.

838
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:28,974
PHARMACY
11-28 YAKJAE-GOLMOK, GYEONGDONG MARKET

839
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:34,939
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

840
01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:41,028
Sanchez, thank you for everything.

841
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,365
Let's go out to eat with Chan-sung soon.
It'll be my treat.

842
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:46,200
Are you moving back
to your parents' house?

843
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,285
She's moving in with me.

844
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:50,621
Are you going to live together?

845
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:53,290
It's going to be so tough for you,
Yeong-su.

846
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,585
Mi-ra tries to help around the house,

847
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,128
but she's useless.

848
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:00,589
I already know.

849
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:02,633
We had so many fights,

850
01:11:02,716 --> 01:11:06,220
so we decided to see
how much more we can fight.

851
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,265
Luckily, I'm good at cleaning.

852
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:13,060
And she's better at cooking than me,
if nothing else.

853
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:15,688
She is?

854
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:16,814
Yes.

855
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:21,402
The kimchi and side dishes
she brought me were good.

856
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,155
I didn't make them all by myself.

857
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:27,241
My parents helped me a little.

858
01:11:27,324 --> 01:11:28,534
I see.

859
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:31,745
It's not a lie since they make them
at the factory.

860
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,163
"The factory"?

861
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:37,626
My parents run a kimchi factory.

862
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:41,547
They're always on the shopping channel.
Haven't you heard of Daeho Kimchi?

863
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,382
"Daeho Kimchi"?

864
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:46,760
I used to eat it all the time
back in the day.

865
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:51,849
Is that why Mi-ra's side dishes
were perfect to my taste?

866
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,392
No wonder.

867
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,313
The food that raised you
was made by my parents.

868
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:00,524
We're meant to be together.

869
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:02,067
I think so.

870
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,987
Chan-sung and I ate that kimchi too.

871
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:07,531
It's a kimchi brand
that fed countless people in Korea.

872
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:09,700
I don't think it's anything special.

873
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:12,286
Yeong-su says it's perfect to his taste.

874
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:14,371
-Right?
-Sure.

875
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:15,873
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

876
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,000
-Love shot?
-Love shot.

877
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,460
You read my mind.

878
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:24,923
They should get along
until they move in together.

879
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,217
She might end up staying here
if they fight.

880
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:31,388
Is it good?

881
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:32,431
It's good.

882
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:38,687
Both of you are writers, aren't you?

883
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:41,815
This was Li Bai's favorite drink.

884
01:12:43,108 --> 01:12:46,779
He's a famous best-selling author.

885
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,365
He passed away
just before the release of his new book.

886
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:51,158
It's really unfortunate.

887
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,494
I did a lot of research,

888
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:55,287
and the story was really interesting.

889
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:57,414
What is your novel about?

890
01:12:57,498 --> 01:13:00,209
It's about a scholar
from the Joseon Dynasty.

891
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,795
The bartender is a scholar

892
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:05,297
who won the first place
in the National State Exam.

893
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,216
Really?

894
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:09,385
What is your name?

895
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:12,096
My name wasn't recorded anywhere
in history.

896
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:14,973
The protagonist of the novel
I was writing is also someone

897
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,601
who won the first place
in the National State Exam.

898
01:13:17,684 --> 01:13:20,813
But his appointment got cancelled.

899
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,731
Did that actually happen?

900
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:25,067
He got caught for writing lewd literature,

901
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:28,654
so he was beaten up by other scholars,
and his appointment got cancelled.

902
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,531
It's the story of a perverted scholar.

903
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,283
That's interesting.

904
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:36,537
What's the name of that perverted scholar?

905
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,247
He has a grandiose name.

906
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:40,833
It's Si-ik, which means
the wings of the era.

907
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:43,585
His name is Kim Si-ik.

908
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,009
Kim Si-ik!

909
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:53,178
If you have any shame,

910
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:56,140
do not ever dare lift up your face again.

911
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:01,979
I had finished the novel before I died,

912
01:14:02,062 --> 01:14:04,773
so it might be published
as my posthumous work.

913
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:07,568
I hope it does get published.

914
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:39,349
I heard the wine is made
with the energy of the moon.

915
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:49,401
The tree came back
to how it used to look like.

916
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:52,863
No, it's different from that time.

917
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:55,949
Back then, it was just on display.

918
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:59,953
But this time, its leaves sprouted,
and its flowers bloomed and fell

919
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:01,538
as time passed once again.

920
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,999
The tree has gone through all that.

921
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:09,713
Do you hope to see it

922
01:15:09,796 --> 01:15:12,883
grow out leaves and bloom flowers again?

923
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:21,475
This is dead.

924
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:24,853
If I wish to have such time once again,

925
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:27,940
I should probably cross the bridge.

926
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:30,817
Probably.

927
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:36,782
Yu-na, what's wrong?

928
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:41,203
Ms. Jang.

929
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:45,582
I stole this wine from Mago's pharmacy.

930
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:53,882
I heard it's for the new owner.

931
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:58,512
Can you drink this

932
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:01,723
and stay at this hotel?

933
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:29,960
A girl who has been
coming in and out of your hotel

934
01:16:30,043 --> 01:16:32,879
stole the wine I made.

935
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:36,383
I'm sure she did this
because she was afraid

936
01:16:36,466 --> 01:16:38,051
the reception guy,
Hyeon-jung, would leave.

937
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,345
She didn't want the hotel to disappear.

938
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:44,558
Then she probably brought that to Man-wol.

939
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:50,439
If she drinks that

940
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:52,983
and regains the power of the Moon Tree,

941
01:16:53,066 --> 01:16:55,027
Hotel del Luna will remain here,

942
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,447
and you two

943
01:16:59,072 --> 01:17:01,575
can be together again.

944
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,664
If Ms. Jang makes such a choice,

945
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:10,125
will you not stop her?

946
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:15,213
You wanted to let her go peacefully.

947
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,385
If I do not stop her,

948
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:24,348
what will you do?

949
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:42,699
Mr. Koo, Yu-na came with...

950
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,744
I know. Where's Jang Man-wol?

951
01:18:12,145 --> 01:18:15,273
On the first day that I was
tied down to the Moon Tree,

952
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:20,946
the full moon was
as big and bright as that one.

953
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:32,833
The wine I drank then
fell into my hands again.

954
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:39,423
Chan-sung.

955
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:46,304
Should I drink this again?

956
01:19:00,777 --> 01:19:02,529
When I went back in time

957
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:05,699
and met you,

958
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:08,744
I wanted to take the drink you offered me

959
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:11,329
to stay with you there.

960
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:18,712
If I had done that,

961
01:19:19,629 --> 01:19:21,882
I would've become
the 85th human who worked for you,

962
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,802
and drawn a portrait of you.

963
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,821
I had this thought as I hung
the picture we took together.

964
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:51,995
That I will be your last manager,
the 99th one.

965
01:19:54,247 --> 01:19:55,499
I won't let you

966
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:59,294
spend meaningless time with the 100th one.

967
01:20:12,265 --> 01:20:13,391
So...

968
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:18,146
don't drink that.

969
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:31,451
I knew you would say that.

970
01:21:45,483 --> 01:21:47,319
Thank you, Chan-sung.

971
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,543
I love you.

972
01:22:16,389 --> 01:22:17,933
I love you.

973
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,451
