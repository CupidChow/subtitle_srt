1
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,684
Boss, what are you doing out here?

2
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,064
This place has the nicest view
of the moon.

3
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,068
Princess Song-hwa is here to see you.

4
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,290
Why are you leaving?

5
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,167
Didn't you come to the castle to see me?

6
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,503
No.

7
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,672
I came to steal.

8
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,841
A clumsy man is keeping guard,

9
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,717
so I thought it'd be
a great night to steal.

10
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,514
I thought I managed to run into someone
I missed.

11
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,767
But I guess I just ran into a thief.

12
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,064
What did you steal?

13
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,318
This belongs to someone I care for.

14
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,615
I guess you came to see me yourself
because I didn't show up

15
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,075
while you were drinking.

16
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,910
Forget it.

17
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,584
It seemed like you were busy
seducing that lady.

18
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,668
You should get going.

19
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,379
You saw that?

20
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:56,426
But did it really seem like
I was the one seducing her?

21
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,470
Clearly, she was the one seducing me.

22
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,516
You're one lucky guy.
You even get drinks from someone so noble.

23
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,603
I like this better.

24
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,022
And it's more my style.

25
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,276
I'm going to...

26
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,028
confiscate this.

27
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,908
It seems like you already stole
what you were here for.

28
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,911
So you should go back.

29
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,249
The guards are very alert
due to the rebel forces,

30
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,375
so it's very dangerous.

31
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,463
I'll pay for the bottle
the next time we meet.

32
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,095
At this rate, the tree will soon
be covered with flowers.

33
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,518
Chan-sung will put on airs again
when he sees this.

34
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,018
He's trying to scare me.

35
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,442
Are you enjoying this? I'm hot, aren't I?

36
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,504
Are you enjoying this?

37
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,232
Out of the way!

38
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,500
Hey, what was that guy doing
in the ladies' room?

39
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,126
I don't know. He must be a pervert.

40
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,920
The ladies' room?

41
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,767
I definitely got the chills.

42
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,019
What was it?

43
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,617
Is this possessed or something?

44
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,000
You're a ghost who's living
inside a human's body, aren't you?

45
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,754
Was it your doing?

46
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,725
You should be in the afterlife.

47
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,562
This is the punishment
for corrupting the order of this world.

48
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,230
You must vanish immediately.

49
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,285
It wasn't her doing.

50
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:39,167
She is just a soul
Man-wol has decided to keep alive.

51
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,295
She is not an evil ghost
that has harmed humans.

52
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:54,390
Why has a lowly ghost taken over a body
and been going around like this?

53
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,600
The owner of the body

54
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,269
died due to the foolish choice
of her parents.

55
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,898
Man-wol let her soul live
in an empty body.

56
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,775
Strictly speaking,
she has not harmed any human.

57
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,532
Man-wol has done a peculiar thing again.

58
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,117
Hurry up and leave here.

59
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,504
A human was harmed here just now.

60
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,339
It's a ghost I have been looking for.

61
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,633
It has harmed a human,
so it is an evil ghost.

62
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,010
Get rid of it as soon as you catch it.

63
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,553
Another Mago has ordered me

64
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,640
to find it and put it back
where it used to be.

65
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,683
Hotel del Luna again?

66
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,477
It was a guest there.

67
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,271
You should capture all of the ghosts
wandering around

68
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,525
and take them to the other world instantly
instead of letting them have a rest.

69
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,276
Is the path to the other world
an expressway?

70
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,903
Why do they need a rest area?

71
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,489
Why did she have to create such a thing

72
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,534
and entrust it to an evil ghost
like Jang Man-wol?

73
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,453
Strictly speaking,
she is not an evil ghost.

74
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,205
Also,

75
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,291
she will also go to the other world soon.

76
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,543
So I was told.

77
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,920
I heard the one who will guide her
to the other world

78
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,672
has been sent there.

79
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,385
They want to send

80
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,763
Man-wol to the other world that easily?

81
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,726
Her soul can't go
to the other world so easily.

82
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,729
Her ill-fated relationship
of this life will be repeated.

83
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,151
She will hurt humans again,

84
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,822
and she will be sent to the afterlife
as an evil ghost.

85
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,205
I'm glad you're leaving here
after a good rest.

86
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,003
If you found your wife who died with you,

87
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,088
you could have departed together.

88
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,341
I hope you will reunite with her
in the afterlife.

89
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,970
The platform for the afterlife is
that way. I'll take you there.

90
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,562
Honey?

91
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,606
Honey.

92
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,816
What are you doing here?

93
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,318
I'm here because I'm dead.

94
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,404
Do you know how much I looked for you
as soon as I died?

95
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,364
You're dead too?

96
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,450
I thought you were saved.

97
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,161
Who is this guy?

98
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,414
Are you having an affair
with that little brat as soon as you died?

99
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,624
Be careful what you say!

100
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,251
He died young.
He's actually three years older than you!

101
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,170
Sweetheart.

102
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,756
-"Sweetheart"?
-What?

103
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,549
Who are you?

104
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,593
Who are you?

105
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,012
Don't you dare touch him!

106
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,597
He is my first love!

107
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:41,974
Are you crazy?

108
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,476
You can't do this here, sir.

109
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,560
Yes, I'm crazy.

110
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,354
Don't you dare touch him,
and just go your way.

111
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,605
I'm going to kill you!

112
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,524
She's already dead.

113
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,776
You don't need to kill her.

114
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,862
Let me go. I will kill her!

115
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,743
Mr. Koo!

116
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,952
I'll kill you.

117
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,497
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

118
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,499
Just leave him be.

119
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:25,017
This hotel provides all the services

120
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,519
our guests desire.

121
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,562
You are already dead.

122
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,774
It is not difficult for you to die again.

123
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,652
Kill her as much as you want
until you feel better.

124
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,404
Now...

125
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,906
What do you want to kill her with?

126
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,699
Pick one.

127
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,746
Sir, slash and chop her with this.

128
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,624
Ma'am, you can't just stand still.

129
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,000
Chop him properly.

130
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,044
This way please.

131
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,132
Now, there will be a lot of blood
and flesh everywhere.

132
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,633
Everyone take a step back.

133
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,803
You are all dead.

134
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,223
But you can inflict deadly pain
on the other person's soul.

135
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,395
Please hack up the time you lived
together to your heart's content.

136
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,314
Slash it, tear it,

137
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,482
and destroy it.

138
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,695
We will do our best to help you
vent out your grudges.

139
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,531
What are you doing? When a couple fights,

140
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,908
you should try to stop them
and persuade them to live happily.

141
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,493
What do you think you're doing?

142
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,872
How can you live happily?

143
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,415
You are already dead.

144
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,794
You don't even have one second to live.

145
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,212
Just vent out your grudges.

146
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,132
Whether you hack each other,
or bathe in blood,

147
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,010
enjoy to your hearts' content. Bye.

148
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,227
-That's enough.
-Stop fighting.

149
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,522
Stop now.

150
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,567
You shouldn't fight.

151
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,194
That's good.

152
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:14,293
They were lovebirds
when they were alive. Such a pity.

153
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,421
Her first love, who she truly loved, died.

154
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,966
She married some random guy
out of despair.

155
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,136
An untimely encounter took place
in front of the door to the afterlife.

156
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,722
Remember the last time
when the guests who had debt problems

157
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,307
met here and caused a great commotion?

158
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,353
They have no need for money after death.
But they fought like cats and dogs.

159
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,688
Whether it's big or small,
they had their grudges.

160
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,732
Fighting can be a way
of resolving grudges.

161
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,404
Here is patbingsu.

162
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,741
I'll be going to resolve
the wife's grudges.

163
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,036
She wants to have the patbingsu
that she had with her first love

164
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,871
on their first date.

165
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,343
What is it?

166
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:08,305
They're soju and roasted seaweed
you enjoyed when you were alive.

167
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,267
I heard from your wife
that she always prepared them for you.

168
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,144
She's so mean.

169
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,025
It's a mean question to ask
in this situation,

170
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,362
but don't you have anyone else
in your heart?

171
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,741
I don't.
For me, my wife was my first love.

172
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,369
It feels so unfair that I'm going to die.

173
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,792
You are already dead.

174
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,589
I'm glad the guests have calmed down.

175
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,967
You were hit, weren't you?
You have to be careful of angry ghosts.

176
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,385
It didn't hurt that much.

177
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,597
That's not important.
You were hit by an evil grudge.

178
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,892
-An evil grudge?
-The grudge of that guest

179
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,477
has hit you.

180
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,856
It could have been dangerous.

181
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:03,068
But Ms. Jang was watching it,
so you'll be fine.

182
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,154
Ms. Jang?

183
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,295
She probably came because it was too loud.

184
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,590
Whether our guests fight
or have a bloody battle,

185
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,842
she hardly ever cares about it.

186
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,552
But she stepped up today.

187
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,305
I think she did that because she was
worried you'd be hit again.

188
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:32,848
Well...

189
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,644
I don't usually get beaten up by others.

190
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,772
Since you were hit by a ghost,

191
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,066
you should sprinkle some salt
to ward off evil influence.

192
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,025
Like this.

193
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,324
She told me she would protect me.

194
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,910
She really did protect me.

195
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,120
But it's a little...

196
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,248
embarrassing.

197
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,892
It's the sea.

198
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,772
The sea looks really beautiful.

199
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,068
I'm a little sad.

200
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,113
Because the sea

201
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,573
looks more beautiful now...

202
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,037
than it did earlier.

203
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,689
Jang Man-wol.

204
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,816
I came to check something.

205
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,776
If you're going to nag, do it later.

206
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,112
I'm doing my nails now,
and it's going great.

207
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,781
If these get ruined, I'll kill you.

208
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,867
Goodness.

209
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,953
I can't believe you got beaten up
by a ghost like a loser.

210
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,916
That's the color of the blue sea.

211
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,461
Yes, they're pretty, aren't they?

212
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,963
They are. Very sadly.

213
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,136
The reason you were sad on the beach...

214
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,848
was this?

215
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,391
Because there was no yacht?

216
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,477
Goodness, it got here?

217
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,730
It was sent from Norway,
so I thought it would take a while.

218
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,815
But it got here quickly. Give it to me.

219
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,151
Are you going to buy that?

220
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,529
I sold all of my cars.
I could use a yacht.

221
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,656
You don't have any place to go
on that yacht.

222
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,241
Of course, I have places to go.

223
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,743
What's that thing called?

224
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,995
Right, The Fishermen and the City.

225
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,082
They go around the country on a boat
catching fish.

226
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,376
Don't worry.
I have many places to go on a yacht.

227
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,545
What about the money? Can you afford it?

228
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,966
That's the problem.

229
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,844
That painting of the tiger.
Is no one willing to buy that?

230
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,846
Try to sell it for a quarter of the price.

231
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,431
You can't get a yacht.

232
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,599
If you want to go fishing,

233
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,559
I'll take you
to a fishing hole in Wolmi Island.

234
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,811
We can get there by car.

235
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,187
You sold all of my cars.

236
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,438
We have two left.

237
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,482
What? You said I still have three.

238
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,944
Right, three of them. I got confused.

239
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,654
Gosh, you scared me.

240
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,531
I'm so relieved.

241
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,074
That's a relief, right?

242
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,160
Then let's drive to Wolmi Island.
I'll find a great restaurant too.

243
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:41,912
I will

244
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,456
cancel this request myself.

245
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,175
Everything got ruined
in the perfect timing.

246
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,889
The color blue and Wolmi Island
don't really go well together.

247
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,185
Wolmi Island is famous for the ride,
Ghost Pang Pang.

248
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,814
I'll switch to a color
that stands out a bit more.

249
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,942
Wolmi Island

250
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:30,210
TO MS. JANG MAN-WOL, I LOVE YOU

251
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,801
He told me to sprinkle salt,
so seasoned salt should be fine, right?

252
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,647
Chan-sung, what are you doing?

253
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,399
Hey.

254
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,485
You didn't go to work yet?

255
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,404
I'm about to leave. What's that?

256
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,323
Oh, salt.

257
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,825
What are you doing with that?
Did something awful happen?

258
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,536
I heard it's great to sprinkle salt
to prevent evil influence.

259
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,539
"Evil influence"?
You aren't talking about Mi-ra, are you?

260
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,168
Did Mi-ra steal your credit card again?

261
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,670
Did she borrow money under your name?

262
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,089
Yes, Mi-ra did that to me long ago.

263
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,634
I just remembered how angry I was.

264
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,885
Hey, forget the seasoned salt.

265
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,803
There's Himalayan pink salt.
Do you want it?

266
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,972
I don't need to use
such good salt for this.

267
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,641
Seasoned salt should be enough.

268
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,352
Give it to me.
I'll cover every single inch.

269
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,229
Okay.

270
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,402
Hey, Sanchez.
You're seasoning me a bit too much.

271
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,904
You aren't making kimchi right now.

272
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,032
It's stuck. It won't come out.

273
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,533
Really?

274
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,745
Will Man-wol buy the yacht?

275
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,875
You set her up
with the yacht company in Norway?

276
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,336
I uploaded a picture of my yacht
on my social media.

277
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,005
She saw that and asked me
where I got it, so I told her.

278
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,675
She was going to get
something that expensive?

279
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,260
She's the owner of your hotel.

280
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,594
She can afford that much.

281
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,681
I was going to let her join
our yacht club too.

282
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,392
Your yacht club?
The wealthy people's social club?

283
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,811
It's going to help her
with her business too.

284
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,479
She's not dating anyone, is she?

285
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,065
Why do you ask?

286
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,733
I want to set her up
with one of our members.

287
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,819
If it's a yacht club,
you should go ride on a yacht.

288
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,279
Why are you setting people up?

289
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,906
People meet partners for their businesses

290
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,700
and their lives in such clubs.

291
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,410
That's where I met Veronica.

292
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,203
What do you think about him?

293
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,038
Don't you think he's a good match for her?

294
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,834
He's way too thin.

295
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,252
He is?

296
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,670
Jang Man-wol likes

297
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,549
someone like Kim Jun-hyun.
A type like Kim Jun-hyun.

298
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,718
People who can eat five dumplings
in one bite.

299
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,512
Really? In that case,
what about him? He's okay, right?

300
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,934
He looks way too young.

301
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,144
He's well over 30.

302
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,355
Jang Man-wol is older than you think.

303
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,899
No matter what you expect,
she's older than that.

304
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,109
He's way too young.

305
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,486
In that case, who could be the best?

306
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,656
Sanchez, she has no money to buy a yacht.

307
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,742
She doesn't qualify
to be a part of the club.

308
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,953
So don't set her up with any of them.
Don't do it.

309
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,748
In that case, she can join
our tennis club or golf club

310
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,375
-instead of the yacht club, or--
-Sanchez.

311
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,257
Since when were you into sports?

312
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,343
You're such a sportsman.

313
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,390
But she isn't interested in sports.
Leave her alone.

314
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,106
Where's the Himalayan pink salt?

315
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,357
Over there.

316
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,070
He must like her.

317
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,865
Goodness, he made a mess here.

318
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:50,202
Gosh, this is sweet. Hey, this is sugar.

319
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,287
Did you sprinkle sugar on yourself?

320
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,831
Man, you'll get cockroaches in here.

321
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,733
This is the punishment
for corrupting the order of this world.

322
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,318
You must vanish immediately.

323
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,252
She has grown really weak.

324
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,587
I'm going to take over her body.

325
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,840
Hey. Hey!

326
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,309
No! Stop!

327
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,644
No!

328
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,399
Hey.

329
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,442
Come here.

330
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,487
Is she okay?

331
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,657
-Did she go insane?
-Did she go crazy?

332
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,700
What are we going to do?

333
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,076
Should we call the teacher?

334
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,619
Hey, we should call 911.

335
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,580
Hey, report this.

336
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,039
Should we talk to her?

337
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,083
Maybe she really sees ghosts.

338
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,836
-Can you please step aside?
-Oh, no.

339
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,723
Stop it.

340
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,350
No. No way.

341
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,478
Yu-na, it's me.

342
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,361
You can come out now.

343
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,514
It's okay.

344
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,433
Let's go.

345
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,236
Is there a place
where she can lie down and rest?

346
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,279
The infirmary is
at the end of the hallway.

347
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,447
Thanks.

348
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,022
Something must've happened to her.

349
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:19,202
It was the fourth Mago
that hurt my intern, wasn't it?

350
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,912
The number four in the black dress.

351
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,956
Don't dare to number the deities.

352
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,418
Though they look different,
they're one with greater plans.

353
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,546
Don't you think it's lame to say
that they have greater plans

354
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:33,216
when they don't even appear
in the way humans want them to?

355
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,593
Mago wanted

356
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,138
the vengeful ghost that stayed
at the hotel as a guest.

357
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,765
If Mago finds it, will she get rid of it?

358
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,560
Another Mago wants
to bring it back to the hotel.

359
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:48,023
The greater plans of the deities are
always so darn confusing.

360
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:52,610
They can be generous and cruel.
That's how the deities are.

361
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,657
The first one wants me
to go to the afterlife,

362
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:01,119
and the fourth one wants to destroy me
once I become an evil ghost.

363
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,872
You're right, they're all deities.

364
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,750
But who do you think is stronger?

365
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,169
The first one, or the fourth one?

366
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,295
Don't you dare...

367
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,839
to number the deities.

368
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,051
You're just avoiding to answer that.

369
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:19,387
Whoever is stronger,
they only have one goal.

370
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,725
Anyway, I will have to leave here.

371
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,819
-What's that?
-This is my answer.

372
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,625
Yu-na felt something odd
from the cellphone.

373
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,336
I think the guest of Room 13
harmed a human

374
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,756
by spreading a video through the network.

375
00:27:57,717 --> 00:28:00,887
We'll only know
when we open the video link.

376
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,430
But to make the ghost appear,

377
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,933
we'll need to use a human as bait.

378
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,768
Who should open the link?

379
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,896
No one comes to my mind.

380
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,650
There's only one human at this hotel
who can be the bait.

381
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,569
Get Chan-sung.

382
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,120
No.

383
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,582
Based on what's being said
in the group chat,

384
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,709
I'm sure it's a sex tape
filmed without consent.

385
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,586
Filming such a thing
is a criminal offense,

386
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,171
so is watching it.

387
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,006
I'll never watch anything like this, ever.

388
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,311
What a great man.
What a smart man you are.

389
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:56,025
But you have to be brave.
We have to find a ghost.

390
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,111
With this?

391
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,780
It's the guest that stayed in Room 13.

392
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,450
We have to open it to find the ghost.

393
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,577
You're saying
that the guest became vengeful

394
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,246
because of some accident
involving this video?

395
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:12,709
The video might be unpleasant,
or it might be terrifying.

396
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,461
Are you up for it?

397
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,273
IT'S THE FAMOUS VIDEO? I DIDN'T WATCH IT.

398
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,409
I see an empty room.

399
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,578
There's no one.

400
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,377
Yu-na said that she felt something
when the phone rang.

401
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,046
This is where the ghost was.

402
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,302
Here.

403
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:12,477
I can still feel the grudge of her here.

404
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,604
She created this room.

405
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,524
So you're saying this wasn't
an illegally filmed video?

406
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:18,942
No,

407
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:23,238
this is just a room that's built
with the grudge of a ghost.

408
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,074
There must be a few more like this.

409
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,869
Yu-na said that she felt something eerie
even before the man played the video.

410
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,413
She sent the video only to her targets.

411
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,375
Then there must be a next one.

412
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,752
Where could she be right now?

413
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,128
She's probably sent a video

414
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,339
of a room that looks just like this
to the next target,

415
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:45,009
ready to kill him when he plays the video.

416
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,110
Get off the phone when you're with her.

417
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,071
It's for work. I have to send
something to a client.

418
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,285
Honey.

419
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,204
Honey!

420
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,756
It has been five years
since my sister died,

421
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,134
but the video is still found online.

422
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,846
You must be quite familiar
with cases like this.

423
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,515
There's no way we can get
the videos off the Internet.

424
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,559
That's true.

425
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,187
Were those who distributed
the video punished?

426
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,522
Punished?

427
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,443
All they had to do was pay
some fines when Ga-yeong died.

428
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,035
Is this man related to the incident?

429
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,204
He and Ga-yeong went to the same college.

430
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,874
The video was shared
in the group chat for male students.

431
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,376
That's where the video was leaked.

432
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,554
Her classmates laughed at her

433
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,224
watching the video together.

434
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:03,022
-Look at that.
-Amazing.

435
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,443
Do you remember who watched the video?

436
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,695
How can I forget?

437
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,405
I still remember all their names.

438
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,491
Had just one of them told us
about the video,

439
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,368
we would've prevented it from spreading.

440
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,953
Then maybe my sister...

441
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,207
wouldn't have died.

442
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,169
My sister locked herself in her room
like a lunatic

443
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,423
and looked all over online to see
if there were more videos of herself.

444
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,175
She was slowly dying.

445
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,635
THE QUEEN OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING

446
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,151
Now that she's dead,

447
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,778
she must be in peace
free from pain. Right?

448
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,618
I truly...

449
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,079
hope so as well.

450
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,980
The man who filmed the video and sold it

451
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,982
was also a member of the group chat.

452
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,156
What's funny is

453
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,575
that the man now owns
a video-sharing platform,

454
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,702
getting rich and having a nice life.

455
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:54,675
He really is living a nice life.
So nice that I want to kill him.

456
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,637
Don't get so mad. It'll drain your energy.

457
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,806
This is delicious. Try it.

458
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,060
No, thanks.

459
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,688
The last one is always the best one.

460
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:12,068
See? The vengeful ghost left
the best one for the last too.

461
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,237
That's why I'm sure she'll come for him.

462
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,405
All we need to do is just to take
his phone to our hotel

463
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,241
before the video is sent to it.

464
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,451
Really?

465
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,287
Do you think she will really leave
the last target here and follow us?

466
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,835
I can't believe somebody like him is
so well off.

467
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,170
The deities are so unfair.

468
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,339
That's why I don't like them.

469
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:40,054
As I said, the last one is
always the best one.

470
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,524
You're Mr. Koo Chan-sung,
the manager of Hotel del Luna?

471
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,568
Del Luna.

472
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,196
It must be new.

473
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,907
No, it's been around for a very long time.

474
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,661
Are you here to post
an advertisement on our website?

475
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,745
No.

476
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,665
We're here on behalf of our guest.

477
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,208
She desperately wishes

478
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,044
to meet you.

479
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,212
Me?

480
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,466
Who is she? Why does she want to meet me?

481
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,010
She's someone

482
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,430
who holds a lot of grudges against you.

483
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,973
Against me?

484
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,978
I've never done anything for anyone
to feel that way against me.

485
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:34,901
What are you doing?

486
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,446
You have a really nice yacht.

487
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,948
I'm also planning to buy one like yours.

488
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,284
She's the hotel owner.

489
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:49,248
My gosh, you've traveled
to so many incredible places.

490
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,626
I should go to these places before I die.

491
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,129
That's enough.

492
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,549
It's rude to take photos
of someone's private space

493
00:36:58,758 --> 00:36:59,842
without their permission.

494
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,928
Really?

495
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,726
What was that?

496
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,313
You have a wedgie.

497
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,106
Hey.

498
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,108
How much do I get paid if I upload

499
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,570
an illicit photo like this
on your website?

500
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,448
One hundred won? Two hundred?

501
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:26,160
I wonder how many of these photos
need to get uploaded

502
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,580
for you to be able to buy a yacht
and travel to all those places?

503
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,793
-About a million?
-Are you digging into something?

504
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,671
Are you guys reporters? Or cops?

505
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,674
The hotel was just a lie, wasn't it?

506
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,386
No wonder I had never heard of it.

507
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,721
I guess we should invite you over one day

508
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,682
in order to show you that it wasn't a lie.

509
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,352
Get out of here right now

510
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,437
before I call the guards.

511
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,821
Whenever

512
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,198
you see our hotel,

513
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,994
please feel free to visit.

514
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,580
Let's go.

515
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,920
"Always do your best.

516
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,548
The deities will take care of the rest."

517
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,095
Seriously? You believe this kind of stuff?

518
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,683
I'm a very religious man.

519
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:37,106
If the deities gave you this kind
of life even after what you did,

520
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,736
it just shows how unreasonable
the deities are.

521
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,048
It's his cell phone.

522
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,386
Good job, Chan-sung.

523
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,889
We need to get to the hotel
before the video is sent to the phone.

524
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,057
We should hurry.

525
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,815
Chan-sung did his best
regardless of how weak he is.

526
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,319
I wonder if the deities would do the same.

527
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,751
It's been quite long.
Why isn't the video link here yet?

528
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,795
Is the cell phone out of battery?

529
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,922
The Wi-Fi here works just fine.

530
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,509
The others definitely got the video
through their cell phones.

531
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,887
Cell phones are...

532
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,265
not the only routes to send the video.

533
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,523
Did you check the CCTV footages?

534
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,778
Those people who came in the afternoon
definitely stole my cell phone.

535
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,490
The CCTV footage during that time
all got deleted for some reason.

536
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:11,867
Are you kidding me?

537
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,704
We have so many CCTVs.

538
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,832
You better find it no matter what.

539
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,208
Yes, sir.

540
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,069
I guess she can send the video
through other routes.

541
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:48,988
I should go back there.

542
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,449
Chan-sung, your job is done here.

543
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,952
The rest will be taken care of.

544
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,706
What do you mean? By whom?

545
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,792
Mago will show up there.

546
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,506
I'm curious to know
what form she'll appear in.

547
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,884
I wonder if she'll be merciful

548
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,052
or cruel.

549
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,103
CEO, JEONG EUN-SEOK

550
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,493
HERE'S THE VIDEO YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR

551
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,837
What's this?

552
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,215
It's not the CCTV footage of my office.

553
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,675
What is this?

554
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,691
My gosh, what is this?

555
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,497
What?

556
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,045
Was it hacked?

557
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,966
The security system must be a mess.

558
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,382
Look at me.

559
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,726
Who are you?

560
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,480
I'll kill you.

561
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,939
You're an evil ghost
that has harmed humans.

562
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,487
You shall vanish here and now.

563
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,321
Now that she's dead,

564
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,741
she must be in peace
free from pain. Right?

565
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:06,717
Why won't the deities appear in the way
humans want them to?

566
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,935
This is a glass of a cocktail
to console the soul who has gone.

567
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,147
I think Mr. Koo is heartbroken.

568
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,483
He had his chin up high
after sending off a few customers,

569
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,152
but this incident gave him a burn.

570
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,948
Gosh, that's hot!

571
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:35,954
It's hot.

572
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,540
He's hurt because he was sincere.

573
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,792
Mr. Koo is a good man.

574
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,503
It's so hard to hate him.

575
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:59,186
Nothing would have changed
even if you had arrived there earlier.

576
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,022
It's what the deities decided.

577
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,569
Could the same happen

578
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,656
to all of you here too?

579
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,033
Do you mean vanishing?

580
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,494
Yes.

581
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,830
We're all souls after all.

582
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,502
If we stay behind in this world
instead of going to the afterlife,

583
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,129
there's always a chance
the same could happen to us.

584
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,424
If it's dangerous,

585
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,010
why are you still here?

586
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,514
Did you have a sad and painful death
just like her?

587
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,892
Is it the same for all of you?

588
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:42,062
Mr. Kim and Ms. Choe too?

589
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,740
But

590
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:57,244
we won't run out there and make trouble.

591
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,746
Don't worry.

592
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:25,272
YOU'RE INVITED TO HOTEL DEL LUNA

593
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:33,071
PRESIDENT JANG MAN-WOL

594
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,793
Go mail this out.

595
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,423
What is this?

596
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:52,966
An invitation.

597
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,927
We promised to invite him, remember?

598
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,263
Are you going to invite him?

599
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,348
But our guest is already gone.

600
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:03,143
We failed to serve
one of our guests properly.

601
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:07,898
That's why we should do
what she wanted to do in her stead.

602
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,901
We'll do the best we can.

603
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,259
TO MR. JEONG EUN-SEOK

604
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,804
"Hotel del Luna"?

605
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:43,141
Whenever you see our hotel,

606
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,978
please feel free to visit.

607
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:50,857
This is eerie.

608
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:55,005
YOUR DESTINATION HAS CHANGED

609
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:57,966
Turn left.

610
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,557
Turn right.

611
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,688
Go straight.

612
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:15,525
Turn left.

613
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,277
Turn right.

614
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,697
Make a U-turn.

615
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,952
229-7, MYEONG-DONG 8-GIL

616
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,541
Straight.

617
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,085
Is it really this way?

618
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,922
I said, go straight. Straight.

619
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:38,965
Stop!

620
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:49,684
What is this?

621
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,237
What is this place?

622
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,783
"Hotel del Luna"?

623
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,661
Did I really come here?

624
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,893
Welcome, sir.

625
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,937
You received an invitation, didn't you?

626
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:36,815
Ms. Jang is waiting for you.

627
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,441
This way.

628
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:49,995
What?

629
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,496
It's you.

630
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:58,253
Welcome. We prepared
a room for you, Mr. Jeong.

631
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,756
So this hotel really exists.

632
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:03,925
How did you do this?

633
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,303
Did you hack into my car?

634
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,727
You came here with our owner's invitation.

635
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,190
Please follow me.

636
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,214
This is the room.
Like I told you last time,

637
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,925
the guest who looked for you
used to stay in this room.

638
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,935
You said no one has a grudge against you.
Did someone come to your mind?

639
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,899
I'll go in and find out
why you're doing this to me.

640
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,170
This is...

641
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,804
Do you know where this is?

642
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,682
It's my old room.

643
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:38,186
Do you also remember
the thing you did in this room?

644
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:31,197
Why is this room here now?

645
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,158
What is this place?

646
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:37,036
A hotel right between this world
and the other world.

647
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,581
A hotel for souls.

648
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,834
Stop joking around.

649
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,086
There's no such thing.

650
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,241
Was that a dream?

651
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,409
It wasn't.

652
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:19,913
Who are you?

653
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,958
I invited you to the hotel.

654
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,544
So that wasn't a dream?

655
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,214
It's not a place you can come in a dream.

656
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,090
You can come only when you're dead.

657
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,092
Wait, I'm dead?

658
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:36,137
No, you aren't dead.

659
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,973
I wanted to ask a question,

660
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,059
so I had to bring your soul here.

661
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:43,811
You're standing at the boundary
between life and death right now.

662
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,105
What?

663
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:11,506
Why are you in such a hurry?

664
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,550
I told you that I had a question.

665
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,510
What do you want to know?

666
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,597
You've been to that room.
Do you remember now?

667
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,728
Our guest who made a visit to you.

668
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,064
Do you remember

669
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,483
who that woman is?

670
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,153
That woman...

671
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,155
I will kill you.

672
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,038
Who is that woman?

673
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,331
You killed her.

674
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,084
-I never killed anyone.
-You did.

675
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,420
You stripped her naked
and kicked her outside,

676
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:52,505
so she was stabbed to death
by everyone's eyes.

677
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,216
You have to remember.

678
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,562
I have no idea. I don't know who she is.

679
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,606
It's what you did. Why don't you know?

680
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,898
Try harder!

681
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,738
Yes, it's something I did.

682
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:20,283
But I have no idea who she is exactly.
There are so many!

683
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,402
It was a dream.

684
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,279
It was.

685
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:05,453
Gosh, I thought I really died.

686
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:12,377
He didn't tell you a good answer.
Why did you send him back?

687
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,965
That's not what I was curious about.

688
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:23,805
I tried my best to show
that he's the worst.

689
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,475
Now, what will the deities do?

690
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,860
I remember now. Yun Ga-yeong.

691
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,703
Right. I heard she committed suicide.

692
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,414
I remember that now.

693
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:53,227
The victim of the train accident
at Gyeongbu Line this morning

694
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:57,064
was identified as CEO Jeong Eun-seok
of World Disk, a file-sharing platform.

695
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,650
Jeong was under investigation
by the police

696
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,945
for distributing illegal pornography
and embezzling company funds.

697
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:06,073
The circumstances
of the accident are still unknown.

698
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,075
The police have been investigating

699
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,037
the gang members
for a connection with the porn videos,

700
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,955
but the investigation has faced a dead end

701
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,791
since they couldn't find
any feasible connection.

702
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,543
The navigator and event data recorder
in Jeong's car...

703
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,963
I guess the deities really exist.

704
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,507
The investigation will not be easy.

705
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:25,510
No other human lives were lost
in this accident.

706
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:28,304
Those who got hurt on the train

707
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:32,266
at the time of the accident are
being treated at a nearby hospital.

708
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,689
I'm feeling better now.

709
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,775
I'm staying here
because I don't want to go to school.

710
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:44,695
Tell your friends that it was
because of some bug and go back to school.

711
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:49,325
If you like school that much,
you should come to my school.

712
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:53,246
I mean, you can just show yourself
to people like you did the other day.

713
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,206
I can't do that for long.

714
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:57,166
Especially during the day.

715
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:00,670
Then how about we get out of here now?

716
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,338
I'll buy you something delicious.

717
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:04,966
Where's my brother?

718
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,677
Where's my brother?

719
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,180
Your brother is right here.

720
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,345
That old man is
the founder of this hospital.

721
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,223
He's acquainted with Yu-na's dad,
so I even introduced myself.

722
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:56,976
Do you know what's uncanny?

723
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,228
He has the same name as you.

724
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:00,938
His name is Ji Hyeon-jung.

725
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,027
Hyeon-jung.

726
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:10,740
What is it? Do your legs hurt?

727
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,745
Do you want a piggyback ride? Come here.

728
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,879
How much do you like me?

729
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:26,339
This much.

730
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,090
That's so little.

731
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,051
This much.

732
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:33,429
That much? As many as your loose teeth?

733
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:45,358
Ji Hyeon-jung.

734
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:53,491
I'm sorry. I wasn't calling you.

735
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,493
I'm sorry.

736
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:57,578
Ji Hyeon...

737
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:00,498
Jung. What is this?

738
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:05,920
He always disappears
without saying a thing.

739
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:15,972
Hyeon-jung's little sister is
quite old now.

740
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:19,725
I heard that she lost her vision
and that her health deteriorated.

741
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:23,980
I guess we're going to
see Hyeon-jung off pretty soon.

742
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:35,574
Will they all get on the bus
to the afterlife today?

743
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:38,953
You go first. We'll go later.

744
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:42,164
I'll leave first. You can come later.

745
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:46,085
I got to live with my first love
all my life.

746
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:49,338
So you should make your first love
come true here too.

747
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,549
You can leave then without any regrets.

748
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,511
Thank you for everything. Take care.

749
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,770
The platform is this way.

750
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:26,959
You look upset.

751
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,796
My sister is upset too,

752
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,799
saying it was impudent
of you two to test us.

753
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:37,053
We would've welcomed you

754
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:39,180
if you came looking like that
in front of our guest.

755
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:41,807
If we start showing up
in the way they want,

756
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,852
they'll stop putting
in any efforts themselves.

757
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:51,025
You must be doing a good job.

758
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,569
I think the flower will bloom.

759
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,993
You should look after it well

760
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,579
so you can send her off.

761
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,625
Isn't it beautiful?

762
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:13,881
The sea looks really beautiful.

763
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:16,717
Yes, indeed.

764
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:21,764
It makes me sad.

765
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:26,018
It's beautiful.

766
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:28,813
It makes me sad.

767
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:43,369
The funds that Jeong Eun-seok concealed
were found.

768
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:45,996
It was discovered at a sunflower field

769
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,540
near Jeong's hometown.

770
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,416
About 4 billion won in 50,000-won bills...

771
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,711
He asked us if we were
reporters or police officers

772
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:56,006
because he was doing
something illegal like that.

773
01:08:56,841 --> 01:09:00,594
By the way, the owner of that field
must be someone stupid like you.

774
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,596
If he finds four billion won in cash,

775
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,599
he should keep it. Why did he report it?

776
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,852
My goodness.

777
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,481
This must be why he had a picture
of a sunflower field in his office.

778
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:13,774
What?

779
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:17,236
Don't you remember?
You took a picture of it.

780
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,906
That's why he acted so sensitive
when you took those pictures.

781
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,116
Pictures?

782
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,245
That's enough.

783
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,051
No way.

784
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,804
A field of money was right before my eyes,

785
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:45,806
and I had no idea.

786
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:49,226
That's what I should've asked him.

787
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,854
My sunflower field.

788
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,398
POLICE TO INVESTIGATE
CONNECTION TO JEONG'S DEATH

789
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,483
My four billion won!

790
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:58,235
How is that your money?

791
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,613
That's a ridiculous claim of ownership.

792
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,200
My money.

793
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:12,333
Chan-sung went out to sail on my yacht
with his boss.

794
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:14,251
He said he should calm his angry boss.

795
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:18,214
Chan-sung is sailing on a yacht
with his boss?

796
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:21,342
Is he entertaining his boss?

797
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:24,094
I wouldn't call it entertaining.
It's more like a date.

798
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,853
I lost four billion won
right in front of my eyes.

799
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:35,940
I'm in no mood to ride
someone else's yacht.

800
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:39,401
Like I said, that money isn't yours.

801
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:42,446
How can you say that
just because you have a picture of it?

802
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:44,114
Forget it.

803
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,785
Can't you just console me

804
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,828
even if you don't mean it?

805
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,206
"Would you like me to buy you a yacht?"

806
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:53,832
You could say something like this.

807
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,376
Why are you getting on my nerves?

808
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,295
I'll buy you a yacht then.

809
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,224
Here. Now that you have a picture,
it's yours.

810
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:16,897
You are a thief
if you want something that's not yours.

811
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:19,149
I am a thief.

812
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,609
Didn't you see in your dream?

813
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,861
Your people were all thieves?

814
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:26,991
The man who married you
looked like he had a higher status.

815
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,576
Married? Me?

816
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:37,334
I saw you wearing a red bridal dress.

817
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:43,132
Since it looked fancy,
I assumed you married someone

818
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:44,550
with some nobleman.

819
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,261
I was...

820
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:50,055
wearing someone else's dress.

821
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:05,404
Chan-sung.

822
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:09,408
I was a bad person.

823
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:11,869
I'm still bad now,

824
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:14,371
but I was a lot worse before.

825
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,583
Since you can see my past,

826
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:20,711
you'll gradually find out

827
01:12:21,962 --> 01:12:23,547
how much of a horrible person I was.

828
01:12:38,645 --> 01:12:39,688
What is it?

829
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:42,399
Where?

830
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:37,204
Chan-sung.

831
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:38,997
Hey, Mi-ra.

832
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:09,087
Are there more secrets
in this hotel I'm not aware of?

833
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:12,841
Ms. Jang can never leave this hotel.

834
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:14,176
Let's do nice things together.

835
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:17,137
It's better to see
and eat good things together.

836
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:19,264
What I have is hell.

837
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:22,643
It's not that wonderful
to be in hell together.

838
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:24,019
Just let her pass by.

839
01:15:24,102 --> 01:15:26,772
How could I just let her pass by?

840
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:27,773
Don't do it.

841
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,441
Run away from me, Chan-sung.

842
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:32,277
I don't care if this is
your prison or your fence.

843
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:35,280
I will stay here with you.

844
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:37,991
