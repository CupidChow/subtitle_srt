1
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,940
You know, Hongwei,

2
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,560
big brother got sentenced

3
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,479
to 15 years.

4
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,380
That's not bad.

5
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:39,880
Of course,

6
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,840
with some sentence reductions, he'll be out in about 10 years.

7
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,240
How are you doing abroad?

8
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,120
It's a food desert here.

9
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,360
I'm trying hard to change

10
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,560
their eating habits.

11
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,400
Impressive.

12
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,800
Alright, I have to go now.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,729
I'm about to teach them a class.

14
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,200
My uncle went abroad.

15
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,960
He had just settled down

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,280
when Hong Kong returned home.

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,760
After successfully joining the WTO,

18
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,800
pagers quickly

19
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,200
gave way to flip phones with color screens.

20
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,520
The night we won the Olympic bid,

21
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,600
drums were beating loudly

22
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,920
and firecrackers were going off everywhere.

23
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,440
With all this excitement,

24
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,800
we began chasing our own dreams.

25
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,079
No one was idle.

26
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,600
Seasons came and went,

27
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,920
time flowed on.

28
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,320
And just like that,

29
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,720
we grew up day by day.

30
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,480
And we still

31
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,640
continued on our chosen paths,

32
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,020
moving forward with determination.

33
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,600
As days went by,

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,640
that longing in our hearts

35
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,240
grew deeper and deeper.

36
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,840
Without realizing it,

37
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,240
it filled every moment

38
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,240
of our lives.

39
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,120
These persevering people are like stars.

40
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,180
Each one striving,

41
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,660
silently shining,

42
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,020
illuminating each other.

43
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,760
I'm here!

44
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,000
Nobody home?

45
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,360
Grandpa!

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,400
Mengmeng, you're back!

47
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,040
I'm back.

48
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,400
Come here.

49
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,480
Let Grandpa have a look at you.

50
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,360
I brought you some delicious food.

51
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,120
Look.

52
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,920
This is Beijing roast duck.

53
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,620
Peach cookies.

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,640
Good.

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,760
You've lost weight.

56
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,520
Really?

57
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,000
I've been on a diet lately.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,920
It's working well.

59
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,520
Is that so?

60
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,400
As a dancer,

61
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,800
you can't be overweight.

62
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,240
Sit down.

63
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,760
Okay.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,400
Now that you're back,

65
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,160
are you staying at your grandfather's

66
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,440
or at my place?

67
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,520
I'll stay at your place.

68
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,450
Let my brother have the space here.

69
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,730
Where is my brother? Isn't he home?

70
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,680
He said he's doing an internship

71
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,080
and hasn't been home for several days.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,640
What does he plan to do after graduation?

73
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,520
He says

74
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,660
he wants to work in internet technology.

75
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,200
Internet is good.

76
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,920
But with his brain,

77
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,850
can he really figure it out?

78
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,080
Let's not talk about him anymore.

79
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,320
You've been admitted to the dance academy

80
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,400
for college.

81
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,960
I must reward you

82
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,320
with something special.

83
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,450
What kind of reward?

84
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,040
A trip to Europe.

85
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,480
I'll take you around.

86
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,000
Are you serious?

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,840
Of course I am.

88
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
When are we going?

89
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,900
You need to hurry up

90
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,360
and get your visa.

91
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,880
Once it's done, we'll go.

92
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,720
Okay.

93
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
What about my brother?

94
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,040
I talked to him.

95
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
He said

96
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,720
he's working on some e-commerce website

97
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,680
and doesn't have time to join us.

98
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,480
That's great!

99
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,340
I didn't want to bring him anyway.

100
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,000
We'll go to Russia first,

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,120
then I'll take you sightseeing,

102
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,640
and then we'll watch some football in Europe.

103
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,100
This is what I'm thinking.

104
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,560
First, let's go see your father

105
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,760
and check what he's earning.

106
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,890
How does that sound?

107
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,880
So that's how it is.

108
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,040
I know

109
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,100
you're still angry with your father.

110
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,840
He used to be reckless.

111
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,760
But I have to say,

112
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,960
for the past four years,

113
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,960
he's changed.

114
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,960
Look,

115
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,720
he sends your living expenses

116
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,120
and tuition on time every month.

117
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,720
On your birthday

118
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,600
and holidays, he sends extra money.

119
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,240
You've only lived with him

120
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,680
for a dozen years.

121
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,320
I've been with him

122
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,800
for over forty years.

123
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,120
I can tell you,

124
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,360
he has never been

125
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,240
as reliable as he has been

126
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,440
these past four years.

127
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,280
Since I was old enough to remember,

128
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,810
he's always been reckless.

129
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,160
I don't believe he's changed.

130
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,800
You rarely talk to your father.

131
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,920
I speak with him regularly.

132
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,080
In the past,

133
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,600
he did some unreliable things.

134
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,880
But his intentions

135
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,080
were always good,

136
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,800
trying to make our family better.

137
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,680
To be honest,

138
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,160
I think

139
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,080
it wasn't until your mother passed away

140
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,040
that he truly became an adult.

141
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,000
Before that, you could say

142
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,800
he was still like a child.

143
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,480
Listen, Mengmeng.

144
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,080
If he becomes unreliable again,

145
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,800
you can keep ignoring him.

146
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,400
Dad,

147
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,360
I'm working.

148
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,520
I know.

149
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,240
I need to tell you something.

150
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,160
Since Mengmeng got into college,

151
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,680
I'm planning to give her a nice reward.

152
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,120
I want to take her

153
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,120
to Europe for a trip

154
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,220
to look around.

155
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,440
And visit you while we're there.

156
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,640
What's wrong?

157
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,020
Not happy to see us?

158
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,480
I'm getting old.

159
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,919
If I don't travel now,

160
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
I won't be able to in a few years.

161
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,000
It's not that.

162
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,640
I'm just really busy with work here.

163
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,800
It's hard for me to take time off.

164
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,680
No need.

165
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,810
I don't mean you.

166
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,720
Don't worry about it.

167
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,360
Mengmeng and I have already planned everything.

168
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,690
Where to go, what to eat -

169
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,240
we've done our research.

170
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,520
Well, I...

171
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,760
Alright, alright.

172
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,280
I won't disturb your work anymore.

173
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,520
In about 10 days,

174
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,040
once Mengmeng gets her visa,

175
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,970
we'll come over.

176
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,280
No, no, that's not it.

177
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,260
What are you thinking?

178
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,400
What about Erpang? Isn't he coming?

179
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,930
He's busy with his startup.

180
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,720
No time.

181
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,460
Okay, get back to work.

182
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,600
(Korean) Wow.

183
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,800
(Korean) Who is this?

184
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,200
(Korean) Wow.

185
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,160
(Korean) Choi,

186
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,760
(Korean) are you going to an audition?

187
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,080
(Korean) Do you have a girlfriend?

188
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,920
(Korean) Where is the audition?

189
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,440
Mengmeng looks

190
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,960
thinner than in her photos.

191
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm just like this,

192
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,400
but my teacher still thinks I'm too fat.

193
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,640
If I gain another 2 pounds, forget about early admission.

194
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,000
I won't even pass the college specialty exam.

195
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,840
You're in college now.

196
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,640
Relax a bit.

197
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,160
I'll take you out for a big meal later.

198
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,540
You can indulge yourself,

199
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,170
but I don't want to be as undisciplined as you.

200
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,000
Where are we going?

201
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,880
To a hotel.

202
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,650
The best hotel around here.

203
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,960
After we drop off our luggage,

204
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,760
I'll take you for Korean barbecue.

205
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,560
Why aren't we going to your home?

206
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,680
How is Xiaoxue doing these days?

207
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,760
She's doing well. Her studies are good too.

208
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,040
She's taking college entrance exams this year.

209
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,440
She'll definitely pass.

210
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,360
But she hopes

211
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,920
to get into the University of Political Science and Law.

212
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,360
I asked why we're not going to your home.

213
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,880
Why are you changing the subject?

214
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,540
No, no. I'm not interrupting.

215
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,080
The three of us

216
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,560
each need a separate room.

217
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,290
Three rooms would be too much trouble to clean up.

218
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,860
You visit once in a few years and still complain about trouble?

219
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,400
The main thing is this hotel

220
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,320
is also close to tourist attractions.

221
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,880
The key is I've already paid for it.

222
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,760
You must have

223
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,640
not had Chinese food for a long time.

224
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,960
I was hoping to cook some dishes for you.

225
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,760
Next time. Next time.

226
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,640
Dad, from now on when you're indoors

227
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,560
you can't wear short sleeves.

228
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,960
The air conditioning is too strong here.

229
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,440
Yes.

230
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,480
This beef

231
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,160
costs more than twice as much as other beef.

232
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,960
This beef looks good,

233
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,680
but it shouldn't be this expensive.

234
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,920
Russians love meat,

235
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,640
but this area is a Korean community.

236
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,770
They love barbecue.

237
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,200
To be honest,

238
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
barbecue

239
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,400
doesn't require much skill.

240
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,080
As long as you choose good ingredients,

241
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,120
anyone can do it.

242
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,760
I ordered some soup.

243
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,040
Please try it. It should taste good.

244
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,600
Right?

245
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,920
Thank you.

246
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,320
Will they understand if I say thank you?

247
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,680
They'll get the meaning somehow.

248
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,880
Your face says it all.

249
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:13,880
Enjoy your meal.

250
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,240
Good.

251
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,840
Thank you, Grandpa.

252
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,160
Please try it.

253
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,560
Try it.

254
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,620
Everyone try some.

255
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,720
This soup is quite good.

256
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,400
Isn't it?

257
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,800
This soup is indeed good.

258
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,600
This at least

259
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,080
requires some skill.

260
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Old Park at our Dingqing Restaurant

261
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,120
can also make this kind of soup,

262
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,380
and he makes it better.

263
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,680
However,

264
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,880
it doesn't really match

265
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,280
with Dingqing's menu,

266
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,440
so we never added it.

267
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,560
What have you been doing here all these years?

268
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,400
You're always so vague when I ask.

269
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes.

270
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,720
We'd also like to know

271
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,250
about your work situation.

272
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,760
It's hard to explain briefly.

273
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,480
I'm vague because

274
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,320
I'm afraid that if I explain,

275
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
you won't understand anyway.

276
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,380
There's nothing I can't understand.

277
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,440
Do you know what MK is?

278
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,280
Of course I do.

279
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,920
It's the second largest conglomerate here.

280
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,960
Not bad.

281
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,480
You've done your homework.

282
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,000
No,

283
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,960
I first

284
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,400
worked at MK,

285
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,160
at MK Construction.

286
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,680
Did you study architecture?

287
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,920
Did I need to?

288
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
Well, I did have to learn.

289
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,560
But I'm a quick learner.

290
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,080
Just read some books.

291
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,920
And then?

292
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,850
I went to Xianda Heavy Industries.

293
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,320
That matches your field of study.

294
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,800
Yes.

295
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,920
Then why didn't you stay there?

296
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,120
Why all this jumping around?

297
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Other places paid more.

298
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,880
Later I went to Luo Electronics.

299
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,400
I was their supplier.

300
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,850
Basically all Fortune 500 companies.

301
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,400
What are you doing now?

302
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,060
Samchung. I work at Samchung.

303
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,280
No wonder you

304
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,640
gave me a Samchung computer before.

305
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,840
I'm not with Samchung Electronics.

306
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,100
I'm with Samchung's original business.

307
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,250
Original business?

308
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,080
I remember when you were working on

309
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,240
those pinhole glasses,

310
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,360
you told me

311
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
that Samchung's original business

312
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,760
was selling salted fish.

313
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,640
Your memory is so good.

314
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,320
That's right.

315
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,120
So are you dealing with salted fish?

316
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,920
Take a guess.

317
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,960
Let me ask you something.

318
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,680
How much do you make per month?

319
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,320
I read in the newspaper

320
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,080
that an average white-collar worker there

321
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,920
earns a monthly income

322
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,320
of over 10,000 yuan.

323
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,000
Senior white-collar workers

324
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,500
make 20,000 to 30,000.

325
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,480
You send money home every month

326
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,890
always over 10,000.

327
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,280
So how much do you actually make?

328
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,800
Dad, overseas

329
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,880
they don't ask about this.

330
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,920
Asking someone how much they earn

331
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
is very impolite.

332
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,480
Are you a foreigner?

333
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,760
You're Chinese,

334
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,000
my son,

335
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,400
and Mengmeng's father.

336
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,760
Well, I...

337
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,200
Because I have so many jobs

338
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,080
of different types,

339
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,720
sometimes I work overtime,

340
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,320
sometimes I don't,

341
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,520
it's hard to calculate.

342
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,920
But roughly per month,

343
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,760
I make about

344
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
30,000 to 40,000.

345
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
I send 10,000 home

346
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,080
and keep the rest

347
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,280
because the cost of living here is high.

348
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,360
Is overtime pay for white-collar workers that high?

349
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,400
Yes, yes.

350
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,240
By the way.

351
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,360
Where

352
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,120
are you living now?

353
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,720
Mengmeng and I want to visit.

354
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,120
Far. It's too far.

355
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,320
The drive would take

356
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,520
almost two hours.

357
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,120
Let's talk about it another day.

358
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,320
I checked the map before coming here.

359
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,320
You could circle this area several times in two hours.

360
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,880
How are you so clever?

361
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,920
Grandpa,

362
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,320
I think maybe my dad

363
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,580
has a girlfriend here.

364
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,080
What are you saying?

365
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,000
You have a girlfriend?

366
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,930
Then I definitely want to meet her.

367
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No.

368
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,000
Alright.

369
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,040
Mengmeng's sixth sense is strong.

370
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,320
Little girls can be so smart sometimes.

371
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,240
I actually did find someone.

372
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,560
So it's inconvenient to visit.

373
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,090
Really very inconvenient.

374
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,000
What's so inconvenient about it?

375
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,360
Since we're speaking Chinese anyway,

376
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,620
I'll tell you quietly.

377
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
There's a classified organization here

378
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,920
that's really impressive.

379
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Do you know?

380
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,680
Did you know?

381
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,000
There are things even you don't know, right?

382
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,640
It's a place that produces special agents.

383
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,600
My girlfriend works there.

384
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,200
Recently while on a mission,

385
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
her face was injured in an explosion.

386
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,640
Now she doesn't want to see anyone.

387
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,840
Also, this kind of special profession

388
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,970
is quite sensitive.

389
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,240
Let's keep this between us.

390
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,500
Don't mention it when we go back to China.

391
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,220
This kind of work is quite dangerous.

392
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,520
Mengmeng,

393
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,400
let's not go there.

394
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,760
Let's have a drink.

395
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,290
Thanks for understanding.

396
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,570
Thanks for understanding.

397
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,940
[In Russian] Get out of my way.

398
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,600
Excuse me,

399
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,800
my son

400
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,640
just now

401
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,480
wearing a suit

402
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,320
and a tie.

403
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,800
[In Korean] Who are you?

404
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,440
[In Russian] Who are you looking for?

405
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,920
[In Russian] Who are you looking for?

406
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,320
You're foreigners.

407
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,640
You don't understand what I'm saying.

408
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,040
[In Russian] Who are you?

409
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
[In Russian] I don't know.

410
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,700
Let's look for him ourselves.

411
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,220
Is your girlfriend from that classified workplace

412
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,720
living with you?

413
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,900
Yes, considering her safety.

414
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,520
In the past, you were just unreliable.

415
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,420
You couldn't even lie.

416
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,840
Now you've learned how to lie too.

417
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,560
Except for

418
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,480
the girlfriend from the classified workplace,

419
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,410
everything else

420
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,160
I told you is true.

421
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,320
Then why did you say all that?

422
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,000
You worked at

423
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,680
Samchung, Xianda, Rodian,

424
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,520
and MK. According to you,

425
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,760
you've worked at all the major companies here.

426
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,720
Look at where you're living now.

427
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,180
What kind of place is that?

428
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
I didn't lie.

429
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,800
At MK,

430
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,960
I was carrying sand for them.

431
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
At Rodian,

432
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,680
I was delivering kimchi.

433
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,080
At Xianda Heavy Industries,

434
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,540
I was carrying steel bars.

435
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,160
This sauce factory now,

436
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,400
it really used to be Samchung's.

437
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,800
Later they split up.

438
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,080
Now it's called CG,

439
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,000
or Xinji in Chinese.

440
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,520
Guoming.

441
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,720
Let's go back home.

442
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Come back with me.

443
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
No, I won't go back.

444
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,450
I'm doing fine here.

445
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,120
I enjoy my work

446
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,120
and I've made many foreign friends.

447
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Your debts

448
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,160
are basically paid off.

449
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,020
Please come back home with me.

450
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,640
These debts can never be fully repaid.

451
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,880
Mengmeng and Xiaoxue

452
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,420
are both going to college in Beijing.

453
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,100
Erpang just graduated from vocational school.

454
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,980
Xiaozhi is only in kindergarten.

455
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,860
These expenses are not small.

456
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,960
I have to hold on.

457
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,770
Dad, I don't need your support.

458
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,000
After I start college,

459
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,200
I can earn money teaching kids to dance.

460
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,560
You don't need to worry about Erpang either.

461
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,090
He'll be making money soon.

462
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,760
Xiaoxue

463
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,360
can also earn money as a tutor.

464
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,320
It's just Xiaozhi.

465
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,120
How much could he possibly cost?

466
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,200
Uncle Liu has mentioned several times

467
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,120
that the money you send him,

468
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,680
he hasn't spent a penny of it.

469
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,140
He's saving it all for you.

470
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,640
Why suffer like this?

471
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,180
Come back home with us.

472
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,240
It's different, Mengmeng.

473
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,280
No matter what,

474
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,120
the income here is still higher than back home.

475
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,680
I may change jobs frequently,

476
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,640
but my income

477
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,760
is very stable.

478
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,520
My pension

479
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,360
is enough to support you.

480
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,760
Besides,

481
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,560
you can find a job if you come back.

482
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,080
I'm too old for that.

483
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,410
Spending your pension?

484
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,200
And if I go back...

485
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,060
What kind of job should I look for?

486
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,410
The salary here is high.

487
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,840
I earn more money here.

488
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,320
If I go back and work there,

489
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,120
there's Xiaoxue and the others.

490
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,840
How can I handle all these expenses?

491
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,240
No, if you go back,

492
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,720
you won't earn less than you do here.

493
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,860
I really don't want to go back.

494
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
After going back,

495
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,200
I'm afraid I'll miss Mengmeng's mother even more.

496
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,920
Too many things will bring back memories.

497
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,400
It...

498
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,680
will be very painful.

499
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,760
(In Korean) There are two people here looking for you.

500
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,320
(In Korean) Sorry for the trouble.

501
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,580
(In Korean) It's fine.

502
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,250
Why did you come all the way here to find me?

503
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,520
The company is quite large.

504
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,040
So you weren't completely lying.

505
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,720
The company is big, I am small.

506
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,840
No, Dad.

507
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,760
Vladivostok is close to Northeast China.

508
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,720
But it's still a foreign country.

509
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,840
You should go explore more.

510
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,520
Why did you come all the way here?

511
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,520
To have dinner and chat with you.

512
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,600
What local specialties are there to eat?

513
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,660
Take us to try some.

514
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,620
I'll be off work in 10 minutes.

515
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,050
Okay, I'll wait for you.

516
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,200
Wait for me.

517
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,480
This looks pretty good.

518
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,210
It's just...

519
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,200
why is it called Yanbian hotpot?

520
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,010
You asked the right question, Dad.

521
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,560
This area is where Korean Chinese people gather.

522
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,690
Many people came from mainland China.

523
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,520
In the beginning,

524
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,880
nobody had much money.

525
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,120
These ingredients are actually quite cheap.

526
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,280
Like canned food,

527
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,920
plus some tofu,

528
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,440
sandwich ham,

529
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,480
add some fresh shrimp,

530
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,680
Korean spicy sauce,

531
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,520
sliced rice cakes,

532
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,280
tomato sauce,

533
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,120
sometimes crab sticks,

534
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,600
and whatever else they have,

535
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,330
like kimchi,

536
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,120
instant noodles and such,

537
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,160
all stewed together

538
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,120
in a hodgepodge.

539
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,440
The main thing is

540
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
the ingredients are cheap

541
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,600
and it's easy to make.

542
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,460
It's all about being economical.

543
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,280
This is too rough.

544
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,640
Rough indeed.

545
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,600
This can't compare to our Dingqing Restaurant's hotpot

546
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,520
at all.

547
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,240
Ours

548
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,770
is mixed but still refined.

549
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,480
How much would it cost

550
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,000
to open such a big restaurant here?

551
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,200
This place is cheap.

552
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,200
To open one with two floors,

553
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,480
about 100,000 yuan

554
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,160
would be enough.

555
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,690
It's not like in big cities.

556
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,720
Watch this.

557
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,040
What's going on?

558
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
Did you rob a bank?

559
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,360
I don't have the guts.

560
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,520
That's illegal.

561
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,840
My grandpa and I sold our football tickets.

562
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,760
Not just the Super Cup,

563
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,420
but also the Euro qualifiers.

564
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,560
There was a super fan in our tour group

565
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,040
who bought all our tickets.

566
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,560
Grandpa also took out his savings.

567
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,600
Dad, are you

568
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,680
still going to Europe?

569
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,760
Yes, of course I am.

570
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,680
I need to take Mengmeng around.

571
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,340
We just won't watch the games.

572
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,400
The urgent matter now

573
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,760
is to help you

574
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,620
open your restaurant.

575
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,080
Location, ingredients -

576
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,120
there's a lot to learn.

577
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,120
If we're doing it, let's do it right.

578
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,300
I'll stay to help you oversee things.

579
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,920
We've changed our flight tickets too,

580
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,240
to return home later.

581
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,640
We'll stay to help you open the restaurant.

582
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,440
You're on tourist visas.

583
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,960
You can't work here.

584
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,210
We're not working here.

585
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,200

586

587
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,440
We'll study carefully

588
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,240
those Korean soups.

589
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,200
Once we've figured it out, we'll open.

590
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,440
Come on.

591
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,760
Let's toast to

592
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,480
the success of our restaurant.

593
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,520

It's a gift for your opening.

597
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,560
We finally have

598
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,680
our own shop here.

599
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
Dingqing Restaurant back home

600
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,360
is gone.

601
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,880
I never thought it would reopen here.

602
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,640
The shop is a bit small,

603
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,640
but you need to work hard.

604
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,640
Don't ruin Dingqing Restaurant's reputation.

605
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,880
Don't worry, Dad.

606
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,720
I'll work my hardest.

607
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,240
Dad, I'm an adult now.

608
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,320
Can I have a drink?

609
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,680
Then I'd like to toast

610
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,010
to the prosperity of our soup restaurant.

611
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,560
Good.

612
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,360

613
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,600
Thanks, Dad.

614
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,040
Dad,

615
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,200

616
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,320
why don't you get a new place?

617
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,320
I've already found one for you,

618
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,250
right next door.

619
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,320
You won't need to send me money every month anymore.

620
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,520
When I go back home,

621
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,040
I can teach children to dance

622
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,100
and earn more than from a regular job.

623
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,410
You've worked so hard these years.

624
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,040
It's not hard.

625
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,240

750
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,740
(Korean) What a piece of junk.

751
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,260
(Korean) So annoying.

752
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,140
(Korean) Do you even know what parenting is?

753
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,730
(Korean) Do you understand parenting at all?

754
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,980
(Korean) How much?

755
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,120
(Korean) 1,200.

756
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,600
(Korean) That should be about right.

757
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,730
(Korean) Thank you.

758
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,960
(Korean) The soup rice tastes good.

759
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,090
(Korean) Thank you.

760
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,720
(Korean) No need. It's a tip.

761
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,850
(Korean) Thank you.

762
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,200
(Korean) Leave your contact information.

763
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,040
(Korean) If you need anything,

764
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,600
(Korean) I can deliver it to you.

765
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,560
(Korean) Really? I live nearby,

766
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,520
(Korean) at the motel.

767
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,930
(Korean) Keep up the good work.

768
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,170
(Korean) Thank you.

769
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,580
(Korean) I'm leaving.

770
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,200
I have a brother named Zhao Hailong.

771
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,640
His wife is your current wife.

772
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,320
He's dead.

773
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,680
Now do you know why I hit you?

774
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,640
[Korean] Son of a bitch.

775
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,540
Show some respect when talking to women from now on.

776
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,800
Here I am.

777
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,800
What's with this look you've got going?

778
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,040
[Korean] Abuji.

779
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
What does 'Abuji' mean?

780
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,800
Father.

781
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,160
After all, I'm an overseas Chinese returnee.

782
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,000
I can't appear

783
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,330
looking like some soup restaurant owner.

784
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,530
That's true.

785
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,250
But now that you're inside,

786
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,250
take off those sunglasses.

787
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,490
Where's Erpang?

788
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,080
He's

789
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,920
gone to Shanghai to negotiate

790
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,970
a hundred-million-yuan deal.

791
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,680
Him? Really?

792
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,720
I don't believe it either, right?

793
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,280
But that's what he said.

794
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,240
Though over these years,

795
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,800
he has made some money.

796
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,440
Probably not much though.

797
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,300
How would you know?

798
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,800
I watched him grow up since he was little.

799
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,600
How could I not know him?

800
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,240
He and you

801
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,160
are exactly the same.

802
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,000
They say

803
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,500
nephews take after their uncles.

804
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,880
I didn't believe it before,

805
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,560
but now I do.

806
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,000
The way he talks big,

807
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,880
brags, his mannerisms,

808
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,880
his tone of voice.

809
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,560
You two

810
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,200
were cut from the same mold.

811
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,120
Where's Mengmeng?

812
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,960
Have you met Mengmeng's boyfriend?

813
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,120
What does he look like?

814
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,880
I haven't met him in person.

815
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,680
From his photos, he looks decent.

816
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,200
He's from the south.

817
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,560
I'm a bit worried.

818
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,880
Why worry about him being southern?

819
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,640
He studied in Beijing since childhood.

820
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,000
And he performs all over the place.

821
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,680
What, afraid he won't adapt?

822
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,460
I'm not worried about Mengmeng adapting to him.

823
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,360
I'm worried that

824
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,440
this young man won't adapt to you.

825
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,320
Once he meets you as his future father-in-law,

826
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,920
how could he not be confused?

827
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,680
Why are you so confused?

828
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,080
Even us Northeasterners

829
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,960
get confused when you talk nonsense

830
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,640
and make up stories like that.

831
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,200
Let alone this young man.

832
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,170
Don't you agree?

833
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,960
Where's Xiaoxue?

834
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,120
Xiaoxue works here

835
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,120
at the law firm.

836
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,080
She's on a business trip.

837
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,810
She came to see me last weekend.

838
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,800
My granddaughter is in Beijing.

839
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,240
My grandson is right in front of me

840
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,640
but I never see him.

841
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,440
It's always Xiaoxue

842
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
who visits me regularly every week.

843
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,290
Don't tell her I'm back yet.

844
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,940
I want to surprise her.

845
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,640
Surprise?

846
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,120
With your appearance,

847
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,640
it won't be a surprise,

848
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,240
it'll definitely be a shock.

849
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,600
Doesn't it look good?

850
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,800
It looks good.

851
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,920
It looks amazing.

852
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,700
[Light]

853
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,120
Grand opening special: 20% off.

854
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,080
Please come in.

855
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,160
Please, this way.

856
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,680
Come this way, please.

857
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,600
When you go home,

858
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,920
have your wife

859
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,640
massage you in the morning.

860
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,370
Let me teach you two movements.

861
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,040
Look,

862
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,640
stretch your leg backward

863
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,280
and extend it fully.

864
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,440
See this heel?

865
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,320
Hold for five seconds,

866
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,200
then switch to the other side. Remember that.

867
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,080
And this movement goes with body technique.

868
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,440
Tilt your neck upward.

869
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,360
Upward.

870
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,680
Oh my!

871
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,720
Do we know each other?

872
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,440
Dr. Liu.

873
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,500
I'll head back first then.

874
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,000
Wow! When did you get back?

875
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,800
Just got back.

876
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,240
This shop hasn't changed in ten years.

877
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,160
What do you mean it hasn't changed?

878
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,680
I replace these banners every three months.

879
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,560
Your hair...

880
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,480
Is this

881
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,320
fashionable?

882
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,200
This color -

883
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,680
would you dare to dye yours like this?

884
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,610
I wouldn't dare.

885
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,320
I heard from my father

886
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,920
your business is booming.

887
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
Why didn't you take over this shop before?

888
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,600
You let him sell chestnuts here.

889
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,920
I'm doing well just to manage

890
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,520
this one shop properly.

891
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,000
That young Liu from the shop across the street

892
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,130
got arrested again.

893
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,040
Got arrested again?
