1
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,720
So what do you think

2
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,220
about your dismissal?

3
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,720
Talking about this?

4
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,960
Let me analyze it for you.

5
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,200
You know what?

6
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,120
I think someone targeted me.

7
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,220
Think about it.

8
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,200
That shop has been open for so long.

9
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,720
Nothing happened to anyone else.

10
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,200
As soon as I went there, before I could even take off my coat,

11
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,280
they detained me.

12
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,280
You guys

13
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,880
should go check out that store.

14
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,810
There's not a single decent person in there. Really.

15
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
This is my number.

16
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,120
About what happened on the night of the 17th.

17
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,520
If you remember anything else,

18
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,800
give me a call.

19
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,200
Alright then.

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,120
You know, I'm the type

21
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,580
who makes friends easily.

22
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,720
I'm in a hurry today.

23
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,520
Gotta go.

24
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
You guys have fun.

25
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,640
Enjoy yourselves.

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,770
I'm leaving.

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,130
I just got here and now I'm leaving.

28
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,400
Lift it up a bit.

29
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,560
Just came from the market, huh?

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,880
Coming at this hour,

31
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,140
how many pigs have you been dealing with?

32
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,720
Our classmates are all waiting.

33
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,120
I can only handle so many.

34
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,800
Don't worry. I'm saving my energy.

35
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,260
I'll take care of you next.

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,960
This celebrity speaks with such grandeur.

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,040
So imposing.

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,280
What do you know about being imposing?

39
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
I'm not as good as you.

40
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,660
You're famous now.

41
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,640
I've told you.

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,760
Even celebrities must follow the rules.

43
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,960
You said it yourself.

44
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,920
Good and evil will eventually be repaid.

45
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,520
The right path is full of vicissitudes, right?

46
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,640
Yes.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,160
Students,

48
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,320
do you know

49
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,440
why I'm standing in front of the TV?

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,460
It's to emphasize this one point.

51
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,560
It's mainly for this student

52
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
in our class, Dajian.

53
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Look how motivated he is.

54
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,520
He really took it to heart

55
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,580
and remembered it.

56
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,200
Good.

57
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,800
What did our teacher teach us back then?

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,520
Study hard,

59
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,600
learn well.

60
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,460
Get out of here.

61
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,840
Come on, sing a song.

62
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,160
Guoming, give us one.

63
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,440
I've had too much to drink.

64
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,200
I'm not singing.

65
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,920
Come on,

66
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,380
didn't you just say you'd sing if we paid you?

67
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,980
Well, you need to pay up properly.

68
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,300
Is this enough?

69
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,040
Wow.

70
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,960
If that's all you're offering,

71
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,760
then

72
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,960
I can only hum a little.

73
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,440
Let's hear it.

74
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,520
Is it enough?

75
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,600
I'll have to hum a few notes.

76
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,120
So tell me,

77
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,380
how much would it take for you to sing?

78
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,920
118,000.

79
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,560
I'll sing for you until dawn.

80
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,920
118,000?

81
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,159
118,000!

82
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,920
What nonsense are you talking?

83
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,920
Even if you cleaned yourself up,

84
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,840
would you be worth 118,000?

85
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,800
Stop it!

86
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,480
We're classmates.

87
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,360
We're all classmates.

88
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,800
But I'm a police officer.

89
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,720
If you keep fighting,

90
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,560
I'll take you to the police station.

91
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,920
What a coincidence! I just came from there.

92
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,320
Still, you can't fight.

93
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,360
Is Mr. Li gone?

94
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,080
Get up.

95
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,120
Guoming, get up.

96
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,840
Don't move.

97
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
Stop fighting.

98
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,160
They're deliberately being jerks.

99
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,200
Those two punks

100
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,440
strutting around like they own the place.

101
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
We said we'd take him down back in school.

102
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,900
Let me deal with him today.

103
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,040
We'll teach him a lesson every time we see him.

104
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,970
That's the plan.

105
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,280
But he does have some money.

106
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,120
So what?

107
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,720
I'll be on top soon too.

108
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,880
How are you going to make it?

109
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,760
I took your advice.

110
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,560
I found a real master

111
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,080
who performed a ritual for me.

112
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,240
I've cleansed my past sins.

113
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,360
From now on,

114
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,409
I'll be incredibly successful

115
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,640
and famous everywhere.

116
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,680
You want to be even more successful?

117
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,640
You're already notorious.

118
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
If you become any more famous,

119
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,840
what more do you want?

120
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,040
Your thinking is too small.

121
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,320
I'm the type

122
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,960
who will truly be

123
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,040
famous throughout the land, known by everyone.

124
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,200
You don't have to believe me.

125
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,600
Just today,

126
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,240
at the market,

127
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
two detectives from the criminal investigation unit

128
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,280
came to make friends with me on their own initiative.

129
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,080
Do you understand what that means?

130
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,010
Why would detectives look for you?

131
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
What did you do?

132
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,360
What are you thinking?

133
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,000
Let me tell you,

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
how can you navigate this world without knowing some detectives?

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,360
Ever since these two guys

136
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,520
became my friends,

137
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,280
I guarantee

138
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,100
everyone at the market will be my friend from now on.

139
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,720
What kind of people are at your market

140
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,580
that you need to know detectives?

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,280
Check this out.

142
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,480
What's that?

143
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,960
Karaoke contest.

144
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,420
[Prize]

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,560
First prize is 30,000?

146
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,200
I set this up just for you.

147
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,720
After this depressing class reunion,

148
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,320
Uncle saw this flyer

149
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
and perked up again,

150
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,440
feeling one step closer to owning a car.

151
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,960
Take off your clothes.

152
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,890
They're filthy.

153
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,560
How much more do we need

154
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,640
to buy our car?

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,880
73,000.

156
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,440
Why?

157
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Soon,

158
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,080
we'll only need 43,000 more.

159
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,620
Oh my goodness!

160
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,040
Did the factory give you such a big bonus?

161
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,800
Not at all.

162
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,170
Then what happened?

163
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,520
Can I keep it a secret for now?

164
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,480
What a ridiculous day.

165
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,730
Wash your hands.

166
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,920
I'm here to be the factory director.

167
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,920
I have only one goal.

168
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,720
To restore our factory

169
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,650
to its glory days of the 60s and 70s.

170
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
So if we want

171
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,360
to recreate this glory,

172
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,760
the most essential thing

173
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
is technology.

174
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,320
And the core of technology

175
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,760
is always people.

176
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,920
Everyone here today is a technical backbone of our factory.

177
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,800
How about this?

178
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,920
Let's

179
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,760
get to know each other first.

180
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,320
I'll call the roll,

181
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,180
whoever I call.

182
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,480
Who would like to raise their hand?

183
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,160
Alright.

184
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,720
Zhao Hailong.

185
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,040
Present.

186
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,450
Hello, Manager.

187
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,240
Good.

188
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,200
Liu Ye.

189
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,920
Present.

190
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,720
Good.

191
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,600
Liu, have a seat.

192
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,130
Sit down.

193
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,760
Cui Guoming.

194
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,240
The factory manager

195
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,039
isn't here.

196
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,760
This Cui Guoming,

197
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,039
his name sounds familiar.

198
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,900
Where did he go?

199
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,970
He took time off.

200
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,280
It's you,

201
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,200
lucky girl,

202
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,160
give me your smile,

203
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,640
let's together

204
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,720
lead this colorful era.

205
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,440
You know

206
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,240
I love you.

207
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,880
W-what?

208
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,680
Share your feelings with me,

209
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,800
don't refuse our date.

210
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,360
What are you looking at?

211
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
You looked at me first.

212
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,240
How was the previous contestant's performance?

213
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,400
Not good.

214
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,600
Alright then. Let's welcome our next contestant,

215
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,680
Cui Guoming,

216
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
to the stage

217
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
to perform.

218
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,520
What's the deal with this Cui Guoming?

219
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,640
No one listened to his far-fetched suggestions,

220
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,880
so he stopped coming to work.

221
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,200
That might be true.

222
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,080
He's

223
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,610
gone to a singing competition.

224
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,880
He thinks he's highly skilled,

225
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,520
always thinks highly of himself.

226
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,520
That's fine,

227
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,320
but he's always taking time off.

228
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,080
We don't even know what he's busy with.

229
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,320
He disappears for days at a time.

230
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,760
Nobody disciplines him.

231
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,960
When the old factory manager was here,

232
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,090
he was a bit spoiled.

233
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,640
We thought he was a graduate

234
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,760
from Engineering University with decent skills.

235
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,960
So we've been

236
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,960
turning a blind eye to his behavior.

237
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
It seems

238
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,460
we need to make an example of someone.

239
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,080
Agreed.

240
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,440
No.

241
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,760
I understand.

242
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,320
Got it.

243
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,240
Understood. I won't look for him.

244
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,100
Yes, Director.

245
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,320
Xiao Cui has made such a mess of the office

246
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,520
and you're not doing anything about it.

247
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,050
How can I manage him?

248
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,680
I'm not his supervisor.

249
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,720
Secretary Zhang,

250
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,340
why don't you talk to the Director

251
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,920
about giving me a position?

252
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,040
I'll definitely keep Xiao Cui in line.

253
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,920
I've never liked him anyway.

254
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,280
Take a look yourself.

255
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,320
This doesn't look like an office at all.

256
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,250
How is this any different from a foot massage parlor?

257
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,840
What's a foot massage parlor like?

258
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,100
I've never been to one.

259
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Secretary Zhang.

260
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,960
There's no outsiders here.

261
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,440
You have such rich life experiences.

262
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,370
Tell me about it.

263
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,360
Please share.

264
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,720
Zhao Hailong.

265
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,440
Wait until he comes back.

266
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,300
Make him clean this up right away.

267
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,520
Got it.

268
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
I'll tell him

269
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,000
it's Secretary Zhang's orders.

270
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,810
Is that okay?

271
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,600
I don't have the right to order him around either.

272
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,520
Besides,

273
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,410
I'm doing this for his own good.

274
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,440
If the factory director sees this,

275
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,560
won't you have to criticize him?

276
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,440
Right.

277
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,920
Cui has thick skin.

278
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,460
He's not afraid of criticism.

279
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,660
Is Cui Guoming really your uncle?

280
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,200
Did you all watch TV?

281
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,840
Cui Guoming really is my uncle.

282
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,320
If you don't believe me, go ask the teacher.

283
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,920
Who dares to ask the teacher?

284
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,740
If you don't believe me, go ask Wang Ning.

285
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,240
Is that true?

286
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,040
What day did you participate in the competition?

287
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,520
Last Thursday.

288
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,040
Did your workplace send you?

289
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,280
No,

290
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
I went on my own.

291
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,480
Did you go during work hours?

292
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,760
Of course I did.

293
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,520
Did you ask for leave?

294
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,540
How was my singing?

295
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,560
It was pretty good.

296
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,080
You got that good voice from your mother.

297
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,000
But what I care about now is when you'll be promoted to senior engineer.

298
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,930
I'll try my best.

299
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,000
Dad, I have something to do.

300
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,130
I need to hang up now.

301
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,620
I think Guoming will definitely win a place.

302
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,800
Both these kids take after me.

303
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,200
They have artistic talent.

304
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
You know, back then,

305
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,600
the Changchun Film Studio

306
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,080
selected me out of thousands of candidates.

307
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
If my family background hadn't been problematic,

308
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,200
I would be a movie star now.

309
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,960
If I were a movie star,

310
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,480
would I still be with you?

311
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Go live with whoever you want.

312
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,440
It's not too late now.

313
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,200
Fine then.

314
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,560
I'll talk to Mr. Zhang about it tomorrow.

315
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,480
Zhang, Li, Wang,

316
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,080
talk to whoever you want.

317
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,840
You're really letting me go?

318
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,360
Fly as high as you want,

319
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,680
but be careful not to fall.

320
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,040
Fly as far as you want,

321
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,440
but be careful you can't find your way home.

322
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,080
You can't say anything nice,

323
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,440
you grumpy old man.

324
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,920
Grandpa.

325
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,040
What does 'senior engineer' mean?

326
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,680
Senior engineer means high-level technical professional.

327
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,960
It's a prestigious technical title recognized by the state.

328
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,560
If your uncle were more reliable

329
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
and hardworking,

330
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,960
he would have been a senior engineer long ago.

331
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,240
Do you think I could become a senior engineer?

332
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,840
Look.

333
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,360
Yes.

334
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,010
A senior engineer on scaffolding.

335
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,320
Then we need to reinforce the scaffolding.

336
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,680
Indeed we should.

337
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,840
What's wrong?

338
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,240
Cat got your tongue?

339
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,640
Where are you going?

340
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,840
Did you ask for leave?

341
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,440
Is that any of your business?

342
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,100
I don't need your permission.

343
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,480
The factory director said

344
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,320
we need to set examples.

345
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,440
What kind of model worker are you looking for?

346
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,100
The singing and dancing type?

347
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,480
The technical expert type?

348
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,200
Or the outspoken justice type?

349
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,360
I'm all of those types.

350
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,960
You're the slacker type.

351
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,760
Look at yourself.

352
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,690
If not you, then who should we pick?

353
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,330
How do you pronounce that word?

354
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,760
Come on then, pick me!

355
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,600
Catch it!

356
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,260
Listen, you

357
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,720
remember to watch TV these days.

358
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,860
Just tell me what's on your mind, Liu.

359
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,280
From now on,

360
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,960
whenever you have issues with the police

361
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,560
or political matters,

362
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,040
if you're in trouble, just consult me.

363
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,680
If I can help, I'll definitely take care of it.

364
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,839
Even police matters?

365
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,680
Especially police matters.

366
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,079
Those two guys who came to see me last time,

367
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,040
you remember them?

368
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,640
Do you know what kind of police they are?

369
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,280
What kind?

370
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,800
Criminal investigators.

371
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,839
They mainly

372
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,400
deal with people like you.

373
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,920
What problems do I have?

374
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,079
My tem-

375
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,200
My temper is much better than before.

376
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,280
Aren't those two police friends of yours?

377
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,210
I came to see you.

378
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,440
I'm here.

379
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,720
Can't find me?

380
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,250
We were just talking about you.

381
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,730
What's going on?

382
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,400
Wait.

383
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:31,920
Cut the crap.

384
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,040
What's the meaning of this?

385
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,640
No more talking.

386
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,320
Come with us.

387
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,840
Hold on.

388
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,760
What's...

389
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,680
What's happening here again?

390
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,240
That's quite intense.

391
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,600
What kind of friend is this?

392
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,240
So annoying.

393
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,280
Get out of my way.

394
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,880
I won't move.

395
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,520
If you go, I'll move.

396
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,320
I'm not going.

397
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,880
I'll sing for you.

398
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,240
I don't want to hear it.

399
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,520
I never come late

400
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,520
365 days a year.

401
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,120
Then how about 364 days

402
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,360
and one day of coming late and leaving early? Okay?

403
00:17:59,360 --> 00:17:59,920
No way.

404
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,600
My father is the manager.

405
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,400
If your father is the manager,

406
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,640
that's all the more reason I can't miss work.

407
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,360
Enough already.

408
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,090
Li Xiaozhen,

409
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,880
listen to me carefully.

410
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,520
As the young master of Dingqing Restaurant,

411
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
I officially inform you

412
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,580
that you're fired.

413
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:11,880
Get lost.

414
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,520
You're dismissed,

415
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,640
I'm telling you.

416
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,920
Are you going to participate in

417
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,980
the city-wide karaoke competition?

418
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,160
(in Cantonese) Yes.

419
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,040
Can I go with you?

420
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,920
Sure.

421
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,640
Ji Qiang.

422
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,860
Do you think I can win first place?

423
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,160
Thanks.

424
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,820
The factory director is here.

425
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,160
Here for an inspection?

426
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,000
We were just about to check the work area.

427
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,530
Let's go.

428
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,280
Wait.

429
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,090
Where are you two going?

430
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,460
Regular equipment maintenance.

431
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,280
Would you two still go if I didn't come?

432
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,640
Yes.

433
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,480
Of course.

434
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,120
Aren't you wearing work clothes?

435
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Java sparrow.

436
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,400
Bengalese finch.

437
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,570
Throw away what needs to be thrown.

438
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,120
Tear up what needs to be torn.

439
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,240
Uncle.

440
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,160
I heard

441
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,480
my mom could sing and dance

442
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,800
as well as you. Is that true?

443
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
That's not right.

444
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,420
So they were just making it up.

445
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,280
They were definitely making it up.

446
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,680
Because your mom's singing and dancing

447
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,880
was much better than mine.

448
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,640
Really?

449
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,280
So when you're on TV,

450
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,040
can my mom see you?

451
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,880
She should be able to.

452
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,240
Uncle.

453
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,160
You must teach me to sing and dance.

454
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,420
I must perform on stage

455
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,700
so my mom can see me.

456
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,880
Okay.

457
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,400
Don't wait here.

458
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,280
Time won't stand still.

459
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,360
The train has passed by,

460
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,160
leaving just a breeze.

461
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,000
Who could understand

462
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,120
these feelings right now?

463
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,920
The path here was so peaceful,

464
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,760
as you traveled through the darkness.

465
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,360
The path away is bathed in sunset glow,

466
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,360
as you hear the bell toll.

467
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,360
Good, good, good.

468
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,400
Next up

469
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,920
is the first-place winner from the preliminaries,

470
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,480
Cui Guoming from the Provincial Machinery Factory

471
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,640
to the stage.

472
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,180
Nothing's happening.

473
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,800
Ladies and gentlemen,

474
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,120
we sincerely apologize,

475
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,920
but the tape for Cui Guoming's song

476
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,720
'Who Understands a Wanderer's Heart' is damaged

477
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,440
and cannot be played.

478
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,360
Please, Mr. Cui Guoming, step down from the stage.

479
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,400
Let's welcome the next contestant.

480
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,160
Wait a moment.

481
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,560
No.

482
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,320
Did you rewind the tape?

483
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,650
Just rewind it backward a couple of times.

484
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:57,920
No.

485
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,800
Since I'm already here, I'll...

486
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,160
How about this?

487
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,680
I'll sing without music, okay?

488
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,120
Sing one!

489
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,840
Go for it!

490
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,120
Sing one!

491
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,400
Let's welcome Mr. Cui Guoming

492
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,560
to sing for us.

493
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,360
This song is called 'Mother in My Dreams'.

494
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,600
'Eji' means mother.

495
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,040
I dedicate this song

496
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,640
to my nephew Huo Xiaoyang.

497
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,640
I hope he can reunite with his mother soon.

498
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,880
Thank you.

499
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,240
Good.

500
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,440
That day,

501
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,240
my uncle's singing touched my heart.

502
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,600
I felt my soul trembling.

503
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,720
When my uncle was on stage

504
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
at that moment he almost cried,

505
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,520
I didn't know if he was thinking

506
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,160
more about pitiful me,

507
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,200
or about his ill-fated sister,

508
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,360
my mother.

509
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,640
Dad.

510
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,120
You were amazing!

511
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,160
You just realized your dad is great?

512
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,040
I've always known.

513
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,640
But I really didn't know

514
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,300
you could make money singing.

515
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,720
Money isn't important.

516
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,880
What matters is...

517
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,120
Honor.

518
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,940
You already have too many honors.

519
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,800
But this time is different.

520
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,330
This time we can make money.

521
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,440
Our family has earned another 30,000 yuan.

522
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,120
Does that mean

523
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,580
we can buy a Xiali car soon?

524
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,280
No rush.

525
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,850
Let's wait a bit longer.

526
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,410
Look at this.

527
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,080
Once we get the trophy,

528
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,800
the whole factory will be buzzing.

529
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,080
Our colleagues at the factory

530
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,360
from every department have said

531
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,690
they want to treat you to drinks together.

532
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,690
You almost hit your wife with that trophy.

533
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,800
Tell all departments

534
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,080
to arrange themselves alphabetically by pinyin

535
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,960
and take turns treating me to dinner.

536
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,520
Got it.

537
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,000
Go ahead and show off.

538
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,840
Of course,

539
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,880
winning the championship deserves celebration.

540
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,120
However,

541
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,800
you must do your job well first.

542
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,320
You should look into

543
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,920
when you can become a senior engineer.

544
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,330
Right, exactly.

545
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,320
Hailong and I

546
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,920
were introduced by you and your wife.

547
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,450
I'm about to give birth now.

548
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,560
Since you're so talented

549
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,640
and won the championship,

550
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,360
you must name my child.

551
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:00,960
Yes.

552
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,160
Are you being sincere or just rescuing me?

553
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,960
I'm sincere.

554
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
Please give us a name.

555
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,920
Is the baby in your belly

556
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,280
a boy or a girl?

557
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,160
The fortune teller said it's a boy.

558
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,800
I think it's a boy too.

559
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,560
Then let's name him as a boy.

560
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,650
Let's call him Xiaozhi.

561
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,720
Xiaozhi.

562
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,800
When I was young,

563
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,680
my father had very high expectations for me.

564
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,360
When I went to college,

565
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,400
I wanted to study arts,

566
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,560
but he insisted I apply to the engineering university.

567
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,680
Well, I got in.

568
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,280
Having great ambition.

569
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,280
After I graduated,

570
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,600
I thought I must participate in

571
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,120
the development of spacecraft.

572
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,040
Now

573
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,960
I can't even figure out

574
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,620
these simple family matters.

575
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,200
So I think ambitions

576
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,600
shouldn't be too grand.

577
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,160
Smaller ambitions

578
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,360
are easier to achieve.

579
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,200
The happiness index will be higher too.

580
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,600
If it's a boy, let's name him Xiaozhi.

581
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,800
Listen to my brother.

582
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,840
Your ambition

583
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,680
isn't about being grand or not.

584
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,120
It's about your ambitions being all over the place.

585
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,360
Your mother has been running to school

586
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,420
until she's nearly worn her legs out.

587
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,560
In high school.

588
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,320
From what I can remember, your ambitions

589
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,360
included being a poet,

590
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,400
a philosopher,

591
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,840
a medical scientist,

592
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,560
(a veterinarian),

593
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,920
a screenwriter,

594
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,160
a fashion designer,

595
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,840
and a rock star.

596
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,320
The only thing missing was

597
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,850
your desire to become Deputy Prime Minister.

598
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,440
In my opinion,

599
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,360
all those ambitions of yours

600
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,840
were just nonsensical dreams.

601
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,520
Now I have a new dream.

602
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,280
I'm studying the Austrian School of Economics.

603
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,120
Hayek.

604
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,960
I strongly agree with his ideas.

605
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
He says leave everything to the market,

606
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,720
and the economy will naturally improve.

607
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,280
The Soviet Union has collapsed.

608
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:38,960
I've also studied

609
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,360
the industrial structure of the Commonwealth of Independent States.

610
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,280
I think now is

611
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,040
the best time for free trade.

612
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,080
It's a very vast free market.

613
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,360
Since I know Russian,

614
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:49,960
well then,

615
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,360
why shouldn't I give it a try?

616
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,560
What do you think, Dad?

617
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,320
I think

618
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,360
you should take those potato strips to Ji Qiang.

619
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,080
Alright.

620
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,640
Mr. Cui,

621
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
I also want to do some

622
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,680
foreign trade with the CIS in my spare time.

623
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,640
But the problem is

624
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,100
my family has no money now.

625
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,920
Is having no money a problem for our family?

626
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,600
If that's not a problem, what is?

627
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,660
That's the answer.

628
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,450
Stop working, Ji Qiang.

629
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,360
Let's eat.

630
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,640
You're Cui Guoming.

631
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,760
Huh?

632
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,880
I've been following you for a long time.

633
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,960
Never thought I'd run into you here.

634
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,520
What are you doing here?

635
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,840
My dad is the general manager of Dingqing Restaurant.

636
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,040
I hang out here often.

637
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,920
Your performance was absolutely amazing.

638
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,960
Let me tell you.

639
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,960
That karaoke competition,

640
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,120
I watched both the preliminaries and finals.

641
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,920
When I saw the preliminaries,

642
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,520
I knew you'd be the champion.

643
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,520
I never expected

644
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,120
you'd win the finals by singing a cappella.

645
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,880
You are?

646
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,920
Do you know Night Color?

647
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,360
Of course,

648
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,290
the biggest nightclub in the city.

649
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,360
That's mine.

650
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,880
Miss Yang, pleased to meet you.

651
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,520
Likewise.

652
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,410
What can I do for you?

653
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,880
I really admire your singing

654
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,280
and your stage presence.

655
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,360
If you have a chance,

656
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,040
you could perform at my place a few times.

657
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,520
We can negotiate anything.

658
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,050
I can't. I work at a factory.

659
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,280
No problem.

660
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,840
I know.

661
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,560
Don't you work during the day?

662
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,820
We only start at night.

663
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,010
It won't interfere.

664
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,960
That's true.

665
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,160
Let me think about it.

666
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,690
Alright.

667
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,720
Give me your pager number.

668
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,010
I don't have a pager.

669
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,450
Then give me your landline number.

670
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,360
8-3-3-3-2-3-8.

671
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,400
Do you have a pen?

672
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:36,920
No need.

673
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,560
I've got it.

674
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,680
8-3-3-3-2-3-8.

675
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
[8-3-3-3-2-3-8]

676
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,410
Impressive.

677
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,280
Well then, I'll be going now.

678
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,120
I won't keep you any longer.

679
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,680
Okay.

680
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,280
I'll treat you to dinner sometime.

681
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,280
Sure.

682
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,680
Bye-bye.

683
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,210
Goodbye.

684
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,120
See you.

685
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,560
What are you laughing at?

686
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,360
Eat up.

687
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,880
What's wrong with you?

688
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,280
You want sesame paste?

689
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,760
I'll go make some for you.

690
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,680
I was just thinking about

691
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,920
when Erpang's mother was little.

692
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,200
Whenever she heard someone outside yelling

693
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,120
'Sticky rice candy!'

694
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,960
she would cry and beg

695
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,440
for us to buy her some.

696
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,160
Now she's living abroad,

697
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,560
I wonder if they have sticky rice candy there.

698
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,840
They're in

699
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,920
a developed country.

700
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,960
They have plenty of candies better than sticky rice candy.

701
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,560
Why are you worrying about this?

702
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,020
Nothing tastes as good as sticky rice candy.

703
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,640
Xiaohong,

704
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,840
how long has it been since she called us?

705
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
Two months.

706
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,640
Well,

707
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,880
why don't you give her a call?

708
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,200
I won't.

709
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,120
After all these years,

710
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,720
how can you still be angry with her?

711
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,440
I'm not.

712
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,960
You were too strict with the children.

713
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,960
Way too strict.

714
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,080
That's why they all rebelled.

715
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,540
You shouldn't have controlled them so much.

716
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,880
Was I really that controlling?

717
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,120
Of course you were!

718
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,600
When Guoming wanted to apply to the Central Conservatory of Music,

719
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,840
why did you stop him?

720
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,160
His sister studied arts,

721
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,580
and what happened?

722
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,440
Besides,

723
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,080
a man who sings and dances

724
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,820
can hardly be called a man.

725
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,920
I'd rather have him clean sewers

726
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,680
than let him work in that field.

727
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,080
You're just prejudiced.

728
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,160
Yes,

729
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,040
he followed your wishes and studied engineering,

730
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,560
but does he really like it?

731
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,160
Has he found happiness

732
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,320
in his work?

733
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,600
Look how talented he is in arts.

734
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,720
He could win championships just by singing.

735
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,160
He works as an engineer, right?

736
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,800
His job is stable.

737
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,080
His income is steady.

738
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,960
What more could you want?

739
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,920
But when he graduated,

740
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,400
he wanted to go south for better opportunities,

741
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,160
yet you insisted he come back.

742
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,880
I still don't understand

743
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,560
what was so good about him returning.

744
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,360
Our machinery factory

745
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,880
was built with Soviet aid.

746
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,440
These large Soviet-aided factories

747
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,440
are mostly in the Northeast.

748
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,840
What future could he have in the South?

749
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,880
Alright, alright.

750
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,810
I can't win this argument with you.

751
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,520
Mengmeng brought up buying a car again.

752
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,720
Let her talk about it.

753
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,840
We still need to save money slowly to buy it.

754
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,880
Our saving speed

755
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,640
is no match for your spending speed.

756
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,080
When Hailong and Zhang Xiaomei got married,

757
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,360
you gave them a refrigerator and a washing machine.

758
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,690
Now you've got a godson.

759
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,160
What kind of family are we?

760
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,600
We're just a family living on fixed salaries.

761
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,860
You're constantly throwing money away.

762
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,440
Who can bear this?

763
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,960
What should we do then?

764
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,360
Hailong's family was already poor.

765
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,920
Zhang Xiaomei looks down on him again.

766
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,120
And we're the ones who introduced them.

767
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,560
When they're getting married,

768
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,320
shouldn't you show up and save some face for them?

769
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,600
If you go there to save their face,

770
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,060
what about our own family?

771
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,080
Besides,

772
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,360
I think Zhang Xiaomei simply doesn't think Hailong is good enough.

773
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
This couple,

774
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,560
mark my words,

775
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,960
it's just a matter of time

776
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,320
before they break up.

777
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,120
Can't you wish them well?

778
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,850
You're really something else.

779
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,840
How can I compare to you?

780
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,440
Your optimistic spirit

781
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,700
is beyond most people.

782
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,840
Hey, Cui.

783
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,300
You're really something.

784
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,040
Cui,

785
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,120
could you sign an autograph for my granddaughter?

786
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,920
No problem.

787
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,880
Thank you.

788
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,639
Let's go.

789
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:32,920
Cui!

790
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,360
Mrs. Liu.

791
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,639
You're really impressive.

792
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,370
Won another award, didn't you?

793
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,320
Congratulations, Cui.

794
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,040
Cui, you're amazing.

795
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,400
I must treat you to dinner.

796
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,320
Director.

797
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,449
This is Cui Guoming.

798
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:42,679
Cui.

799
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,560
Ms. Liu.

800
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:44,880
I can do it too.

801
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,210
You try. Come feel mine.

802
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,380
This is our new factory director.

803
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,719
Hello, Director.

804
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,280
I am...

805
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,320
Cui Guoming.

806
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,360
I've heard so much about you.

807
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,290
You're too kind.

808
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,520
I heard that you...

809
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,880
Just won a singing competition.

810
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,880
Yes.

811
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,940
You've brought honor to our factory.

812
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,400
It's nothing really.

813
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,960
I heard you...

814
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,690
Don't like coming to work much.

815
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,400
I'm always here when it matters.

816
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,810
Let him come to the private room later.

817
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,800
Come to the private room soon.

818
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,160
I heard that.

819
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,660
Why aren't you going to the private room yet?

820
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,370
Secretary Zhang told me

821
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,600
that the factory wants to

822
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,530
make an example of me for being negligent.

823
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,600
If I go, I'll just get criticized anyway.

824
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,760
I'll eat here first.

825
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,680
The factory director is new.

826
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,560
You should at least show some respect.

827
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,000
Why should I respect him?

828
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,120
I haven't neglected my work.

829
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,160
He can't fire me.

830
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,200
That's right.

831
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,640
If Cui really leaves,

832
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,640
who could operate those antique machines

833
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,040
in our factory?

834
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,840
Cui.

835
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,520
Eat up.

836
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,120
Here.

837
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,280
This dish is good.

838
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,560
Director.

839
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,160
Why are you standing there?

840
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,320
Hurry up.

841
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,320
Okay.

842
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,900
Let me borrow this.

843
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,800
I'd like to toast all the leaders.

844
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,060
Water instead of wine, please forgive the modest gesture.

845
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,400
Xiao Cui.

846
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,320
Everyone here has reported that you're

847
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,520
slacking off at work.

848
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,600
Normally, this matter

849
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,080
could be forgiven.

850
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,760
But it's certainly not a good thing.

851
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,400
No, Director.

852
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,800
Actually, I haven't been slacking off.

853
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,280
I was just late twice when it snowed.

854
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,200
The snow was heavy and I...

855
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,560
I was just a little late.

856
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,120
Cui Guoming.

857
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,880
It snowed across the entire city.

858
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,280
Was it only snowing at your house?

859
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,120
Couldn't you overcome this difficulty?

860
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,760
Being on time for work

861
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,560
is the most basic requirement.

862
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,880
Right.

863
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,920
This clock has stopped again.

864
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,840
This clock,

865
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,920
if you don't fix it,

866
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,080
it will never show the correct time.

867
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
Right.

868
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,840
Xiao Cui,

869
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,250
don't you like singing?

870
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,880
Sing us a couple of songs.

871
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,260
After you sing,

872
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,680
write a self-criticism,

873
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,280
and we'll let this matter go.

874
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,600
Sing.

875
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,600
Come on, sing.

876
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:19,920
Sing now.

877
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,250
When I tell you to sing, you'd better sing.

878
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,960
Alright.

879
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,000
The next song

880
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,080
is dedicated to our dear factory director.

881
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,560
I hope your life

882
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,400
every day

883
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,360
will be as happy

884
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,320
as these lyrics.

885
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,080
Okay.

886
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,120
Thank you.

887
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:47,920
Thank you.

888
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,760
Iron doors, iron windows, iron chains.

889
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,360
Hands gripping the iron bars, looking out.

890
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,440
Cui Guoming, what do you mean?

891
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,200
Get out!

892
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,040
Cui Guoming!

893
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,280
What kind of place do you think this is?

894
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,010
You think you can act wild here?

895
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,960
You're suspended pending investigation.

896
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,680
This is outrageous!

897
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,160
He hit me!

898
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,600
My uncle and the factory director had an unfortunate misunderstanding.

899
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,760
The misunderstanding between both sides grew deeper and deeper.

900
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,920
From this moment on,

901
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,960
Uncle completely set his life free.

902
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,200
He never imagined

903
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,000
how brilliant and colorful his life would become.

904
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,200
Happy.

905
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,160
Satisfying.

906
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,960
How could I bow down to the powerful,

907
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,560
and lose my joyful expression?

908
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,960
That's right!

909
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,360
Beat him up!

910
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,320
Well done!

911
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,600
I really can't stay here anymore.

912
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,680
I can't take this humiliation.

913
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,160
I don't even care if they fire me.

914
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,880
That's right.

915
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,680
If you quit, what will you do?

916
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,320
Where would you go?

917
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,440
You'll have nothing to eat.

918
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,040
You have a family to support.

919
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,600
Heaven won't let a sparrow starve,

920
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,120
so it won't let me starve either.

921
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,960
That's right.

922
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,600
Why are you joining in?

923
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:16,480
Iron doors, iron windows, iron chains.

924
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:23,000
Hands holding the iron bars, looking outside.

925
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,680
How beautiful the outside world is!

926
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,600
Can you stop singing?

927
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,520
Keep singing and I'll knock your teeth out.

928
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,650
Does your family own this restaurant?

929
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,240
Where did this wild beast come from?

930
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,330
Let's settle this with a fight.

931
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,800
What did you just say?

932
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,560
I said let's have a little fight.

933
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,160
Not that one.

934
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,960
The one before.

935
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,420
Is this restaurant yours?

936
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,730
The one before that.

937
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,220
What did I say earlier?

938
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,640
Could you keep it down?

939
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,840
Believe me, I'll break your teeth if you keep singing.

940
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,640
I believe you.

941
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:33,960
I believe you.

942
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,080
How could you not believe me?

943
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,200
I can't.

944
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,640
I don't believe you.

945
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,760
Won't you just beat me up?

946
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,200
No, that's not right.

947
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,800
You should say you don't believe me.

948
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,240
Right?

949
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:44,840
If you say you don't believe me,

950
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,360
then I can smack you.

951
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,120
Only then can I hit you.

952
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,280
Now you say you believe me,

953
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,120
so now I'm just...

954
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,160
I can't do it.

955
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,960
What am I supposed to do?

956
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,320
Right, now I...

957
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,760
I just don't want you to hit me.

958
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,000
That won't work.

959
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,720
I have to hit you, brother.

960
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,560
Why?

961
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,280
Recently...

962
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,560
I just got out of prison.

963
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,840
I just got released.

964
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,560
My brothers said,

965
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,280
'Big brother, let's go get some food,

966
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,960
have some drinks,

967
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,440
get some barbecue and stuff.'

968
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,960
I had just sat down,

969
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,360
and you started singing about iron bars and prison cells.

970
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,920
You made me sad.

971
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,880
I'm sorry,

972
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,680
big brother.

973
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,680
I am...

974
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,080
I'm sorry.

975
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,560
I am...

976
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,720
Isn't this guy quite polite?

977
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,200
Uncle!

978
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,240
Uncle!

979
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,760
Come out for a second!

980
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,360
Hurry!

981
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,080
You even brought a kid.

982
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,920
You're just hanging around here with nothing better to do.

983
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,120
What kind of person are you?

984
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,480
Come on, big brother.

985
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,480
I'm just visiting.

986
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,160
Brother, do you believe me?

987
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,280
No.

988
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,600
Yes, yes!

989
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,280
What am I doing? What?

990
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,880
I don't know what you're talking about believing or not.

991
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,880
I'm just visiting.

992
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,210
What's wrong, Xiaoxue?

993
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
Mr. Cui,

994
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,160
my father has been arrested.

995
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,800
W-what happened?

996
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,650
The police station just called me.

997
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,120
They said my father is a murderer.

998
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,960
It's okay.
