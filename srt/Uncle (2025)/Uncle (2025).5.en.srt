1
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
Li

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,720
Li Yang.

3
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,040
Liu.

4
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,259
Which one of you is paying?

5
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,360
I'll pay.

6
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,200
Don't worry about it.

7
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,120
How much?

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,920
Over 10,000.

9
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,360
How much?

10
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,120
Over 10,000.

11
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,440
No, no.

12
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,600
No, brother.

13
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
He said you have over 10,000 here.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,759
Yes, I was saying...

15
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,120
What he's asking you is

16
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,600
how much this meal costs.

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,240
Sit down, sit down.

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,120
Do you understand? He's asking you

19
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,200
how much this meal costs.

20
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,050
The meal is free.

21
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,440
Free?

22
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,040
What are you doing here then?

23
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,420
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid.

24
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,360
Take this.

25
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,320
Okay, that's enough, enough.

26
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,380
That's definitely enough. Let's go.

27
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,770
Look how scared you are.

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,130
Where would I get so much money? I just got out.

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,440
Erpang needs to live with me.

30
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,180
We need to rent a place.

31
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,440
Then you can bring him back.

32
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,640
Do you need me to write you a receipt?

33
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,360
No need.

34
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,960
I can tell you're decent people.

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,680
Otherwise I wouldn't dare rent to you.

36
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,000
What if I rented to some thugs

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,120
and they trashed my house?

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,800
Alright then. Carry on.

39
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,440
Brother, I've

40
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,600
never seen anything like this

41
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,460
in my whole life. Such a big house.

42
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,770
Are these all the rooms?

43
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,000
Still living in the same old place?

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,120
You bet. They talk about demolition

45
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,520
but never actually do it.

46
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,680
Leaks in winter

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,960
and drafty in summer.

48
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm really afraid one day a strong wind

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,640
will blow my roof right off.

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,960
Then move in here.

51
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,200
No way. This is your home.

52
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,440
Aren't there three rooms?

53
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,760
One for me, one for Erpang,

54
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,200
and one for you. Perfect.

55
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,680
It's not appropriate.

56
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,760
I can't disturb your life.

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,200
What? Do I have to beg you?

58
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,880
You're already lying here.

59
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Brother, that's not what I meant.

60
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,200
What do you mean then?

61
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,260
This place already feels like yours.

62
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,329
I know your home is far away.

63
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,880
While you're here,

64
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,560
cook a meal for Erpang.

65
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,540
Your cooking is so delicious.

66
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,760
I don't have any other requests.

67
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,440
Just one.

68
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,640
What request? Don't bring women back here.

69
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,770
I can't handle that.

70
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,200
That might be difficult.

71
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,680
Well...

72
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
I can't promise.

73
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,240
Let's buy some bedding, toilet paper

74
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,000
and daily necessities. Stock up on food and drinks.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's get some booze and snacks

76
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,000
and start our new life.

77
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,760
Which room is mine?

78
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,760
You'll stay here.

79
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,000
No problem.

80
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,540
It's so soft. This one's perfect.

81
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,920
Later, I'll take Erpang

82
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,440
to Huo Dongfeng's place.

83
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,320
Then I'll go to my night shift.

84
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,440
Why does your night shift end so early?

85
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,540
Isn't earlier better?

86
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,040
I've seen other people's night shifts

87
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,240
that last until dawn.

88
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,720
That's them,

89
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,840
and we're us.

90
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,160
Brother,

91
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,160
are you moving out?

92
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,610
When will you move back?

93
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,200
I'm not coming back.

94
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,500
See what happened?

95
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,400
When your brother was here,

96
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,560
you bullied him every day.

97
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,040
Now he's leaving,

98
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,840
and you're feeling bad about it?

99
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,960
After all, my brother is part of our family.

100
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,840
The time your brother spent here,

101
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,960
everything you did to him,

102
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,360
he'll remember for life.

103
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,440
Until he's 70 or 80.

104
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Really?

105
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,440
How is that possible?

106
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,560
I'm your sister.

107
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,159
No,

108
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,080
you're my sister.

109
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,320
Mom's hospital deposit,

110
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,180
why haven't we gotten it back yet?

111
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,520
Oh, I forgot.

112
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,040
Give it to me. I'll go get it back.

113
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,500
No need. I'll go tomorrow.

114
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,480
I'll go change my clothes

115
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,680
and see him off later.

116
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,800
By the way,

117
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,680
that certificate...

118
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,440
We should give it to Erpang

119
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,440
to hang above his bed in his new home.

120
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,680
Great! That's awesome. Very generous.

121
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,840
Bro.

122
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,680
You didn't drink too much yesterday, did you?

123
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,409
Do you remember what I told you?

124
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,960
It was the day before yesterday.

125
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,720
Right, right.

126
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,450
Absolutely.

127
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,800
Cherish it, bro.

128
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,400
I'm leaving.

129
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,560
You're leaving?

130
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,320
Don't go. Stay for dinner.

131
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,720
It's just ready. Come on.

132
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,720
Smells delicious.

133
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,320
I can't.

134
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,380
I have to go to work.

135
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,800
You're working two jobs in one day.

136
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Can you handle it?

137
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,440
It's nothing for a man.

138
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,160
You're not working two jobs because of pressure

139
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,680
from Er Pang, are you?

140
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
It's just a pair of chopsticks.

141
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,050
Is it really that serious, bro?

142
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,480
Just tell me if you need anything.

143
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,320
Alright!

144
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,960
Er Pang, come eat.

145
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Are you really leaving?

146
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,040
Bro.

147
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,080
Do you have 6,000?

148
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,680
Add another pair of chopsticks.

149
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,610
Sure thing, bro.

150
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,400
Do you have 6,128?

151
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
Yuan?

152
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,320
More or less.

153
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,720
Okay.

154
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,159
Wait, keep 200.

155
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,440
Why such an odd amount?

156
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,720
It's because...

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,600
Alright.

158
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,320
Just tell me if you need anything.

159
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,450
Come eat, let's eat.

160
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,930
Which room are you sleeping in?

161
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,620
Are you sleeping on the couch?

162
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,770
I see you like this room.

163
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,860
You can sleep here.

164
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,640
Let's sort it out after dinner.

165
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,080
Okay.

166
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,960
Er Mei said

167
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,160
she'll take us to the fish market later.

168
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,440
Sounds good.

169
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,320
Bro, how is it?

170
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,680
The flavor is quite rich.

171
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,560
Of course!

172
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,690
That's how a fish market should smell.

173
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,560
Brother,

174
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,080
about this fish market,

175
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,480
let me tell you something.

176
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,680
It was rebuilt in '87.

177
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,080
It's been six years. I can say

178
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
this place is

179
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,600
the fish distribution center for our entire province.

180
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,840
Look at those big trucks.

181
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,920
Every day, coming and going,

182
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,320
several hundred of them.

183
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,400
Bro,

184
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,880
let me introduce you to the owner. Come.

185
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,640
Er Ge, you're looking good lately, Er Ge!

186
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
Just go about your business.

187
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,040
Er Ge is here.

188
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,680
Sister Xu.

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let me get you some fish.

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,880
No need, no need.

191
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,280
We just got some big-headed carp.

192
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,160
Let me introduce you.

193
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,040
This is my big brother, Huo Dongfeng.

194
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,760
He wants to do some business here too.

195
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,120
You two should get acquainted.

196
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,250
That would be great!

197
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,610
Go on with your work.

198
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,640
Good.

199
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,040
Let's go, bro.

200
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,130
Everyone knows you.

201
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,760
You big troublemaker.

202
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,920
And they all welcome you.

203
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,000
What's going on? Have you been bullying them?

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,120
Who could I possibly bully, brother?

205
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,680
Ask around.

206
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,240
Have I ever bullied any of them?

207
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,800
Then why are you so respected?

208
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Brother, let me tell you something.

209
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,280
Before I came here,

210
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,680
this place was a mess.

211
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,480
Nobody could control the business or taxes.

212
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,400
After I arrived,

213
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,920
It got even worse.

214
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,240
Once you start working here,

215
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,370
you'll understand.

216
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,180
It's different from our time.

217
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,560
Completely different from the '70s and '80s.

218
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,160
Brother, nowadays money brings respect.

219
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,480
Money gives you courage.

220
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,760
I see you've got plenty of courage,

221
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,820
pushing me around.

222
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,640
Let's go, brother.

223
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,160
This is who I've been telling you about,

224
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,120
my big brother, Huo Dongfeng.

225
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,560
I've heard so much about you,

226
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,220
Er Mei always talks about you.

227
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,760
Come.

228
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,640
Have a seat.

229
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,520
Come sit down.

230
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,880
Mr. Wu,

231
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,040
my brother here

232
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,800
wants to

233
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,160
start some business here.

234
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,820
You'll need to look after him.

235
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,000
Look after him?

236
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,640
All these years,

237
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,570
you've been taking good care of me.

238
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,040
Brother Huo coming to do business here

239
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,520
is actually doing our fish market a favor.

240
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,800
In our fish market,

241
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,520
what fish isn't being bought yet?

242
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,000
Those silver carp and bighead carp

243
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,530
don't have regular buyers.

244
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,800
So can my brother deal in silver carp?

245
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,040
Of course that's fine.

246
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,240
Second Brother has spoken.

247
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,760
How could it not be okay?

248
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
Er Mei is a righteous brother.

249
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,840
Since Er Mei arrived,

250
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,920
our fish market

251
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,160
has become much more peaceful.

252
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,040
These years,

253
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,920
the social atmosphere hasn't been good.

254
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,400
If Er Mei wasn't around,

255
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,040
we'd have three fights a day.

256
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,360
All these troublemakers

257
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
would cause problems every single day.

258
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,000
Since Er Mei arrived,

259
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,730
we don't even have one fight in three days.

260
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,680
He didn't force you to say this, did he?

261
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,880
No, not at all.

262
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
If he dares to bully anyone,

263
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,520
I'll deal with him.

264
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,480
Brother, what are you saying?

265
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,360
These are all our friends.

266
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,640
Sounds just like you coached them.

267
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,500
What could I possibly teach them?

268
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,240
Mr. Wu,

269
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,400
once my brother starts working here,

270
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
rest assured, your fish market will be even more stable.

271
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
If anyone dares to cause trouble in the future,

272
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,040
just let my brother handle it.

273
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,680
You just said

274
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,080
I'm a righteous brother, and I accept that.

275
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,800
But

276
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,240
these small skills of mine

277
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,120
I learned from my big brother.

278
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,640
People out there

279
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,880
may not respect me, Ermei,

280
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,940
but they must respect my big brother.

281
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,080
Who is my big brother?

282
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,040
The leader of the Dalin Three Heroes.

283
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,880
A true hero. What makes a hero?

284
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,520
Someone who enjoys helping others

285
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
and never bullies anyone.

286
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,280
Enough.

287
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
No, brother.

288
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,080
Fine, we've bullied people too.

289
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,480
All those thugs.

290
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,160
Those troublemakers,

291
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,820
we've dealt with them, right?

292
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,180
But we've never bullied ordinary folks.

293
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,880
Brother Huo,

294
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,280
really.

295
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,560
Please sit down.

296
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,690
I'm counting on you.

297
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,920
Manager Wu asked me to do business here.

298
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,240
I'll maintain order while I'm at it.

299
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,120
That's a must.

300
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,480
It's something I'm willing to do.

301
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,940
That's really wonderful!

302
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,880
Why don't we go out for a meal?

303
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,760
No need.

304
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,040
We just ate.

305
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,520
You two have plenty of time.

306
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,600
You should spend time alone together.

307
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,920
Great. Now that Brother Huo is here,

308
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,280
I feel much more at ease.

309
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,760
It's settled.

310
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,920
Rest assured.

311
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,040
Brother, when you see trucks like this,

312
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,920
have our guys approach them

313
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,040
and ask if they have silver carp.

314
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,520
If they do, negotiate the price

315
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,960
and we'll buy it all.

316
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,760
But we don't touch other fish.

317
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,680
Then,

318
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,800
we mark up the price a bit

319
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,130
and sell to the vendors.

320
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,780
Whatever they charge is their business.

321
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,760
Brother, just a little markup.

322
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,410
Let's not be too greedy.

323
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,080
Just enough for our efforts.

324
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
This job isn't difficult.

325
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,040
Of course not.

326
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,000
This job is perfect for you.

327
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,040
Within three months,

328
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,520
I think everyone,

329
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,240
will like you even more than they like me.

330
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,000
But if

331
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,930
there's any trouble in the market,

332
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,370
just help out if you can.

333
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,000
Let's go.

334
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,720
Where to?

335
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,960
Come on, brother.

336
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,600
Director, please take a look. Recently...

337
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,280
The attendance record at our factory

338
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,560
is quite good.

339
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,320
Apart from weddings, funerals, and sick leaves,

340
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,920
no one has taken any time off.

341
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,360
Even tardiness and leaving early

342
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,320
have been completely eliminated.

343
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,120
Our administrative staff

344
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,760
has also inspected the cleanliness of each office.

345
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,200
I must say, everything looks brand new.

346
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,520
Every office

347
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,120
is not only clean and tidy,

348
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,960
but also, shall we say, identical.

349
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,960
This 'identical'

350
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,960
seems like a negative term, doesn't it?

351
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,520
Director,

352
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,000
I actually think

353
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,760
that under your leadership,

354
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,760
the layout of each office

355
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,920
is now uniform

356
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,280
and well-organized.

357
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
In this context,

358
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,280
the term 'identical'

359
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,240
has become a compliment.

360
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,000
The meaning of this word

361
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,040
has changed because of you.

362
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,440
You're quite the smooth talker.

363
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,120
However,

364
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,160
Director, there are still some incorrigible people.

365
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,920
Who?

366
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,320
Young Cui.

367
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,360
You see,

368
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,840
you suspended him without cutting his pay.

369
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,100
You've been more than fair to him, right?

370
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,480
Guess what he's been doing?

371
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,600
Just tell me directly.

372
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,680
How would I know?

373
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,530
Night Club, you know it?

374
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,620
He's been there singing and dancing.

375
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,040
The way he dresses,

376
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,080
the way he dances,

377
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,280
I,

378
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,720
a grown man like me,

379
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,400
even I felt embarrassed.

380
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,240
Director,

381
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,960
there's a term

382
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,360
I'd like to ask you about.

383
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,800
This 'indecent behavior,'

384
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,280
does it describe men

385
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,440
or women?

386
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,600
It's usually used for women,

387
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,120
but if you want to use it for men...

388
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
There's nothing wrong with it.

389
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,600
Okay.

390
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,360
If you say it's fine,

391
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,520
then I'll use it.

392
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,640
Look at how they're dressed.

393
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,380
And the way they dance.

394
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,960
It's amazing.

395
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
And like this too.

396
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,420
Alright, alright.

397
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,810
Put your clothes on.

398
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,840
Director, I think he

399
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,120
is way too immoral.

400
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,720
I mean,

401
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,120
it would be one thing if it only affected him.

402
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,360
But everyone outside knows

403
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,920
he works at our factory.

404
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,930
He's damaging our factory's reputation, Director.

405
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,440
Do this:

406
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,440
Send someone from the administration office

407
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,720
and someone from security

408
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,960
as well.

409
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,040
Have them take turns following him

410
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,920
for a week

411
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,520
to see what he's really up to.

412
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,000
Write down everything.

413
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,680
Yes, sir.

414
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,240
Director,

415
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,160
I think

416
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,200
you're being too kind to him.

417
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,520
I'm not saying this because

418
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,880
I have some personal grudge against him.

419
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,960
I'm completely thinking about

420
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,600
our factory's interests.

421
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,920
After we document everything,

422
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
the consequences for him shouldn't just be

423
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,720
a simple suspension, right?

424
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,780
Like I need you to tell me that.

425
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,600
Oh, my big mouth.

426
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,930
Alright, Director, I'll let you get back to work.

427
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,500
Just this one award certificate?

428
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,960
Yes.

429
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,840
So far, this is the only one I have.

430
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,620
Crawling competition champion?

431
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,680
What kind of championship is that?

432
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,810
It's still a city-wide championship.

433
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,360
Try this.

434
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,960
I can't do it.

435
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,640
Let me eat some more.

436
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,680
It's nothing.

437
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,280
Dad, why did you wake me up so early?

438
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,520
I'm so sleepy.

439
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,570
You got into a fight the day I came back.

440
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,920
Those three were being unreasonable.

441
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,760
I did nothing wrong.

442
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,160
I'm not talking about right or wrong.

443
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,240
Who cares about reason when you're fighting?

444
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,500
When countries go to war with each other,

445
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,010
who do they reason with?

446
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,960
Let me ask you,

447
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,880
as a man,

448
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,000
who do you rely on to win?

449
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,280
What?

450
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,080
On myself, of course.

451
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,570
My uncle would work too.

452
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
I was standing there watching that day.

453
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,610
Why didn't I step in?

454
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,840
As a real man,

455
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,120
to win, you can't depend on anyone else.

456
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,320
You must rely on yourself. Understand?

457
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,880
First of all, those three guys

458
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,680
were fighting just me.

459
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,640
I couldn't handle it by myself.

460
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,440
Look at your size.

461
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,120
You're as big as three of them.

462
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,280
You could crush them just by falling on them.

463
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,960
Are you really my son?

464
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,120
Saying things like that.

465
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,100
I can't do this.

466
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,200
I need to eat.

467
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,040
Tiger climbs the mountain.

468
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,330
You're a tiger, not a pig. Climb again.

469
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,960
Again!

470
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,960
Once more!

471
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,330
Elbow to the center.

472
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,770
Steady your stance.

473
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,580
The warlord breaks the reins.

474
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,300
I not only met with the client,

475
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,200
but also

476
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,720
got some information from a police officer I know

477
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,160
and privately inquired about the situation.

478
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,680
Overall, this case

479
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,680
looks very unfavorable.

480
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,280
How so?

481
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,240
The victim disappeared on the evening of the 17th

482
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
until the early morning of the 18th.

483
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,000
Many witnesses saw

484
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Guo Dalei on the morning of the 18th

485
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,960
burning paper offerings by the river.

486
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,360
He was at the exact spot where the body was recovered

487
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,160
and threw away his boning knife.

488
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,920
Someone also saw him washing his hands by the river.

489
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,280
According to police analysis,

490
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,720
the killer is very professional

491
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,360
and someone who regularly uses knives.

492
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,640
If he's not a surgeon,

493
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,770
then he's a butcher.

494
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,040
His profile fits perfectly.

495
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,120
He was just recently detained

496
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,680
for visiting a massage parlor,

497
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,160
and the victim was a masseuse there.

498
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,960
If you were a police officer,

499
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,360
would you consider him a prime suspect?

500
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,840
It doesn't matter what I think.

501
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,440
No one actually witnessed him committing the murder, right?

502
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
My friend

503
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,960
is absolutely incapable of murder.

504
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,200
Please believe me.

505
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,680
I know him very well.

506
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,120
You might not know

507
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,240
your friend as well as you think.

508
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,560
He not only confessed at the police station,

509
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,320
but others in the detention center reported

510
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,960
that he admitted to the killing.

511
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,640
I definitely know

512
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,680
my friend better than you do.

513
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,320
At that time,

514
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,120
he wasn't in a good mental state.

515
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,960
I made a joke,

516
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,520
and he actually went to the riverbank

517
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,760
to find a fortune teller to break his bad luck.

518
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,560
Burning paper, throwing knives -

519
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,760
all of it was the fortune teller's idea.

520
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,690
Even if he confessed to the murder,

521
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,320
knowing him as I do,

522
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,040
he must have been afraid of being bullied in prison.

523
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,440
We need to work together.

524
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Let's try to stay positive.

525
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,400
Can we do that?

526
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,840
Unless you can find the real killer,

527
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,840
the police have

528
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,100
basically determined

529
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,080
it was him.

530
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,080
Let's be practical.

531
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,080
Let's fight this case properly

532
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,080
and try to get him a suspended death sentence.

533
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,360
No.

534
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,360
This is what I do.

535
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,400
If it were any other lawyer,

536
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,200
with his current situation,

537
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,600
he'd be facing the death penalty,

538
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
and immediate execution.

539
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,480
Hello?

540
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,400
Okay.

541
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,530
I'll be right there.

542
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,400
I really don't know what happened

543
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,560
to Huo Xiaoyang

544
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,920
over the past week.

545
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,680
Brother Cui, can you tell me?

546
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,120
I really want to know what

547
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,360
happened to him at school today.

548
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,760
Okay.

549
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,880
Let me tell you,

550
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,040
this kid Huo Xiaoyang

551
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,840
is actually very well-behaved normally.

552
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,920
Only when others bully him,

553
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,400
he never bullies anyone.

554
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,640
He's been bullying others.

555
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,600
Huo Xiaoyang not only bullies others himself,

556
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,080
he's also formed a gang called the Smile Gang,

557
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,080
and he's recruited

558
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,600
several normally well-behaved classmates.

559
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
They've been in six fights in just two days.

560
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,560
Three fights a day,

561
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,960
not missing a single one.

562
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,160
If I hadn't come to you,

563
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,040
he would probably soon break out of school

564
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,100
and start fighting in the community.

565
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,040
Howling Gang?

566
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,840
Which 'howling'?

567
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,960
The 'howling' from Howling Dog?

568
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,780
The 'smile' from smiling.

569
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,160
Sounds quite intimidating.

570
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,000
Which boss?

571
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,280
Brother,

572
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,840
you're letting him

573
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,370
study in this kind of environment?

574
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,080
Isn't this great?

575
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,210
Many great figures studied

576
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,800
in busy places.

577
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,680
It's to strengthen their willpower.

578
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,760
Does he need

579
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,640
this kind of willpower training?

580
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,240
Erpang, to become a man,

581
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,840
he needs to be tested.

582
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,400
Try this.

583
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,520
Can you

584
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,040
find him a bedroom?

585
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,080
Become a man.

586
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,520
There's space in the bedroom.

587
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,800
He can sleep here.

588
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,340
It's livelier inside.

589
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,500
What about the store downstairs?

590
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,640
He can't go out.

591
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,200
What if he learns bad habits?

592
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,000
He's already here.

593
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,760
You're still afraid he'll go out and be corrupted?

594
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,040
Everyone here

595
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,700
has been my brother for years.

596
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,340
Principled and loyal.

597
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,280
This is his uncle.

598
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,760
Say hello to your uncle.

599
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,040
Keep playing.

600
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,520
You know what?

601
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,800
Let him go out and learn bad habits for three years.

602
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,080
See if he can recognize

603
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,360
all these brothers of yours.

604
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,360
That's absolutely not acceptable.

605
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,760
These men have rankings.

606
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,880
A kid like him,

607
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,680
how could he possibly meet them?

608
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,800
Erpang,

609
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,100
pack your things. We're leaving.

610
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,080
I've troubled you for so many years.

611
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,360
How can I trouble you again?

612
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,290
It's no trouble.

613
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,840
Let's go, Erpang.

614
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,000
Don't go anywhere.

615
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,360
Just stay here with your father.

616
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,760
Come with me now.

617
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,680
Fine, you can go.

618
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,540
But if you leave, don't come back.

619
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,600
When we get home,

620
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,080
finish your remaining homework quickly

621
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,640
and then have your aunt check it.

622
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,700
I need to go to work.

623
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,920
Is my dad a bad person?

624
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,400
No.

625
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,000
He's not exactly bad,

626
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,400
but there might be bad people around him.

627
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,520
I think they're all nice.

628
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,080
They always buy me snacks.

629
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,520
Your teacher had a talk with me.

630
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
What did they say?

631
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,600
That you've improved in your studies

632
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,680
and get along well with classmates.

633
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,440
Really?

634
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
What do you think?

635
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,360
This is what happens when

636
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,240
you spend time with those 'nice people' around your dad.

637
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,080
Listen to me.

638
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,640
Until those bad people leave,

639
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,800
you can't go back there.

640
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,840
Do you understand?

641
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,880
Manager Cui is our

642
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,210
general manager of Dingqing Restaurant.

643
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,440
He has accompanied Dingqing

644
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,160
through

645
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,080
half a century of ups and downs.

646
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,680
He's also our Dingqing's

647
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,980
distinguished general manager.

648
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,560
Manager Tang,

649
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,440
please seek his guidance in the future.

650
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,900
Manager Cui is truly respected and admired.

651
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,040
Since I was a child, I dreamed

652
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,560
that if I could eat here just once a year,

653
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,600
how happy I would be.

654
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,080
I never imagined

655
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,120
that I would replace you

656
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,450
as the general manager.

657
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,840
I remember when I was little,

658
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,640
I would pass by Dingqing Restaurant every day,

659
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,600
just smelling the aroma

660
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,280
would make my mouth water.

661
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,080
A classmate of mine said

662
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,880
he had eaten a dish here

663
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,940
called Snow-Covered Red Bean Paste.

664
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,360
I was so envious.

665
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,000
He told me how

666
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,840
it was prepared.

667
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,240
But in the end,

668
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,500
I still didn't know what it actually was.

669
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,880
Until the 1980s,

670
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,080
when I had been working for several years,

671
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,320
I finally had

672
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,680
my first taste of Snow-Covered Red Bean Paste.

673
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,680
Guess how many I ate?

674
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,640
How many?

675
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,000
Eleven.

676
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,680
That's quite a lot.

677
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,640
Snow-Covered Red Bean Paste

678
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,880
is the entry-level dish for Dingqing's chefs.

679
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,840
It's also the first test for chef evaluation.

680
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,240
I see many restaurants nowadays

681
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,840
where apprentices become chefs

682
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,360
in just three or four years.

683
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,860
That's absolutely not acceptable here.

684
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,520
From apprentice to knife skills to chef,

685
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,600
even the smartest takes thirteen years.

686
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,840
Most importantly,

687
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,080
no matter how many chefs have changed,

688
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,320
the taste of Dingqing's dishes

689
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,520
has never declined.

690
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,280
That shows your excellent management.

691
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,320
I'm the second general manager of Dingqing.

692
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,760
The first general manager

693
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,920
was Old Mr. Zhang.

694
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,280
This restaurant

695
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,800
has been operating for almost a hundred years.

696
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,000
Now that this brand is in your hands,

697
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,480
I truly hope

698
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,840
you can make it a century-old establishment.

699
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,640
Don't worry, I absolutely will.

700
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,720
The ingredients and chefs are of utmost importance.

701
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,880
Let me take you to the kitchen.

702
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,000
It's about time now.

703
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,560
Let's taste the food together.

704
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,400
Please give us your valuable feedback.

705
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,840
This is our signature dish.

706
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,440
You must give it a good try.

707
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,640
I still don't know

708
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,440
what this Su Huang dish actually is.

709
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,680
It's actually just caramelized eggs.

710
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,200
This dish,

711
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,640
though it looks simple,

712
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,880
actually...

713
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,490
That crazy person making a mess outside earlier,

714
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,560
who is he?

715
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,240
He's talking about Ji Qiang.

716
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,240
That boy,

717
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,320
I heard in the early 80s,

718
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,040
he got into college,

719
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,720
but because of some family trouble,

720
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,320
he couldn't attend.

721
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,640
The poor kid's mind was traumatized.

722
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,200
What happened?

723
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,080
At first,

724
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,360
he would go to the few

725
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,240
state-owned restaurants in town

726
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,100
to lick plates,

727
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,800
occasionally helping illiterate people

728
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,640
write letters

729
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,640
to earn some food.

730
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,680
Later when things got better,

731
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,600
he started coming here specifically for leftovers.

732
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,640
He's quite peculiar.

733
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,160
He doesn't like meat,

734
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,600
he only eats vegetables.

735
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,520
So we just

736
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,800
take these leftover vegetables,

737
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,840
put them together

738
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,970
and give them to him.

739
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,600
Won't he being here

740
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,920
affect your business?

741
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,640
Not at all.

742
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,480
It doesn't affect us one bit.

743
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
Manager Tang,

744
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,080
you really need to agree to this.

745
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,520
Some leftover food

746
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
to give him a meal.

747
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,850
He's not a nuisance.

748
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
Life isn't easy.

749
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,720
Manager Cui has spoken,

750
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,160
I must agree.

751
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,720
Besides,

752
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,160
I wouldn't dare refuse anyway.

753
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,280
Wouldn't dare refuse?

754
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,840
What do you mean by that?

755
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,400
Your family members

756
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,360
are really too capable.

757
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,760
Talented in both civil and military arts.

758
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,800
Thankfully,

759
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,930
you only have one son and one daughter.

760
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,720
If you had ten children,

761
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,640
all the businesses in the world

762
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,700
would be monopolized by your family.

763
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,290
What do you mean?

764
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,640
Is your son-in-law

765
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,720
named Huo Dongfeng?

766
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,320
I suppose so.

767
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,520
You don't know?

768
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,880
Know what?

769
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,680
I haven't seen him for many years.

770
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,160
Is it true that recently

771
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,720
silver carp prices went up by 0.3 yuan per jin?

772
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,780
Yes, prices have gone up everywhere.

773
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,280
Now, throughout the city

774
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,400
and even the entire province,

775
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,560
all the silver carp

776
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,000
are processed by him,

777
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,090
making 0.3 yuan profit per jin,

778
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,010
and it all goes into his pocket.

779
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,040
Your son

780
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,120
is now at the biggest nightclub in our city

781
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,040
as their star performer.

782
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,080
That's why they say he's talented in every way.

783
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,280
Brother, eat up.

784
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,720
Thank you, Mengmeng.

785
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,760
That's wonderful, isn't it?

786
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,240
You should cherish your family.

787
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,160
Every day your brother spends here.

788
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,560
I've always cherished it.

789
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,000
Oh, really?

790
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,640
Well.

791
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,480
Come here.

792
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,280
Let me see how tall you've grown.

793
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,080
Not good enough.

794
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,240
You need to grow taller quickly.

795
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,080
Look.

796
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,810
You're still short.

797
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,760
By this much.

798
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
For the Xiali car.

799
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,480
For our family's Xiali car.

800
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,320
I need to grow taller quickly too.

801
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,180
Go do your homework after dinner.

802
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,700
Let's go outside and talk.

803
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,560
Talk, sure.

804
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,170
Put on your clothes.

805
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,200
What's wrong?

806
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,860
You've really been working hard lately.

807
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,320
Yes, as the head of this household,

808
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,640
I wanted to buy a Xiali car sooner.

809
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,880
Working night shifts at the factory every day.

810
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,330
It's exhausting when your days and nights are reversed.

811
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,460
I've been thinking...

812
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,780
Actually, you didn't really lie.

813
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,520
You said you work night shifts at a factory.

814
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,650
If we just rearrange these words a bit,

815
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,810
then it's not really deceiving me.

816
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,690
Because you do work at a nightclub.

817
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,020
So that's technically the truth.

818
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,280
Cui Guoming!

819
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,000
If you've got any guts, never come back!

820
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,120
You bastard!

821
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,760
Here, have some soup.

822
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Warm yourself up.

823
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,040
Got caught?

824
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,199
What? Got caught?

825
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,679
Her husband caught you?

826
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,760
Get out of here.

827
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,000
I just came from home.

828
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,320
We're both men.

829
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,780
You don't need to lie to me.

830
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,420
It's good that you managed to escape.

831
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,320
Where did Brother Huo go?

832
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,120
He went to a birthday party.

833
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,880
Give me...

834
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,080
Find me some of his clothes to try on.

835
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,680
What do you need them for?

836
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,720
Don't worry. You're at home now.

837
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,060
If her husband comes, I'll deal with him.

838
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,400
I came from home.

839
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,880
Just hurry up, will you?

840
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,360
Look at you, getting all stylish now.

841
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,280
Of course.

842
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,200
This is nice. Good color.

843
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,130
I've got to look presentable, bro.

844
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,530
The material is quite good.

845
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,600
Xiao Cui, let me tell you.

846
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,600
This isn't a big deal.

847
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,040
I really came from home.

848
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,120
Do you do this often?

849
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,740
If you don't tell me the truth,

850
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,480
how can I protect you?

851
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,520
Then you tell me the truth first.

852
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,440
Secret.

853
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,720
Do you have a crush on him?

854
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,480
Get out.

855
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,740
Purely professional relationship.

856
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,000
I think you two would make a good match.

857
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,520
When he performs on stage,

858
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,820
it's like watching someone welding.

859
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,360
There's something I don't understand.

860
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,960
Are you talking to me?

861
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,640
Do you think

862
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,960
you're good-looking?

863
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,680
Not bad. Why?

864
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,120
No, no.

865
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,920
That's not it.

866
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,420
You must think you're very handsome,

867
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,120
otherwise why would you

868
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,680
have your huge face

869
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
printed this big?

870
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,200
The photo is posted here.

871
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,320
Is this photo in color?

872
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,680
Yes.

873
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,200
But the only flaw is there's no blush on your cheeks.

874
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,240
Never mind that.

875
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,080
The photo I hang on the wall is in color.

876
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,840
When yours gets hung on the wall,

877
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,200
it will only be in black and white.

878
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,120
What do you mean?

879
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,450
What? You want to fight?

880
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,600
The welder.

881
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,890
Ms. Yang wants you to get in the car.

882
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,980
Miss Yang, what do you need me for?

883
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,040
It's getting late.

884
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,720
I'll take you home.

885
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,400
Okay, thanks.

886
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,200
Where do you live?

887
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,010
The machinery factory dormitory.

888
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,960
Is your wife at home?

889
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,080
Yes.

890
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,290
I heard you graduated from the Engineering University.

891
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,760
People like me who were terrible at school

892
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,960
really admire smart people like you.

893
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,680
I wouldn't call myself smart.

894
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,140
I just did well on the college entrance exam.

895
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,160
I've had a bit too much to drink tonight.

896
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,240
Is my face red?

897
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,440
No.

898
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,440
Erpang,

899
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,880
open the door!

900
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,280
Don't open it.

901
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,200
Not many people around today.

902
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,440
I thought you brought Erpang

903
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,440
with you.

904
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,160
It's fine to wait a couple more days.

905
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,600
I'll get everything set up for the guys,

906
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,760
then it'll be a good time for him to come.

907
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,160
What's going on with you?

908
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,160
My wife kicked me out.

909
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,690
I'm crashing here tonight.

910
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,360
Move over.

911
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,040
Let's get to work.

912
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,680
Move over. What work are you talking about?

913
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,600
Come over here, let's have a drink.

914
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,440
Good.

915
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,650
Women need to be coaxed,

916
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,530
and uncles need to be pampered.

917
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,880
Women need to be pampered,

918
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,680
and you're both coaxing and pampering your uncle.

919
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,240
You're asking me for money

920
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,570
because of this, right?

921
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,920
I took the lawyer's fee from home.

922
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,920
If I can't get it back,

923
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
my wife is going to fight with me.

924
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,000
Are you sure he didn't kill that person?

925
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,240
Definitely not.

926
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,680
This happened because I couldn't keep my mouth shut.

927
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,920
I saw his condition

928
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,800
and found a fortune teller

929
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,800
to give him some psychological comfort.

930
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,440
Otherwise, I was afraid something would happen to him.

931
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,160
And then this happened.

932
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,200
It's my responsibility.

933
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,500
About this matter,

934
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,600
if he didn't kill that person himself,

935
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,800
why would he confess?

936
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,360
He not only confessed,

937
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,320
he was afraid of being attacked in jail,

938
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,560
so he told everyone in there

939
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,680
that he did it.

940
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,000
What did the lawyer say?

941
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,040
The lawyer told me
