1
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
Li

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,720
Li Yang

3
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,040
Liu

4
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,820
I need to ask you a favor, brother.

5
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,560
Someday,

6
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,800
if I'm really gone,

7
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,479
please put me in this temple.

8
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,560
Then every day,

9
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,240
I can listen to Buddhist scriptures and such.

10
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,200
Maybe I'll be reincarnated sooner.

11
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,880
Okay?

12
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,720
Did you think about this

13
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,320
a long time ago or just now?

14
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,680
What's there to think about?

15
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,100
I just say whatever comes to mind.

16
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,480
I promise you.

17
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,079
Brother,

18
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,560
you'll always be my big brother.

19
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Brother,

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,130
just say the word if you need anything.

21
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,600
It's good not to be involved anymore.

22
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,660
I don't want to be in this life either.

23
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,240
Brother,

24
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,120
the guys

25
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,840
all came to see you

26
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,560
to get your decision.

27
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,280
Let's consider this matter settled.

28
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,800
Take the guys back first.

29
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,380
I still have work to do.

30
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,459
We're open now.

31
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,680
Everyone's welcome to come.

32
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,000
Brother,

33
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,320
I want to avenge our second brother.

34
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,120
The police already know about it.

35
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,580
Do we really need to seek revenge ourselves?

36
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,320
The police are the police,

37
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,880
and we are who we are.

38
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,409
Alright.

39
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,880
Everyone out.

40
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,690
Take a break.

41
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,159
Come on,

42
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,040
what are you trying to do?

43
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,560
I just want them to suffer

44
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,220
to avenge our second brother.

45
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,400
Who do you want to suffer?

46
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,530
Who do you think you are?

47
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,320
What are you thinking?

48
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,560
And all of you.

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,530
Don't you trust the police?

50
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,280
The police enforce the law.

51
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,940
If we kill someone, that's breaking the law.

52
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,280
So we're not avenging my second brother?

53
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,410
We can regularly visit the police station

54
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,970
to urge them to solve the case quickly.

55
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,600
Brother,

56
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,280
I came to you for guidance.

57
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,040
My second brother is gone.

58
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,040
From now on, we'll all follow you.

59
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,040
Okay.

60
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,280
I'm about to open my business.

61
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,810
You all can come work for me.

62
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,159
As bouncers?

63
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,320
What bouncers?

64
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,400
It's a legitimate restaurant.

65
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,600
No need for bouncers.

66
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,930
Then what will we do?

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,920
You'll be the manager.

68
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,840
The rest of you guys will start as waiters.

69
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,170
I guarantee the highest wages in the city.

70
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:56,960
No way.

71
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,200
Bro,

72
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,480
we're all gangsters.

73
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,920
You're a big shot.

74
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Working as a waiter? Where's your pride?

75
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,210
If you don't live properly, how can you have any dignity?

76
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,860
All of you, get out.

77
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,970
If you have any family issues in the future, just let me know.

78
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,930
It's on the house this time.

79
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,159
Brother,

80
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,760
listen to me.

81
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,840
You

82
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,940
should just focus on running the restaurant properly.

83
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,440
Don't get involved in street business.

84
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,690
Don't end up like me.

85
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,200
Sir,

86
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,000
you're back again.

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,520
Yes, yes.

88
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,200
Where's your wife?

89
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,080
I came alone.

90
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,360
Is that house still available?

91
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,120
Over the past period,

92
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,600
we've sold five more units.

93
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,040
I estimate in another two or three months,

94
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,240
all these houses will be sold out.

95
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,409
Two or three months?

96
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,280
If you think that's not enough time,

97
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,680
you could pay more deposit

98
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,600
and we can hold it longer for you.

99
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,800
That works.

100
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,120
How much deposit then?

101
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,800
50,000.

102
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,520
How long can you stay?

103
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,360
Six months.

104
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,800
Six months.

105
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,200
Take care and come again.

106
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,200
Be sure to wash it with warm water.

107
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,000
Thank you.

108
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,440
What are you thinking about?

109
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,120
That day you were so lazy,

110
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,400
you wouldn't even move an inch.

111
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Do you believe it?

112
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,800
Those three big bags of clothes you have

113
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,000
might not be worth as much as my stamps.

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Your stamps and phone cards are just pieces of paper

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,920
or cheap plastic pieces.

116
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,160
How could they be worth anything?

117
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,040
Look at you.

118
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,920
Do you even know what stamp speculation is?

119
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,200
What's stamp speculation?

120
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,860
I know about

121
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,160
stir-frying food, seeds, and peanuts.

122
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,800
But what's stamp speculation?

123
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,200
You wouldn't understand even if I told you.

124
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,840
Right now in Shanghai,

125
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,080
the stamp market is really hot.

126
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,320
There's

127
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,520
the Luwan Stamp Market.

128
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,640
I'm planning in a few days

129
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,400
when I go to Guangdong for inventory,

130
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,720
to stop by

131
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,120
and check out the market.

132
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,480
How can you keep hustling

133
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,120
with so much energy?

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,360
For our villa, of course!

135
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,520
Just now

136
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,000
Just now

137
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,840
I went to take another look at our villa.

138
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,640
Stop.

139
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,080
Whose villa?

140
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,720
Ours.

141
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,260
Within six months,

142
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,720
it will be ours.

143
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,360
I can't believe you dare make such promises.

144
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,560
Why wouldn't I say it?

145
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,680
I wasn't very successful before

146
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,600
because I had bad luck.

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,200
But my direction

148
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,480
There's never been any problem.

149
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,240
Do you admit it?

150
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,720
I've been thinking

151
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,440
about all these ventures you've been messing with for the past two years.

152
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,200
I even miss

153
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,640
the days when you wrote novels,

154
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,640
set up chess stalls, and sang songs.

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,680
At least those businesses had no costs.

156
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,160
People came just for you.

157
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,240
And you didn't lose money.

158
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,280
Why don't you and Erpang

159
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,040
go back to setting up stalls on weekends?

160
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,200
Or singing would be fine too.

161
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,400
I'll come support you

162
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,480
and bring you flowers or something, okay?

163
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,880
Please show some respect

164
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,280
when talking to a wealthy businessman.

165
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,400
Don't always be like this.

166
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,260
Am I not respectful enough to you?

167
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,960
As for singing,

168
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,000
that's not possible anymore.

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,680
The karaoke place has already been leased out

170
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,760
to Erpang's father for a restaurant.

171
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,330
Do you think Erpang's father can behave himself?

172
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,880
He's not a bad person,

173
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,540
he just likes to use his fists.

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,840
What if he gets into fights again?

175
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,080
He absolutely won't.

176
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,240
He's too old for that now.

177
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,320
People change, you know.

178
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:58,960
Uncle.

179
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,800
Yes?

180
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,080
The teacher wants you to come to school.

181
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
I have good news

182
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,960
and bad news.

183
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,440
Let me hear the bad news first.

184
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,100
Huo Xiaoyang is at the bottom of the class again.

185
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,480
That's not bad news.

186
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,610
That's just normal.

187
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,560
Is there anything worse?

188
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,520
That's all.

189
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,920
There's also good news.

190
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,440
Okay.

191
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,040
Guo Xiaoxue got

192
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,680
ninth place in the midterm exam.

193
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,140
Really?

194
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,600
I'm just confused.

195
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,160
Huo Xiaoyang and Guo Xiaoxue

196
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,480
study together every day.

197
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
Why is it that

198
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,640
Guo Xiaoxue has made such great progress

199
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,040
while Huo Xiaoyang hasn't improved at all?

200
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,640
I've reflected on this too.

201
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,560
I've been using one teaching method,

202
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,020
but I overlooked that people are different.

203
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,720
Let's tailor our teaching to each student.

204
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,520
From now on,

205
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,440
regarding Huo Xiaoyang's grades,

206
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,840
please don't call me anymore.

207
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,080
Call his father instead.

208
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,520
That works.

209
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,320
Just came out.

210
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,200
You...

211
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,280
Look.

212
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,280
Your family are all celebrities.

213
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,440
But I hope

214
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,640
if Huo Xiaoyang becomes famous one day,

215
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,240
it should be for something good.

216
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,520
This is amazing!

217
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,240
Am I dreaming?

218
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,780
This is not a dream.

219
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,440
This place

220
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,880
will be our future home.

221
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,520
It will soon become reality.

222
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,920
But on one condition:

223
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,520
each of you must

224
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,920
improve your ranking by five places.

225
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,720
Well,

226
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,800
Xiaoxue might actually be able to do it.

227
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,520
But

228
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,490
if my brother were here,

229
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,560
this would be even less realistic than a dream.

230
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,280
He wouldn't even dare to dream

231
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,360
about improving his ranking by five places.

232
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,560
Can you imagine that?

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,080
Anyway, in dreams,

234
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,240
what is there to be afraid of?

235
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,970
It's not like it's a nightmare.

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,080
I won't give you any water.

237
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,200
You're always laughing.

238
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,400
Where's my Xiali car?

239
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,600
Dreams come in stages.

240
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,330
Our dream used to be a Xiali car.

241
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,280
Now,

242
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,480
our dream

243
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,600
is this villa.

244
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,080
That's amazing!

245
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,720
Then my dog

246
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,000
will have a kennel to live in.

247
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,800
Mengmeng,

248
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,130
can your pigeons

249
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,920
be kept outside too?

250
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,600
Back then, stamps

251
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,120
were considered collectibles in big cities.

252
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,480
The prices rose accordingly.

253
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,880
My uncle, with his judgment and foresight,

254
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,320
also spotted a good opportunity to make money.

255
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,680
But some things

256
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,320
are destined to happen.

257
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,040
How much will you pay for this one?

258
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,360
How much do you want to sell it for?

259
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,090
How much are you willing to pay?

260
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,040
3,000 yuan.

261
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,080
How much?

262
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,720
3,300 yuan.

263
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,680
That's my final offer.

264
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,280
It was only 2,800 last week.

265
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,740
Go ask other dealers if you don't believe me.

266
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,720
Let me think about it.

267
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,600
Hey, Guoming.

268
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,680
The stamps I bought before leaving have tripled in value.

269
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Do you have time to go to the post office

270
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,010
and check the current price of our stamps?

271
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,520
Hello?

272
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,240
Who's going to watch the store if I go?

273
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,320
Where are you anyway?

274
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,360
I'm in Shanghai.

275
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,060
Why did you go to Shanghai?

276
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,600
Aren't you supposed to be getting supplies in Guangdong?

277
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,000
I've already finished getting supplies.

278
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,460
I'm just passing through.

279
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,000
That's enough.

280
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,400
Quit while you're ahead.

281
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,120
Just sell them quickly

282
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,400
and be happy with the profit.

283
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,120
Come back soon.

284
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,480
I'm exhausted running the place alone.

285
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,120
I miss you.

286
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,200
My offer is the highest you'll get around here.

287
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,800
Excuse me.

288
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,760
2,500.

289
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,680
Would 3,500 work?

290
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,410
Final offer.

291
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,520
3,400 yuan.

292
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,420
I'll sell you six sets for 3,500 each.

293
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,240
You're an expert!

294
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,640
I've met a real professional today.

295
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,520
How much for these?

296
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,480
4,000 yuan. No negotiation.

297
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,520
Not a penny less.

298
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,860
I'll take them all.

299
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,340
Let me get my money.

300
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,320
You...

301
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,040
4,000.

302
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,360
You're good.

303
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
You have a good eye, beautiful lady.

304
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,130
Is the villa still far away?

305
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,880
This money came too quickly.

306
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,840
We could make easy money

307
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,570
but instead we're chasing the complicated kind.

308
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,880
Xiaoxue's father's case is going to trial.

309
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,200
What?

310
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,760
You are?

311
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,480
Good morning.

312
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,280
Good morning.

313
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,500
Come in.

314
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,770
Hello, Director Zhang.

315
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,080
I'm here to seek justice.

316
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,880
Who are you?

317
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,920
I'm from outside.

318
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,560
I'm here to file a complaint.

319
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,440
A complaint.

320
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,040
How did you get in?

321
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,920
I walked in.

322
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,920
You walked in.

323
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,480
Complaints are filed at court.

324
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,080
You need to go through proper channels.

325
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,640
Yes.

326
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,000
Liu.

327
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,080
No.

328
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,800
Director, please hear me out.

329
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,480
Liu.

330
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,360
Wait a moment.

331
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,000
Wait a moment. No.

332
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,440
Director, I have documents here.

333
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,900
Please take a look at them.

334
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,320
What's wrong with security?

335
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,920
I'm sorry.

336
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,600
Sir, please leave.

337
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,800
I understand.

338
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,320
Please look at these documents.

339
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,600
Okay.

340
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,480
I know, it's not...

341
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,400
Don't disturb the director's work, sir.

342
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,000
Director, please take a look.

343
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,320
Please look at these documents.

344
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,960
Wait.

345
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,160
I think I've seen this case before.

346
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,690
Have you?

347
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,320
What's your relationship with this person?

348
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,960
High school classmates.

349
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,880
He's my buddy.

350
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,680
This appeal document is written

351
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,520
quite professionally.

352
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,980
I took the bar exam before.

353
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,640
You didn't pass?

354
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,440
I passed.

355
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,680
But for other reasons,

356
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,810
I didn't get my professional license.

357
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,000
Why was that?

358
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,960
Well, I... um...

359
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,490
I was selling pinhole glasses.

360
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,480
Your surname is Cui.

361
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,280
Cui Guoming.

362
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,760
I...

363
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,620
Yes, that's me.

364
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,440
I know

365
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,200
an unlicensed lawyer

366
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,680
sneaked into our court

367
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,080
and knocked on my door claiming injustice.

368
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,320
Is this legitimate?

369
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,000
It's not legitimate.

370
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,040
I may not be credible,

371
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,840
you can say whatever you want about me,

372
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,720
but my materials

373
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
are absolutely solid and reliable.

374
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,400
We won't

375
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,860
wrong an innocent person.

376
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,520
Fine, leave it here.

377
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,319
I'll take a good look at it later.

378
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,560
Please don't wait.

379
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,160
Please take a good look at it now.

380
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,720
This wrongful case is truly unjust.

381
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,680
Whether it's a wrongful case or not

382
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,480
isn't determined by your words.

383
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,960
The court values

384
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,400
facts and evidence.

385
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,240
Yes, yes.

386
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,040
I understand.

387
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
Let me tell you something else.

388
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,079
If you come again in the future,

389
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,800
you must follow the proper procedures.

390
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,960
Understood.

391
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,660
Sorry for the trouble.

392
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,320
Please take a look at this urgently.

393
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,480
It's quite urgent.

394
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,760
I really appreciate your help.

395
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,920
Thank you.

396
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,560
Congratulations on your opening!

397
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,820
Congratulations on your grand opening!

398
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,140
Congratulations!

399
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,560
May your business prosper!

400
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,200
Best wishes for your business!

401
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,520
Try our dishes!

402
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,200
Brother!

403
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,560
Coming!

404
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,400
May your business flourish, brother!

405
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,160
What gift should I bring?

406
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,760
We're all tight on money.

407
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,220
Just showing up is enough.

408
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Hey guys!

409
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,560
No matter how tight your budget is,

410
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,720
you still need to bring a gift for brother's opening.

411
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,240
Let's go.

412
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,160
Where to?

413
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,330
The biggest and best private room.

414
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,360
Hurry up.

415
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,290
The four of you can drink together.

416
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,440
Brother!

417
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,240
Don't take the main seat. Sit down.

418
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,500
Sit down, make yourselves comfortable.

419
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,280
We're all family here.

420
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,160
Don't be shy, drink up!

421
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,680
Good.

422
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,320
Take care of them.

423
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,840
Alright.

424
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,920
I'll come back to toast with you later.

425
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,520
Sure thing, brother!

426
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,280
Make yourselves at home!

427
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,720
Please, carry on with your work.

428
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,120
Such a nice private room.

429
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,800
Why did Boss save it for us?

430
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,600
Why not save it for

431
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,280
the officials or VIP guests?

432
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,240
Are you really that stupid?

433
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,880
Or just pretending to be?

434
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,880
Boss is afraid we'd

435
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,760
sit outside

436
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,120
and scare those VIP officials.

437
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,680
But since we're brothers,

438
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,940
he can't lose face.

439
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,400
He can't just make us

440
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,880
sit in some corner.

441
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,800
So he had to give

442
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,860
this big room to us.

443
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,760
What else could it be?

444
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,250
Boss really quit the business?

445
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,760
He really did quit.

446
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:58,840
Make yourselves at home.

447
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,240
Hello.

448
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,180
Come, sit down.

449
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
This is...

450
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,280
So Huo Dongfeng's restaurant is opening today?

451
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,680
Yes.

452
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,280
You are...

453
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,160
Come in.

454
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,050
What gift did you bring?

455
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,020
Officer Zhang.

456
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,290
I'm already touched

457
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,760
that you came.

458
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,840
To be honest,

459
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,320
this is my first time attending

460
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,480
a former inmate's celebration.

461
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,960
Have you really reformed?

462
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,640
Sir,

463
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,640
I have.

464
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,160
If you've reformed, then keep it that way.

465
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,120
Your rehabilitation

466
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,680
gives me a sense of achievement too.

467
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,200
If you get into trouble again...

468
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,320
I won't be so nice to you.

469
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,720
Sir, I've definitely reformed.

470
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,400
Then I'll definitely accept this. I...

471
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,680
Control your temper

472
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,440
and stay away from those troublemakers

473
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,040
you used to hang around with.

474
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,360
I'll be going now.

475
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,480
Come have a drink inside.

476
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,940
Come in and eat something.

477
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,880
Sir!

478
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,200
I won't let you down.

479
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,640
Thank you.

480
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,080
Thank you, leaders.

481
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,920
Thank you, honored guests,

482
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,600
my friends and family of many years.

483
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,360
Thank you all for coming

484
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,320
to the opening of Youyicun Restaurant.

485
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,120
Thank you.

486
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,100
Do you have your father's speech?

487
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,120
No, I don't.

488
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,520
It's lost.

489
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,840
I told you not to drink so much soda.

490
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,040
In the blink of an eye,

491
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,800
I'm over forty now.

492
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,280
I want

493
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,080
to say goodbye

494
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,810
to the old Huo Dongfeng.

495
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,160
The old Huo Dongfeng was violent

496
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,160
and never did anything legitimate.

497
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,570
That person is gone now.

498
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,580
The man standing before you today

499
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,040
is honest

500
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,560
and runs a legitimate business.

501
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,000
Good!

502
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,680
The fact that I could

503
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,960
open Youyicun Restaurant today...

504
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,120
I must thank my good brother Ermei.

505
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,080
But he couldn't be here today.

506
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,760
The better I run this restaurant,

507
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,640
the more I honor my brother Ermei.

508
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,520
Come.

509
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,040
Let's raise our glasses

510
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,600
to my good brother

511
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,640
Ermei.

512
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,240
Ermei,

513
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,320
you're watching from heaven.

514
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,760
Trust me,

515
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,240
give me all the money in the house

516
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,250
so I can buy stamps and phone cards.

517
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,360
We'll make money soon.

518
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,280
Let's just make a little like last time.

519
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,960
This money is coming too fast.

520
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,320
I don't feel right about it.

521
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,120
Stamps and IC cards are going up in price every day.

522
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,250
Don't pull at it.

523
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,240
Times are changing rapidly.

524
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,280
We must keep up with the times.

525
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Ten years ago,

526
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,040
who would have thought

527
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,040
that people trading stocks

528
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,400
could become rich?

529
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,360
I don't feel like I'm falling behind the times.

530
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,960
I just feel I can't keep up with you.

531
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,480
Why?

532
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
Singing at nightclubs,

533
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,600
pinhole glasses,

534
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,240
making multi-speed bicycles,

535
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,170
border trading,

536
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,600
now dealing in stamps,

537
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,480
phone cards...

538
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,140
What else do you want to do?

539
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,680
I want to buy a villa

540
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,680
for our children.

541
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,680
Old Zhang across the hall is selling his place.

542
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,400
We could buy his house.

543
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,120
I want our children to have that villa.

544
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,720
I want it, I want it, I want it.

545
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,400
I promised the children.

546
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,920
Do you really have to do

547
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,960
that thing where you call the dog

548
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,040
before you've even finished your business?

549
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,160
You have to trust me.

550
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,960
This time,

551
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,800
I will definitely make money.

552
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,360
The stamp market is booming right now.

553
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,000
Our stamps worth 1,000 yuan

554
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,800
will be worth 2,000 in Shanghai.

555
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,200
In just one week,

556
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,530
we can double our money.

557
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
Why are you always thinking about

558
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,560
these get-rich-quick schemes?

559
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,720
Well...

560
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,440
What era are you living in?

561
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,320
Why are you still using those old terms?

562
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,880
These days, the bold get rich

563
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,120
and the timid starve.

564
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,160
I'm timid,

565
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,980
but I haven't starved yet.

566
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,720
Let me put it this way.

567
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,650
All these years,

568
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,170
have I ever cheated you?

569
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,120
No.

570
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,400
Give me 50,000.

571
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,600
In one week,

572
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,180
I'll return 60,000 to you.

573
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,400
I don't want a penny of interest.

574
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,640
When the time comes,

575
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,240
just pay back the principal.

576
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,480
This money

577
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,520
is everything I've earned from my shop in the past two years.

578
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,560
Use it sparingly.

579
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,880
I'll definitely make big money.

580
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,960
Be frugal with it.

581
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,880
I want to buy everything.

582
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,360
Then name your price.

583
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,200
According to today's market price,

584
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,400
it would be about 230,000.

585
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,160
To be honest though,

586
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,520
I've bought too much inventory lately.

587
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,480
I don't have that much cash anymore.

588
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,560
But I have an apartment nearby.

589
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
Let's make this quick.

590
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,560
I'll give you this apartment,

591
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,080
you sell all these to me,

592
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,160
and you're guaranteed to profit.

593
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,560
I'm from Northeast China.

594
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,200
What would I do with

595
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,960
your Shanghai apartment?

596
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,560
Your apartment

597
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,160
will only increase in value.

598
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,000
I offer

599
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,440
240,000

600
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,800
and will pay the deposit immediately.

601
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,200
I offer 250,000.

602
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,240
Alright, everyone, please stop arguing.

603
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,320
Listen to me.

604
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,240
I'm not selling today.

605
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,440
The time

606
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,170
isn't right.

607
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,200
Boss, boss!

608
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,480
Please talk with me again.

609
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,960
Don't put them away, boss.

610
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,240
Let's talk some more.

611
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,640
Boss!

612
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,500
I was only in there for half a year.

613
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,640
Now it's been changed into a restaurant.

614
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,840
Did the former owner Yang go south?

615
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,240
Huo Dongfeng runs it now.

616
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,000
Let's go.

617
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,080
Let's go in and see what's happening.

618
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,610
Let's go.

619
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,520
Come on, brothers.

620
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,520
Is there wine in the cups?

621
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,600
Yes.

622
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,860
With Brother Tao here,

623
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,240
drink all you want.

624
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,600
Cheers.

625
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,320
Alright.

626
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,040
Bottoms up.

627
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,890
Brother.

628
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,090
We ordered so much food.

629
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,240
Do we have money to pay for it?

630
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,040
No.

631
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,960
Then what do we do?

632
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,360
This is Huo Dongfeng's restaurant.

633
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,890
So what about Huo Dongfeng?

634
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:06,920
We'll put it on credit.

635
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,880
He's an old-school gangster,

636
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,520
Er Mei's former boss.

637
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,250
You better think this through.

638
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,640
Changmao.

639
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,560
In this business,

640
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,240
we need one famous battle to make our name.

641
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,840
Why bother with small fry?

642
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,680
If we're going to do it, let's go big.

643
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,770
Isn't he the Three Heroes of Dalin?

644
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,460
Isn't he Er Mei's big brother?

645
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,120
He's exactly who we're after.

646
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,560
Let me tell you something.

647
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,720
If we take him down,

648
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,650
we'll be famous.

649
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,740
Isn't this our chance?

650
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,400
Yes.

651
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,920
What if he agrees to let us have credit?

652
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,880
Are you stupid?

653
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,940
Then we'll come every day.

654
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,760
Once word gets around

655
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,970
that we've got him under our thumb,

656
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,760
we won't need to fire a single shot

657
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,200
and we'll still be famous.

658
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,120
Right, Brother Tao.

659
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,560
We brothers will follow your lead.

660
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,480
We'll go after the boss.

661
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,760
What can Huo Dongfeng do about it anyway?

662
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,280
Let's get him. Come on.

663
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,360
Brothers, pour the drinks.

664
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,960
To our boss! To our boss!

665
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,520
Cheers.

666
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,920
Take care.

667
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,440
Miss,

668
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,740
how much is my bill?

669
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,000
832.

670
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,880
Alright,

671
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,740
put it on my tab.

672
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,240
I'm sorry,

673
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,520
I don't know you

674
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,680
and I'm not authorized to approve tabs.

675
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,120
Well,

676
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,040
please wait a moment.

677
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,240
I'll get our manager.

678
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,880
Fine,

679
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,200
go ahead.

680
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,320
Keep an eye on them.

681
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,360
Mr. Huo,

682
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,700
it's like this.

683
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,880
Some customers want to put their bill on a tab.

684
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,480
Could you come over, please?

685
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,560
Just a moment.

686
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,720
Please wait a bit.

687
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,640
No problem.

688
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,120
How old are you, miss?

689
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,920
I'm 21.

690
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,500
Where are you from?

691
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,360
I'm local.

692
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,080
Which district?

693
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,120
If we stay close to each other

694
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
with so many people hunting wolves.

695
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,890
Excuse me, coming through.

696
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,800
Who wants to run a tab?

697
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,080
Sir.

698
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,780
Let me see the bill.

699
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,680
832.

700
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,120
You want to put it on a tab?

701
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,480
Boss Huo.

702
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,080
I've heard so much about you.

703
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,360
Who are you?

704
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,450
My name is Datao.

705
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,480
I'm a generation younger than you.

706
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,080
You must know my big brother,

707
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,660
Old Mingzi from Longshan.

708
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,220
Old Mingzi?

709
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,760
Yes, I know him.

710
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,320
The one with the limp?

711
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,290
Didn't he pass away a couple years ago?

712
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,280
Yes, my brother is gone.

713
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,580
So the brothers have to rely on me now.

714
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,040
I just got out.

715
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,340
Don't have much money.

716
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,720
When I have money later,

717
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,080
I'll settle it all at once.

718
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,210
Just put it on my tab.

719
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,420
I've heard a lot about you in the streets.

720
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,120
Mr. Huo is a man of honor.

721
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,560
We're all part of the same world.

722
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,560
You can't refuse this small favor, right?

723
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,520
You all work for him?

724
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,200
Yes.

725
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,530
Being a boss isn't easy.

726
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,570
Just chewing a toothpick doesn't make you a boss.

727
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,840
Like Brother Fa.

728
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,330
Put it on his tab.

729
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,250
Okay.

730
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,410
Don't see me out.

731
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,760
Thank you, Mr. Huo.

732
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,640
Buddy,

733
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,240
isn't he deliberately trying to skip out on his bill?

734
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,440
Of course he is.

735
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,080
Who wears a big gold chain and asks for credit?

736
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,800
So you're just letting him go like that?

737
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,240
What else can I do?

738
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,120
Fight him!

739
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,600
I'm telling you, this punk

740
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,200
is just asking for a beating.

741
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,000
Listen, brother,

742
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,560
next time I see him,

743
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
I'll destroy him.

744
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,160
Calm down.

745
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,450
Business has been good lately.

746
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,740
Lots of customers too.

747
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,040
Mr. Liu, you've been working hard.

748
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,320
What's hard about what I do?

749
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,720
I just worry you're not comfortable.

750
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,400
How could I not be comfortable?

751
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,680
I'm always comfortable working with you.

752
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,320
Didn't you always want to get a mountain?

753
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,850
Have you found one you like?

754
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,120
Yes, I have.

755
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,000
There's a mountain next to my house

756
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,920
that's available for contract now.

757
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,720
How much?

758
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,360
Five yuan per acre.

759
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,290
It's quite reasonable.

760
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,400
Look, if you lease it for decades,

761
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,000
it's less than 20,000 yuan.

762
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,200
I'll give you 20,000 then,

763
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,330
and you get it for me.

764
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:43,960
Wait.

765
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,560
Brother Huo, are you planning to let me go?

766
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,340
Is my work not good enough?

767
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,480
Or what did I do wrong?

768
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,840
You've done too well.

769
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,040
It's just that your strength

770
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,560
can't be put to good use here.

771
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,040
These are all delicate tasks.

772
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,200
I think working in the mountains

773
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,880
would let you show your real abilities.

774
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,010
You should go work in those mountains.

775
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,200
In about a month,

776
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,320
come back and see me.

777
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,720
Wouldn't that be better?

778
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,600
No.

779
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,080
You've already helped me so much.

780
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,639
How could I have the nerve to take your money?

781
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,570
I'll pay 10,000.

782
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,080
No.

783
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,480
That won't do.

784
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,880
We'll split it fifty-fifty.

785
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,480
Look.

786
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,199
No, you can't do this.

787
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,159
The two of us

788
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,480
can go to your mountains

789
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,440
hunt some rabbits.

790
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,239
It'll be fun.

791
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,199
But I still can't take your money.

792
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,080
Pay attention.

793
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,400
Right.

794
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,730
I need to borrow that 10,000 from you first

795
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,219
because my money is tied up in stamps.

796
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,560
Why don't you ask your father for it?

797
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,960
In a few days

798
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,320
I'll bring my father here, okay?

799
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,360
That would be great.

800
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,219
I can ask him for 10,000 in person.

801
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,880
If that's how it's going to be

802
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,280
then he won't come at all.

803
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,920
That's not what I meant.

804
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,480
I'm just afraid he won't come.

805
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,040
Then you'll have to work hard.

806
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,159
So I need to perform well?

807
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:47,800
Exactly.

808
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,920
What else can I do to perform well?

809
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,120
Hurry up and give that 20,000 to Mr. Liu.

810
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,320
By the time Mengmeng grows this tall,

811
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,320
we'll be able to move into our villa.

812
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,440
Finally fulfilling our child's dream,

813
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,440
and our dream too.

814
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,720
I'm going to Shanghai in 10 days.

815
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,480
This trip to Shanghai,

816
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,800
you just wandered around

817
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,530
and didn't sell a single stamp.

818
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,560
I can't sell them.

819
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,730
The prices are rising too fast.

820
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,440
If we sell one day earlier,

821
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,770
we'll make less profit.

822
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,300
Is it really that profitable?

823
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,200
You know,

824
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,400
you can't go without reading books or newspapers.

825
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,760
I'm minding the store every day.

826
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,640
When do I have time to read newspapers?

827
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,520
This time,

828
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,920
I plan to raise more money

829
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
to go to Shanghai.

830
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,560
Make a fortune in one go.

831
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,320
Good.

832
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,040
Master.

833
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,500
Chef Zhang is here.

834
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,800
Come and have a toast.

835
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,960
Zhang, come here.

836
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,290
This food is delicious.

837
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:43,840
This is my...

838
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,720
Good.

839
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,680
Zhang.

840
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,120
Zhang Er.

841
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,040
Your

842
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,120
cooking skills have improved greatly.

843
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,400
The appearance, aroma,

844
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,440
and taste are all excellent.

845
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,080
This deserves at least 90 points,

846
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,000
don't you think?

847
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,520
It's just the thickening sauce

848
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,480
that could be a bit better.

849
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,360
It's always been your weakness.

850
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,240
No, Dad.

851
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,560
He brought a good bottle of wine to pay his respects to you.

852
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,000
Your professional habit is acting up again, critiquing others.

853
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,080
It's fine.

854
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,560
Whenever you give me advice, Master,

855
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,640
it's my honor.

856
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,320
Master?

857
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,580
I'm giving him advice.

858
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,560
Is there a problem?

859
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,290
Is this good?

860
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,520
He's been with me since he was 17.

861
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,760
Do you have a problem with me giving him some criticism?

862
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,560
No, I don't.

863
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,800
Zhang.

864
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,760
Keep up the good work.

865
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,120
Yes.

866
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:35,920
Look,

867
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,560
of course.

868
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,480
This is our own business, right?

869
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,010
I'll definitely work hard.

870
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:47,760
It's delicious.

871
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,690
Get back to work.

872
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,760
Take your time eating,

873
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,360
okay.

874
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,960
I need to go cook more dishes.

875
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,480
I'm here.

876
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,380
How much did you pour? What are you doing?

877
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,680
Erpang, move aside.

878
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,480
It's fine.

879
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,280
Uncle.

880
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,360
Erpang.

881
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,440
Uncle.

882
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,520
It's been a long time. This drink is for you.

883
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,480
Thank you for all your hard work over the years.

884
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,000
I don't know how to thank you.

885
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,920
Please, eat.

886
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,200
This...

887
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
Please accept it.

888
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,360
Keep it for yourself.

889
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,480
I won't take it.

890
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,640
I heard that

891
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,960
since you got out

892
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,450
you haven't gotten into

893
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,000
any fights for months.

894
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,180
Not only no fights,

895
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,800
I haven't even lost my temper with anyone.

896
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,930
I can vouch for that.

897
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,360
I am

898
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,440
Erpang's grandfather.

899
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,960
How we take care of him

900
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,240
is only natural.

901
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,000
But Erpang

902
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,280
is growing up.

903
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,200
You need to be more reliable.

904
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,460
If you continue to be unreliable,

905
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,280
you're not just

906
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,400
being irresponsible to yourself,

907
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,680
but also to Erpang.

908
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,920
Before, it was my fault.

909
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,120
You'll see what I can do.

910
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,400
I remember your birthday is next month.

911
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
Please keep this.

912
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,200
Dad.

913
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,720
This is a gift from me.

914
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,760
Please accept it.

915
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,770
Alright.

916
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,640
My birthday is next month.

917
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,960
If you don't cause any more trouble,

918
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,420
I'll accept it.

919
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,480
Alright.

920
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,280
That's no problem at all.

921
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,000
No problem.

922
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,260
Brother, take it easy.

923
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,740
You still need to greet other guests.

924
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,840
Uncle, I toast to you.

925
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,120
Bottoms up again.

926
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,920
Take your time.

927
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,120
Please eat more.

928
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,120
Here, take it.

929
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,080
This...

930
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,400
Keep this for now.

931
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,400
Dad.

932
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,880
For your birthday,

933
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,740
let's hold the celebration here.

934
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,840
How about that?

935
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,760
We'll have it right here.

936
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,560
I'll make all the arrangements.

937
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,120
Good. Eat more.

938
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,920
He definitely won't cause trouble anymore.

939
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
Look at him now,

940
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,660
he's so well-behaved.

941
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,770
Come on, Grandpa, get in my car.

942
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,920
You've had too much to drink.

943
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,860
Grandpa, please get in first.

944
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,640
You're too heavy.

945
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,320
Bro.

946
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,440
Try to help a little bit yourself.

947
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,040
Okay.

948
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,440
Take it slow.

949
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,280
It's fine.

950
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,880
It's okay, brother-in-law.

951
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,600
Let's go. Alright.

952
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,160
Let's go. Alright.

953
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:21,810
Take it slow.

954
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,280
Doesn't your boss know everything?

955
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,120
Thanks for your support.

956
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,840
Mr. Huo, come.

957
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,920
I'm broke.

958
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,720
You don't dare, sister. Tell me.

959
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,370
Running a tab again?

960
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,840
I'm used to it.

961
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,280
You're too generous to your buddies.

962
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
In just one month,

963
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,730
you've run a tab over ten times.

964
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,130
I've let you run tabs all this time,

965
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,940
never asked you for money.

966
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,120
You come here to run a tab yourself,

967
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,280
you order three or four tables,

968
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,410
and still on credit.

969
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,440
Isn't that a bit inappropriate?

970
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,530
No. What are you saying?

971
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,720
Let me see the bill.

972
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,130
Let's forget about the previous tabs,

973
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,840
but don't come back anymore.

974
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,940
That's it then.

975
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,120
Wait. Come back.

976
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,220
What's the matter?

977
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,200
I just owe you some money.

978
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,120
I told you I'll pay when I have it.

979
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,250
You think I can't afford it?

980
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,880
I'm sure you can pay.

981
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,460
I'm afraid I can't afford to give credit.
