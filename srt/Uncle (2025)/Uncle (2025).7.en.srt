1
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
Li

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,720
Li Yang.

3
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,040
Liu.

4
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:37,920
What the hell?

5
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,759
Brother, what are you doing here?

6
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,020
Do you know how to play?

7
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Yes, that's fine.

8
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,250
Let's go.

9
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,120
I understand.

10
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,860
You're here to avenge him?

11
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,640
He's such an honest person.

12
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,040
Why did you mess with him?

13
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,200
Look at how you people are dressed.

14
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,280
You must be wanderers too, right?

15
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,760
Since we're all wanderers...

16
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
You should know the rules of the game.

17
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,840
Always leave someone a way out.

18
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,840
So you can face each other in the future.

19
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,079
But this guy...

20
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,880
He had to take everything from me.

21
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,200
Left me with just a lone king and still beat me.

22
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,840
Isn't he just picking a fight?

23
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,960
Right? Was it you?

24
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,570
Was it you or not?

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,060
Come, sit down.

26
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,800
Your chess skills are terrible.

27
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,260
Who can you blame for that?

28
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,360
Did you hit him?

29
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,960
Yeah, so what?

30
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,000
Apologize to him.

31
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,160
Pay for his medical expenses and it's over.

32
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,200
I haven't laid a hand on you yet.

33
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,760
Don't you understand what's going on?

34
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,000
Look at these guys standing behind you.

35
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
What a mess they are.

36
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,930
What a state they're in.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,079
I just heard all that crashing noise.

38
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,740
Did you come bouncing in here?

39
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,079
What if I actually

40
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,000
beat you guys up for real?

41
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,520
If you go to the police

42
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,050
and get that so-called forensic assessment,

43
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,200
I couldn't explain

44
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,160
which of your injuries I caused.

45
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,840
I've taken photos

46
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,880
of his injuries.

47
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,840
If he gets any more injuries,

48
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,280
then you're the one who did it.

49
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,880
You're asking for it, buddy.

50
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,080
My new camera is coming in handy.

51
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,720
Let me take another shot.

52
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,650
I need evidence.

53
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,280
I'll deal with you later.

54
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,840
Look at you two, one with a cracked head.

55
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,960
One with a limp.

56
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,760
So this is the

57
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
crippled one, right?

58
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,530
My name is Huo Dongfeng.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,440
What did he say?

60
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,240
He said his name is Huo Dongfeng.

61
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,040
The leader of the Three Heroes of Dalin,

62
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,160
Huo Dongfeng.

63
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,400
Didn't you just get out?

64
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,600
A little over a month.

65
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,080
Then you're really something.

66
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,840
Really. But now that we've met,

67
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,720
you haven't been out long either.

68
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,320
To be honest,

69
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,250
I don't have many days left myself.

70
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,600
See this?

71
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,200
My intestines

72
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,280
got badly damaged in a fight.

73
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,560
Western doctors said I wouldn't survive.

74
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,440
My family

75
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,760
found a quack doctor

76
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,360
who replaced them with dog intestines.

77
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,490
Since I don't have long to live anyway,

78
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,600
why should I care who you are?

79
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:03,840
Try that again.

80
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,080
The way you talk

81
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,210
is really annoying.

82
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,920
You look like a howling dog

83
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,650
and your yapping hurts my ears.

84
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,760
Let's not waste time

85
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,960
with this nonsense.

86
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Just tell me the truth,

87
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,920
why did you come looking for me today?

88
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,080
For a fight, right?

89
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,920
So what now?

90
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,840
Just these few people?

91
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,370
Should I wait for you to call reinforcements?

92
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,400
Let me say something.

93
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,360
Um...

94
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,960
Are you going to film him?

95
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,040
Could you do that again first?

96
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,960
Better to have evidence.

97
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,360
Keep some proof.

98
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,620
You're worse than him.

99
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,200
No, I think we can all reach an agreement, right?

100
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,600
You set up this chess game

101
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,480
to resolve this peacefully.

102
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,920
There's no need to get physical.

103
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,980
It's unnecessary.

104
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,360
Let's

105
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,320
play a round,

106
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,159
shall we?

107
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,560
Are you blind?

108
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,680
Can't you see what's going on?

109
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,080
This has nothing to do with chess now.

110
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,200
Besides, when two cats are fighting,

111
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,720
what business does a rat like you have trying to mediate?

112
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,560
Get lost.

113
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,760
Let me summarize briefly.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,840
Today we fought

115
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
a perfect, beautiful victory.

116
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,040
Right. First, in terms of teamwork,

117
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,240
with my brother and me leading,

118
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,720
That's right.

119
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,360
My brother kicked him,

120
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,280
and I immediately followed with my fist.

121
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,000
That Gouchang was completely defenseless.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,880
Two quick hits.

123
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,840
He couldn't even touch us.

124
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,520
Right.

125
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,120
This Gouchang,

126
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,240
looks like a barking hound.

127
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,840
I didn't even want to bother with him.

128
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,040
If it wasn't for you,

129
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
I would have walked away.

130
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,570
My brother didn't even want to beat him up.

131
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,560
Weren't you doing it for Erpang?

132
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,280
I...

133
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,840
For Erpang,

134
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,240
right?

135
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,240
Erpang.

136
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,640
Let me tell you,

137
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,000
Erpang himself

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,240
could have solved this problem on his own.

139
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
You're bleeding.

140
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,000
It's nothing.

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,120
Let's go to the hospital.

142
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,780
To the hospital? The same one from this morning?

143
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,860
The one from this morning.

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,760
Huo.

145
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,000
Huo, you're here.

146
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,900
Here for another inspection?

147
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,880
So you all know each other?

148
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,000
My brother used to come here once a week.

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,880
He's already a VIP customer here.

150
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,120
Haven't you heard the rumor?

151
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,000
Anyone my brother brings in for treating injuries

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,260
gets him a commission.

153
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Take it easy, bro.

154
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,120
Huo.

155
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,240
Haven't seen you in ages.

156
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
Were you out of town or locked up?

157
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,200
Huo, I'd say we're destined to meet.

158
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,840
My first night shift after graduating

159
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,880
was operating on you.

160
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,280
Right here, remember?

161
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,400
You were quite a fighter.

162
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,720
Stop talking.

163
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,520
Please.

164
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,650
Or I'll do it myself.

165
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,880
Now you want me to talk, but I'm done.

166
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,720
All finished.

167
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,400
Erpang,

168
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,720
call your uncle on the pager.

169
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,240
Don't call him.

170
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,920
I'm going home now.

171
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,440
I don't want to see him.

172
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,920
Seeing him will only make me upset.

173
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,040
Dad, don't be angry.

174
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,640
It's my fault for not keeping him in line.

175
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,370
This has nothing to do with you.

176
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,680
I've been looking after him for over 30 years

177
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,320
and couldn't set him straight.

178
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,799
He's been like this since he was little.

179
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,880
Always thinking the grass is greener elsewhere.

180
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,640
Never sticks with anything.

181
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,440
But he wasn't always

182
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,760
this desperate for money.

183
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,880
What's wrong with him?

184
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,039
Who knows.

185
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,920
Grandpa.

186
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,160
He saw that

187
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,760
Mengmeng's classmates all have Xiali cars.

188
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,040
He wants one too.

189
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,520
My uncle is so talented,

190
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,400
why doesn't he have money?

191
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,400
Your uncle's problem is

192
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,980
not that he lacks ability,

193
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,970
but that he has too many abilities.

194
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,240
A father knows his son best.

195
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,000
I can tell you

196
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,330
that in his entire life,

197
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,000
he'll never make much money.

198
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,440
Today,

199
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,280
my uncle and I made over 100 yuan

200
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,410
in just over an hour.

201
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,370
If someone hadn't interfered,

202
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,250
we could have made at least 800.

203
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,760
You're becoming more and more like your uncle.

204
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,880
That wasn't a compliment.

205
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
I meant you're becoming unreliable,

206
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,040
just like your uncle.

207
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,240
I think my uncle is great.

208
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,250
Whether he's good or not

209
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,820
remains to be seen.

210
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,640
My uncle just wants to help others.

211
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,120
He should help himself first. I'm leaving.

212
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,920
Dad.

213
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,000
Grandpa, let me walk you out.

214
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,800
No need.

215
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,640
If he continues to be this unreliable,

216
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,960
you should come back to my house.

217
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,380
I may not take perfect care of you,

218
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
but at least I won't lead you astray.

219
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:01,920
Right?

220
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,760
Better than following him

221
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,700
and picking up his bad habits.

222
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
Call him quickly.

223
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,920
Dad.

224
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,040
Man,

225
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,440
what an amazing day.

226
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,800
Hang out with us,

227
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,240
and we guarantee every day will be amazing.

228
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:27,920
Right?

229
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,640
Yes,

230
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,240
my day has been amazing enough.

231
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,680
I'm going home to my wife.

232
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,320
Please take me home.

233
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
What home?

234
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,920
We have to go sing karaoke

235
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
and have some drinks.

236
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,680
What drinks?

237
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,640
You just got stitches and you want to go drinking?

238
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,280
What does drinking have to do with getting stitches?

239
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,760
We've all been busy all day.

240
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,640
Let's relax.

241
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
No, no.

242
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,520
You guys go relax.

243
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,380
I'm going home.

244
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,400
Cut the nonsense.

245
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,040
Don't you know we've spent the whole day for you?

246
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,680
Besides, we all know you sing well.

247
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,120
We're just waiting to hear you sing.

248
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
As the saying goes,

249
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,680
there's no time like the present.

250
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,640
So it's settled.

251
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,920
Let's go.

252
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,160
Why don't you head back first?

253
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,120
What do you mean?

254
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,760
Aren't you just messing with me?

255
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,560
I don't get it.

256
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,160
Drive faster.

257
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,840
Did you call your uncle earlier?

258
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
No.

259
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,160
Call him

260
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,040
and tell him to come back.

261
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,640
Should I scare Uncle a bit?

262
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,200
Just leave him a message.

263
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,960
Say it's getting late

264
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,730
and he should come home.

265
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,720
Okay.

266
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,520
Brother,

267
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,920
do you really know

268
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,010
so many people at the hospital?

269
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,740
Well, they are important clients after all.

270
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,880
So if we go to the hospital in the future,

271
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,680
will mentioning your name help?

272
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,970
It'll definitely work in surgery,

273
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,840
but not necessarily in other departments.

274
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,000
My wife wants me to go home.

275
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,800
Brother, I really have to leave.

276
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,040
You shouldn't...

277
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
You shouldn't...

278
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,000
It's okay to turn back even after falling into a trap.

279
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,480
Uncle,

280
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,360
Erpang's uncle, thank you

281
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,130
for taking care of Erpang all these years.

282
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,800
From now on, leave it to me.

283
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,160
You shouldn't...

284
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,000
Eight things you shouldn't do...

285
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,320
You shouldn't...

286
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,960
surrender to fate.

287
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,120
I won't take back my tears,

288
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,600
you shouldn't have backed yourself into a corner.

289
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,040
Nine things you shouldn't do,

290
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,320
ten things you shouldn't do, most of all,

291
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,920
I still love you deeply.

292
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,250
After I finish singing,

293
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,120
I'll go with you.

294
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,960
Come to me soon.

295
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,440
The path of love has both bitterness and sweetness.

296
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,320
I just hope soon

297
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,840
you'll come after me.

298
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,560
Come.

299
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,240
Erpang.

300
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,280
I did it.

301
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,880
I admit it.

302
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,040
Even though Old Huo is an old friend,

303
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,880
who do you think you're fooling?

304
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,560
Who do you think you're fooling?

305
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,000
There's one more thing.

306
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,440
You expect us to believe you did all this alone?

307
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:13,880
Who would believe that?

308
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,280
They didn't do anything.

309
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,800
Who would believe that?

310
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,840
Really, they didn't do anything.

311
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,500
Hurry up. Back to the station.

312
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,480
And you guys too.

313
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,600
Come on, hurry up.

314
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,120
Let's go. Take them away.

315
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,960
Hurry up.

316
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,200
Everyone move faster.

317
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,200
Wait, I...

318
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,480
Don't waste time.

319
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,280
Hurry up.

320
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,560
This was Uncle's first time

321
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,360
in a detention center in 33 years.

322
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,760
At first, he seemed a bit lost.

323
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,840
Squat down.

324
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,960
Donglin - Look.

325
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,540
Donglin ~ Look.

326
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,680
What brings you here?

327
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,520
Got into a fight.

328
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Not bad.

329
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,810
Wouldn't have guessed. Who'd you fight with?

330
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,880
Someone called Dog Gut.

331
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,280
Dog Gut?

332
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,000
Did you win or lose?

333
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,280
I guess I won.

334
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,960
Don't bullshit me.

335
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,480
Dog Gut is a real tough guy.

336
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,560
Look at you.

337
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,040
No way you could fight him.

338
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,600
I had a friend who helped me.

339
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,840
Huo Dongfeng.

340
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,480
The badass Huo Dongfeng?

341
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,560
One of the Three Heroes of Dalin?

342
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,280
So he's your friend?

343
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,480
Sit down.

344
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,520
It's normal. All newcomers have to be tested.

345
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,280
Get used to the place.

346
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,320
Right?

347
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,040
But I think you're

348
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,760
quite likable and not annoying.

349
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,010
Especially since you're Huo Dongfeng's friend.

350
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,560
You can sleep here.

351
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,880
Hello, we're from Tuanjie Road Police Station.

352
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
We'd like to ask you some questions.

353
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,560
Go ahead.

354
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,960
Is Cui Guoming an employee at your factory?

355
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,560
Yes,

356
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,520
he works in the technical department.

357
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,760
Does he have

358
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,160
any criminal record or misconduct at work?

359
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,360
Oh, there's plenty.

360
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,480
Let me tell you.

361
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,080
He's currently suspended for reflection.

362
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,120
Tell me more.

363
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,570
For example?

364
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,080
He's often late and leaves early,

365
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,380
slacks off at work,

366
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,760
and frequently abandons his post without permission.

367
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,280
Also,

368
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,250
last month he was just publicly criticized by us.

369
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,800
Anything else?

370
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,800
Yes,

371
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,730
he's got all kinds of problems.

372
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,880
For instance, his office is a complete mess,

373
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,500
with pictures of scantily-clad women posted everywhere.

374
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,760
These aren't considered criminal records outside the workplace.

375
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,800
Has he been involved in any gang fights,

376
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,329
theft, fraud, or other criminal activities?

377
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,180
No, not really.

378
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,300
He doesn't have the guts for that anyway.

379
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,480
Alright, I think we've got what we need.

380
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,040
Thank you.

381
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,600
Wait, don't hang up!

382
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,600
Could you tell me

383
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,680
what he's actually done?

384
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,320
I'll owe you this money for now.

385
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,080
Director, guess what happened to Cui Guoming?

386
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,040
What are you saying?

387
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,680
Speak up.

388
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,010
There's nobody around.

389
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,800
Guess what happened to Cui Guoming?

390
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,760
Why are you shouting? Always asking me to guess.

391
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,240
I'm not a riddle solver.

392
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,840
Yes.

393
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,200
No.

394
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,800
What is it? Just tell me.

395
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Cui Guoming...

396
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,520
He's been arrested by the police.

397
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,360
Why was he arrested?

398
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,490
What did he do wrong?

399
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,880
Let me explain everything slowly.

400
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,800
Yesterday morning...

401
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,880
he took a chubby kid

402
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,840
to set up a chess stall in the park.

403
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,280
Then he got into a fight with a thug.

404
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,040
He lost the fight.

405
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,080
Then he went to the hospital.

406
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,660
Guess what happened next?

407
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
No guessing. I won't guess.

408
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,040
He called Huo Dongfeng.

409
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,800
Not only Huo Dongfeng,

410
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,780
but also several other thugs.

411
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,280
They were driving

412
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,680
that old van of theirs,

413
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,280
going around and around,

414
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,800
driving in circles,

415
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,280
until they finally ended up at the police station.

416
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,280
No, actually they

417
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,800
went to a barbecue restaurant

418
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,080
and found that thug.

419
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,880
Then they got into a fierce fight.

420
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
The police came.

421
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,800
Then they all ran away in a flash.

422
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,040
Guess where they went next?

423
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,440
I won't guess.

424
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,280
No guessing. They went to a KTV.

425
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,520
The police were at the KTV entrance

426
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,320
and found their old van again,

427
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,040
then arrested all of them.

428
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,410
What happened next?

429
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,480
At the detention center,

430
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,880
they just verified with me

431
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
about his situation at our factory.

432
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,560
He's really a troublemaker.

433
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,600
Are you done with your report?

434
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,440
Yes,

435
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,120
get out.

436
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,040
I'll let you get back to work.

437
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,280
Get out now!

438
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
The higher-ups are now requiring us

439
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,120
to reduce staff.

440
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,680
Indeed, there's no other way.

441
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,320
Our factory

442
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,780
hasn't been doing well these past few years.

443
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,440
But we have tens of thousands of employees in this factory.

444
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,080
Many of them

445
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,560
have worked for our factory for decades,

446
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,080
old colleagues and veteran workers.

447
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,280
Who should be laid off

448
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,680
and who should stay?

449
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,400
I think we

450
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,060
definitely need to have clear criteria.

451
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
My suggestion is:

452
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,040
First,

453
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,560
those who don't work seriously.

454
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,000
Second,

455
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,760
those with poor work and professional skills.

456
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,680
Third,

457
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,280
redundant staff

458
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,660
in non-essential positions.

459
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,000
Please share your opinions too.

460
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,600
That's right.

461
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,120
We should have clear guidelines

462
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,380
about who gets laid off

463
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,120
and who stays.

464
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,240
Yes.

465
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,240
For those colleagues who will be laid off,

466
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,060
we also have a severance package based on years of service.

467
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,480
I'll say it again:

468
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,960
Who exactly gets laid off

469
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,480
will be decided democratically.

470
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,520
What are you looking at?

471
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,040
I...

472
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,720
You stole my bun

473
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,520
and now you're acting innocent?

474
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,440
We're eating here.

475
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,960
What's going on?

476
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,360
Who is it? Bring him over.

477
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,560
Boss, he hit me.

478
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,960
I...

479
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,840
I...

480
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,320
You dare hit anyone?

481
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,880
Just for a fight?

482
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,080
I thought you came specifically to help me escape.

483
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,940
You really think highly of me.

484
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,040
I've known you for decades

485
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,120
and never thought you'd become a big shot in here.

486
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,040
Well done.

487
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,480
Your finest hour, huh?

488
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,610
Just ask if they respect me now.

489
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,800
I heard

490
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,080
you've been bragging to everyone that you actually killed someone.

491
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,840
They're easy to fool.

492
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,880
It's not like they're the police or prosecutors. Just talk big.

493
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,520
Do you realize

494
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,520
some people in here want to earn merit

495
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,040
and will report you?

496
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,960
Everything you say can be used as evidence.

497
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
That's what the lawyer said.

498
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,200
I'm saying it. I've been studying law recently.

499
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,720
I know you didn't kill anyone.

500
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,320
I didn't kill anyone!

501
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,320
Do I have the guts?

502
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,580
Forget about killing,

503
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,280
when the police interrogate me lately,

504
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,480
I get scared just answering their questions.

505
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,360
Every time they ask, I confess.

506
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,280
Whatever they ask, I admit to it.

507
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,520
After confessing, I can always recant the next day.

508
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,650
Don't be too clever.

509
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,320
Listen to me. If you didn't kill anyone,

510
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
stop bragging about it everywhere.

511
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,000
Okay.

512
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,720
I'll hang in there.

513
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,520
How are my father and daughter

514
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,520
doing outside?

515
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,960
What will happen to them?

516
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,520
Don't worry, I'm here.

517
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,010
I'll take good care of them.

518
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,720
A while ago,

519
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,850
I found you a lawyer.

520
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,580
Not very reliable.

521
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,680
Next,

522
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,040
I'll find you a trustworthy lawyer.

523
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,050
Where will you find one?

524
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,930
You'll see when the time comes.

525
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,720
Cui Guoming!

526
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,640
They called you.

527
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,120
Here.

528
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,080
Come out.

529
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,880
Yes.

530
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,280
Hey, what about

531
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,280
Huo Dongfeng? He's not out?

532
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,840
I heard he won't be out anytime soon.

533
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,010
He was only out for three months

534
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,560
and kept getting into fights.

535
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,960
There's a crackdown now.

536
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,000
With his

537
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,600
long criminal record,

538
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,600
he'll probably get sent to labor camp.

539
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,660
Labor camp is only two or three years.

540
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,560
That's not too bad.

541
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,800
Labor camp is acceptable.

542
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,200
Labor camp isn't so bad.

543
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,760
Then go ahead.

544
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,760
No.

545
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,200
Dad.

546
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,080
Guoming.

547
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,720
Dajian.

548
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
You came here to supervise the work?

549
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,800
Just experiencing life.

550
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,440
I got into a fight.

551
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You lost, didn't you?

552
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,040
No way.

553
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,400
When have I ever lost?

554
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,680
If you won, why do you look so beaten up?

555
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,930
What would you look like if you'd lost?

556
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,440
Terrible. They even replaced my intestines with a dog's.

557
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,320
Yeah, right.

558
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,960
What are you doing here?

559
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,570
I'm picking someone up.

560
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,720
You're organizing again?

561
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,400
Organizing what?

562
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,560
Prostitution.

563
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,850
You're disgusting.

564
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,780
What are you laughing at? I'm talking to you.

565
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,000
Come play with me.

566
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,700
Who wants to play with you?

567
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,640
Here.

568
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,520
Food's ready.

569
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,440
Thank you.

570
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,040
Eat slowly.

571
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,520
Can you really get this hungry after just 20 hours?

572
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,800
I was eating well in there.

573
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,680
All those police officers know me.

574
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,880
They've seen me on TV.

575
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,120
I ate whatever they ate.

576
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,050
They almost served me alcohol too.

577
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,440
When are you

578
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,770
planning to go back to work at the factory?

579
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,800
Didn't they suspend me?

580
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,440
The factory manager wants to make things difficult for me.

581
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,560
I'll just wait and see.

582
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,680
The manager.

583
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,480
How did they give you a hard time?

584
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,520
I think the factory director was merciful enough to you.

585
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,520
If I were the director, I would have fired you already.

586
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,340
It wouldn't go that far, would it?

587
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,560
Why wouldn't it?

588
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,240
Are you just waiting for

589
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,170
the factory to beg you to come back?

590
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,240
What else can I do?

591
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,900
And then you just mess around.

592
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,840
You're over 30 years old

593
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,700
and you've ended up in detention.

594
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,880
What kind of person is Huo Dongfeng?

595
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,280
How could you hang out with him?

596
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,560
Dad, he's not a bad person.

597
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
So the government

598
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,960
just wrongfully accuses innocent people?

599
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,200
He's been in labor reform so many times

600
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,160
he's spent more time inside than outside.

601
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,970
Go ahead and keep hanging out with him.

602
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,320
I won't, I won't.

603
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,250
I'll stay away from him from now on.

604
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,480
During those 20 hours inside,

605
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,280
I've already planned my future.

606
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
Let's hear it.

607
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,720
I want to become a lawyer.

608
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,130
You want to become a lawyer?

609
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,760
Have you ever studied law for even one day?

610
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I studied for two days

611
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,660
learning criminal law at Huo Dongfeng's place.

612
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,700
Look at the place you chose

613
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,800
and the teacher you found.

614
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,780
It's because I know the law

615
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,680
that this time when I went in,

616
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,760
I got out so quickly.

617
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,220
I discussed the law with them,

618
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,250
and they saw I knew my stuff,

619
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,080
so they said, 'Fine,

620
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,960
you can go.'

621
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,720
So that's why they released you?

622
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,160
Then I really misunderstood, Dad.

623
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,840
I thought we paid a 2,000 yuan fine

624
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,970
to get him released.

625
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,960
If that's the case,

626
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,280
let's ask for our money back.

627
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,160
If you know the law so well,

628
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,080
why did we need to pay anything?

629
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,760
Right?

630
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,400
No way.

631
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,720
What are you doing?

632
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,520
Why are you getting so worked up?

633
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,440
You don't understand the law.

634
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,480
That 2,000 yuan had to be paid.

635
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,760
I just meant that by discussing the law with them,

636
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,520
my release went more smoothly.

637
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,680
That's what I meant.

638
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,760
You still want money?

639
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,050
I've been thinking carefully.

640
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,440
In my current profession,

641
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,000
I've hit a bottleneck.

642
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,800
I can't advance any further,

643
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,700
so I might as well change careers.

644
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,240
Dad.

645
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,800
Why are you shaking your leg?

646
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,160
He's just full. It's nothing.

647
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,800
Hurry up and eat.

648
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,080
We'll go home after dinner.

649
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,160
Give me 100 yuan.

650
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,480
What do you need money for?

651
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,080
To buy books for the bar exam.

652
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,400
You're really going to take it?

653
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,080
Of course, we've known each other for over ten years.

654
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,280
Although sometimes I'm really

655
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,740
not... not very reliable.

656
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,200
But my learning ability,

657
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,480
you know it well, right?

658
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
If I want to learn something,

659
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,810
I'll definitely master it and excel at it.

660
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,800
Just 100 yuan.

661
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,280
I won't ask for a penny more.

662
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,140
Give me a break.

663
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,060
I won't give you a single cent.

664
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,640
If you don't give it to me,

665
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,560
then I'll have to beg you.

666
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,280
Go ahead.

667
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,010
I'll kneel down for you.

668
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,440
Fine. How much?

669
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,560
100. Stop playing dumb.

670
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,800
Is Dalei inside?

671
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,800
He's doing fine.

672
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,760
Don't worry. Nobody's hurting him.

673
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,170
Everything's good.

674
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,560
And another thing,

675
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,760
we need to trust in the justice system.

676
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,880
The real culprit

677
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,540
will be found sooner or later.

678
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,880
Also,

679
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,960
I'm studying law now.

680
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,890
When the time comes,

681
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,760
I can personally defend Dalei.

682
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,720
So please don't worry.

683
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,800
It's all right, uncle.

684
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,400
Didn't I give you over 1,000 yuan?

685
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,600
Why are you eating such plain food?

686
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,160
Uncle.

687
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,600
I'm here for you.

688
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,280
Don't worry.

689
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,320
Xiaoxue.

690
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,010
No rush. Eat slowly.

691
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,760
Whenever you're hungry in the future,

692
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,800
just come here.

693
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,200
Order whatever you want.

694
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,970
Your father is definitely not a murderer.

695
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,930
He will surely be released.

696
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,600
No, no.

697
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,480
Eat slowly.

698
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,000
Child,

699
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,200
I'll pay for you.

700
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,180
Take your time.

701
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,120
Remember this girl.

702
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,960
Whatever she orders when she comes here,

703
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,080
make sure she gets plenty of good food.

704
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,240
Just put it on my tab.

705
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,080
Um,

706
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,760
is she that buddy of yours' daughter?

707
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,040
Yes, that's right.

708
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,720
The one you sent kidneys and chives to.

709
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,240
How is he now?

710
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,320
As you said,

711
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,320
he's back in jail.

712
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,240
What a shame.

713
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,360
That thing about the advertisement,

714
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,080
I didn't see the interview.

715
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,400
This time,

716
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,060
he's suspected of murder.

717
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,520
The verdict won't come quickly,

718
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,400
and he won't be released soon either.

719
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:57,680
Eat.

720
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,240
Did he kill someone after eating those kidneys?

721
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,440
The next day.

722
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,760
It has nothing to do with my kidneys, right?

723
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,840
Hard to say.

724
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,320
This stuff takes time to digest,

725
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,640
you know, and then it kicks in.

726
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,760
Are you saying my...

727
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,600
Let's drop this topic.

728
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,530
But don't worry.

729
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,320
He definitely didn't eat your kidneys for nothing.

730
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,080
He is

731
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,010
a man of his word.

732
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,380
Let's not advertise that.

733
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,840
I heard you're performing a solo dance on New Year's Day.

734
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,360
Get out.

735
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,040
I absolutely have to show off.

736
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,320
I've studied dance for six years

737
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,520
and still don't dare to perform solo.

738
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,600
How do you dare?

739
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,520
Even if I had studied seriously for one day.

740
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,850
My uncle never studied law for a single day

741
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,160
but he's still taking the bar exam.

742
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,040
My dad taking the bar exam

743
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,440
doesn't have to perform in public.

744
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,760
You're just making a fool of yourself in public.

745
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,880
When you shake like that,

746
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,800
the flesh on your cheeks

747
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,160
will jiggle for ages.

748
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,800
That's what gives it rhythm and impact.

749
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,200
I'm begging you,

750
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,520
please don't dance.

751
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Many of my classmates

752
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,040
already know you're my cousin.

753
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,880
If you really dance,

754
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,160
how am I supposed to live with that?

755
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,360
You'll live with dignity because of me.

756
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,320
Well then,

757
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,760
show me a dance first.

758
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,400
I haven't learned it yet.

759
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,260
Then what are you dancing for?

760
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,040
You have to believe in my potential.

761
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,160
When pushed to the limit,

762
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,240
I can do anything.

763
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,080
Even if you were pushed to death,

764
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,010
could you solve this math problem?

765
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,440
I support you, Erpang.

766
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,840
Snow weighs down bamboo branches,

767
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,300
bending them near the mud.

768
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,160
But when the sun rises,

769
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,900
they stand tall again, reaching the sky.

770
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,020
Your current hardship

771
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,360
doesn't mean you'll struggle forever.

772
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,240
Don't forget when you were little,

773
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,240
you won the crawling championship.

774
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,240
Keep going.

775
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,610
Everyone, be quiet now.

776
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,720
Thank you for your hard work.

777
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,880
If it weren't for you,

778
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,280
how could I

779
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,440
have arranged a meeting with the factory director?

780
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,600
It's not hard to invite him for a meal.

781
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,880
But

782
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,800
why do you want to see him?

783
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,200
It's about

784
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,360
my son, Cui Guoming.

785
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,360
Guoming?

786
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,530
He's known for being smart.

787
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,200
Everyone knows

788
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
he was a good student when he was young.

789
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,660
Didn't he go to the Engineering University?

790
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,480
What could be wrong with him?

791
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,360
Nothing serious.

792
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,520
He's just not steady enough,

793
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,440
always has too many ideas.

794
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,920
When the old factory director was around,

795
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,480
he was pampered and spoiled,

796
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,000
and life was decent.

797
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,880
But when the new director arrived,

798
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,080
how could he tolerate someone like him?

799
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,480
He's been suspended for self-reflection now.

800
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,060
But I've talked to him.

801
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,680
He'll work properly from now on.

802
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,800
When the director comes,

803
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,880
please put in a good word for him.

804
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,680
We've been friends for decades.

805
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,760
I'll certainly do my best.

806
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,200
Good.

807
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,360
Sir,

808
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,940
I'm late for a meeting.

809
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,280
And you're treating me to a meal.

810
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,240
This is really too kind of you.

811
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,480
I've always wanted to treat you to dinner

812
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,360
to thank you for all these years

813
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,360
of mentoring me.

814
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,040
Let me introduce you.

815
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,320
This is General Manager Cui from Dingqing Restaurant.

816
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,719
Former general manager.

817
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,840
I just retired.

818
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,560
I've heard so much about you.

819
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,840
Please, have a seat.

820
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,400
Sit down.

821
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:26,560
Okay.

822
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,280
Come.

823
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,880
Have a seat.

824
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,120
Please sit down.

825
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,179
Please take a seat.

826
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,280
Sit down.

827
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,560
Alright.

828
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,280
You've just taken office recently.

829
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,679
Must be quite busy.

830
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,239
Don't even mention it, sir.

831
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,770
I've got a heap of problems.

832
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,120
The company has been

833
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,520
losing money for 4 years.

834
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,000
The higher-ups want us to cut staff.

835
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,000
I just arrived

836
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,360
and immediately face this thankless task.

837
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,690
What am I supposed to do?

838
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,840
So layoffs have reached your factory now.

839
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,760
That's right.

840
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,760
We're the first to face it.

841
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,840
Our factory's revenue is average,

842
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,320
but we have the most employees in the city.

843
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,380
Tens of thousands.

844
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,320
That's tens of thousands of families.

845
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,880
I just arrived

846
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,440
and they make me do this.

847
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,800
It's definitely not easy.

848
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,200
I also want to use this opportunity

849
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,730
to reorganize the factory.

850
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,320
For example, our factory

851
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,600
has a troublemaker.

852
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,700
He never takes his job seriously.

853
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,280
Always coming in late or leaving early.

854
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,120
And the office?

855
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,920
He's turned it into a complete mess.

856
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,360
You put him on suspension,

857
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,000
and what does he do? Goes to nightclubs to sing.

858
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,640
And that's not all.

859
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,760
He spends all his time

860
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,520
hanging out with those shady characters

861
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,840
and even gets into fights.

862
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,360
Yes.

863
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,280
Didn't he get into a fight

864
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,400
and end up at the police station a few days ago?

865
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,200
That's right.

866
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,480
Someone like him,

867
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,880
if he doesn't get laid off, who should?

868
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,280
Right. If we don't lay off someone like him,

869
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,940
everyone will be furious.

870
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,380
This person's surname is Cui too, right?

871
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,170
Cui Guoming.

872
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,360
Yes, Cui Guoming.

873
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,600
The day we settle the severance packages,

874
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,760
he'll be the first to go.

875
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,840
Our management team has reached a consensus.

876
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,400
For people like him,

877
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,560
no amount of pleading will help.

878
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,280
If he doesn't go, who should?

879
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,780
Hurry up and serve the hot dishes.

880
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,120
So everyone

881
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,600
has been invited, right?

882
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,660
What about the drinks?

883
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,520
Everyone's had enough to drink.

884
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,080
Why won't you let me speak?

885
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,920
I can't lose face like that.

886
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,850
Between us old friends, there's nothing more to say.

887
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,420
This...

888
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,080
This...

889
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,960
I...

890
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,840
I can't put you in a difficult position.

891
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,880
You know what,

892
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,360
you're too thin-skinned.

893
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,080
Isn't this drink going to waste?

894
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,560
No, not at all.

895
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,440
The two of us

896
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,280
have already drunk it, haven't we?

897
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:12,720
Right?

898
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,520
Slow down.

899
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,840
Ji Qiang.

900
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,200
It's getting cold.

901
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,000
Go back and get some sleep.

902
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,720
This time

903
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,060
it coincided with the crackdown.

904
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,080
Plus, he's a celebrity,

905
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,560
so who else would they arrest?

906
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,890
Look at someone like me,

907
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,400
detained for 15 days and then released.

908
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,820
Actually, I came to see you today for something important.

909
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,760
Brother Huo told me

910
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,640
to give you this money.

911
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,360
You need money to raise Erpang.

912
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,160
Take it.

913
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,360
Erpang.

914
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,880
We can afford to take care of him.

915
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,680
We don't need this money.

916
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,080
You should let him quickly.

917
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,760
No, no, no.

918
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,720
If it weren't for Brother Huo,

919
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,440
I wouldn't have earned this money, right?

920
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,720
Just let him use it

921
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,440
to improve his meals in there.

922
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,040
Take it back first.

923
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,280
Really, take it back.

924
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,440
Actually, we earn quite a lot.

925
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,080
While he's in there,

926
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,320
the money I earn

927
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,160
is his too.

928
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,520
Yes, didn't I tell you?

929
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,960
If you keep acting like this,

930
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,440
I'm going to get angry with you.

931
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,880
Just stop explaining all this.

932
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,440
Fine, I'll keep it for now.

933
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,240
When are you going back to work?

934
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,960
I don't want to work there anymore.

935
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,080
Why? It's such a good job.

936
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,880
I have bigger plans.

937
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,600
Today's meal

938
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,720
is quite good.

939
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,440
Actually,

940
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,720
if you study seriously,

941
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,040
you could become a chef at Dingqing Restaurant.

942
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,200
It's possible.

943
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,880
You have the talent.

944
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,880
Why would I become a chef?

945
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,810
Dad, I'm trying to become a lawyer.

946
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,560
But you haven't passed the exam yet.

947
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,280
I didn't pass,

948
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,680
but I did extremely well.

949
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,880
It was perfect,

950
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,160
flawless.

951
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,100
What are you doing?

952
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,840
All my life,

953
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,480
I...

954
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,010
you can say I'm unreliable,

955
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,720
but when it comes to exams,

956
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,300
who dares say I'm not good?

957
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,440
That's true.

958
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,720
But it will be

959
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,980
a few months before the results come out.

960
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,000
The factory won't take you back,

961
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,400
so what do you plan to do during this time?

962
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,920
After studying for a while,

963
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,400
I feel that I

964
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,720
am really suited for

965
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,760
desk work.

966
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,720
I want to

967
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,280
write a popular martial arts novel.

968
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,160
I've even thought of a pen name,

969
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,720
Gu Longju.

970
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,440
When my book is published,

971
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,020
it will be called 'A Great Work by Gu Longju.'

972
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,880
I have a high school classmate who works at a publishing house.

973
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,640
He says I have real talent.

974
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,720
I can write too.

975
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,920
And with my skills,

976
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,520
I could finish a book in just one month.

977
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,080
Each book

978
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,160
would earn me 5,000 yuan.

979
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,880
Just think about it. In a month,

980
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,720
I could make 5,000 yuan.

981
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,320
That's way better than working at the factory.

982
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,960
I don't object to this.

983
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,720
You're just sitting around anyway,

984
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,720
better than going out and causing trouble.

985
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,840
But let's be clear.

986
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,840
If you write, do it quietly.

987
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,440
No going out.

988
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,200
If you finish it, great.

989
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
If not, that's fine too.

990
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,080
If the factory calls you back to work,

991
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,940
you must return immediately.

992
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,040
That's right, Dad.

993
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,960
I can

994
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,760
give everyone a brief introduction to

995
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,880
the origins of martial arts novels.

996
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,040
In Macau in the 1950s,

997
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,200
they organized a

998
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,730
martial arts competition.

999
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,300
That competition was absolutely unwatchable.

1000
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,160
They were just throwing wild punches,

1001
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,640
with no skill whatsoever,

1002
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,770
no technique at all.

1003
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,300
But this very competition

1004
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,640
inspired a reporter from Ta Kung Pao newspaper

1005
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,770
to write something.

1006
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,400
His name was Liang Yusheng,

1007
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,280
and he wrote a novel

1008
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,960
called 'Dragon and Tiger Fight in Beijing.'

1009
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,160
It became an instant hit.

1010
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,960
This Liang Yusheng had a buddy

1011
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,520
named Cha Liangyong.

1012
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,520
When Cha Liangyong saw Liang's success,

1013
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:42,960
he couldn't stand it.

1014
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,020
He wanted fame too.

1015
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,400
So he wrote

1016
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,960
'The Book and the Sword.'

1017
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,320
Eventually,

1018
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,320
he took his name, Cha Liangyong,

1019
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,040
and split the last character 'yong' apart

1020
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,400
to create his pen name.

1021
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,760
He became Jin Yong.
