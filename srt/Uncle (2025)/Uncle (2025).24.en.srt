1
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,130
The doctor said I shouldn't drink.

2
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,200
It's fine. Drink.

3
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,720
One sip is better than none.

4
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,080
The doctor told you not to drink.

5
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,340
What's wrong with you?

6
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,960
At my age,

7
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,280
having some health issues

8
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,520
isn't that normal?

9
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
You scared me.

10
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,139
As long as you're okay.

11
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,120
You write such wonderful novels,

12
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,840
and you're so good at singing and dancing.

13
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,840
I'd like to know what else you can do.

14
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,400
This question...

15
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,640
You should ask differently.

16
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,240
You should ask me

17
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,200
what I can't do.

18
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,600
Or be more specific.

19
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,040
Can you cook?

20
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,600
In our city,

21
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,000
there's

22
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,120
a very famous restaurant

23
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,450
called Dingqing Tower.

24
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,840
My father

25
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,079
was the general manager there for decades.

26
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,760
I was abroad

27
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,560
and even ran a restaurant.

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,440
So do you think I can cook?

29
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,840
Can you play basketball?

30
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,480
In high school,

31
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,880
our school had a team,

32
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,840
and I was the captain.

33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,720
I led my team

34
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,040
to win the provincial championship.

35
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,460
I've never met such an all-around talented person.

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,040
You know,

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,640
my whole life

38
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,960
I've known too many things.

39
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,920
But

40
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,560
I'm not good at anything. So

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,090
that's why I ended up like this,

42
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,440
a complete failure.

43
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,560
After meeting me,

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,530
you'll become successful.

45
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,120
I heard from Mr. Huo

46
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,410
that your wife passed away a long time ago.

47
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,280
Yes.

48
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,720
So you're single now.

49
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,720
I grew up abroad,

50
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
so I'm quite straightforward.

51
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,240
Hope you don't mind.

52
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,320
Can I be your girlfriend?

53
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,720
I admire that carefree spirit you have.

54
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,570
What year was your father born?

55
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,120
1955.

56
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,840
He is indeed a few years older than me.

57
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,800
Age isn't an issue.

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,530
As long as there's attraction.

59
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,320
Young lady,

60
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,080
are you serious?

61
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,680
I am serious.

62
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,600
Very serious.

63
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,280
Thank you.

64
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Did I startle you?

65
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,200
Do you think someone like me

66
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,520
would be startled?

67
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,159
Then think about it.

68
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm afraid I have to reject you.

69
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,200
You probably

70
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,780
haven't been rejected before, have you?

71
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,760
I'm too old

72
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,800
and not in good shape.

73
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,960
I don't have high expectations in that area.

74
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,090
It's not about that.

75
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,120
It's my health

76
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
that's very poor.

77
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,690
Since you've been so honest

78
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,760
with me about

79
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,890
what's on your mind,

80
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,760
in return,

81
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,100
I'll tell you a secret too.

82
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,080
You're

83
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,000
the first one to know.

84
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,600
I went to the hospital a few days ago.

85
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,130
They diagnosed me with lung adenocarcinoma,

86
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,610
terminal stage.

87
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,600
I've been

88
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,680
given a death sentence.

89
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,000
Are you that desperate

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
not to be with me?

91
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,080
Just to avoid being with me,

92
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,810
you'd tell such a terrible lie?

93
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,120
To reject you,

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I wouldn't need to make up such a lie.

95
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,120
I really envy you and Erpang at your age.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,930
It's wonderful.

97
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,720
In my life,

98
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,960
I've made too many people

99
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,680
suffer along with me.

100
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,800
You shouldn't

101
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,440
catch this last train.

102
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
I'm leaving.

103
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,200
Don't go.

104
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,400
Can you hug me?

105
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,720
Of course.

106
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,800
Can I stay here

107
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,580
and hear you sing 'Season of Wind' one more time?

108
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,880
I'll try my best

109
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,700
to sing it well for you.

110
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,440
Mr. Cui, I've told you so many times.

111
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,880
No deal.

112
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,720
Why do you keep pushing me like this?

113
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,039
If I don't push you, then who...

114
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,000
Our city has so many

115
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,159
newly opened commercial streets.

116
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,000
They not only don't make you

117
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,880
pay for renovation costs,

118
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,120
but also give you a rent-free period.

119
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,520
Isn't that a better deal?

120
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,700
That's different.

121
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,800
The original Dingqing Restaurant...

122
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
I'm begging you,

123
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,040
please stop coming here.

124
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,160
No matter how many times you come, I won't agree.

125
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,880
Dingqing Restaurant's original location is right here.

126
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,400
It used to be a restaurant.

127
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,680
Reopening a restaurant here

128
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,760
would definitely be good.

129
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,640
In the future,

130
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,520
people returning from other cities

131
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,120
or from abroad,

132
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,640
they'll want to taste this food again.

133
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,760
If Dingqing Restaurant is still here,

134
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,920
waiting for them right here,

135
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,360
that taste would be completely different.

136
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,280
But when they come back and see

137
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,000
this is a beauty salon,

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,440
imagine how disappointed they'll feel.

139
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,040
Don't you agree?

140
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,800
Wouldn't that be perfect?

141
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,640
They could get a beauty treatment here

142
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,800
and experience our city's

143
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,930
beauty techniques.

144
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,520
Let me tell you something,

145
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,280
young lady.

146
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,880
This is about nostalgia.

147
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
It's not just my nostalgia,

148
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,520
nor is it just someone else's.

149
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,880
It belongs to everyone in this city.

150
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,640
I was also born and raised in this city,

151
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,570
so why don't I feel this nostalgia?

152
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,160
You're too young.

153
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,480
Artificial flowers really can't...

154
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,680
No, no, miss.

155
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,600
Because what you're doing

156
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,800
affects the feng shui

157
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,400
and is bad for business.

158
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,560
My business is doing fine

159
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,160
without your concern.

160
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,520
Please reconsider.

161
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,320
Sir,

162
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,880
I have many customers waiting outside.

163
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,440
Why don't you look around somewhere else?

164
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,400
I'll go for now,

165
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
but I'll be back.

166
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,280
I will definitely

167
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,080
keep talking to you about this.

168
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,440
Because you...

169
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,000
Please.

170
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,720
Just think about it again, will you?

171
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,380
There's nothing to consider.

172
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,560
Mr. Huo.

173
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,480
Stop messing with me.

174
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,800
You keep pacing around

175
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,040
and it's driving me crazy.

176
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,640
You keep walking here

177
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,290
and it's making me anxious.

178
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
I'm just thinking about

179
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,520
company strategy.

180
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,080
The previous accountant

181
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,800
when he left

182
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,800
told me

183
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,760
there was 1 million in the account.

184
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,210
Then you started your second business

185
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,360
and left me with just 30%,

186
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,080
300,000.

187
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,800
Now with your third startup

188
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,000
it's another 30% cut,

189
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,040
100,000 yuan.

190
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,200
Let me tell you,

191
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,560
after paying salaries,

192
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,840
utilities,

193
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,080
and rent,

194
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,530
we can't even afford a bottle of water.

195
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,440
That's not your concern.

196
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,640
I'm the accountant.

197
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,520
If I don't worry, who will?

198
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,280
You know those employees

199
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,160
and the landlord,

200
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,880
they come to me asking for money.

201
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,210
What am I supposed to do?

202
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,640
Don't worry.

203
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,160
I have my ways.

204
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,760
This vertical e-commerce I'm talking about

205
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,600
is definitely the future

206
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,040
direction of internet development.

207
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
It's absolutely the next big thing.

208
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,480
Alright.

209
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,800
Stop talking to me about it.

210
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,480
I wouldn't understand anyway.

211
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,200
Let me confirm a few things with you.

212
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,640
You have local household registration, right?

213
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,880
I've checked your credit report.

214
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
No late payments.

215
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,040
You haven't borrowed money

216
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,080
from anyone else, right?

217
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,920
No, I haven't.

218
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,160
And that house from your grandfather,

219
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,400
you've been living there all along.

220
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,520
You have inheritance rights,

221
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,840
just haven't transferred the deed yet?

222
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,370
Correct.

223
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,280
Good.

224
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,600
150,000 for three months.

225
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,100
Pay interest monthly.

226
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,610
Okay.

227
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
When will you be free?

228
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,620
I'll explain everything to you then.

229
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,880
Miss Feng,

230
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,000
for the sake of my nostalgia,

231
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,660
could you sell your shop to me?

232
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,240
Please get up first, would you?

233
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,160
No, don't kneel on the ground.

234
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,040
I'm not kneeling.

235
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,280
My butt is right here on this.

236
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,880
Just sell the shop to me.

237
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,120
Look, sir,

238
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,880
I run a beauty salon.

239
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
I don't understand

240
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,120
anything about running restaurants

241
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,000
or this nostalgia thing you're talking about.

242
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,240
Young lady, nostalgia belongs to all humanity.

243
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,160
It's universal.

244
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,680
It has nothing to do

245
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,040
with beauty salons or restaurants.

246
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Fine.

247
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,480
You come here every day saying the same few things.

248
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,360
Nostalgia.

249
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,640
My ears are getting calluses from hearing it.

250
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
If you sell the shop to me,

251
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,880
you won't get calluses anymore.

252
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
I won't sell it.

253
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,880
Absolutely not.

254
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,920
I'm just trying to convince you

255
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,160
to sell it to me.

256
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,160
When it was just you alone

257
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,120
upstairs, it was fine.

258
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,000
But now

259
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,880
you two grown men

260
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,240
sitting in my dining area,

261
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,160
how am I supposed to run my business?

262
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,800
That's exactly

263
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,760
my goal - to stop your business.

264
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,120
No, why are you being like this?

265
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,640
It's not like that.

266
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,840
No, no, that's not it.

267
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,560
Let's go.

268
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,940
I'll leave for today then.

269
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,360
How could I possibly get a perm?

270
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,280
I'll

271
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,880
come back again.

272
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,280
I'll definitely come tomorrow.

273
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,560
I really mean what I say.

274
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,820
I'll definitely come.

275
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,760
Please think about it carefully.

276
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,400
Please leave.

277
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,640
I'm begging you.

278
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,410
I heard their pancakes are really delicious.

279
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,000
Are they good?

280
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,960
Let me have a bite.

281
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,490
What makes a craft special?

282
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,920
It's simply about putting your heart into it.

283
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,880
When you make it with care,

284
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,000
it stands out from the rest.

285
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,760
Right?

286
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,920
I've been thinking

287
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,640
about renting that shop across from yours.

288
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
The landlady?

289
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,610
She won't agree.

290
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
Can you help me think

291
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,320
of any other solutions?

292
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,320
What solutions could I possibly have?

293
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,800
Shady tactics?

294
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Sorry, buddy,

295
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,600
I left that life behind long ago.

296
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,600
I never said

297
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,460
I wanted you to use shady tactics.

298
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,760
Do I look like

299
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,560
someone who knows any other way?

300
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,280
I'm just brainstorming with you.

301
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,160
Please don't bother me.

302
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,890
I'm swamped. Look at this line.

303
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,640
Want green onions?

304
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,120
Yes.

305
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,280
This morning, all the suppliers

306
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,040
called me.

307
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,080
They said they're going to sue us.

308
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,760
Sue us!

309
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,760
And you're still smiling.

310
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,600
You're grinning like an idiot.

311
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,260
That stupid grin on your face.

312
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,760
Liu.

313
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,040
Tell me,

314
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,680
what major company

315
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,090
doesn't have lawsuits?

316
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,160
They are major companies.

317
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,920
You're just a big fraud.

318
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,740
Your phone is ringing.

319
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,720
Liu,

320
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,420
please step outside for a moment.

321
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,720
Hello.

322
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,860
What are you doing?

323
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,560
Why did it take you so long to answer?

324
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,480
I was in a board meeting.

325
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,000
Board meeting my ass!

326
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,730
When are you paying me back?

327
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,280
I need to

328
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,240
consult with the board to make decisions.

329
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,800
This isn't something

330
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,280
I can decide on my own.

331
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,040
Look,

332
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,560
could you please

333
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,000
be more polite when talking to me?

334
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I've been plenty polite with you.

335
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,920
You've been promising to pay for a month now.

336
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,560
I haven't seen a penny yet.

337
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Who do you think you're talking to?

338
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,360
Damn it!

339
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,280
Don't talk to me like that.

340
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,920
It's irritating.

341
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,120
Who do you think you are?

342
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,240
Have I disrespected you?

343
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,520
Talk to me properly, you hear me?

344
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,080
You little punk, where are you?

345
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,120
I'm coming to find you right now.

346
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm at the company.

347
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,920
Come on over. I'll be waiting.

348
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,880
Fine. Wait for me.

349
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,640
Don't you dare run away.

350
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,300
I won't run.

351
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,900
If you don't show up, you're a coward.

352
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,720
Why do you keep calling?

353
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,040
Someone might come

354
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,360
to collect debt by force.

355
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,490
How did this happen?

356
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,040
Can you find some guys

357
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,280
to help me deal with this?

358
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,080
Where are you?

359
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
I'm at the office.

360
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,320
Okay, got it.

361
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,400
He's a man

362
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,640
and he's blind.

363
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,800
What are you going to do?

364
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,080
This guy looks so familiar.

365
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,680
Where have I seen him before?

366
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,220
You were in jail together.

367
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,520
Come with me. I need your help.

368
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,320
What for?

369
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,760
To solve some debt issues.

370
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,490
You've already taken this job?

371
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,920
Let's go.

372
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,040
Why are they leaving?

373
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,760
Abandoning the stall?

374
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,090
What about my pancakes?

375
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,050
Everyone should leave now.

376
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,600
How can you just leave like that?

377
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,330
You still owe me three months' salary.

378
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,660
I'll definitely pay you your salary.

379
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,680
Let's wrap this up.

380
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,800
If I don't get my salary back,

381
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,460
my wife and kids will leave me.

382
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,240
Brother Liu, you don't need to be so upset.

383
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,200
Boss, if you don't pay up,

384
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,280
I'll deal with you too.

385
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,560
Do you actually want to work for him?

386
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,880
I'll do whatever I want.

387
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,960
Alright, everyone calm down.

388
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,440
I understand how you feel.

389
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,840
But,

390
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,840
some debt collectors are coming soon

391
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,400
threatening to wreck our company.

392
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,460
I don't want to drag you all into this.

393
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,960
As for me...

394
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
No, Brother Liu, what are you doing?

395
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,240
I'll keep this for now.

396
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,560
Take it home and have a look.

397
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,220
Can you even carry that thing?

398
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,170
Where's the remote?

399
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,690
I'll bring it back when you're on your feet again.

400
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,410
What kind of person is this?

401
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,839
Boss, I believe you'll bounce back.

402
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,010
Stay strong!

403
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,160
Thanks.

404
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,120
Uncle.

405
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,040
Uncle, where are you?

406
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,100
Coming right away.

407
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,720
Your uncle says he's coming.

408
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,440
What's up?

409
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,880
Hey, you know,

410
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,720
don't you have some buddies in the streets?

411
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,280
Get a few of them over here.

412
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,120
Who?

413
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,880
Dapeng.

414
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Dapeng?

415
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,220
Dapeng won't work.

416
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
I heard that Dapeng

417
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,760
got into some trouble a few years back,

418
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,560
got caught,

419
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,400
and they broke his leg.

420
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,320
Broke his leg?

421
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,760
What about Xiaofei?

422
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,840
Xiaofei?

423
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,880
He became a thief years ago.

424
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,340
Got locked up a while back.

425
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,400
Zhuzi's got a big crew.

426
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,280
Zhuzi won't work either.

427
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,240
I think Zhuzi

428
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,120
works at some farm now,

429
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,160
as a feeder

430
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,730
out in the countryside.

431
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,920
How did they all end up like this?

432
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,380
Come on!

433
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,960
What are you talking about?

434
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,680
'End up like this'?

435
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,920
Let me tell you, among all the guys,

436
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,200
I'm doing the best now.

437
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,920
I earn my living through honest work.

438
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,680
But I'm just

439
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,160
a pancake vendor, right?

440
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,040
Isn't that?

441
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,040
No, why are you asking me all this?

442
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,920
Where are we going?

443
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,520
You've got me confused.

444
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,080
You just said 'let's go'

445
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,920
so I came right away.

446
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,680
It's just a small matter.

447
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,040
Take off your apron first.

448
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,560
When we get there,

449
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,400
act like those tough guys

450
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,480
from the 90s.

451
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,760
Hey, who are you

452
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
calling a thug?

453
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,240
No, no.

454
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,760
Who's a thug?

455
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,620
I mean show some

456
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,290
heroic spirit, that's all.

457
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,040
That's more like it.

458
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,280
After being inside

459
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,120
for so long,

460
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,240
do you know anyone tough

461
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,770
who can intimidate people?

462
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,960
How about Scarface Ming?

463
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,320
I've heard of him.

464
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,520
He scares everyone.

465
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,520
He'll do.

466
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,160
He's perfect.

467
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,680
Get him.

468
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,400
He's serving life.

469
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,520
At least 20 more years.

470
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,200
If you need him urgently,

471
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,000
you two can help me break him out.

472
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,520
Damn, look at your stupid face.

473
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,960
Do you know how to talk?

474
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,920
If you can't speak properly,

475
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,080
shut your trap.

476
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,200
What kind of talk is that?

477
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,360
So irritating!

478
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,560
Who are you?

479
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,600
What do you mean 'who am I'?

480
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
What are you looking at?

481
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,360
I'm looking at you, so what?

482
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,000
What do you mean 'so what'?

483
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,810
Don't hit me!

484
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,540
Stop fighting!

485
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,440
No, no, stop!

486
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,880
He's biting me!

487
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,610
Stop biting!

488
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,160
Stop fighting!

489
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,720
Uncle, hurry up!

490
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,580
Everyone's already downstairs.

491
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,360
Bro.

492
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,480
Hey.

493
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,680
You! Get down here!

494
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,360
Don't go!

495
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,800
Take one more step and I'll jump.

496
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,020
What are you doing?

497
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,720
Can't you tell?

498
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Jumping off?

499
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,480
Fine. I won't interrupt your business.

500
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,360
Listen.

501
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:28,920
I need to ask you something.

502
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,160
Can I ask before you jump?

503
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,920
Go ahead.

504
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,400
Weren't you

505
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,600
shouting orders on the phone,

506
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
dragging me all the way here

507
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,640
just to watch you

508
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,840
livestream your suicide?

509
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,200
You're the one who pushed me to this.

510
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,480
Who pushed you?

511
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,520
I'm going to force you.

512
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,520
I should make you jump from the 20th floor.

513
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,880
Why would I make you jump from the 2nd floor?

514
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,160
Am I crazy?

515
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,000
I won't die jumping headfirst from the 2nd floor.

516
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,360
If I die, you'll have to pay with your life.

517
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,160
Pay?

518
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,240
If you really die today,

519
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,040
I'll really pay with my life, okay?

520
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Go ahead and jump.

521
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,960
Too scared to jump?

522
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
If you don't dare to jump, then listen,

523
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,440
pay back what you owe me today.

524
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,980
Then I'll livestream for you.

525
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,280
I'll jump instead, okay?

526
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,040
Come on.

527
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,440
I'll go up there.

528
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,240
Don't pull this on me.

529
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,400
Pay me back and I'll come down.

530
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:15,920
No, no, no.

531
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,880
Come on.

532
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,410
Don't pull this stunt on me.

533
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
What stunt?

534
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,320
Do you really think I won't jump?

535
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,680
No, you think I'm afraid of you, don't you?

536
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,040
How could I be afraid of you?

537
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,300
Come on, jump. I'll sit right here today.

538
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,480
I'll watch you jump with my own eyes.

539
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,000
So you're really going to jump today?

540
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'll give you a discount.

541
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,760
How's that?

542
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,600
How much?

543
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,480
3,000.

544
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,320
I'll consider it payment

545
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,180
for my boys to watch a monkey show.

546
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,280
Deal?

547
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,200
Deal.

548
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:48,900
Come on.

549
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,360
Look at you every day,

550
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,720
acting like you're from a TV show,

551
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,880
like Ke Zhen'e.

552
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,620
Talking the toughest game

553
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,120
then taking the worst beating.

554
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,580
What kind of habit is this?

555
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,980
Are you addicted to it?

556
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,420
Are you jumping or not?

557
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,280
Are you going to jump?

558
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,000
Don't mess around.

559
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,400
Jump or not?

560
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,240
Stop messing with me.

561
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,440
Who's messing with you? Jump!

562
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:06,960
I said I'm messing with you.

563
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,440
Stop!

564
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,740
Are these three your friends?

565
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,760
What kind of people are these?

566
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,400
Young man, you need to speak politely.

567
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,740
Show some respect.

568
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,480
I'm his uncle.

569
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,560
No.

570
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,080
You look only

571
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,890
about 30 or 40 years old.

572
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,200
How can you be

573
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,720
Tell me

574
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,320
who you used to hang out with.

575
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,360
After you tell me,

576
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,120
I'll see if I know them.

577
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,640
Well, I

578
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,200
like to study Buddhism in my spare time.

579
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,880
If you ask who I hang out with,

580
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,440
let's just say monks.

581
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,080
Which organization are you three from?

582
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,160
The Sunset Years Club?

583
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,960
Have you heard of my name?

584
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,460
I'm called Dog Intestine.

585
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,770
What intestine?

586
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,080
Dog.

587
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,920
Wangwang.

588
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,400
Did you see it?

589
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,880
It's a C-section.

590
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,280
Let me tell you again.

591
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,760
A few years ago, I got into a fight.

592
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,720
Many of my intestines were stabbed and cut.

593
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,560
When I got to the hospital,

594
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,120
the Western doctors said they couldn't save me.

595
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,240
But my family

596
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,480
found an old Chinese doctor

597
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,000
who replaced mine with dog intestines.

598
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,800
I don't have many years left to live.

599
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,460
I've come to terms with death.

600
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,640
Now let's look at this one.

601
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,400
Just from his appearance,

602
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,340
he just came back from abroad.

603
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,520
Don't laugh.

604
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,600
He committed a crime,

605
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,880
just returned from overseas,

606
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,200
fled abroad after seriously injuring someone,

607
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,000
and only came back after the statute of limitations expired.

608
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,130
Now look at this one.

609
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,100
This guy is even more impressive.

610
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,320
A murderer.

611
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,820
One slash, instant death.

612
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,840
Stop, stop, stop.

613
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:50,760
I...

614
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:51,960
Listen.

615
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,400
I don't care if you're Dog Intestine or whatever,

616
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,320
so you're back from abroad, right?

617
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,440
I don't care if you're from overseas

618
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,320
or somewhere in this country,

619
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,720
it's none of my business.

620
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,360
Even if you were a ladyboy today,

621
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,720
you better keep your mouth shut.

622
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,960
Hey, you, the quiet one,

623
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,020
I'm talking to you.

624
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,560
So you're a murderer, huh?

625
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,290
Your knife skills must be good.

626
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,360
Carve me a radish sometime.

627
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,640
Not you three.

628
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,360
If I weren't considering your age,

629
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,560
I would've buried you all by now.

630
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,200
This is none of your business. Get out of here.

631
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,560
Get lost!

632
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,440
Young man.

633
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,120
Don't talk nonsense.

634
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,880
Tell me

635
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,120
what will it take for you to release him?

636
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,040
Did I kidnap him?

637
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,840
Look,

638
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,720
he owes me money.

639
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,560
It's been overdue for over a month.

640
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,680
Won't even answer my calls.

641
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,000
Keeps dodging me, then suddenly calls.

642
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,800
My mom's stuff is still in there.

643
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,640
Insisted on meeting up with me.

644
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,760
Wanted me to come so we could 'talk it out.'

645
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,290
So I came.

646
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,840
And now he's sitting on the windowsill.

647
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,440
Too scared to jump down.

648
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,400
Won't jump from the second floor.

649
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,440
You're his uncle, right?

650
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,000
Yes.

651
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,800
This kid...

652
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,930
How did you raise him when he was young?

653
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,960
Just tell me what you want today.

654
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,820
Listen, uncle.

655
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,200
I've been in this business for over ten years.

656
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,320
I've never used violent collection methods before.

657
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,920
But this kid is just too infuriating.

658
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,380
He's really infuriating.

659
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,610
Don't fight. You want trouble?

660
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,840
You think we three old men are easy targets?

661
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,280
You young people nowadays

662
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,320
don't fight, you just swing wildly.

663
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,720
Have you ever

664
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,240
seen real kung fu before?

665
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,420
Today he won't join in.

666
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
Just us three.

667
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,720
Yes, you four or five guys.

668
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,360
Let's go downstairs and show our skills.

669
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,620
It's too cramped here.

670
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,610
Alright.

671
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,920
Let's find a place with better feng shui.

672
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
Let's go, Erpang.

673
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,120
Okay, coming.

674
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,300
Hurry, follow your uncle.

675
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,520
Come on, let's stretch a bit.

676
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,780
The event has started.

677
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,360
Did they run away?

678
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,520
You stay here and lay low for now.

679
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,980
And take care of these two while you're at it.

680
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,120
You know what, Uncle?

681
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,050
These two look quite similar to us.

682
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,560
How so?

683
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,840
They dress like us.

684
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,640
And have identical hairstyles.

685
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,380
I thought you were saying I snore too.

686
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,600
Erpang.

687
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,300
When you're in the mountains,

688
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,090
you must learn how to make fire.

689
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,440
For your food and warmth.

690
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,240
We have to rely on this stove.

691
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,320
Mountain water can't be drunk cold.

692
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,650
It must be boiled first.

693
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,280
So making a fire

694
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,840
Have you learned how?

695
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,600
I have.

696
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,840
Uncle,

697
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,720
could this stove

698
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,120
set the house on fire?

699
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,320
Theoretically, yes.

700
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,570
I've never tried it.

701
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,170
You probably won't try either.

702
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,770
You don't have the guts.

703
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,600
Why wouldn't I?

704
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,440
What if I do someday?

705
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,480
Then congratulations to you.

706
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,600
Uncle.

707
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,380
How long do I have to hide here?

708
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,960
Wait until I sort this out.

709
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,520
When will you sort it out?

710
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,600
I don't know.

711
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,050
How do you plan to fix it?

712
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,880
I don't know.

713
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,560
Then

714
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,200
what am I supposed to do?

715
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,600
How much money do you owe?

716
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Don't ask.

717
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,490
I really don't know.

718
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,720
Besides, you can't help me pay it back anyway.

719
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,600
How much do you owe your employees?

720
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,360
That

721
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,300
needs to be paid first.

722
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,320
They all

723
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,160
have families to support.

724
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,810
I'll cover it for you first.

725
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,130
The employees' wages aren't much.

726
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,570
Ask our accountant Liu and he'll tell you.

727
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,760
Erpang.

728
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,000
Did you know when you were eleven months old,

729
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,400
you won the city-wide

730
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,060
baby crawling championship?

731
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,480
So young,

732
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,900
yet such a glorious achievement.

733
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,280
This proves

734
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,280
you were born extraordinary.

735
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,160
Among your peers,

736
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,240
no one

737
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,160
can surpass you.

738
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,880
Just think, at such a young age,

739
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,280
you've already achieved such remarkable success.

740
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,210
Sooner or later,

741
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,730
you'll win another championship.

742
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,040
Dapao, let me sing you a song.

743
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,480
We are the Three Dogs Band

744
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,530
from Rabbit Hole Mountain.

745
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,000
Full Body Oil Massage

746
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,400
(Full Body Massage

747
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:50,720
Palace Body Massage

748
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,450
Foot Salt Scrub, Back Walking)

749
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,920
Tomorrow

750
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,080
you'll have a chance to change your fate.

751
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,880
The reason for all this

752
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,930
is because of that one cut you made.

753
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,920
I didn't kill Boren,

754
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,520
but he died because of me.

755
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,400
What's up?

756
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,440
You're looking for me?

757
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,680
I need to talk to you.

758
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,730
Hurry up.

759
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,600
What's wrong?

760
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,240
That fortune teller who scammed me,

761
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,800
remember him?

762
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,560
I do.

763
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,170
He's right in there.

764
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,480
Are you sure?

765
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,570
I'm pretty sure.

766
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,880
Very sure.

767
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,240
It's definitely him.

768
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,640
Wait here.

769
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,320
I'll check for you.

770
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,680
Your lower back strain is quite serious.

771
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,140
What do you do for a living?

772
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,560
I'm a truck driver.

773
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,280
I thought so.

774
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,840
Sitting for over ten hours at a time,

775
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,040
no wonder it's so bad.

776
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
My life is hard.

777
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,760
How so?

778
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,400
My wife passed away early.

779
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,160
I have to raise two children.

780
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,960
One is mine,

781
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,280
and one is my sister's.

782
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,040
My nephew, that chubby kid,

783
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,700
gives me nothing but trouble.

784
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,240
It's too much.

785
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,040
You speak so eloquently,

786
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,240
so measured and calm.

787
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,640
You shouldn't be doing such hard labor.

788
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,040
Haven't you consulted a fortune teller?

789
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,520
What? A fortune teller?

790
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,850
Does that even work?

791
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,840
Well, this thing,

792
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,570
it works if you believe, and doesn't if you don't.

793
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,600
I learned a bit when I was younger.

794
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,200
My master said I had the gift.

795
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,400
Perhaps I revealed too many heavenly secrets,

796
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,130
and now my eyesight is failing.

797
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,760
These days,

798
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,060
I just do massages,

799
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,890
hardly read fortunes anymore.

800
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,240
How much do you charge for a reading now?

801
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,200
Same as a massage, 198 yuan.

802
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,480
That's quite expensive.

803
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,640
198 yuan,

804
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,360
but if my reading isn't accurate,

805
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,560
you don't have to pay.

806
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,840
Alright, I'll try it.

807
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,130
Tell me your birth details.

808
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,120
July 6, 1960.

809
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,160
At 2:30 in the morning,

810
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,880
born in this city.

811
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,280
Although you were born during

812
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,880
the Three Years of Hardship,

813
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,800
you never went hungry as a child.

814
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,400
Compared to other children at that time,

815
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,160
you ate quite well, didn't you?

816
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,200
Yes.

817
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,320
And you have an exceptional destiny.

818
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,440
You're multi-talented

819
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,400
and write excellent articles.

820
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,880
Do you know that you are

821
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,800
the reincarnation of Han Xiangzi's young page?

822
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,719
Has anyone ever told you?

823
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,960
What? Getting excited?

824
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,520
You mean Han Xiangzi from the Eight Immortals?

825
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,600
Of course.

826
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,320
You were sent to earth

827
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
because you broke his inkstone.

828
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,040
That's why you're so talented,

829
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,800
but have no place to use your skills.

830
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,880
When you were young,

831
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,920
things went quite smoothly.

832
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,960
But in middle age,

833
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,159
your career suddenly became rocky.

834
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,840
Running here and there,

835
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,040
I do all kinds of fortune-telling.

836
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,760
Do you know me?

837
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,920
I'm just a blind man.

838
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,250
How would I know anyone?

839
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,300
You really can tell fortunes.

840
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,679
You be the judge of my skills.

841
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,139
But let me tell you something privately.

842
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,960
I think you're a good person,

843
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,040
kind-hearted.

844
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,620
You've helped quite a few people in your life, haven't you?

845
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,320
He helped me today.

846
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,800
Who?

847
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,080
Fortune telling.

848
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,560
Just casual talk.

849
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,800
Not very accurate.

850
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,530
Why bother if your predictions aren't accurate?

851
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,680
Hey, you called me over.

852
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,760
I did your fortune.

853
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,560
Do I have some grudge against you?

854
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,040
Come here. Open your eyes

855
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,240
and look at who I am.

856
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,400
How can I tell who you are?

857
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,720
I'd be happy just to see you beat me up.

858
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,120
Why are you yelling at me?

859
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,560
You don't remember who I am, right?

860
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,720
Let me help you remember.

861
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,680
September 1993.

862
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,560
Didn't you tell fortunes

863
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,720
for a pork seller

864
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,560
by the river?

865
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,760
I've been fortune-telling for over 40 years.

866
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,680
I've been everywhere.

867
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
Think carefully.

868
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,480
Five in the morning by the river.

869
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,080
The Zhen position.

870
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,880
You told me to burn three yellow talismans

871
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,000
that would rise to the heavens.

872
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,720
Then wash my hands in the river.

873
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,800
And then it was done.

874
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,240
You told me I'd never worry about food or clothing,

875
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,880
that I'd be successful in my later years

876
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,000
and become famous.

877
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,120
Isn't that what you said?

878
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,880
Remember?

879
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,740
I remember now.

880
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,400
Was my prediction wrong?

881
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,040
I admit it.

882
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,440
So you admit it?

883
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:55,800
I admit it.

884
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,720
Let's go to the police station.

885
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,250
What for?

886
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,320
Why should I go to the police station?

887
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,960
What? Why?

888
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,480
Go to the police station?

889
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,600
What police station? What for?

890
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,400
Do you know?

891
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,360
Do you know who I am?

892
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,560
Just because of those few words you said,

893
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,000
I spent over ten years in prison.

894
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,600
Over ten years behind bars!

895
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,440
What did you do

896
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,560
to get locked up for so long?

897
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,960
I didn't do anything!

898
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,840
I did exactly what you told me.

899
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,760
I threw a knife in there.

900
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,490
The day after I threw the knife,

901
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,800
a female corpse floated up.

902
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,400
How could I explain that to the police?

903
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,680
I told them it was a fortune teller

904
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,480
who told me to do it.

905
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,760
I told them everything.

906
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,160
After I told them, they went looking for you

907
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,040
but couldn't find you. Where did you go?

908
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,080
Where were you?

909
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,280
Wandering the world.

910
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,160
Where else can I go?

911
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,480
What are you doing here?

912
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
Why are you looking for me?

913
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,200
You're here for money.

914
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,960
More than 20 years have passed.

915
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,320
Let's go to the police station.

916
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,880
I won't go.

917
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,240
Go? What would I do at the police station?

918
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,840
Me at the police station?

919
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,640
Can I report you for feudal superstition?

920
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,960
I'm just asking if my fortune-telling was accurate.

921
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,000
What accuracy are you talking about?

922
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,880
You spent over ten years in prison.

923
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,800
While you were in there,

924
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,000
didn't they feed you?

925
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,130
Didn't they give you uniforms to wear?

926
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,340
Nothing to say now, right?

927
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,280
You call that

928
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,160
living without worries?

929
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,320
Living comfortably.

930
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,120
That's what I call.

931
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,760
So what?

932
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,240
One day this case gets overturned.

933
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,040
The internet is so powerful nowadays.

934
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,720
Once the case is overturned,

935
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,840
you'll become famous throughout the world.

936
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,080
What's wrong with that?

937
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,080
Can I just kill him?

938
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,440
No, no, no. Calm down first.

939
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,480
No, I've already been sentenced to more than 10 years.

940
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,680
If I beat him up, that's what he'll get.

941
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,360
That makes sense in theory and logic.

942
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,880
Whose side are you on anyway?

943
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,560
Beating or cursing him now won't help.

944
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,290
You might end up back in prison.

945
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,600
What you should do now

946
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,520
is bring him to the police station.

947
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,580
To testify for you.

948
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,280
On your part,

949
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,640
he really spent over a decade in prison

950
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,000
because of what you said.

951
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,440
We're still appealing the case.

952
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,900
So we need your statement.

953
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
Once you're there,

954
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,440
you'll only talk about his case.

955
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,760
Whatever you've done in the past

956
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,000
has nothing to do with this.

957
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,400
You're a fortune teller.

958
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,360
I believe

959
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,840
and you believe too

960
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,420
that karma exists,

961
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,000
right?

962
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,000
Dapao.

963
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,240
What?

964
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,640
Take this.

965
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,930
What's this for?

966
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,080
Take it.

967
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,720
I took 50 yuan from you back then.

968
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,700
Now I'm giving it back.

969
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,960
But prices have changed.

970
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,090
Why are you bringing this nonsense up?

971
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,720
Even now,

972
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,640
I still believe my fortune-telling was correct.

973
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,840
It was clearly about you.

974
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,440
Free from worries about food and clothing,

975
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,640
living comfortably.

976
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,080
How dare you mention this?

977
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,200
I need to have the courage to tell you what comes next.

978
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,240
Remember this:

979
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
The day of vindication

980
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,320
will be when you become famous

981
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,250
and renowned throughout the land.

982
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,440
What about my fortune-telling fee?

983
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,700
I'll give it to you too.

984
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,780
Let's talk about fate.

985
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,640
Come visit me often in the future.

986
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,880
Keep coming back here,

987
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,000
I'll continue for free.

988
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,160
No need for free service.

989
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,200
Next time when I need you to testify,

990
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,160
just show up.

991
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,040
About testifying,

992
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,640
I'll come whenever you call.

993
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,880
But brother, you...

994
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,320
Brother, what's

995
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,560
wrong with me?

996
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,440
You might face a calamity.

997
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,640
Can it be avoided?

998
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,280
Life in this world

999
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,260
is nothing but suffering.

1000
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,530
Finding release sooner

1001
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,040
might not be such a bad thing.

1002
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,600
Erpang.

1003
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,640
Erpang.

1004
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,000
Erpang.

1005
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,840
I thought you really committed suicide.

1006
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,040
I thought debt collectors had chased me all the way here.

1007
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,080
How could you get instant noodles

1008
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,280
all over your head?

1009
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,020
Why didn't you make a fire?

1010
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,480
I don't know how.

1011
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,490
The fire went out soon after you left that day.

1012
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,200
Then how did you cook the noodles?

1013
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,160
I didn't cook them.

1014
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,200
I ate them dry.

1015
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,640
Then a bite of noodles and a sip of wine.

1016
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,760
A bite of noodles and a sip of wine.

1017
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,920
It's quite satisfying.

1018
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,480
The biggest difference between us and animals is

1019
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,010
that we know how to use fire.

1020
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,560
I know how to use fire too.

1021
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,960
But there's no fire here.

1022
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,530
There'll be hot food later.

1023
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,840
I'll just have a few bites first.

1024
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,840
How long has it been since you've eaten?

1025
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
I can't remember.

1026
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,400
Two or three days.

1027
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,770
Maybe three or four.

1028
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,760
Time passes easily in the mountains,

1029
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,220
while a thousand years of prosperity have passed in the world.

1030
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,480
With that attitude of yours,

1031
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,280
you wouldn't starve even if you didn't eat for ten years.

1032
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,410
When did your phone get disconnected?

1033
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,610
I really don't know.

1034
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,840
I think it's actually better this way.

1035
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,840
Saves me from all those annoying calls.

1036
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,370
Don't just eat by yourself.

1037
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,040
How long have the dogs gone without food?

1038
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,960
I haven't eaten for days.

1039
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,880
So they haven't eaten for days either.

1040
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,160
Uncle, if you hadn't come,

1041
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,420
we would've all starved to death up here.

1042
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,400
Hurry up and grab a sausage

1043
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,130
to satisfy their hunger first.

1044
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,970
I'll cook you all a proper meal.

1045
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,040
The steps and methods for lighting the stove

1046
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,280
Have you got it all clear?

1047
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,010
Yes, I got it.

1048
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,360
Uncle.

1049
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,720
Actually, these quilts are thick enough.

1050
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,480
As long as I don't turn over,

1051
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,810
I won't feel cold at all.

1052
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I just can't stick out of the covers.

1053
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,440
It's too miserable when I do.

1054
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,480
Anyway, I've taught you how to light the stove.

1055
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,410
Whether you do it or not is up to you.

1056
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:46,840
Here you go.

1057
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,300
Is today Spring Festival?

1058
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,240
Tomorrow.

1059
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,240
Tomorrow.

1060
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,760
Mengmeng is coming back.

1061
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,560
I'll celebrate the New Year with her.

1062
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,290
Originally,

1063
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,200
we should be together,

1064
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,000
but I'm afraid if you're here,

1065
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,360
the creditors might come too,

1066
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,290
and that would frighten Mengmeng.

1067
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,600
Why is Mengmeng still so fragile?

1068
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,730
You're not fragile.

1069
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:07,840
You're not fragile.

1070
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,680
You're hiding in the mountains.
