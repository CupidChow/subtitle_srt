1
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
Li.

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,720
Li Yang.

3
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,040
Liu.

4
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,280
First mistake.

5
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,759
Second mistake.

6
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,360
I shouldn't have loved you so deeply.

7
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,560
Loved you so deeply.

8
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,800
But it doesn't matter.

9
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,000
You shouldn't have come to my home.

10
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,960
Xiaomei.

11
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,760
I.

12
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,320
Xiaozhi.

13
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,079
Don't abandon us.

14
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,360
Xiaomei.

15
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,360
People.

16
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,920
Ninth mistake, tenth mistake.

17
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,480
I shouldn't have loved you so deeply.

18
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,880
But loving you doesn't matter.

19
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,800
I've been waiting at home for you to return.

20
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,680
Hailong is dead.

21
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,680
Hailong is dead.

22
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,760
What?

23
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,079
Hailong is dead.

24
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,040
How do you think he died?

25
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,640
I don't know.

26
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,320
Someone found him while fishing this morning.

27
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,340
What about Zhang Xiaomei?

28
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,480
She ran away.

29
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,600
Where did she go?

30
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,159
I don't know.

31
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,560
I heard she ran off with a foreigner.

32
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,960
They'd only known each other for a few days.

33
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,560
She left a letter.

34
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,520
Let me see it.

35
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,080
You don't need to see it.

36
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,120
The police took it.

37
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,040
But I've read it.

38
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,280
The letter mentioned

39
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,740
Hailong's incompetence,

40
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,320
mediocrity, narrow-mindedness, and poverty.

41
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,920
She got to you too.

42
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,040
Compared to you,

43
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,680
I wasn't criticized as much.

44
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,290
But what she said about us is pretty much the same.

45
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,690
Both full of ourselves,

46
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,570
but actually nothing special,

47
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
and have nothing.

48
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,640
I think this letter hurts Hailong

49
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,920
more than her running away.

50
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,200
What about Xiaozhi?

51
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,000
He's not even weaned yet,

52
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,400
still breastfeeding.

53
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,740
His grandparents don't have much space,

54
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
they're getting old too.

55
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
What should we do?

56
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,040
My place is already full,

57
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,500
I already have three kids.

58
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,570
My wife and I are busy making money.

59
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,460
My three kids are already at my dad's.

60
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,410
My dad's health isn't good enough to care for such a young child.

61
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,620
How about this?

62
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,120
I'll provide the money,

63
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,250
you raise the child.

64
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,360
Okay.

65
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,490
Ask Sister Zhou.

66
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,000
How did I reject that foreigner?

67
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,480
It was Zhang Xiaomei who couldn't control herself.

68
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,640
How is that my fault?

69
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,920
Cui Guoming.

70
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,600
Calm down.

71
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,840
Calm down.

72
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Cui Guoming.

73
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
What right do I have to control her?

74
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,960
What authority do I have over her?

75
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,159
You need to calm down.

76
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,200
Don't go.

77
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,460
What's wrong with you?

78
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,320
Cui Guoming.

79
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,700
Can you be more mature?

80
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,300
What happened to your eye?

81
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,220
I fell down the day before yesterday.

82
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,540
Yet you still came to the funeral,

83
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,920
and it's Hailong's too.

84
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,050
What about Hailong?

85
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,760
Hailong was a veteran worker at our factory,

86
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,880
our old colleague,

87
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
who worked at the factory for over ten years.

88
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,370
An old friend. How could I not come?

89
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,000
Guoming.

90
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,810
My condolences.

91
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,530
Hailong, hand me the number 13 wrench.

92
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,730
This one might work too.

93
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,440
How's Xiaozhi doing?

94
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,900
How much does he weigh now?

95
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,280
Normal weight.

96
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,800
Let him drink more milk.

97
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,800
He can even chew on formula sometimes.

98
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,000
He'll grow up strong.

99
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,000
What?

100
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,400
You want him to end up like your Erpang?

101
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,220
What's wrong with Erpang?

102
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,640
Being chubby means good health.

103
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,840
If he thinks he's too fat later,

104
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,900
he can lose weight.

105
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,120
Being fat isn't a compliment nowadays.

106
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,800
Don't think it's like when you were young,

107
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,720
when calling someone fat was a compliment.

108
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,320
Anyone can be fat these days.

109
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
But staying slim

110
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,360
shows self-discipline and standards.

111
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Self-discipline my ass.

112
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,480
Live in the moment.

113
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,160
Besides, I'm not fat, right?

114
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,520
Erpang's parents aren't fat either.

115
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,560
My parents aren't fat either.

116
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,720
No, they're not.

117
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,250
Then he won't be fat either.

118
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,080
Just be happy.

119
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,840
Be happy every day.

120
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,900
Why are these wheels always so stiff?

121
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,600
No one's fighting you for food.

122
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,060
Why are you eating so fast?

123
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,480
I've always eaten at this speed.

124
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,760
Xiaoxue, have some vegetables.

125
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,120
This is your home too.

126
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Don't be shy.

127
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,560
Thank you, Grandpa.

128
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,680
He told you not to be shy.

129
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,720
So don't be shy.

130
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,960
Take more food.

131
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,360
Look how much Erpang can grab with one pair of chopsticks.

132
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,280
Really, don't be shy.

133
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,320
Yeah.

134
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,920
By the way, could you stop grinding your teeth at night?

135
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,560
Do I grind my teeth?

136
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,920
You start grinding as soon as you fall asleep.

137
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,320
And continue until dawn.

138
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,200
I'm sorry.

139
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,080
If I grind my teeth again, just hit me.

140
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,520
How could I hit you?

141
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,620
Then wake me up with a push.

142
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,120
Okay.

143
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,000
Also, do you always have nightmares when you sleep?

144
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,800
You're always startling awake.

145
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,120
I'm sorry.

146
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,080
About the teeth grinding,

147
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,120
it's easy to fix. I saw on TV there's a kind of mouthguard.

148
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,520
You wear it before bed and you won't grind your teeth anymore.

149
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,200
Really? Is there something to stop nightmares too?

150
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,680
Yes.

151
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,640
What?

152
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,860
I heard that if you eat well, you won't have nightmares.

153
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
From now on, Xiaoxue will eat better and better.

154
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,180
Then she won't have nightmares anymore.

155
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,760
The chain fell off again.

156
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,240
My installation definitely isn't the problem.

157
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,040
It's just that this equipment is inadequate.

158
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,360
The lathe is too poor quality.

159
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,840
Why don't we get a better lathe then?

160
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,600
I'm broke. Don't be fooled by this old bike.

161
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,370
It cost me over 20,000 yuan.

162
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,080
This is a true luxury ride in the bicycle world.

163
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,840
Uncle,

164
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,250
why don't you ever let me try this luxury bike?

165
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,760
Mengmeng is too clever.

166
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,820
You can't handle this kind of luxury.

167
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,200
What's up? You're skipping work too?

168
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
I got laid off.

169
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,320
But without you at the factory,

170
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,320
who's going to maintain the equipment?

171
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,200
They said

172
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,760
they hired a specialist from Shenyang.

173
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,040
Have you thought about what to do next?

174
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,020
I haven't thought about anything at all.

175
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,730
I've figured it out for you.

176
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,700
Because I knew you'd get laid off.

177
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,760
Look.

178
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,240
This shop is your future.

179
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,120
You want me to run a grocery store

180
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,440
or marry Sister Fang?

181
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,620
You're overthinking.

182
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,420
I want you to open a Chinese medicine clinic.

183
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,250
Your whole family is in this business.

184
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,600
Your grandfather, your father, your uncle,

185
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,400
and you.

186
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,960
Some do cupping,

187
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,120
some do acupuncture,

188
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,160
some do massage.

189
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,680
Why not open a Chinese medicine clinic?

190
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,360
My grandfather is over 80.

191
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,880
The other day he tried to give Xiaozhi acupuncture

192
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,560
and his hands were shaking terribly.

193
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,000
He doesn't need to do the work.

194
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,360
Just hang his photo on the wall - the older he looks, the better.

195
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,640
That makes it look like a family tradition clinic.

196
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,280
This is marketing.

197
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,600
This is wealth.

198
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,720
Your father has good skills.

199
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,960
Let him work. Your skills aren't great,

200
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,720
so you can be the boss.

201
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,600
What? Being a boss is all I'm good for?

202
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,200
Yes, because you don't know how to do anything.

203
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,640
Did you make this?

204
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,440
Yes.

205
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,520
You're so talented.

206
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,850
It's just a minor skill.

207
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,200
I work with 'minor skills' too.

208
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,920
But I mainly carve dragons.

209
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,880
Take a look at my work.

210
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,480
Let's go.

211
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,920
Not bad.

212
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,880
This guy.

213
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,800
You've made this shop look really nice.

214
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
It's very dynamic

215
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,410
and thoughtful.

216
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,360
Well,

217
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,600
I see you working on renovations every day,

218
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,840
making all those noises,

219
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,170
but I haven't seen a single worker around.

220
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,960
I was worried that

221
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,500
the renovation workers wouldn't have enough artistic taste.

222
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,360
I was afraid they might affect the overall vibe of our tattoo shop,

223
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,680
so I did all the renovations myself from top to bottom.

224
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,760
Even this wall was knocked down by me.

225
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,680
You don't come to the shop often.

226
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,280
If you don't believe me, ask your sister-in-law if I did all the renovation by myself.

227
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,010
Yes, she's mentioned you to me.

228
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,480
Can you show me some of your tattoo work?

229
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,640
I don't have any photos at the moment.

230
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,960
Because with any artwork, if you only look at photos,

231
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,600
you can't see its soul.

232
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,040
But I can guarantee you.

233
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,360
Each of my tattoo pieces

234
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,620
is completely unique.

235
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,680
They're all filled with my personal

236
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,490
creative touch.

237
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,520
I'm curious.

238
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,960
What style are your tattoo works?

239
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,920
Style.

240
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,560
You understand. Style.

241
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,090
You're stepping on my foot.

242
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,560
I mainly work in the traditional Chinese fine-brush painting style,

243
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,820
rich with traditional Chinese aesthetic sensibilities,

244
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,120
while also incorporating elements of cartoon and anime styles,

245
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,520
giving my tattoo works a sense of childlike wonder and innocence.

246
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,120
When you're doing a tattoo,

247
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,040
could I come watch you work?

248
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,760
I can see you're also someone who appreciates art.

249
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,240
What's your surname, brother?

250
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,040
It's Cui.

251
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,540
Pleased to meet you again.

252
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,200
May I ask,

253
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,560
how did you get that injury?

254
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,800
Yesterday I had an artistic disagreement with a customer.

255
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,480
I felt his understanding of art was misguided.

256
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,240
So you got beaten up, huh?

257
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,560
Shouldn't you be listening to your customers?

258
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,880
Should an artist listen to the opinions of the common masses?

259
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,960
For example.

260
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,720
Take Van Gogh.

261
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,400
If he had listened to some old doorman telling him how to paint,

262
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,480
would Van Gogh still have become Van Gogh?

263
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,600
But the thing is, we're running businesses.

264
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,400
The customer comes first.

265
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,120
I sell clothes,

266
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,240
and I have to listen to what customers want.

267
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,520
You sell products,

268
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,720
while I sell art.

269
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,040
I sell fashion.

270
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,320
Your fashion is defined by so-called fashion influencers

271
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,440
and trendy designers.

272
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,400
But I refuse to be defined.

273
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,360
My art can only be defined by me.

274
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,690
You're quite stubborn too.

275
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,960
Extremely stubborn.

276
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,560
How many artists are well-behaved good boys?

277
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,880
Following the crowd.

278
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,640
Which art school did you graduate from?

279
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,560
Fourth Vocational High School.

280
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,440
Studying art?

281
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,360
Cooking.

282
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,080
So why did you pick up a needle instead of a ladle?

283
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,520
Because of

284
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,200
passion.

285
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,120
I could introduce you to my father sometime.

286
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,960
Is the old man also an artist?

287
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,880
No.

288
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,360
Do you know Dingqing Restaurant?

289
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,360
That old establishment. Very delicious.

290
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,800
My father worked there as a chef for twenty years,

291
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,000
and then as the general manager for another twenty years.

292
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,250
That's impressive.

293
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,400
But I probably wouldn't discuss these things with him.

294
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,560
Why not?

295
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,080
Did Lu Xun still practice medicine after he started writing?

296
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,210
Did Yu Hua still work as a dentist after he began writing?

297
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,200
Since I've chosen this profession,

298
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,080
I must completely forget

299
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,050
my previous one.

300
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,680
You're an artist.

301
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,040
My wife won't let me stay out too long.

302
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,560
I look forward to seeing your artwork.

303
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,240
Your expectations will be worth the wait.

304
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,200
Erpang, is it okay if I ride the bike to school?

305
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,080
Of course it's fine.

306
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,000
I'll tell all my classmates

307
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,560
that this is the Rolls-Royce of geared bicycles,

308
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,800
with every part handcrafted.

309
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,520
Well, not every part.

310
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,280
The wheels aren't original,

311
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,970
but everything else is.

312
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,040
Limited edition.

313
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,000
Cool.

314
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,840
You went to the tattoo shop?

315
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,120
Yes, the young artist is interesting.

316
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,000
So you two met after all.

317
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,440
I just can't keep you apart.

318
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,120
What's wrong with knowing him?

319
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,400
You're both equally unreliable.

320
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,440
Once you two get together, it's like a perfect storm,

321
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,600
a disaster waiting to happen.

322
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,280
You've only been responsible for a few days.

323
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,210
I'm worried he'll lead you astray.

324
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,200
A young kid like him can't lead me astray.

325
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,920
If anything, I'd be the one leading him astray.

326
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,180
Is there a difference?

327
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,160
I'm going to the post office to pick up a package.

328
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,760
Don't go to his place.

329
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,200
Did you hear me?

330
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,680
I won't go.

331
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,080
Mind the store properly.

332
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,800
Don't you dare go there.

333
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,080
I'm definitely not going.

334
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,880
Brother Cui.

335
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,920
I want to hang out with you for a while.

336
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,400
He wants to hang out with me for a bit.

337
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:04,960
Come.

338
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,890
Sister-in-law.

339
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,320
Thank you, young lady.

340
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,440
Spending so much at once.

341
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,400
260.

342
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,780
I don't have any money.

343
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,400
What do you mean?

344
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,960
I want to work here.

345
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,040
Why would you want to do that?

346
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,160
Life is short.

347
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,420
I want to seize the day.

348
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,440
Do you read books?

349
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,200
Yes, I do.

350
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,320
Whose books do you read?

351
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,120
Fu Yao.

352
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,280
Young lady, I suggest you go home and read Qiong Yao instead.

353
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,200
Thank you, boss.

354
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,130
You're welcome.

355
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,040
Miss Yang.

356
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
What a rare visitor!

357
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,360
Brother Cui.

358
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,640
What brings you here?

359
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,280
Why are you here?

360
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,520
This is our family's shop.

361
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,440
Really?

362
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:07,880
Yes, mainly.

363
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,760
My wife does most of the work.

364
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,320
I don't come here much.

365
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,760
So your wife isn't here?

366
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,440
No, she went to the post office to handle some packages.

367
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,120
She's out?

368
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,920
Yes.

369
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,080
So are you here every day?

370
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,000
No.

371
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,840
I'm just here occasionally.

372
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,000
Right.

373
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,560
I have a new project now.

374
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,200
I'm developing a gear-shifting bicycle.

375
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,960
Let me show you. Hey!

376
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,760
Er Pang!

377
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,200
Come here. This one.

378
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,000
In the market.

379
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,840
Go ahead.

380
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,040
The market only has eight-speed bikes.

381
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,100
I'm developing a sixteen-speed one.

382
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,360
That's incredible!

383
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:48,960
No, no.

384
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,120
How is it that you seem capable of everything?

385
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,280
Not only are you knowledgeable.

386
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,340
But you're also good with your hands.

387
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,330
That's what engineering students do.

388
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,600
I went to Europe recently.

389
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,640
To attend a professional lighting and sound exhibition.

390
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,200
I discovered that European girls.

391
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,120
Think men who can fix all kinds of machinery.

392
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,640
Are the sexiest.

393
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,520
When European men open up a machine.

394
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,480
The girls are like, 'Wow!'

395
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,160
That's so cool.'

396
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
I'm telling you.

397
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,440
My thinking is very similar to European girls'.

398
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,880
I just think.

399
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,760
Men who can handle machinery are the most attractive.

400
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,960
Actually, here in China.

401
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,320
It's pretty much the same.

402
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,040
Around here.

403
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,800
You know.

404
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,560
Look at my dad's generation - men who could make furniture.

405
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,220
That's how he found a wife too.

406
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,320
Sister-in-law!

407
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Miss Yang, the owner of Yese, has been very kind to me.

408
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,560
Sister-in-law!

409
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,320
Hello!

410
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,720
I finally get to meet you.

411
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,240
You're so young and beautiful.

412
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,320
Hello, Miss Yang. You're the one who's young and beautiful.

413
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,980
Your outfit is so stylish too.

414
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,560
Sister-in-law,

415
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,680
you're the beautiful one.

416
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,210
Why else would my brother Cui be so fond of you?

417
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,840
We've been together for years.

418
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,000
Where did you get this outfit?

419
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,040
I haven't seen anything like it around here.

420
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,200
I didn't know we had this style.

421
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,680
I bought it in Italy during my business trip to Europe recently.

422
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,400
No wonder.

423
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,600
But you look good in anything.

424
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,920
With your figure,

425
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,320
everything looks great on you.

426
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,640
Guoming told me

427
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,840
that you used to take special care of him.

428
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,000
You know what, I don't have anything special in my shop,

429
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,840
but please pick a few items and I'll give them to you as gifts.

430
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,600
Then when you wear them,

431
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,920
your girlfriends will ask where you got them, and you can tell them from my shop.

432
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,400
It'll be good for my business.

433
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,720
Sure, no problem.

434
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
Sister-in-law,

435
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,320
I have something to do today.

436
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,850
Can I come back another day?

437
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,840
That's fine.

438
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,120
Well then...

439
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,520
I'll be going now.

440
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,360
Warm send-off!

441
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,000
I mean, not send-off...

442
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,760
I mean warm welcome!

443
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,600
Come again!

444
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,800
Brother Cui, Sister-in-law.

445
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,240
Bye-bye.

446
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,840
Goodbye.

447
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,160
Okay, bye.

448
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,200
Bye-bye.

449
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,040
Come by when you're free.

450
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,570
Really pick out a few items.

451
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,320
Come back again.

452
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,280
This Miss Yang,

453
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
she's beautiful.

454
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,680
Well, she's already thirty, thirty-one.

455
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,000
You remember her age so clearly.

456
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,000
She's still several years younger than me.

457
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,040
Why do you care about her age?

458
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,480
Why shouldn't I care?

459
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,040
Do you believe in women's intuition?

460
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,240
What intuition?

461
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,560
She's interested in you.

462
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,440
Then why are you being so nice to her?

463
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,520
This is a war between women. You wouldn't understand.

464
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Let me tell you,

465
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,420
flies don't land on eggs without cracks.

466
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,800
She's interested in you,

467
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,200
you must have made her feel she has a chance.

468
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,640
I have no cracks.

469
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,640
We're here.

470
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,520
Excuse me.

471
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,250
How could you be more than 20 minutes late?

472
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,920
My bicycle chain fell off.

473
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,720
Couldn't you just put it back on?

474
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,330
This is a geared bicycle my uncle made by hand.

475
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,680
The mechanical structure is too complicated.

476
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,880
I don't know how to fix it.

477
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,440
Your uncle can even make bicycles?

478
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,880
It's one of a kind.

479
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,760
Alright, go wash your hands quickly.

480
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,480
Come back and continue with the lesson.

481
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,280
After class, show me what that bicycle looks like.

482
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,080
Stop laughing.

483
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,520
Alright, quiet down.

484
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,760
What is this?

485
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,240
Don't push.

486
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,000
Students.

487
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,600
This is so cool.

488
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,480
Such incredible craftsmanship.

489
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,560
Except for the wheels,

490
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,760
every single part is handmade.

491
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,120
Just like a luxury car.

492
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,760
What's a luxury car?

493
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,320
Luxury car.

494
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,800
So cool!

495
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,600
I've never ridden in one either.

496
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,360
How's my car?

497
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,200
It's really nice.

498
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,320
But you're not allowed to ride this to school anymore.

499
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,920
It's beautiful.

500
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,290
Erpang, this gear bike keeps slipping its chain lately.

501
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,600
Is your problem really about the bike chain?

502
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,240
How is it my problem?

503
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,440
What's wrong with me?

504
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,000
Your problem is your life keeps falling apart.

505
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,440
I didn't mess up the clothing business this time, did I?

506
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,960
What does it have to do with you?

507
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,280
How many times do you even go there in a month?

508
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:08,920
It's on track now.

509
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,960
Why would I go there?

510
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,890
I'm busy with important business.

511
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,040
I want to discuss something with you.

512
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,840
Go on.

513
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,330
I've seen many factories about to close down.

514
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,360
Lots of lathes are sitting idle.

515
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,520
Continue.

516
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,120
I just need to apply for some funding.

517
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,040
No.

518
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,840
It's just a few thousand yuan.

519
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,680
No.

520
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,960
If I finish it sooner,

521
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,800
I can apply for a patent.

522
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,600
No.

523
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,680
You really don't respect intellectual property.

524
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,440
Have you respected your promises?

525
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,760
You initially agreed to invest 10,000 yuan.

526
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,560
Don't think I don't know.

527
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,320
You've already put in all your pocket money,

528
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,680
book money, and BBQ money.

529
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,120
You've already invested about 20,000 now, right?

530
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,520
It's just a matter of tens of thousands.

531
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
Soon you'll...

532
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,440
Just be quiet.

533
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,800
Liu Ye's acupuncture massage shop is about to open.

534
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,200
It's one thing if you're just messing around yourself,

535
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,960
but you've dragged your buddy into this mess too.

536
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,160
How did I drag him in?

537
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,920
He'll definitely make money.

538
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,180
What if he loses money?

539
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,000
His whole family is involved.

540
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,880
If they lose money, how will you explain yourself?

541
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,160
That's exactly why his whole family is involved.

542
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
He won't lose money.

543
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,040
He'll definitely profit.

544
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,560
No hired staff means no labor costs.

545
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,160
If he can't earn back that cheap rent in a year,

546
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,620
then they must be stabbing their customers.

547
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,440
When you put it that way, it makes some sense.

548
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,440
Of course it does.

549
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,320
I'll borrow a few hundred from Liu Ye later.

550
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,360
How did you get in here?

551
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,240
I didn't see anything.

552
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,920
What's going on?

553
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,800
You did see something.

554
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,000
I didn't.

555
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,640
Why didn't you knock?

556
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
I forgot.

557
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,100
Stop arguing and come out.

558
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,360
What if she saw me?

559
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,020
What's happening? Come here.

560
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,640
What's wrong?

561
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,800
I was using the bathroom,

562
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,600
and she came in without knocking.

563
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,000
He saw everything.

564
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,840
No, I didn't.

565
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,840
So what if she saw you?

566
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,480
You want her to take responsibility and marry you?

567
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,560
No way.

568
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,400
See? Then forget about it.

569
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,920
It's fine. No big deal.

570
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,200
It was just a glance.

571
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:01,480
What happened?

572
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,160
It's not a big deal.

573
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,160
Come here.

574
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,960
Didn't you say you liked a pair of shoes last time?

575
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,160
No, I was just talking.

576
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,090
Let's go shopping tomorrow and I'll buy them for you.

577
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,120
No need, really.

578
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,800
Be good. We'll go buy shoes tomorrow.

579
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,840
What about Mengmeng?

580
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,360
Of course we'll buy the same ones for her too.

581
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,000
Let's go. Don't cry anymore.

582
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,240
Sir! Sir!

583
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,920
Please come in, please come in.

584
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,450
Alright!

585
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,200
Come in, come in.

586
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,160
Let's go.

587
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,000
A lifetime ago.

588
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,760
Well,

589
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,840
Guoming and Liu Ye are good friends.

590
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,530
We're good friends too.

591
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,560
Well, I'm here to be your first customer today.

592
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,040
I've got this chronic back pain.

593
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,370
I'm counting on you.

594
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,410
Do you believe in traditional Chinese medicine?

595
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,400
Of course I believe it.

596
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,080
I don't really believe it.

597
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,880
Why not?

598
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,490
We had so many great masters in ancient times,

599
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,440
like Hua Tuo,

600
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,920
Bian Que and others.

601
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,800
Why weren't their medical skills passed down?

602
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,080
Not to mention those miracle pills from martial arts novels.

603
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,240
They just got lost over time.

604
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,440
Then why didn't food recipes get lost?

605
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,920
Even the tofu pudding vendor across the street

606
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,840
claims to have an ancestral secret recipe.

607
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Not to mention all those delicious dishes at your Dingqing Restaurant.

608
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,360
The recipes of Dingqing Restaurant are almost lost.

609
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,420
That can't happen.

610
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,440
Why not?

611
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,240
Trust me,

612
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,320
it's absolutely impossible.

613
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,120
Explain.

614
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,200
Because these dishes actually existed,

615
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,560
unlike Hua Tuo or Bian Que who might be legends.

616
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,800
Fair point.

617
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,140
I dare you to never see a Chinese doctor in your life.

618
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,240
I don't see Western doctors either.

619
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,200
I'm healthy.

620
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,720
Let me tell you something.

621
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,360
Next time you mess up someone's tattoo and get beaten up,

622
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,040
with your leg broken,

623
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,920
don't go to Western doctors either.

624
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,840
Cui, wish me some good luck.

625
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,800
Why should I wish you well?

626
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,520
Do you have any sense?

627
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,520
They just opened today,

628
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,960
and you're here gossiping.

629
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,120
Let's talk privately.

630
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,650
What do you mean privately?

631
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,440
Let me tell you,

632
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,170
you really shouldn't doubt it.

633
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,040
Our factory director's father was bedridden for six years.

634
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,360
He needed help with everything, even using the bathroom.

635
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,400
This old doctor here,

636
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,239
with just one acupuncture needle,

637
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,320
made him jump right out of bed.

638
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,420
Then he climbed onto the roof.

639
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,000
Disappeared in a flash,

640
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,460
leaping across rooftops.

641
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,130
He hasn't come back yet.

642
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,000
Stop joking.

643
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,159
I'm not joking.

644
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,199
Where did he go?

645
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,360
How would I know?

646
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,489
I can't leap across rooftops. Can you?

647
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,719
I can't either.

648
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,920
So you believe me now?

649
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,440
You're messing with me.

650
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,520
Exactly.

651
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,080
Is it true or not?

652
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,280
Let me put it this way.

653
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,320
People, if they concentrate their minds,

654
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,000
can reach heaven or dive into earth.

655
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,000
Nothing is impossible.

656
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,560
Think about it yourself.

657
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,560
Mengmeng.

658
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,240
Look what Mom bought for you.

659
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,600
What's this?

660
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,400
Is it cool?

661
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,880
This color is clean and pretty.

662
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,040
What's this?

663
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:49,640
These are Xiaoxue's.

664
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,240
They're exactly like yours.

665
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,360
How pretty!

666
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,880
I don't want these shoes.

667
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,680
Why not?

668
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,880
Just try them on.

669
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,960
I won't. There's another pair here.

670
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,480
Let her try them if someone has to.

671
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,240
Why is this child so disobedient?

672
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,770
How am I being disobedient?

673
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,240
You can force me to wear whatever shoes?

674
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:08,960
Are you my mother?

675
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,440
Can you force me to wear something I don't like?

676
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,700
Be good and try them on.

677
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,520
These shoes are so pretty.

678
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,200
This is this year's trendy style.

679
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,120
Exactly.

680
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,200
I don't like it.

681
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,680
Don't force me.

682
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,880
Why are you being like this?

683
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,800
This is how I am.

684
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,240
I just don't like these shoes.

685
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,840
I'm going to throw them away.

686
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,580
Can't control you for one day.

687
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:43,920
Xiaoxue.

688
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,960
Xiaoxue.

689
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,600
Xiaoxue.

690
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,320
Why are you sitting on the ground?

691
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,440
It's so cold.

692
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,160
Let's go home.

693
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,760
Xiaoxue, be good.

694
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
Come home with me.

695
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,120
I won't go back.

696
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,680
That's not my home.

697
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,840
This is my home.

698
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,040
Well, I

699
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,640
want to apologize to you on Mengmeng's behalf.

700
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,500
When we get back, I'll talk to her.

701
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,840
Okay?

702
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,880
No.

703
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
It's me. I'm just a burden.

704
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,640
I'm affecting your family.

705
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,000
Why would you say that?

706
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,920
Don't think like that.

707
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,240
This isn't my home.

708
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,000
I have my own home.

709
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,000
How can I let you live here alone?

710
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,220
Your father is my good friend.

711
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,570
If you act like this,

712
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,850
your father will never be able to get out of there if he finds out.

713
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,540
He'd die of worry in there.

714
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,410
If for nothing else,

715
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,800
do it for your father.

716
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,810
Let's go home, okay?

717
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,520
Okay.

718
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,520
Look, the power is out.

719
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,040
Let's go.

720
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,680
Come on.

721
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,400
Watch your step.

722
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,720
Where did this dog come from?

723
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,400
I found it on the road just now.

724
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,560
I'm sorry, Mengmeng.

725
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,920
It's my fault.

726
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,600
Today was really my mistake.

727
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,120
Give each other a hug.

728
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,260
What about the dog?

729
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,000
We already have three kids at home.

730
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,130
And now another dog.

731
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,200
Yes, what do you think?

732
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,850
Why don't we give it away tomorrow?

733
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,600
Let's not do that.

734
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,000
I think Xiaoxue brought this dog home

735
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,040
because her fate and this dog's

736
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,100
are quite similar.

737
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,320
If you give it away now,

738
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,240
won't she be hurt again?

739
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,000
Let's leave it for now.

740
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,120
Tomorrow we'll go look at houses.

741
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,680
I guess that's all we can do.

742
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,360
Are you tired?

743
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,920
I'll prepare some water for you to soak your feet tonight.

744
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,580
No, I'll get some water for your feet.

745
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,880
My head hurts.

746
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,480
Then I'll...

747
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,320
I'll wash your hair for you.

748
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,160
Thank you, wife.

749
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,200
This 126-square-meter three-bedroom apartment

750
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,080
is the largest unit we have here.

751
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
Do you have any four-bedroom units?

752
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,480
Four bedrooms?

753
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,680
In our new development,

754
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,140
this is already the largest unit available.

755
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,680
Why do you need four bedrooms?

756
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,010
We have three children.

757
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,680
Three children.

758
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,360
Do you

759
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,360
raise so many children?

760
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,360
How do you manage it?

761
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,160
Ask him.

762
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,600
It's actually not a problem.

763
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,120
When the children are older,

764
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,640
boys can share one room

765
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,760
and girls another.

766
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,360
No way.

767
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:11,720
Besides,

768
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,650
they're not biological siblings.

769
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,560
What's wrong with this?

770
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,000
I've been riding for so long and the chain hasn't fallen off.

771
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,330
See? It works just fine.

772
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,130
Take two more steps and it'll fall off.

773
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,720
What's going on?

774
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,960
What happened to him?

775
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,760
He died.

776
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,800
How did he die?

777
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,970
Sudden vascular tumor.

778
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,400
Wait a minute.
