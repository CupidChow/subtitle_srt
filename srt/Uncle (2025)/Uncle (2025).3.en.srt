1
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,880
Uncle.

2
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,920
Uncle, I'm here.

3
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,800
No rush.

4
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,360
I know Dapao.

5
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,120
He would never kill anyone.

6
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,880
This matter will be fine.

7
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,360
Nothing bad will happen.

8
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,420
Don't make yourself sick with anger.

9
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,479
Are you just eating noodles?

10
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,720
This won't do, Xiaoxue.

11
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,680
You're still growing.

12
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,800
Your grandfather isn't well either.

13
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,200
You both need to eat something nutritious.

14
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,720
I'll leave this money here first.

15
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,079
I'll figure out how to get the rest later.

16
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,900
I need to discuss something with you.

17
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,680
Didn't I just give you 200 this morning?

18
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,800
I wasn't talking about money.

19
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,440
Just tell me how much you need.

20
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,680
This time...

21
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,400
I might need quite a bit.

22
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,520
My classmate...

23
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,760
Guo Dapao is in trouble again.

24
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
I was thinking...

25
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,900
He's in trouble again?

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,120
No, no.

27
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,520
Well, this time...

28
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,520
It's more serious.

29
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,050
He's been wrongly accused.

30
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,480
Let me tell you something.

31
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,640
You can help anyone else.

32
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,880
But you absolutely cannot get involved with Guo Dapao.

33
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,720
Do you hear me?

34
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,520
Really...

35
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,800
Always hanging around with that butcher.

36
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,730
Birds of a feather flock together.

37
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,000
The butcher...

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,260
What did he ever do to offend you? Really.

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,440
On the night of the 17th,

40
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,280
which was early morning of the 18th,

41
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,140
where were you?

42
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,160
I went home.

43
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
Really went home.

44
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,130
Think again carefully.

45
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,620
Did you go somewhere else?

46
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,000
Look, sir,

47
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,400
I have a father at home,

48
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,240
and a daughter,

49
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,880
they can both vouch for me.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,200
Let me give you a hint.

51
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,690
Did you go to the riverside?

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,640
Yes, I did.

53
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,720
But I went there the next morning.

54
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,200
It was at what time...

55
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,960
Mao hour.

56
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,680
What did you do at the riverside?

57
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,170
I burned some paper offerings.

58
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,920
In my life,

59
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,680
I've accumulated too many blood debts.

60
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,160
Why did you burn paper offerings?

61
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,399
To cleanse the blood debts on my hands.

62
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,200
What blood debts do you have on your hands?

63
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,000
Well, I'm a pig butcher.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,520
So don't I have many blood debts on my hands?

65
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,840
At that time,

66
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,880
did you have a boning knife in your hand?

67
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,680
Yes, I did.

68
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:33,880
Where's the knife?

69
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,140
I threw it in the river.

70
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,720
Why did you throw it away?

71
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,480
This is the only way

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,960
I can clear my blood debt completely.

73
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,920
Fine.

74
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,020
Tell me about your blood debt.

75
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,240
I'm

76
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,560
a pork seller.

77
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,159
I don't kill the pigs myself,

78
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,640
but they die because of me.

79
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,040
Those butchers who actually kill the pigs,

80
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,600
they only slaughter because I need to sell.

81
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,000
But those who buy the meat

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,960
pay me for it.

83
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,200
So in the end,

84
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,920
the sins from both sides fall on me alone.

85
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,840
I need to clear this.

86
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,100
There are too many souls I'm indebted to.

87
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,960
Then why did you suddenly

88
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,200
decide that morning

89
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,480
to go to the riverside to burn paper money,

90
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,160
throw away a knife and wash your hands?

91
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,160
I seriously consulted a master.

92
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
He did a divination for me.

93
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,600
Tomorrow at dawn,

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,280
walk toward the east,

95
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,560
stop when you reach the river,

96
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,840
burn yellow prayer paper,

97
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,960
three sheets,

98
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,690
after the ashes rise to the sky,

99
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,600
sink

100
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,480
the butcher knife into the river,

101
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,560
then

102
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,280
wash your hands in the river water and light an incense.

103
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,680
Only then can you change your fate.

104
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,920
That master is so accurate.

105
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,120
He told me

106
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,280
as long as I solve this matter,

107
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,480
I'll have

108
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,280
a life free from want,

109
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,880
and in my later years I'll become famous

110
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,810
and renowned throughout the land.

111
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,240
Become famous

112
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,320
and renowned.

113
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,680
Where is this master?

114
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,200
It's right by the Songhua River.

115
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,720
He's a blind man.

116
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,560
When you go there, if you want your fortune told,

117
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,240
just look for him. He's incredibly accurate.

118
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,760
You know about that female corpse

119
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,490
that was fished out of the river

120
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,520
near here, don't you?

121
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,240
Of course I know.

122
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,040
What about it?

123
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:07,960
Well,

124
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,360
you're now the prime suspect.

125
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,560
We need to take you into custody.

126
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,410
We've searched all over North Bank

127
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,680
and found nothing.

128
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,480
This guy is playing us.

129
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,240
This place?

130
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,560
Who would set up a stall here?

131
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,200
Who would tell fortunes here?

132
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,520
What a made-up ghost story.

133
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
Let's go back.

134
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,180
We have our own protocols.

135
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,159
Technically speaking,

136
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:43,720
I shouldn't be

137
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,680
revealing so many case details to you.

138
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,540
Do you think Guo Dapao has the guts

139
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,770
to kill someone?

140
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,920
When we investigate cases,

141
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,000
we follow five key elements:

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,240
time, place, object, matter, and person.

143
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,440
To determine if someone is suspicious,

144
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,159
we must start with these five elements.

145
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,760
First are time and place.

146
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,720
Dapao claims he never left home,

147
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,080
but several witnesses

148
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,880
saw him by the river,

149
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
almost exactly where the body was found.

150
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,920
He was just caught at a massage parlor.

151
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,720
And another young woman is dead.

152
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,260
That knife he used,

153
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,720
the one he's had for over ten years,

154
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,840
how is it such a coincidence

155
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
that he threw it away just like that?

156
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,640
Finally,

157
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,920
let's talk about the suspect.

158
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,600
According to forensic analysis,

159
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,480
the killer handled the knife with extreme skill,

160
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,520
must be either a surgeon or a butcher.

161
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,400
Time, place, weapon, person -

162
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,440
everything matches him.

163
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,760
If we don't detain him,

164
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,840
it would definitely be our mistake.

165
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,120
No, listen to my explanation.

166
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,050
This is my fault.

167
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,960
I thought he was having

168
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,360
some psychological issues lately.

169
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,640
I told him to find a fortune teller

170
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,600
to break his bad luck.

171
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,560
He did all this

172
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,760
because the fortune teller

173
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,800
told him to do so.

174
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,920
Did you actually see him get his fortune told?

175
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,400
No.

176
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,720
Even if you saw him get his fortune told,

177
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
can you prove he didn't kill anyone?

178
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,280
No.

179
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,600
Then that settles it.

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,080
You should stay out of this matter.

181
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,520
You don't understand criminal investigation

182
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
or the law.

183
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,760
Just based on brotherhood,

184
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,120
you want to prove his innocence?

185
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,280
Do you think that's possible?

186
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,760
I've said too much already. I'm almost breaking the rules.

187
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,000
I can't discuss these case details with you.

188
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,200
Then tell me,

189
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,440
what should I do?

190
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,220
If you really want to help,

191
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,000
go find a lawyer.

192
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,040
Follow the standard procedure.

193
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,680
Uncle never imagined

194
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,720
that a casual joke

195
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,280
would land Guo Dapao in prison.

196
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,320
And because of this, he spent decades running around.

197
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,120
Goodbye.

198
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,810
Hello, is Attorney Zhao in?

199
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,440
Do you have an appointment?

200
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,040
Yes, I do.

201
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,770
I made an appointment by phone.

202
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,559
My surname is Cui.

203
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,120
Follow me.

204
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,480
Okay.

205
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,059
Attorney Zhao,

206
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,240
Mr. Cui is here.

207
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,420
Hello, Attorney Zhao.

208
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,520
I was referred here by my classmate,

209
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
Officer Zeng.

210
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,600
It's a homicide case, isn't it?

211
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,400
Yes, it is.

212
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,880
But it's definitely a wrongful conviction.

213
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,120
Whether it's a wrongful conviction or not,

214
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,560
your opinion alone doesn't determine that.

215
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,240
Right.

216
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,000
That's why I'm here to hire you.

217
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,330
You understand my fees, right?

218
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,080
I do,

219
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,920
but not completely.

220
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,640
Take him outside to discuss the details first.

221
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,440
Okay.

222
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,840
Mr. Cui,

223
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,720
our fees work like this.

224
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,120
Investigation phase: 3,000 to 10,000.

225
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,080
Review phase: 3,000 to 10,000.

226
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,320
Trial phase: 3,000 to 20,000.

227
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,940
So we're in the investigation phase now?

228
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,640
Yes.

229
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,040
Does it matter if we win or lose

230
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,280
the case?

231
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,960
It's the difference between 3,000 to 10,000

232
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,720
and 3,000 to 20,000.

233
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,720
So no matter what kind of case,

234
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,640
as long as Attorney Zhao shows up,

235
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,000
it starts at 3,000?

236
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,680
You understand perfectly.

237
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Mr. Cui,

238
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,280
our fee structure

239
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,520
works exactly like that.

240
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,320
If you hire us for your case,

241
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,000
we charge 3,000 upfront.

242
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,600
This price might seem a bit high,

243
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,730
but at the same time,

244
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,660
doesn't it come with a higher chance of winning?

245
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,280
Makes sense.

246
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,800
That's why they say

247
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,160
our Brother Cui is something special.

248
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,600
Three notices in total,

249
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,760
and he's mentioned in every one.

250
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,320
Impressive.

251
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,320
Suspended,

252
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,600
not fired.

253
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,800
I think

254
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,100
with a change of environment,

255
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,320
Brother Cui,

256
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,440
you'll be better off.

257
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,560
Uncle started his professional singing career

258
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,200
to pay for Guo Dapao's legal fees.

259
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,280
I didn't expect

260
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,000
you'd actually call me.

261
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,320
Yeah, I thought about it after I got home.

262
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,520
I figured I might as well do something

263
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,120
so I

264
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,890
decided to give it a try.

265
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,480
I really appreciate your stage presence

266
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,480
and performance skills.

267
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,440
Thank you.

268
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,840
It's not just me who thinks so,

269
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,240
everyone agrees.

270
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,560
When people here heard you were coming,

271
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,280
they got really excited.

272
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,280
I'm nowhere near as good as the professionals.

273
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,480
You've never had professional training?

274
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,360
No.

275
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,960
My mother works in the arts,

276
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,320
so my sister and I probably

277
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,360
watched her sing and dance

278
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,620
quite a lot growing up.

279
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,520
Many people nowadays like listening to

280
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
Cantonese songs.

281
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,640
How's your Cantonese?

282
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,080
It's okay.

283
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,560
What do you mean by 'okay'?

284
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,080
It's only good enough for communicating with other Northeasterners.

285
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,560
What about talking with Cantonese people?

286
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,620
They'd have to guess what I'm saying.

287
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,720
Okay.

288
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
So what are your thoughts on salary?

289
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,240
I don't know,

290
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,960
I've never done this job before.

291
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,400
Anyway, I'm not

292
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,800
here to earn money for my wife and kids.

293
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,400
So just

294
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,840
pay whatever you think is fair.

295
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,920
You're married?

296
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,200
At my age, who isn't married?

297
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,130
You're not married?

298
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:38,920
I'm sorry,

299
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,680
I

300
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,680
was being a bit rude.

301
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,540
There's nothing rude about that.

302
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm divorced.

303
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,600
Have been for a while.

304
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,570
That's fine.

305
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,400
I don't have children.

306
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,360
That's just

307
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,640
how life goes.

308
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,780
So here's the deal:

309
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,800
300 per show,

310
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
and if there are song requests with flower baskets,

311
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,200
you get an extra 20 per song.

312
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,930
Is that okay?

313
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,920
That's great!

314
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,680
Sounds good.

315
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,170
Alright.

316
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,520
Take this.

317
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,240
No, I can't.

318
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,480
I haven't started working yet.

319
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,520
How can I take your money now?

320
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,160
No.

321
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,800
It's just in case

322
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,490
we can't find you later.

323
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,200
Take it.

324
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,840
This is a bit embarrassing.

325
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,440
Just take it already.

326
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,360
Okay.

327
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,760
Alright, then,

328
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,480
thank you.

329
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,560
So I'll

330
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,240
be going now.

331
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,480
You really came to work here.

332
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,160
Good for you.

333
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,520
Okay, I'll be going now.

334
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
You two carry on.

335
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,760
I have one last question

336
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,560
I'd like to ask you.

337
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,160
Go ahead.

338
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,440
Why did you come here to sing?

339
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,160
To be honest,

340
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,840
I need to make money.

341
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,000
Your family needs money?

342
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,720
My family needs it too,

343
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
but my friends need it even more,

344
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,120
so I'm in a bit of a hurry.

345
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,520
Here's to

346
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,060
a pleasant working relationship ahead.

347
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,640
Happy working together.

348
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,440
Who gave you this pager?

349
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,600
A friend.

350
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,120
Wow, friends give these as gifts?

351
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,050
Of course. That's how popular I am.

352
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,400
Is it good, Mengmeng?

353
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,850
It's delicious.

354
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,000
Why did you suddenly decide

355
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,280
to make so many tasty dishes today?

356
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,360
I'm in a good mood.

357
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,040
Let me see how tall you've grown.

358
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,060
Stand up straight.

359
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,720
Wow, look at this.

360
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:40,960
In just six months,

361
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,120
it's grown about 10 centimeters.

362
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,580
You're at this height now.

363
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,340
By the time you reach here,

364
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,680
our family will have

365
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,740
bought a Xiali car.

366
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,960
Then I better grow taller quickly.

367
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,160
Well, eat up then.

368
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,920
Working overtime

369
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,650
gives you this much allowance?

370
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,840
This thing,

371
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,880
you know,

372
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,600
you have to stay up all night.

373
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,480
They have to give compensation.

374
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,400
Really.

375
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,320
Uncle!

376
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,200
Come quickly!

377
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,460
Grandma is having heart problems again.

378
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,240
Patient's family,

379
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,170
please come out.

380
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,020
You're the patient's son.

381
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,760
Well,

382
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,880
you should prepare

383
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,340
what needs to be prepared.

384
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,200
Optimistically speaking,

385
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,660
there's still a week left.

386
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,080
And pessimistically?

387
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,520
Anytime.

388
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,340
You need to pay a 10,000 yuan deposit for hospitalization.

389
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,600
If I die...

390
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,480
Who's going to take care of Erpang?

391
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,680
Your father is just a grumpy old man.

392
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,760
How could he possibly take care of children?

393
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,000
Mom, you still have me.

394
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,560
It'll be hard on you.

395
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,720
Taking care of three kids all by yourself.

396
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,160
Mom?

397
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,420
Aren't there just two?

398
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,800
There's also Guoming.

399
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,079
He may be in his thirties.

400
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,760
But he's still so immature.

401
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
Should I call my sister to come back?

402
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,440
Dad?

403
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,520
Miss Yang?

404
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,740
I'd like to request some time off.

405
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,280
Okay.

406
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,050
Okay. Thank you, Miss Yang.

407
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,640
Mom?

408
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,880
Mom?

409
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,680
It's Xiaohong.

410
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,680
I've come back to see you, Mom.

411
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,440
I'm back, Mom.

412
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,600
Mom?

413
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,120
Mom.

414
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,040
Thank you.

415
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,720
Whose child are you?

416
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,600
Your child.

417
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,200
What?

418
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,480
I heard

419
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,340
that you're my mother.

420
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,240
From the photos,

421
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,970
you really look like my mom.

422
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,480
Xiaoyang.

423
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,440
Erpang.

424
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,760
I am...

425
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,880
You...

426
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,400
Mom is gone.

427
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,560
For Dad,

428
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,120
our family has fallen apart.

429
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,610
Don't you want to come back?

430
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,960
If I'm here,

431
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,480
the family won't fall apart?

432
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,540
How did I go abroad in the first place?

433
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,760
I forgot.

434
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,960
Cui Xiaohong.

435
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,000
Have you ever considered

436
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,920
coming back?

437
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,420
What would I come back for?

438
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,450
I'm worried Mengmeng will argue with him.

439
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,360
She won't. He wouldn't dare.

440
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,320
Mengmeng would dare.

441
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,380
Don't you know your own daughter?

442
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,640
He's a boy.

443
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,040
And he's your own nephew.

444
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,200
Give him a heads-up beforehand

445
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
not to take Mengmeng too seriously.

446
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,490
You don't know Erpang well enough.

447
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,120
As long as you don't touch his food,

448
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,680
you could burn him with cigarettes

449
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,280
and he wouldn't make a sound.

450
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,560
So you'll have dinner at home tonight?

451
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,120
Who's staying with the patient?

452
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,040
Xiaohong.

453
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,520
Your sister is back.

454
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,460
Why didn't you tell me?

455
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,050
How is she doing?

456
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,090
Fine. She's doing well.

457
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,440
Why aren't you eating your vegetables?

458
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,320
Mom,

459
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,440
there are no more ribs.

460
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,880
He ate them all.

461
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
Look, he only eats meat

462
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,940
and no vegetables.

463
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,880
I did eat vegetables.

464
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,520
You didn't eat any vegetables at all.

465
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,920
I only had one rib.

466
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,080
Alright,

467
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,040
I'll make more ribs tomorrow. Problem solved.

468
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,720
But what am I supposed to eat today?

469
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,080
There are still a few ribs left.

470
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,920
You can have them all.

471
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,580
I'm not eating his leftovers.

472
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,160
Is this okay with you?

473
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,260
What if I dip my hand

474
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,640
in the soup and swish it around?

475
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,500
Would that satisfy your craving?

476
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,720
This child...

477
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,720
You took my teddy bear.

478
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,280
I didn't touch your bear.

479
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,960
Yes, you did.

480
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,400
It was just on the bed.

481
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,520
I really didn't.

482
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,050
I wasn't even near your bed.

483
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,200
Let's eat.

484
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,600
What's wrong?

485
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,400
Mom, he's always touching my things.

486
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,860
He didn't do it on purpose.

487
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,720
He's your cousin.

488
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,580
How can you speak to him like that?

489
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,560
How did I end up with a cousin like him?

490
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,040
He's as fat as a pig.

491
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,440
Watch your language.

492
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,760
That poor child.

493
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,320
His parents aren't around.

494
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,920
Shouldn't we be nicer to him?

495
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,600
What?

496
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,400
Just because his parents aren't around,

497
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,330
he gets to steal my parents from me?

498
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,880
Lower your voice.

499
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,960
Be good.

500
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,640
Snow weighs down bamboo branches,

501
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,120
So low they almost touch the mud.

502
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,440
But when the red sun rises,

503
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,400
They stand tall again, reaching for the sky.

504
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,880
Sister.

505
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,840
Mengmeng, this is your aunt.

506
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,440
Say hello to her.

507
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,360
Auntie.

508
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,760
This is Mengmeng.

509
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,360
She's grown so much.

510
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,400
Perfect figure.

511
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,930
Sister-in-law.

512
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,800
Come.

513
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,760
Come.

514
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,730
Sister-in-law,

515
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,280
I have a gift for you.

516
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,720
Sister, what are you doing?

517
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,920
We're family, there's no need for this.

518
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,040
Take it. It's for you.

519
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,840
I bought this when you

520
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,400
married Guoming.

521
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,420
I've been thinking of you.

522
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,100
Thank you, sister.

523
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,840
Take a look.

524
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,440
This is too extravagant.

525
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,240
It has over 100 years of history.

526
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,740
Thank you, sister.

527
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,860
It will look beautiful on you.

528
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,120
When I'm not around,

529
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,920
it's all up to you to take care of our parents.

530
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,180
You've worked so hard.

531
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,800
To be honest,

532
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,680
Our parents

533
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,680
take care of us

534
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,340
more than we take care of them.

535
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,120
You see, when I'm not here

536
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,760
and Guoming is so careless,

537
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,290
you're like a daughter to them.

538
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,280
Mom and Dad treat me like their own daughter,

539
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,740
no doubt about it, sister.

540
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,600
That's good.

541
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,920
Enough talk.

542
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,370
Mom said she wants to eat my special cabbage dish,

543
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,000
I'll go make it for her.

544
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,260
Go ahead. I'll keep an eye on things here.

545
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,600
Don't worry.

546
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,440
My dear.

547
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,040
You've been with me all my life.

548
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,340
Thank you for everything.

549
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,200
I'll come find you.

550
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,720
Dad.

551
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,810
How will you manage on your own?

552
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:52,920
Why don't

553
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,410
you go live with Guoming's family?

554
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,360
Guoming's family of three

555
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,890
is already cramped enough.

556
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,600
I'd better not impose on them.

557
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,300
I'm still strong and healthy.

558
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Don't need anyone to take care of me.

559
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,770
I still need to work.

560
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,920
Even if I didn't work,

561
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,250
I wouldn't know how to take care of a child.

562
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,320
Poor Erpang.

563
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,050
I'm quite busy overseas every day.

564
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,280
The key issue is that right now

565
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,400
I can't bring Erpang over there.

566
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,880
I never expected

567
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,660
you to take care of Erpang.

568
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
In all my years,

569
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,260
I've seen fathers who don't care about their children,

570
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,760
but mothers who don't care about their children,

571
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,520
I have

572
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,780
never seen before.

573
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,240
When are you going back?

574
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,720
Tomorrow.

575
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,120
Guoming,

576
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,400
I'll send 1,000 yuan home every month from now on.

577
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,260
Is that enough?

578
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,720
1,500.

579
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,960
Why are you in such a hurry to go back abroad?

580
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,560
Is your house on fire?

581
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,360
All these years you didn't come back,

582
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
I can understand.

583
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,600
Even if I don't, there's nothing I can do.

584
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,480
But overseas,

585
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,680
they do sell paper and pens, don't they?

586
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,880
You still have hands.

587
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,000
Would writing a letter kill you?

588
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,760
Or have you forgotten how to write Chinese?

589
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,920
You know what,

590
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,960
just leave.

591
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,420
Don't bother coming for dinner tonight.

592
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,440
Look, Erpang now

593
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,560
doesn't even dare to look at you.

594
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,000
I am...

595
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,000
I'm your mother.

596
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,480
Why won't you look at me?

597
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,760
When you were here,

598
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,600
I didn't think much of it.

599
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,320
When you leave.

600
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,240
I feel

601
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,040
so empty inside.

602
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,170
Here are your

603
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,880
sneakers.

604
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,440
Thanks.

605
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,400
Who are you thanking?

606
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,660
Thank you, Mom.

607
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,560
Louder.

608
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,520
Thank you, Mom.

609
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,440
I'll always be your mother.

610
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,740
What are you doing?

611
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,680
Guoming is so unhealthy.

612
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,360
He needs to watch his diet.

613
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,960
You should eat some vegetables too.

614
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,480
Look, this time

615
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I exchanged some RMB at the airport.

616
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:39,920
What are you

617
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,280
doing with this?

618
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,880
What's this for?

619
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,840
No, no.

620
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,880
Take it.

621
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,080
Money doesn't come easy.

622
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
What's wrong with taking some money?

623
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,240
Don't be so stingy in front of the child.

624
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,880
Take it back.

625
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,000
I really can't accept it.

626
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,640
It's only right.

627
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,920
Take it.

628
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,920
Erpang.

629
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,480
Enemy at six o'clock.

630
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,820
Throw the grenade!

631
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,640
Throw!

632
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,800
Yes, sir!

633
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,560
So...

634
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,820
I have some classmates

635
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,400
who say we haven't met for over ten years

636
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,460
and want to meet up.

637
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,520
You need to lose weight.

638
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,050
Look how fat you've gotten.

639
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,520
I think your sister definitely

640
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,000
has many untold troubles.

641
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,570
What did you say?

642
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,860
I'm telling you

643
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,340
your sister must have many things she can't talk about.

644
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,580
She's had many untold troubles since she was young.

645
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,040
Why don't we have so many

646
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,840
secrets?

647
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,280
[Clink]

648
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,290
Let's have a drink. Come on.

649
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,780
Let's drink together.

650
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,000
Thank you.

651
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,880
Listen to me.

652
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,370
If it weren't for you back then,

653
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,200
stealing that money from home for me,

654
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,520
how could I have gone abroad?

655
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,640
How could I have

656
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,640
this good life now?

657
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,360
As long as you're doing well,

658
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,360
I'm happy.

659
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,920
The beating I took at home back then

660
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,680
was worth it.

661
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,540
You got beaten?

662
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,240
Where did you steal all that money from?

663
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,520
All for you.

664
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:56,960
No.

665
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,720
Listen to me.

666
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,480
I feel terrible inside.

667
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,440
You know?

668
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,680
What's wrong?

669
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,560
My mother passed away.

670
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,920
My mother

671
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,530
never enjoyed much happiness in her life.

672
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,880
She's gone.

673
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,800
[Sob]

674
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,840
Do you understand what I mean?

675
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,120
I feel so awful inside.

676
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,880
My mother is gone.

677
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,680
In this whole wide world,

678
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,680
I can't find anyone to talk to.

679
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,520
Someone to talk to.

680
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,280
I'm here.

681
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
Always have been.

682
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,080
You all eat first.

683
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,680
I'll go find Cui Xiaohong.

684
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,120
Let's eat.

685
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,640
Oh my!

686
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,320
I'm here.

687
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,240
What the hell?

688
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,450
About your brother,

689
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,720
you really need to control him.

690
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,000
His temper is way too explosive.

691
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,920
Why does he resort to violence?

692
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,760
My brother beat you up?

693
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
What? Beat me?

694
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,600
How could he possibly beat me?

695
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,520
Why did my brother

696
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,980
Why did my brother hit you?

697
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,080
Well,

698
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,719
we were talking about you.

699
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,800
We had a misunderstanding,

700
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,920
and then he started fighting.

701
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,000
Talking about me?

702
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,080
What about?

703
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,440
What were you saying about me?

704
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,600
Just that

705
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,480
life abroad hasn't been easy for you.

706
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,239
Come on,

707
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,320
let's drink.

708
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,719
A toast to your hard times abroad.

709
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,120
Cheers.

710
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,040
Hong.

711
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,600
Don't get so close.

712
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
It's irritating.

713
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,679
Later,

714
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,080
how are you getting back?

715
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,360
I have a modest car.

716
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,489
I can give you a ride.

717
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,720
You'll drive me?

718
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,840
I'll drive you.

719
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,880
And then?

720
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,840
Then,

721
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,620
we could go to my place and chat a bit more.

722
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,600
Get lost!

723
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,440
I know why my brother beat you up.

724
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,480
I know why my brother hit you.

725
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,600
What did you just say?

726
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,130
Nothing.

727
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,600
Have a drink.

728
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,160
Oh my,

729
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,840
you've had too much.

730
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,360
You can't hold your liquor.

731
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,160
Come on, let's drink.

732
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,520
Come on,

733
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,760
let's drink.

734
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,600
Cheers!

735
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,520
Drink up.

736
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,120
That song is mine.

737
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,760
Don't sing it.

738
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,760
That's my song.

739
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,360
It's nothing.

740
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,480
Can someone play it again for me?

741
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,160
Play it again.

742
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,450
You're eating too fast.

743
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,120
They don't have this abroad.

744
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,360
The taste from childhood is still the best.

745
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,280
When we were little,

746
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,040
we used to wrap it up bit by bit.

747
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,120
Now you

748
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,610
must be really wealthy.

749
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,900
You don't understand.

750
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,690
Every bite I take is one less I'll have.

751
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,040
Does Erpang visit Huo Dongfeng often?

752
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,920
About three or four times

753
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,080
a year.

754
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,200
What about you?

755
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,400
I used to go often,

756
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,320
but they've changed the rules recently.

757
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,580
Only immediate family

758
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,440
can visit now.

759
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,720
He's your sister's husband.

760
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,320
How is that not immediate family?

761
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,120
Is he really my brother-in-law?

762
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,480
Legally, no,

763
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,560
but in reality, he is.

764
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,320
Not really, even in reality.

765
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,480
Besides, even if he were my brother-in-law,

766
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,040
he still wouldn't be my immediate family.

767
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,120
Is he doing okay in there?

768
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,360
He's fine.

769
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,120
Maybe he looked old even when he was young,

770
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,520
so he's quite resilient.

771
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,400
He'll be out in a few days.

772
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,320
Can't you wait

773
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,600
just a little longer?

774
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,200
Maybe it's better not to see him.

775
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,410
I don't want your money.

776
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,880
Open it and see.

777
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,960
I've changed my name

778
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,480
to Qianhui now.

779
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,760
Cui Qianhui.

780
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,320
Better than Baihui.

781
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,180
A thousand is greater than a hundred.

782
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,640
My son

783
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,860
is one and a half years old.

784
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,200
He's more handsome than Erpang.

785
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,200
Such a big thing,

786
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,320
and you didn't tell your family?

787
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,920
There are many things I haven't told my family.

788
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,200
Guoming,

789
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,600
what I owe you

790
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,280
and mom and dad,

791
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,610
I can never repay in this lifetime.

792
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,280
My father...

793
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,320
He's aging so fast.

794
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,280
Only 60 years old

795
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,480
and he's already completely an old man.

796
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,800
How long has it been since you came back?

797
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,560
People change.

798
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,600
Actually, when I'm abroad,

799
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,920
I think about you every day.

800
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,240
About mom and dad,

801
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,600
and Erpang too.

802
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,360
Every single day.

803
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,000
Do you believe me?

804
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,920
What about Erpang?

805
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,680
Neither Huo Dongfeng nor I are by his side.

806
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,800
How much hardship

807
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,240
and mistreatment must this child endure?

808
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,000
He hasn't.

809
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,320
We're here for him.

810
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,040
Before you leave tomorrow,

811
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,760
could you visit dad?

812
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,240
He

813
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,280
really misses you a lot.

814
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,120
Guoming,

815
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,400
please take care of Erpang for me.

816
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,340
What are you doing?

817
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,160
Why aren't you sleeping?

818
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,840
Do you think

819
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,120
my mom loves me?

820
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:15,760
Of course.

821
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,720
What mother in this world

822
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,120
doesn't love her own son?

823
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,880
Erpang.

824
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,560
Adults have

825
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,000
their own difficulties.

826
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,800
When you grow up,

827
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,440
you'll understand everything.

828
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,640
I miss my dad.

829
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,000
Your dad will be out soon.

830
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,460
Really?

831
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,240
Yes.

832
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,580
In a couple of days.

833
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,040
He's shown good behavior,

834
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,120
so he's getting an early release.
