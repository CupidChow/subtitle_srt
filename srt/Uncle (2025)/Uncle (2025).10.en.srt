1
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,120
The crack is in the middle of Ding Qing Restaurant

2
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,120
It's like a wound

3
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,800
in grandpa's heart.

4
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,600
He put the plaque together and hid it.

5
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,680
and also a silent wait.

6
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,480
Maybe in my heart,

7
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,480
this plaque will eventually see the day again.

8
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,800
He firmly believed

9
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,920
The smell of Dingqing Restaurant

10
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,480
will float again in this city.

11
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,240
As long as someone remembers this smell,

12
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,320
This inheritance

13
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,160
is always there.

14
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,200
experience.

15
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,120
You should at least have a bite.

16
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,480
Why don't you have an empty stomach tonight?

17
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,940
you won't be able to sleep.

18
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,440
I think you'll be able to sleep well. You'll be able to sleep well. You'll be able to sleep well.

19
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,120
come in this time

20
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,650
You don't need to get angry.

21
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,240
You sell Kong glasses

22
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,000
is a crime of high IQ.

23
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,040
Not like the last time you came in.

24
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,680
You look more handsome.

25
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,560
Who committed a crime?

26
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,200
Stop talking.

27
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,040
How is my dad?

28
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,680
A while ago,

29
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,560
not very well.

30
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,100
I took him to the hospital.

31
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,360
Now?

32
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,000
It's good

33
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,480
My daughter

34
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,000
Good girl.

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How's your study?

36
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,320
You still care about her study?

37
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,200
It's just that I'm uneducated.

38
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,560
If I were as good as you,

39
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,680
I would have done big business earlier.

40
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,600
I want to do big business.

41
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,530
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

42
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,880
I'm good at studying.

43
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,880
But

44
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,360
I'm here just like you.

45
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,560
You're back.

46
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,000
Aunt.

47
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Guo Xiao Xue wrote your essay today.

48
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,330
What did she write about me?

49
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,760
Guo Xiaoxue said

50
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,160
I really want a mother like you.

51
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,540
Why didn't you go to Dingqing Restaurant today?

52
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,840
Didn't I retire?

53
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,280
Besides,

54
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,480
Ding Qing Restaurant

55
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,010
is no longer in the country.

56
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,000
I have to give it to someone.

57
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,280
Why didn't you?

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,120
I'm old, right?

59
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,600
Why did you

60
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,360
today?

61
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,280
It's about my son.

62
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,640
Your son is amazing.

63
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,000
Isn't he studying

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,280
Aeronautics and Astronautics?

65
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,360
Yes.

66
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,720
I remember what he got.

67
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,480
the city Karaoke Award.

68
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,600
What's wrong?

69
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
Yeah.

70
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,360
A while ago,

71
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,520
he produced a batch of products.

72
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,210
It's against the rules.

73
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,080
Now it's all gone.

74
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,880
He's also arrested.

75
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,840
What did they produce?

76
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,000
He was arrested.

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,840
Glasses.

78
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You scared me.

79
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,240
I thought you were making drugs.

80
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,000
It’s not a big deal.

81
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,460
for such a trivial matter?

82
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,240
Right?

83
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,170
produce that small-Kong glasses?

84
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,240
to sell them and sell them.

85
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,960
right?

86
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,480
That's it.

87
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,360
That's my son.

88
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,240
It's not a big deal.

89
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,600
But in society,

90
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,360
in society.

91
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,240
Will he be sentenced?

92
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,120
Well...

93
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,280
It's hard to say.

94
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,880
But don't worry.

95
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,810
Don't get angry.

96
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,640
Wait.

97
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,240
After this,

98
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,360
after this.

99
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,360
After all,

100
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
the consequences are not serious.

101
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
And your son

102
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,840
didn't intentionally

103
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,400
If we can

104
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,240
the parents' understanding,

105
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,960
I don't think he can be sentenced.

106
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Then can we get a guarantor pending trial first?

107
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,000
Security pending trial?

108
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,280
Please.

109
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,640
Slow down.

110
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,240
Drink slowly.

111
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,000
Drink slowly.

112
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,080
This must be seven years.

113
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,640
It's only seven years.

114
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,840
If it weren't for seven years,

115
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,770
if I didn't write a lawsuit for you,

116
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,140
How long will it take for me to get out?

117
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,160
Well,

118
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,400
two cases seem light,

119
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,880
But you have two criminal cases.

120
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,080
When two criminal cases are together,

121
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,010
your probation is very difficult.

122
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,410
If you are sentenced to this trial,

123
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,210
what will happen to my clothing store?

124
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,120
What else are you thinking about?

125
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,360
My lawyer said

126
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,500
I might be sentenced to five or six years.

127
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,840
What kind of lawyer

128
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,240
are you looking for?

129
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,120
Why did you

130
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,920
Why do you need five or six years?

131
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,250
Three years, six months to four years.

132
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,400
Playboard.

133
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,840
If not,

134
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,440
I'll write a lawsuit for you.

135
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,080
Really, brother.

136
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,520
Really

137
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,720
Thank you so much.

138
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,600
Don't thank me.

139
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,640
But you're going out.

140
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,570
What should I do?

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,760
I'm going out.

142
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Then I'll be a lawyer.

143
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,640
Then I can

144
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,000
solve these cases for you.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,120
Great.

146
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,960
With your current situation,

147
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,640
you still have a lawsuit.

148
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,100
Can you still release the lawyer's license?

149
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,480
I don't know.

150
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,000
I gave her 5,000 yuan.

151
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,680
and agreed to settle.

152
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,880
I'll let it go.

153
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,840
That's great.

154
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,360
Where did you get the money?

155
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,610
I borrowed it from Ms. Zhou.

156
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,240
Come to the bank with me.

157
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,640
I have some savings.

158
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,280
I didn't spend a penny

159
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,720
from abroad.

160
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,000
Dad.

161
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,890
That's the money I gave you.

162
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
It's inappropriate for us to use it.

163
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,280
What time is it now?

164
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,080
Is it suitable?

165
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,120
If so,

166
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,640
will Gook Myung

167
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
be released soon?

168
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,600
When he comes out,

169
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,480
let's talk to him.

170
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,160
We need to do something serious.

171
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,640
Since

172
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,760
I stopped working in the factory,

173
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,120
for more than half a year,

174
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,360
for more than half a year.

175
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,290
That's not good.

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,160
If this continues,

177
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,760
What should we do?

178
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,320
Actually, it's not entirely his fault.

179
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,760
But after he came out,

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,160
can you beat him up?

181
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,880
He deserves it.

182
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,080
But since he was young, he's never beaten me.

183
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,340
I've never beaten him.

184
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,880
He's in his thirties.

185
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,010
Is it appropriate for me to beat him up?

186
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,160
Why don't you do it?

187
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,280
Fine, I'll beat him up.

188
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,480
Your dad is coming out today.

189
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Wait for my dad.

190
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,000
beat him up.

191
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,820
Your grandpa said the same thing.

192
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,280
Is this for my uncle?

193
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,760
For Guo Xiao Xue.

194
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,000
Look at that kid.

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
like a cockroach.

196
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,360
Okay, I won't eat it secretly.

197
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,240
Haha.

198
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,640
Whose clothes are you wearing?

199
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,480
I changed it with someone inside.

200
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,120
Look at you.

201
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
you're still in there.

202
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,080
What a mess.

203
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,600
I didn't get bullied inside.

204
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Who dares to bully me?

205
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,360
respect me.

206
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,640
I have many friends.

207
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,880
I can make friends here.

208
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,240
Well, Guo Dapao...

209
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,080
Alright.

210
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,000
Go home and take a shower.

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,960
Get changed.

212
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Think about the future.

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,360
what to do in the future.

214
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,760
What can I do?

215
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,880
I wonder if they can

216
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,520
if they can give it to me.

217
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,360
I don't know.

218
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,480
If I were the government,

219
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,000
if I were the government.

220
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,600
You always think

221
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,720
to break through your own bottleneck.

222
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,520
Now the bottleneck is broken.

223
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,000
There's a cap up there.

224
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,840
Right?

225
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,600
Don't forget what I told you.

226
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,640
Okay.

227
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,640
What did I tell you?

228
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,250
I'm not telling you.

229
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,880
What is it?

230
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,760
What's good?

231
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,080
is better than home.

232
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,120
It's comfortable.

233
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,880
Your dad and your daughter said

234
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,080
to teach you a lesson.

235
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
I plan to

236
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,760
for two days.

237
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,480
Mengmeng.

238
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,960
Why did you peel me?

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,080
She's awesome.

240
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,840
I'll do my best.

241
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,720
Later,

242
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
I'm going to see Guo Dapao's father.

243
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,640
I have to go to work.

244
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,160
You'd better stay home

245
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,960
for two days.

246
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,280
before you go out for fun, you hear me?

247
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,120
Wait a minute.

248
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,880
Listen to

249
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,640
My plan.

250
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,120
A new plan?

251
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Yes, that joke.

252
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,840
If I stay inside,

253
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,160
for nothing.

254
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,000
Seriously.

255
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,120
Tell me

256
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,850
what were you thinking inside?

257
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,160
Thinking.

258
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,120
Okay.

259
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,440
Tell us what you're going to say.

260
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,880
Here's the thing.

261
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,600
Hello?

262
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,240
Mr. Cui.

263
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,120
I thought you haven't come out yet.

264
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,240
I have something to tell you.

265
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,840
Go ahead.

266
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,640
you need to come to the factory

267
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,280
to get off work.

268
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,800
Great. Great.

269
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,540
I finally got off work.

270
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,600
Why are you so happy?

271
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,010
Shouldn't you be happy?

272
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,600
I'll be right there.

273
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,680
You finally got off work.

274
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,160
Good.

275
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,320
Why didn't you tell me

276
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,920
get this?

277
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,120
Why didn't you tell me?

278
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,040
I can finally get

279
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,360
to buy off my age.

280
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
A pillow came to sleep.

281
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,200
What do you want?

282
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,960
I'll tell you when you come back.

283
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,280
Don't move even if you get the money back.

284
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,080
Do you hear me?

285
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,200
I heard that Liu is off duty next door.

286
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,040
Really?

287
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,880
I haven't heard yet.

288
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,600
Stop it.

289
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,680
Really?

290
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,020
Cui is back.

291
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,450
I heard you got a lawyer.

292
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,880
Did you pass?

293
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,400
Yeah.

294
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,120
Let's go.

295
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,450
Let's go to work.

296
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,930
Did Ms. Jang clean it up?

297
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,360
It has nothing to do with us.

298
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,040
Why is he so diligent?

299
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,600
Come on.

300
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,200
Sign this contract.

301
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,120
you'll be fired.

302
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,120
And then,

303
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,880
in the auditorium this afternoon,

304
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,840
in the auditorium.

305
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,080
I'm going to sign this.

306
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,840
Meeting?

307
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
I don't need to go.

308
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,600
No one will force you.

309
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,720
When you were working,

310
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,600
You don't have to go if you don't want to.

311
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,560
This is the last meeting before I get off work.

312
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,600
If you don't go,

313
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,920
if you don't go.

314
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,280
When I was young,

315
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,740
I learned when I was young.

316
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,410
called the last lesson.

317
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,640
Should I

318
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,440
finish the last lesson?

319
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,460
I suggest you don't go.

320
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,300
You've been idle for more than ten years.

321
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,360
What if

322
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,040
if you go there.

323
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,120
It's a bit cheap.

324
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,880
Right.

325
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,340
I haven't signed this yet.

326
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,200
Today,

327
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,400
in the office

328
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,640
in the office.

329
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,920
You can sit here

330
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,280
you can sit here.

331
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,640
But tomorrow,

332
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,640
I don't think so.

333
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,440
What? I'll come tomorrow.

334
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,100
Are you still driving me away?

335
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,180
You're not allowed to enter the door.

336
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,360
This uniform...

337
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,400
as a souvenir.

338
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,640
Here.

339
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,720
Here.

340
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,160
This.

341
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,140
This is for you.

342
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,400
Let's go home.

343
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,119
Let's go.

344
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,720
Have a smoke before you go.

345
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,920
Coming

346
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,600
What are you looking at?

347
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,840
What does this mean?

348
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,040
It's up to you.

349
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,200
Open the structure.

350
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,280
I hung a map.

351
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,440
I'm full of research in China.

352
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,520
Where can I do barbecue?

353
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,840
Later I found something.

354
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,480
I'm still small-minded.

355
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,960
Look up

356
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,280
I'll hang the world map

357
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,760
I'm going to break out of Asia

358
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,820
and go to the world.

359
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,840
When I looked there,

360
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,680
Did you say there's barbecue in America?

361
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,880
Do you have barbecue?

362
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,280
No

363
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,960
Let's combine the waist and hamburger

364
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,000
The whole waist burger

365
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,280
You said

366
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,520
in the tripe pot.

367
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,920
Can you do it?

368
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,920
Good. You've opened up your mind.

369
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,440
Right?

370
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,040
Very good.

371
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,840
Have a seat.

372
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,000
Come on.

373
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,520
This table. Put it here.

374
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,000
Mr. Cui, order it.

375
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,240
Well...

376
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,130
It's my treat today.

377
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,960
Applause.

378
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,280
It's not easy.

379
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,760
I don't think so.

380
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,200
It's always Mr. Cui's treat.

381
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,520
But you lost your job.

382
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,690
You lost money by selling glasses.

383
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,080
I can't let you treat me anymore.

384
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,520
We're here.

385
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,160
It's your treat.

386
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,840
I'm leaving.

387
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,360
Talk later.

388
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,280
It's okay. I still have 40,000 yuan

389
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
to buy off my age.

390
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,480
We need to save money.

391
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,690
Let's get down to business.

392
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,040
Have you decided

393
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,240
What do you want to do?

394
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,160
I've made up my mind. Let's do clothes.

395
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,520
A fine house.

396
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,160
This is good.

397
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,760
Yes.

398
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,040
Mr. Cui has a good taste.

399
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,500
I'm sure he'll make money.

400
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,720
Don't fool me.

401
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,280
I really...

402
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,240
I really don't think it's good.

403
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,000
Why not?

404
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,080
Those who do clothes

405
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,140
can do by elementary school culture.

406
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,000
You graduated from the university of engineering.

407
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,760
Why are you competing with elementary school students?

408
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,560
The most worthless thing is dignity.

409
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,800
We can't lose face.

410
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,040
With money, we have face.

411
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,000
I have a family.

412
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,960
Dapao's dad is in hospital.

413
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,240
My kids have to go to school.

414
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,080
Look at me.

415
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,840
Leave your ID. Leave your ID.

416
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,000
No, Mr. Cui.

417
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,760
I don't understand.

418
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,040
Where are you going?

419
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,520
Clothes.

420
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,440
Didn't you tell me

421
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,080
you need to work hard

422
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,000
Do you want to sprout?

423
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,040
I'm going to work hard

424
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,760
in the clothing industry.

425
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,960
Let's wait and see.

426
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,520
Let's go to the bar.

427
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,580
Okay, eat the sunflower seeds first.

428
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,610
You have to pay for one bite.

429
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,960
It's all free.

430
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,760
It's all free

431
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,200
It's free

432
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,320
Do you want two?

433
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,600
Two more for free.

434
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,080
No.

435
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,520
So stingy.

436
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,160
So stingy.

437
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,600
So stingy.

438
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,280
The Tingqing Restaurant

439
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,760
in Ding Qing Restaurant.

440
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Xiaomei.

441
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,320
Pretty good.

442
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,760
That's great.

443
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,040
You even got a raise.

444
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,280
That Tang guy.

445
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,460
You have to be careful.

446
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,040
He's very cunning.

447
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,520
Mr. Cui.

448
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,560
To be honest,

449
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,520
Is it because

450
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,800
because you didn't

451
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,280
That's why you said I'm not good.

452
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,480
Go away.

453
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,600
Come on.

454
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,600
Look at me.

455
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,280
Boss.

456
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,410
Let's settle the score.

457
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,600
We have to watch.

458
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,360
What?

459
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,560
Stop calculating.

460
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,920
Whatever he says.

461
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,160
You can't beat him.

462
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,320
No, I remember it.

463
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,720
82.7 yuan.

464
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,840
I'm sure.

465
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,080
It's not me. It's been a long time.

466
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,760
You calculated it so quickly.

467
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,380
I calculated it when you ordered.

468
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,360
Liu Ye,

469
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,240
I admire you so much in my life.

470
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,360
I admire you too.

471
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,600
Come on, let's go after drinking.

472
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,160
Uncle, stop it.

473
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,720
I can't hear you clearly.

474
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,440
Listen to me.

475
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,520
I

476
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
promise you two things.

477
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,920
First, I will

478
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,160
to clear Guo Dapao's name.

479
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,320
Second,

480
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
take good care of Xue.

481
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,000
Rest well.

482
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,360
Xue.

483
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Tonight,

484
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,440
Why don't you go home and sleep?

485
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,040
I'll stay here for the night.

486
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,000
No, I'm fine here.

487
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,360
Did you drink?

488
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,650
Is it because you drank after work?

489
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,680
Yes, I want to celebrate.

490
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,840
You're off work.

491
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,560
You don't even get paid.

492
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,020
What are you celebrating?

493
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,200
Mengmeng.

494
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Remember,

495
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,040
Heroes don't make money.

496
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,520
Yes.

497
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,560
I'm off duty today.

498
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,960
doesn't mean I can't make money.

499
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,320
but it means

500
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,440
I can make more money.

501
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,680
Come here.

502
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,840
Come on.

503
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,760
Look.

504
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,360
When you grow up here,

505
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,760
Not long.

506
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,000
I'll buy you a Santana.

507
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,000
Ha-ri is no longer

508
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,520
my first target.

509
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,960
I don't want Santana.

510
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,280
Look, you have to figure out

511
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,200
Santana, what's good about it?

512
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,960
The difference between Ha-ri and Santana.

513
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,520
Get out. I'm going to sleep.

514
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,380
Leave me alone.

515
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,760
I didn't go in either.

516
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,250
Uncle, tell me what you want to say.

517
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,260
I need to use the bathroom.

518
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,560
I haven't finished

519
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,890
I haven't finished yet.

520
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,760
I made a friend in the detention center.

521
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,720
He's in prison.

522
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,850
He can make friends.

523
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,720
It's quite wide.

524
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,840
Let me finish.

525
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,200
Let me tell you.

526
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,800
There's a lot of people hiding there.

527
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,000
The man beside me.

528
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
He runs a fine house.

529
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,920
His shop is on Six Street.

530
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,360
Every month,

531
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,960
he goes to Guangdong to buy goods.

532
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,840
to buy

533
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,920
I'll sell them.

534
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,280
We can earn hundreds of thousands a year.

535
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,050
What do you mean by that?

536
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,960
It means

537
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,560
to some economic advanced places.

538
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,480
to get the second-hand clothes they don't want.

539
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,320
They're all new.

540
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:24,880
They may not like

541
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,680
might not like it.

542
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,210
They don't want it anymore.

543
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,520
It's just something

544
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,280
is the thing.

545
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
It has a high profit.

546
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,800
He

547
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,960
caused trouble after drinking.

548
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,010
It was a big deal.

549
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,600
He'll be sentenced to three to five years.

550
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,360
No one has opened this shop

551
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,680
and no one took care of it.

552
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,480
He told me

553
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,160
that after I came out,

554
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,920
to find his mother.

555
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,480
I thought we should

556
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,680
to cash the shop down.

557
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,320
That's it?

558
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,000
It's gone.

559
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,440
Where is the detention center?

560
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,440
Do you know someone reliable in there?

561
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,040
Thanks to your short time in there.

562
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,280
If you had stayed longer,

563
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,000
as soon as you come out,

564
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,800
he'll become the richest man in the city.

565
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,160
Why don't you listen to me carefully?

566
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,320
Why didn't I listen carefully?

567
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,040
I got it.

568
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,520
Did you notice my spirit?

569
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,040
What?

570
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,920
It's none of your business.

571
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,720
What about the detention center?

572
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,280
About what I said...

573
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,560
Forget it. I'm tired.

574
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,360
I'm tired.

575
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,040
What are you doing?

576
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,080
The pose you pose is

577
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,600
locked.

578
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,400
You know what?

579
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,320
I'm done.

580
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,200
Hurry up.

581
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,080
Uncle.

582
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,200
Are you in there?

583
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,480
Can you see my dad?

584
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,280
I'm in the detention center.

585
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,520
He's in the labor center.

586
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,050
I can't see him in two units.

587
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,240
Why are there so many places?

588
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,140
It's hard for me to explain to you.

589
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,400
Brother, are you leaving or not?

590
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,320
Let's go.

591
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,280
I heard Cui came out.

592
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,940
He came out yesterday.

593
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,290
Let me say something I shouldn't have.

594
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,560
Being with him

595
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,160
What a waste of time.

596
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,840
Your job

597
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,000
is to collect money and finance.

598
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,680
In any company,

599
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,480
is the most important position.

600
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,090
Mr. Tang, you can rest assured.

601
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,400
I've been working here for more than ten years.

602
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,040
Nothing went wrong at work.

603
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,360
It's not a problem.

604
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,280
Your position

605
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,080
the boss trusts the most.

606
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,160
Generally speaking,

607
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,560
the owner's wife

608
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,640
A real sister

609
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,560
to take such a position.

610
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,760
What do you mean?

611
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,600
We're definitely not family.

612
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,240
But I think

613
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,800
can we

614
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,360
more intimate?

615
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,160
Kiss more

616
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,440
Look in the mirror.

617
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,800
I quit.

618
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,320
It's decorated.

619
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,360
When you go somewhere else,

620
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
somewhere else.

621
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,640
I can't take care of you anymore.

622
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,920
Take care.

623
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,560
The thing you said last time...

624
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,360
is it reliable?

625
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,440
Yes.

626
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,240
Buy off your age.

627
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,240
When can we get it?

628
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,840
Just a few days.

629
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,540
I plan to do this business.

630
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,160
I'll quit

631
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
I quit.

632
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,320
Great!

633
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,520
Let's work together.

634
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,320
You didn't even ask me

635
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,040
Why not?

636
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,640
What's there to ask?

637
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,120
Are we still husband and wife?

638
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,160
Listen to me.

639
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,240
Based on your unreliable experience

640
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,600
and unreliable experience,

641
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,360
I'll be the boss this time.

642
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,320
You work here.

643
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,240
Understand?

644
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,120
It's inappropriate for a man

645
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
to work as a man.

646
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,840
I'm just telling you my decision.

647
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,080
I didn't ask for your opinion.

648
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,920
you can quit.

649
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,080
I'll do it.

650
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,240
It's so adorable.

651
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,440
Hello?

652
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,680
My grandpa passed away.

653
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,520
Okay, I...

654
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,840
I'll be right there.

655
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,640
What?

656
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,160
What's wrong?

657
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,890
Guo Dalei's father is gone.

658
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,760
If you are afraid,

659
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,890
you can put the photo in the drawer.

660
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,520
I'm not scared.

661
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,800
He's my grandpa.

662
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,040
Why would I be scared?

663
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,760
Take it.

664
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,560
If you're done,

665
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,360
I'll ask Fatty for it.

666
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,160
Mr. Cui.

667
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,640
Can my dad come out?

668
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,300
I haven't got my lawyer certificate yet.

669
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,530
It may be a bit troublesome.

670
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,360
Don't worry.

671
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,040
I will

672
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,640
make money soon.

673
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,360
By then,

674
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,260
I'll hire the best lawyer.

675
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,000
Aren't you scared to be here alone?

676
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,480
I'm not scared.

677
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,920
Women are slow.

678
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,400
Who is Aunt Zhang?

679
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,120
Who is Liu's mother?

680
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,920
Auntie Zhang.

681
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,360
They are all men over there.

682
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,880
Women are all here

683
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,000
What do you want to say?

684
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,480
Aunt Zhang, right?

685
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,520
I'm Liu's friend.

686
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,880
Cui, my surname is Cui.

687
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,040
I... I called you.

688
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,400
Zhang.

689
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,250
Help me touch it.

690
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,940
Have a seat.

691
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,760
Okay.

692
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,490
Exchange the store.

693
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,440
You two are a serious couple.

694
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,400
Yes.

695
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,360
Legal couple.

696
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,880
Why do you ask?

697
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,960
I don't mean anything else.

698
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,080
I'm afraid you two

699
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,120
a serious couple.

700
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,320
If you two run away,

701
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,720
where can I find someone?

702
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,680
Yes.

703
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,240
I understand.

704
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,880
A serious couple.

705
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,610
Don't worry.

706
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
Where is my son?

707
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,440
A few days ago,

708
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,520
a few days ago.

709
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,080
He said our shop

710
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,480
for the time being.

711
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,000
Why is it temporary?

712
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,920
He told me to cash it to me.

713
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,360
That's what he said.

714
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,320
This shop

715
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,480
to you two.

716
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,680
Rent

717
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,400
20,000 yuan.

718
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,320
I'll give you 10,000 yuan

719
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,240
to you.

720
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,040
30,000 in total.

721
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,200
But

722
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,400
if my son comes out,

723
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,930
you have to return it to him.

724
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,900
He only knows how to sell clothes.

725
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,920
Are you two doing it or not?

726
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,240
I'm in a hurry to play mahjong.

727
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,400
It's not me.

728
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,200
But

729
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,400
we want to do it.

730
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:01,920
Very much.

731
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,360
But we want to do it.

732
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,720
What do you mean?

733
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,960
You want my son

734
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,290
to be sentenced to life.

735
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,280
What are you talking about?

736
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,880
That's not what I meant.

737
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,880
Fine.

738
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,239
Don't waste time.

739
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,840
Do you want to do it or not?

740
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
Just say it.

741
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,679
There are many people who want to do it.

742
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,600
Cheers.

743
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,280
That's it.

744
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,960
It's really the ink.

745
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,400
Zhang, run!

746
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:41,960
Five dots.

747
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,120
Let's go.

748
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,880
Let's go.

749
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,400
Dad, thank you.

750
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,400
I'll go to Guangdong with Guoming

751
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,460
and get some goods.

752
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,530
We'll open on the 1st of next month.

753
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,560
I'm relieved if you go.

754
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,960
Is the purchase money enough?

755
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,920
A while ago,

756
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,080
I helped Guoming

757
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,600
for Guoming.

758
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,000
There's not much left.

759
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
That's enough.

760
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,560
Well...

761
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,000
Not bad.

762
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,120
The last batch

763
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,180
for the last batch.

764
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,480
A few months ago,

765
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,360
a few months ago.

766
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,320
I'll bet on the last.

767
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,360
Uncle, come on! Come on!

768
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,520
You have a family.

769
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,880
I'm still healthy.

770
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,400
and I have pension.

771
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,320
It's okay to make a living.

772
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,760
These two kids

773
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,480
Think about it.

774
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,600
My dad never cares about me.

775
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,960
He always does whatever he wants.

776
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,880
I can do whatever I want.

777
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,080
I'll buy you Santana.

778
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,360
Sometimes I think

779
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,810
you're not as mature as your dream.

780
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,920
He is not as mature as me.

781
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,160
I gave birth to you.

782
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,480
Why am I not as mature as you?

783
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,040
I was born by my mom.

784
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,960
All right, work hard.

785
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,640
Following the profound reform of China,

786
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,280
the market system was rebuilt.

787
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,520
to break the economy.

788
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,680
National corporation reform.

789
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,040
The rise of civil enterprises

790
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,160
caused a huge change

791
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,840
has changed.

792
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,290
Welcome.

793
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,000
Wild rose.

794
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,840
Wild Rose Singing and Dance Restaurant.

795
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,480
We're officially open.

796
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,280
OK.

797
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,760
Mengmeng, this is yours.

798
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,840
Fatty, I'm sorry.

799
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,500
It doesn't suit your body.

800
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,040
You can only wear sportswear for now.

801
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,600
I don't need it.

802
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,860
I can wear sportswear.

803
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
Next time when I go to Guangdong,

804
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,960
when I go to Guangdong next time.

805
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,880
Fatty's clothes.

806
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,720
What is Fatty?

807
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,480
You...

808
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,880
Uncle, do you mean

809
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,280
Hong Kong dialect?

810
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,480
Yes.

811
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,080
There's another pack.

812
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Whose is this?

813
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,200
For Xue.

814
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,520
Send it to Xue tomorrow.

815
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,180
Look how generous the boss is.

816
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,160
Dad, I went to Shenzhen with Guoming.

817
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,080
It's Hong Kong across the street.

818
00:37:59,080 --> 00:37:59,960
A river away.

819
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,120
I can see clearly.

820
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,840
Hong Kong is too bustling now.

821
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,320
When Hong Kong comes back,

822
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,320
we'll make money.

823
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,160
How about

824
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,520
go for a walk?

825
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,120
Yes.

826
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,120
Mom, I'll believe you if you say that.

827
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,280
If my dad said that,

828
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,080
I don't believe it.

829
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,210
I'm not telling you.

830
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,160
That's why I didn't tell you.

831
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
If you trust your mom,

832
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,880
Next time,

833
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,440
you can go to Hong Kong together.

834
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,240
I'll look after the shop at home.

835
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,320
No problem.

836
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,360
I'll bring you some food.

837
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,080
Thank you.

838
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,010
You're welcome.

839
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,800
20% discount for the new store.

840
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,940
Please come in.

841
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,080
Please

842
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,840
This way, please.

843
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,200
Remember what Mr. Zhang said.

844
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,560
combine hobbies

845
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,360
and making money.

846
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,040
That's called success.

847
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,880
Don't worry.

848
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,160
Watch me.

849
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,800
So popular.

850
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,780
Sister-in-law

851
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,920
This is too popular

852
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,240
I've tried it. Take it away.

853
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,240
I don't have time for you.

854
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,120
Okay.

855
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,800
The fabric is so good.

856
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,460
The clothes are so beautiful.

857
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,440
We need to wear work clothes.

858
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,320
If we wear this,

859
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,760
if we wear this.

860
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,840
I think

861
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,040
give one to your wife.

862
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,960
That's what I thought.

863
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,160
I'll give you my spot too.

864
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,240
Give me two.

865
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,120
Really?

866
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,680
Really

867
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,170
Look at the clothes.

868
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,040
I remember.

869
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,240
his sister wore this when she came back.

870
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,040
That dress looks like this.

871
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,370
It really looks like it.

872
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,400
My wife will look good in it.

873
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,600
Take whatever you want.

874
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,680
Take it if you like.

875
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,200
I bought it on kilogram.

876
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,960
What?

877
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,320
How can you buy clothes on kilogram?

878
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,400
Lower your voice.

879
00:39:59,400 --> 00:39:59,960
Brother,

880
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,920
We have to make money.

881
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,200
to make money.

882
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,120
How about this?

883
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,960
I'll go back to the company early to buy off my age.

884
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,320
I'll work with you.

885
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,240
Okay.

886
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,680
Don't listen to him.

887
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,920
His wife won't agree.

888
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,200
You get it now?

889
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,200
Why are you so afraid of your wife?

890
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:14,960
Coming.

891
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,240
I'm not afraid.

892
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,480
It's love.

893
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,600
All the dishes are here.

894
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,600
Eat.

895
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,760
Grandpa, your cooking

896
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,320
is better than my dad's.

897
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,920
I'm used to eating here.

898
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,080
Every restaurant outside

899
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,200
in every restaurant outside.

900
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,480
I've been working for 50 years.

901
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,480
I have my specialty.

902
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,760
Let grandpa do something else.

903
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,000
I really can't.

904
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,930
Unlike your dad who can do everything.

905
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,480
My dad can do everything.

906
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,600
But he can only

907
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,080
he can only get 890 points.

908
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,000
He has never

909
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,040
100 points.

910
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,280
My uncle is professional in selling clothes.

911
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,200
That's because my mom is watching.

912
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,880
Otherwise,

913
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,610
something might happen again.

914
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,880
While I

915
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,720
take care of you

916
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,880
and cook for you.

917
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,360
Ask your parents

918
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,320
Hurry up.

919
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,600
Make more money.

920
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,320
When I can't take care of you,

921
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,920
you should grow up.

922
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,000
Grandpa.

923
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,080
I'll cook for you every day.

924
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,440
Grandpa.

925
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,600
Don't eat my brother's.

926
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,600
I'll cook for you.

927
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,530
Please teach me.

928
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,120
Let's do it together.

929
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,040
Great.

930
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,320
Back then,

931
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,040
I became an old man.

932
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,640
You're the old man.

933
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,800
Grandpa.

934
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,360
Just wait and enjoy your life.

935
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,200
Okay.

936
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,080
We're closing soon.

937
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,740
I thought you were here to rob.

938
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,800
What a rare guest.

939
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,160
Mr. Choi.

940
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,280
Have a good business.

941
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,930
You've earned a lot.

942
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,480
Do I owe you money?

943
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,200
No, it's just two days ago.

944
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,440
Hailong went to my place for dinner.

945
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,160
and talked about you.

946
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,360
So I came in to see you.

947
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,200
How are you?

948
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,160
I'm fine.

949
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,320
You're good.

950
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,200
Good.

951
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,330
Remember the words you told me?

952
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,560
Deep farming?

953
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,920
I've been studying

954
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
how to cultivate.

955
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,320
Same to you.

956
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,920
I also think

957
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,440
of the clothing store.

958
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,160
I've been thinking about it day and night.

959
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,480
I was thinking

960
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,760
why

961
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,040
Why do you keep buying clothes?

962
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,440
Go put on clothes

963
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,200
because I was shy.

964
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,960
to get rid of the cold.

965
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,600
But why

966
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,960
still shopping?

967
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,890
and buy clothes.

968
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,840
Why?

969
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,160
Fashion.

970
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,720
So my shop

971
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,640
is not just a clothing store.

972
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,640
but also a fashion store.
