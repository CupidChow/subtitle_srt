1
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
Li

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,720
Li Yang

3
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,040
Liu

4
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,680
Let's forget about the old debts.

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,400
Don't come back anymore.

6
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,600
That's it.

7
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,880
Wait, come back.

8
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,050
What's the problem?

9
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,960
I just owe you some money.

10
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,880
I told you I'll pay when I have it.

11
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,009
You think I can't afford it?

12
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,960
You can definitely afford it.

13
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,220
I'm afraid I can't afford to give credit.

14
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,740
Let me tell you.

15
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,520
Me coming to eat here

16
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,280
is doing you a favor.

17
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,060
You think I'm respecting you?

18
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,440
I'm respecting Er Mei.

19
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,160
Without Er Mei, what are you?

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,880
Just an ex-con at best.

21
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,040
If you want my respect, fine.

22
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,020
Go to Longshan Temple.

23
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,000
Dig out Er Mei's ashes.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Put them here.

25
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,320
Then I'll respect you right away.

26
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,180
How about that?

27
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,960
What?

28
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,400
Want to fight?

29
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,080
Come on.

30
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,280
Hit me.

31
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,720
Let's talk properly.

32
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,360
Don't go too far.

33
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,920
Too far?

34
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,500
I think I'm being reasonable.

35
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,840
Or else,

36
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,370
I'll show you what going too far really means.

37
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,880
Come on, let's go.

38
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,120
Get to work, come on.

39
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,720
Come on, stop eating.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,079
Stop eating.

41
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,960
Stop eating.

42
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,120
Datao.

43
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,050
What's the rush?

44
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,320
Everyone, everyone.

45
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,200
I'm really sorry,

46
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,560
but we'll have to end this meal.

47
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,290
However, you don't need to pay.

48
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,600
I'll take care of the bill.

49
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,640
I'm the owner here,

50
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,440
Huo Dongfeng.

51
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,720
I'm right here.

52
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,079
Please accept my apologies.

53
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,520
When you come back next time,

54
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,440
I'll treat everyone to another meal.

55
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,840
Today I have some business

56
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,200
that hasn't been resolved.

57
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,840
Please make way, everyone.

58
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,880
Take care and come again.

59
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,680
Don't move!

60
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,260
What are you doing?

61
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,050
What business do you have here?

62
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,920
I said put it down.

63
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,760
Put it down.

64
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,320
Put it down!

65
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,680
Step back.

66
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,120
You want to smash things, right?

67
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,080
Come on.

68
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,080
Smash it.

69
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,020
You told me to smash it.

70
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,240
Your boss told me to do this.

71
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,520
I dare anyone to move.

72
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,920
Anyone who moves gets fired.

73
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,240
Boys,

74
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,560
don't just stand there.

75
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,320
Smash it!

76
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
That's enough.

77
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,280
Having fun?

78
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,720
You're a smart man.

79
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,720
You know what I want.

80
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,409
Let's go, brothers.

81
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,000
Thank you, Boss Huo.

82
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,080
What's going on here?

83
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,540
It's all ruined like this.

84
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,520
We should get

85
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,600
Sixieleng, Hongwei and the others here.

86
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,260
We'll fight them to the death.

87
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,720
No, say something!

88
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,600
Should we call the police?

89
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Put everything down and go home.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,130
We're closed today.

91
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,620
This Hong Kong first day cover

92
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,010
has the greatest potential to increase in value.

93
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,920
The 200,000 yuan our family has saved over the years.

94
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,360
It's all turned into these few pieces of paper.

95
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,280
That's not all.

96
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,960
I borrowed another 500,000.

97
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,720
The more you invest, the more you earn.

98
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,240
I got another

99
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,970
100,000 from Erpang's father.

100
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,040
What if we lose it all?

101
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,920
How will we pay them back?

102
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,720
Impossible.

103
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,360
In just a few days,

104
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,780
it's already increased by 8%.

105
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,360
Our 500,000

106
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,040
has already earned 40,000.

107
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,240
In a couple of days when I go to Shanghai,

108
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,170
it might have increased to 80,000.

109
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,080
Later when we close the shop,

110
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,760
we'll go have drinks with Erpang's father

111
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,280
and the other guys.

112
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,760
What for?

113
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,290
To rally before the battle!

114
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,000
What's going on, man?

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,640
I thought you were giving me some secret signal.

116
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,440
Here you go again.

117
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,400
Am I not welcome?

118
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,160
No, no. Come in. Let's get rid of this.

119
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,840
What's this?

120
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,720
How heavy was the person

121
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,080
who broke the chair like this?

122
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,960
This chair was bound to break sooner or later,

123
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,680
right?

124
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,740
Let's get a new one.

125
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,920
So we're going to the private room?

126
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,560
Yes, I've saved it for you.

127
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,400
Go ahead.

128
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Please, this way.

129
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Miss!

130
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Waiter!

131
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,920
Bring the food!

132
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,680
Waiter, we'd like to order.

133
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,000
You've recovered

134
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,400
so well in just one day.

135
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,720
Waiter,

136
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,320
smashed cucumber salad for each table.

137
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,840
Mr. Huo.

138
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,440
Let's talk.

139
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
Quite fancy here.

140
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,720
Very formal. Come on.

141
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,280
Let me tell you.

142
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,880
I thought about it all night yesterday.

143
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,730
I trashed your restaurant.

144
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,760
That reputation is definitely useful.

145
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,800
But I don't have money.

146
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,850
Here's the deal.

147
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,740
I'll give you two options.

148
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,610
I'll watch over your place.

149
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,660
As long as you're open,

150
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,840
every day you operate,

151
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,170
I'll trash it every day.

152
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,880
Give people some slack.

153
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
It makes future encounters easier.

154
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,000
That's enough.

155
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,120
I'm here as a customer.

156
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,360
I ordered the smashed cucumber.

157
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,520
No need to pay.

158
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
This meal is on me.

159
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,960
No, no, no.

160
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,740
I'm done drinking.

161
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,200
I'm afraid if I drink too much,

162
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
I won't be able to control myself

163
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,060
and might wreck your place again.

164
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,320
I think right now

165
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,850
you look quite ridiculous.

166
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,420
You probably can't see yourself.

167
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Tell me,

168
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
someone like you,

169
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,760
what do you think society needs you for?

170
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,080
Don't you want to change?

171
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,800
Still causing trouble?

172
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,620
If I don't call the police,

173
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,800
someone else will.

174
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,800
Huo Dongfeng, call the police.

175
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,080
Call the police.

176
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,880
Beat him to death.

177
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,800
What are you doing?

178
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,840
Stop hitting him!

179
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,140
What are you doing?

180
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,320
Tao! Tao! Tao!

181
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,840
Tao!

182
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,800
Tao is dead!

183
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,760
Call an ambulance!

184
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,880
Tao! Tao! Tao!

185
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,760
Don't fall asleep, Tao! Tao!

186
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,160
Tao!

187
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,680
Tao!

188
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,720
Tao!

189
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,600
Report it.

190
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,160
Call and report it.

191
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,360
Brother.

192
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,000
Run away.

193
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,880
I should turn myself in.

194
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,160
This is my fate.

195
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,020
Come, sit here.

196
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,680
I need to tell you something.

197
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,400
Guoming.

198
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,610
I have to trouble you again.

199
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,540
Please take care of Erpang for me.

200
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,090
You must promise me.

201
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,400
Look after him until he turns 18.

202
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,160
Brother,

203
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,720
you have us.

204
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,560
Thank you all then.

205
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,650
I called the police.

206
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,880
You're Huo Dongfeng, right?

207
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,170
You've only been out for a few days.

208
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,880
They keep causing trouble.

209
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,940
I couldn't hold back and fought back.

210
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,370
Let's talk back at the station.

211
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,760
You left me.

212
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,400
You left me alone

213
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,880
to deal with two kids.

214
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,760
One is worse than the other.

215
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,890
They drive me crazy.

216
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,120
It's so frustrating.

217
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,480
When I join you down there,

218
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,760
I'll tell you all about their misdeeds.

219
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,600
One person killed

220
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,720
and another seriously injured.

221
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,690
He was forced to fight back,

222
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,410
and the other party was at fault first.

223
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
But killing and seriously injuring someone,

224
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,200
that's serious trouble.

225
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,760
There's something I still don't understand.

226
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,080
I know he trained in martial arts.

227
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,840
He's very skilled.

228
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,400
But

229
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,400
I really didn't expect

230
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,480
how he could get knocked down like that.

231
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,400
It's...

232
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,080
That technique of his,

233
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,240
he practiced it for decades.

234
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,680
Every day,

235
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,450
crashing into walls and trees.

236
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
What do you think?

237
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,320
When you guys came back after fights back then,

238
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,580
I remember you all had bruised faces too.

239
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,880
We weren't going out to kill people,

240
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,560
just to scare them a bit.

241
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,960
If every time

242
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,160
we fought and killed one or two people,

243
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,200
we'd have been executed 800 times by now.

244
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,440
Simply put,

245
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,119
whenever we went out,

246
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,119
we always held back,

247
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,119
never using lethal force.

248
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,720
But this Datao,

249
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,640
he went too far.

250
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,400
Guo Dapao's trial starts tomorrow too.

251
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,560
What's happening?

252
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,800
How did everyone around me get involved

253
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,200
in such serious matters?

254
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,680
If I could be a lawyer, maybe...

255
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,920
Director.

256
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,200
Why is it you again?

257
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,240
Wasn't I banned

258
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,440
from your office?

259
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,940
So you come to my home instead?

260
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,560
What's your situation?

261
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,680
The first trial concluded yesterday.

262
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,080
How's my classmate's case going?

263
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,080
Move your car.

264
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,880
I understand

265
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,280
how you feel.

266
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,040
But there's evidence of the defendant confessing to murder,

267
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,700
and the prosecution has substantial evidence.

268
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,200
So as the court director,

269
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,520
my final ruling

270
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,640
must strictly follow legal provisions.

271
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,080
My classmate couldn't possibly have killed anyone.

272
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,240
I know him too well.

273
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,360
But your word alone isn't enough,

274
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,200
especially when the prosecution has a complete chain of evidence

275
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,800
and the judgment procedure was correct.

276
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,280
But I can promise you one thing:

277
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,400
our judicial organs will handle this impartially.

278
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,880
That's our responsibility.

279
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,840
Alright.

280
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,920
You're a good judge of the people.

281
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,320
Don't flatter me.

282
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,180
No, no, I'm not.

283
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,960
Have you ever seen a judge

284
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,530
handling cases at their own doorstep?

285
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,160
Let me tell you.

286
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,320
If I find out

287
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,640
you're waiting for me outside my home again,

288
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,360
I won't be this nice.

289
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,040
But,

290
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,120
I can't go to your office,

291
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,880
can't come to your home.

292
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,560
Where am I supposed to find you?

293
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,760
Why do you need to find me specifically?

294
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,200
Can't you just follow

295
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,960
the normal procedures?

296
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Who goes directly to the court president to handle a case?

297
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,720
Are you asking me to bend the law?

298
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,040
No, no.

299
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,880
It's like this.

300
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,160
My brother-in-law,

301
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,120
he killed someone again a few days ago.

302
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,360
It's a bit unfair,

303
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,640
so I thought I'd come

304
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,160
to brief you on the case.

305
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,920
You know,

306
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,260
you're quite an interesting person.

307
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,640
If you pass the bar exam,

308
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,960
all these

309
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,800
cases from your friends and family

310
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,260
will keep you busy enough.

311
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,080
That's true.

312
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,560
Did you decide to become a lawyer

313
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,160
because so many people around you

314
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,130
keep getting into trouble?

315
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,360
That's part of it.

316
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,680
You appear

317
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,080
so refined and gentle,

318
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,650
yet everyone around you

319
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,100
is involved in life-threatening cases.

320
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,840
I'm worried too, but what can I do?

321
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,440
They

322
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,640
don't do it intentionally,

323
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,800
and

324
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,440
they're not bad people, really.

325
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,970
Whether they're good or bad

326
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,840
is for the law to decide.

327
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,000
Alright,

328
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,490
I need to get to work.

329
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,800
Let's end

330
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,440
our conversation here, okay?

331
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,080
But we haven't really discussed anything yet.

332
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,360
Nothing at all.

333
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,200
I've been clear enough with you.

334
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,160
What,

335
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,560
do you want to come work at the court with me?

336
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,600
Can I?

337
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,080
Are you serious?

338
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,240
You're really something.

339
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,840
I have a car. I can give you a ride.

340
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,560
Let me drive you.

341
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,560
During this delay,

342
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,520
perhaps

343
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,240
prices in Shanghai will rise even more.

344
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,040
But we can't be too greedy.

345
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,500
We need to play it safe.

346
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,440
Go ahead.

347
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,460
I'll take care of things here.

348
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,280
Alright.

349
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,760
Keep an eye on Erpang

350
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,360
and my father's mood.

351
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Don't worry.

352
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,480
To curb stamp

353
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,360
speculation and illegal operations,

354
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,280
relevant departments have introduced measures

355
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,000
specifying that during the stamp sale period,

356
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,360
stamps will be sold at face value and regulated prices,

357
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,720
and in cooperation with industry and commerce departments,

358
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,200
they will regulate the philatelic market

359
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,400
and crack down on speculation.

360
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,680
Boss,

361
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,260
how much is one set now?

362
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,080
2,800 yuan.

363
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,240
What?

364
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,680
Last week, the price reached as high as 3,700.

365
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,880
This week it dropped.

366
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,600
This is already the highest price I can offer.

367
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,440
I have so much inventory now

368
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,520
stuck with me.

369
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,280
But in business,

370
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,010
that's just how it goes.

371
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,650
When there's a rise,

372
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,130
there's also a fall.

373
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,320
You'll get used to it.

374
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,650
Have you ever seen anything that only goes up and never down?

375
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,000
Boss,

376
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,890
when you were making money,

377
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,090
you should have anticipated this day would come.

378
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,960
I never made any money.

379
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,520
Didn't I refuse to sell last time?

380
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,280
Boss,

381
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,530
I'm thankful you didn't sell to me,

382
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,820
otherwise I would have lost everything.

383
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,880
It's dropped

384
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,400
by about a quarter.

385
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,960
But when it rises, it doubles in value.

386
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,720
As I just said,

387
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,880
when there's a rise, there's a fall.

388
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,840
And now I'll add:

389
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,960
after a fall, there will be a rise.

390
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
That makes sense.

391
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,720
When are you coming back?

392
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,730
It dropped a bit.

393
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
If I sell now,

394
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,440
we might lose some money.

395
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,220
I want to wait a little longer,

396
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,840
until it goes up before I come back.

397
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,080
Just come back when it rises a bit.

398
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,000
Erpang's grades are dropping rapidly now.

399
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,120
His grandfather can't control him.

400
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,580
I can handle him even less.

401
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,760
If you don't come back soon,

402
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,220
this child will be ruined.

403
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,120
Okay, I'll be back soon.

404
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,400
2,000.

405
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,480
I bought it for 3,000.

406
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,800
Boss,

407
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,440
I never said I had to buy it.

408
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,720
To be honest,

409
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,680
I don't even want it for 2,000 per set.

410
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,480
So when do you think

411
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,160
the price will go back up?

412
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,520
That's a great question.

413
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,520
If I knew when prices would rise

414
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,720
and when they'd fall,

415
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,320
I wouldn't be sitting here doing business.

416
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,880
So,

417
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,570
do you think the price will ever go back up?

418
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,680
I think it will.

419
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,040
But

420
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,240
that's just my wishful thinking.

421
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,720
If prices keep falling,

422
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,680
I'll go bankrupt.

423
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
I'll go bankrupt.

424
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,770
I won't go bankrupt.

425
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,770
I won't go bankrupt.

426
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,280
Right, I won't either.

427
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,280
No way.

428
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,160
Won't go bankrupt.

429
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,240
How much for this?

430
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,320
8,000.

431
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,520
I bought it for 18,000

432
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,080
and it's in perfect condition.

433
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,800
Even if you bought it for 100,000,

434
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,240
I'm only offering 8,000.

435
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,160
If you think that's too low,

436
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,420
ask around elsewhere.

437
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:27,960
9,000?

438
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,640
Just 8,000. Not a penny more.

439
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,000
Give me four more sets.

440
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,640
You're averaging down, aren't you?

441
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,440
That's right.

442
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,960
Bold move.

443
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,080
The number you have dialed

444
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,740
is temporarily unavailable.

445
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,680
Please try again later.

446
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,880
Have you been in touch with Guoming lately?

447
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,920
No,

448
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,520
what's up?

449
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,600
Since yesterday,

450
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,400
I haven't been able to reach him.

451
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,240
Is it because of this?

452
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,160
Look.

453
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,600
Stamps and phone cards nationwide

454
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,860
are dropping in price,

455
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,520
crashing dramatically.

456
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,300
I hope nothing's happened to him.

457
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,370
I want to go to Shanghai to find him.

458
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,600
Where in Shanghai is he?

459
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
He's in that...

460
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,320
I'm too anxious to remember.

461
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,000
In Luwan District,

462
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,720
the Luwan Stamp and Coin Market.

463
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,120
I'll go there.

464
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,800
Sister-in-law,

465
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,400
you shouldn't go.

466
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,240
If you go, no one will watch the store.

467
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,170
I have my dad and uncle here to help.

468
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:03,760
Boss.

469
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,680
I want to ask if you've seen a

470
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,240
northerner,

471
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,170
about this tall,

472
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,280
with a side part,

473
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
have you seen him?

474
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,320
Have you seen a

475
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,640
northerner?

476
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,600
He.

477
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,800
Was he drunk

478
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,600
or something?

479
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,480
Boss! Boss!

480
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,120
Let me ask you something.

481
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,800
Have you seen a guy from the North?

482
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,320
About my height,

483
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,850
with a side part hairstyle.

484
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,600
Does he dress flashily,

485
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,060
like some kind of hoodlum?

486
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,640
Yes, exactly like a hoodlum.

487
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,570
Sure, I know him.

488
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,840
He comes here asking about four or five times every day.

489
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,680
Asking four or five...

490
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,040
Where is he now?

491
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,560
This friend of yours,

492
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,440
seems to have a few screws loose.

493
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,320
What do you mean? What's wrong with him?

494
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,640
Where is he now?

495
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,120
Look,

496
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,560
is that him?

497
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,920
Every unit has dropped to 1,500.

498
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,360
If we quit now,

499
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,780
everything we've done

500
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,680
will be for nothing.

501
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,980
And we'll still be in a lot of debt.

502
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,210
I thought it through on my way here.

503
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,160
Whether we make a profit or loss,

504
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,560
as long as you're safe, that's what matters.

505
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,160
Even if we really lose money,

506
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,300
I'm in no rush to get paid back.

507
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,940
You're alone in Shanghai.

508
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,090
Take good care of yourself.

509
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,880
Hailong is already gone.

510
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,890
You can't risk anything happening to you too.

511
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,060
Why isn't he answering his phone?

512
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,280
Well,

513
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,860
he sold his cell phone.

514
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,840
And then

515
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,220
he bought some stamps with the money.

516
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,040
Don't worry,

517
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,850
we'll definitely pay you back.

518
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,690
Sister-in-law,

519
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,160
you know

520
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,360
I've always been a cautious person.

521
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,800
My buddy Cui,

522
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,320
he's brave enough to take risks.

523
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,120
But since we're brothers,

524
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,650
when he takes risks,

525
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,380
it's like he's taking them for me too.

526
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,000
If you look at it that way,

527
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,560
my life can be considered complete.

528
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,540
Tell me where he is.

529
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,120
Sister-in-law, please don't go.

530
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,000
Tell me

531
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,320
where he is.

532
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,170
It's my first time in Shanghai.

533
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,280
Could you show me around?

534
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,560
It's 1,400 per set today.

535
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,560
1,500 per set.

536
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,340
Firm price.

537
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,600
1,420.

538
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,320
Not a penny more.

539
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,520
Let's wait a bit longer.

540
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,200
Deal.

541
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,120
Shall we go home?

542
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,520
We owe 200,000 in debt.

543
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,340
Let's pay off the urgent debts first.

544
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,760
What are we going to pay with?

545
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,100
Sell the house.

546
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,860
Sell the house?

547
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,780
As long as we're together,

548
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,680
we'll always have a home.

549
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,840
Guoming,

550
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,600
let's go home.

551
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,050
That's enough. Let's take a break.

552
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,679
I'm not in a hurry for that money.

553
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,280
Even ten years would be fine.

554
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,320
Is there money from others too?

555
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,400
Let's not talk about it.

556
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,130
It's already been sold anyway.

557
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,040
Mom?

558
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,240
Do we not have a home anymore?

559
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,130
We're just moving to a new home.

560
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,120
My classmate said

561
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,410
that my dad lost everything we had.

562
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,480
Don't listen to their nonsense.

563
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,940
We can always earn it back.

564
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,440
This home won't be

565
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
ours anymore?

566
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,320
Xiaoxue.

567
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,200
Your puppy

568
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,760
will stay with Uncle Liu for now.

569
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,320
Your grandfather

570
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,130
is allergic to dog hair.

571
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,720
Uncle Liu,

572
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,840
can I come see it again later?

573
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Of course you can.

574
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,160
Whenever you miss it,

575
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,690
you can come visit anytime.

576
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,090
Take the pigeon.

577
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,200
Honey, um...

578
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,000
My pigeon!

579
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,320
These two,

580
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,240
I'll leave them here for now.

581
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,760
When I get that bigger one.

582
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,920
You can stay here,

583
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,640
for as long as you need.

584
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,560
But I really

585
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,520
don't know how to take care of children.

586
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,580
Since your grandmother passed away,

587
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,480
I've struggled to keep

588
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,210
this house in order.

589
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,800
I see.

590
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,810
You two need to divide the work.

591
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,000
Erpang,

592
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,840
you'll be responsible for washing vegetables and cooking.

593
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,320
Xiaoxue will do the laundry

594
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,450
and clean the house.

595
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,680
No, Grandpa.

596
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,720
I don't know how to cook either.

597
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,800
Then what can you do?

598
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,560
Eat.

599
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,360
You must learn.

600
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,880
I can learn how to cook.

601
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,120
No need.

602
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,600
He must learn.

603
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,340
I'll teach him how to cook.

604
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,560
Xiaoxue.

605
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,320
Take your things

606
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,760
to your room.

607
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,960
Where will Erpang stay?

608
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,240
Erpang will stay in the living room.

609
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
That's not right.

610
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,880
Girls

611
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,480
need their own space.

612
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,560
It's decided.

613
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,560
I never thought

614
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,160
our family would be wealthy.

615
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,400
We could just live in our old small house.

616
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,460
It was enough for our family of three.

617
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,370
It would be fine for Erpang too.

618
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,180
I could take Mengmeng on weekends

619
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,880
to have a meal with you at Dingqing Restaurant.

620
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,160
What a happy life.

621
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,690
You've been exhausted these days.

622
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,010
Go to the shop in the afternoon.

623
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,920
It's okay.

624
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,000
We'll definitely pay back the money within a year.

625
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,300
The shop is still ours.

626
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,640
Let's work hard together.

627
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,440
We'll be fine.

628
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,520
Drink your porridge.

629
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,960
Hello?

630
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,410
Your sister-in-law

631
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,500
has been in a car accident.

632
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,920
Your sister-in-law has been in a car accident.

633
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,180
She's in the hospital.

634
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,250
What did the doctor say?

635
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,240
The situation doesn't look good.

636
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,700
She needs to be moved to the ICU immediately.

637
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,920
Is it that serious?

638
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,400
We're doing our best.

639
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,440
Someone needs to

640
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,960
pay the ICU fees.

641
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,170
I'll figure something out.

642
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,130
What about your shop

643
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,600
now?

644
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,280
Sir,

645
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,880
I'll look after the shop for you.

646
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
Don't worry.

647
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,360
Xiaoxue,

648
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,120
Erpang,

649
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,240
let's go home first.

650
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,600
Grandpa,

651
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,730
I want to go with you too.

652
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,530
How much money do you have left?

653
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,080
I got 10,000 from my dad.

654
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,620
Paid 8,000 for the hospital deposit.

655
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,090
Only 2,000 left.

656
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,160
Wish you prosperity!

657
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,080
May everything go your way!

658
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,880
Would you like to request a song?

659
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,640
Gentlemen, wish you prosperity!

660
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,480
May everything go your way!

661
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,280
Would you like to request a song?

662
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,360
Ladies and gentlemen, wish you prosperity!

663
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,240
May everything go your way!

664
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,840
Would you like to hear a song?

665
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,040
Don't go! Where are you heading?

666
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,520
Why do you always avoid me?

667
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,720
I'm not avoiding you.

668
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,380
You're keeping a low profile these days.

669
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,920
I can't afford to be high-profile anymore.

670
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,360
Sing.

671
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,930
Brother, it's 20 yuan per song.

672
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,400
Then you should

673
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,130
sing according to how much I'm paying.

674
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,240
Thank you.

675
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,850
I can sing anything, right?

676
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,520
Then I'll sing

677
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,080
'Who Understands a Wanderer's Heart'

678
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,520
for you three gentlemen.

679
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,600
Wish you prosperity!

680
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,840
May everything go smoothly!

681
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,440
