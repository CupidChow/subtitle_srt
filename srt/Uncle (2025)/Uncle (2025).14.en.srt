1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,520
I want to go with you.

2
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,440
Nonhe.

3
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,880
Talk to your international friends there.

4
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,840
A tattoo art.

5
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,039
A combination of Chinese and western style.

6
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,770
and become a big tattoo artist.

7
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,680
You haven't given up on this idea

8
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,680
If that's how I feel,

9
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,200
I'll give up my dream.

10
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,740
What else can I pursue?

11
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,770
Besides,

12
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,560
many great artists travel around the world

13
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,400
to find inspiration and nutrition.

14
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,400
and finally become a master.

15
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,840
Just like Li Bai.

16
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,760
You see, he writes wherever he goes.

17
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,160
the better he writes.

18
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,330
I want to be like him.

19
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,530
You eat wherever you go.

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,840
As a man,

21
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,600
Work hard

22
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,200
and return home in glory.

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,560
You can't live a happy life.

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,960
Be ambitious.

25
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,690
Are you eating something good?

26
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,010
Brother.

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,900
I think you really look down on me.

28
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,320
Did I say I want to work with you?

29
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
I mean

30
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,120
we can have a company together.

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,960
Liu is enough for me.

32
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,600
I'm enough.

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,040
Being with you is too tiring.

34
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,120
I won't go with you.

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,840
Then leave.

36
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,240
I won't eat your food.

37
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,960
Put it on.

38
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,600
What is this?

39
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,320
I...

40
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,600
Who will take the money from here?

41
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,720
If you lose

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,360
If you lose it,

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,520
How can you come back in winter?

44
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,880
Are you a beggar?

45
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,280
I've been to Guangzhou so many times.

46
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,520
I never lost money.

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,280
When you go up a mountain, you meet a tiger.

48
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,480
We have to be careful.

49
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,760
It's not a big deal to lose the money.

50
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,520
The most important thing is to put it on safely.

51
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,920
What are you doing?

52
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,000
Superman

53
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Are you Biao Zi?

54
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,200
Excuse me.

55
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,920
Excuse me.

56
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,720
Sorry.

57
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,360
Come on.

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,760
Stop.

59
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,160
Slow down.

60
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,720
Excuse me.

61
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,640
There are too many people.

62
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,440
Excuse me.

63
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,200
Be careful.

64
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,160
Come here

65
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,040
Over here

66
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,520
Let me do it.

67
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,360
Sit down.

68
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,920
Come here and sit down.

69
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,800
You followed me, didn't you?

70
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,440
Who followed you?

71
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,200
I followed you.

72
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,480
But I sat here first.

73
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,600
Besides,

74
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,280
you booked the whole railway.

75
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,720
If you do, I'll go down now.

76
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,260
Will you follow us after getting off?

77
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,920
Just don't follow me.

78
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,400
How will you live

79
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,840
how will you live?

80
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,810
It's none of your business.

81
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,880
Here's 7,000 yuan.

82
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,600
What does he mean?

83
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,480
What are you thinking?

84
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,200
I said there's 7,000 yuan in it.

85
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,080
The transfer fee Mr. Liu gave me this morning is 7,000 yuan.

86
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,880
Okay.

87
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,040
Now everyone knows

88
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,380
you have 7,000.

89
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,840
Here.

90
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
So what?

91
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,210
Can you take me away?

92
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,720
Can you?

93
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,080
Just kidding, sir.

94
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,410
Look how scared you are.

95
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,840
Train clerk

96
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,160
This way.

97
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,960
I'm hungry.

98
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,640
Come here.

99
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,480
Come here.

100
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,520
A roast chicken.

101
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,640
A pack of melon seeds.

102
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,100
and a bottle of white wine.

103
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,640
35 yuan.

104
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
It's so cheap.

105
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,100
Two bottles of white wine.

106
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,640
Here's the money.

107
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,400
This meal is on me.

108
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,520
Let's get drunk.

109
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,640
Let's break up after getting off.

110
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,200
You do it.

111
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,640
I can't drink.

112
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,820
Sir, have some.

113
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,160
No.

114
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,000
Ever since the Soviet Union was disintegrated,

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,480
Russian light industrial lacks

116
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,880
So, the job of Mr. Fall was proliferated.

117
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,840
The number of trade at the border

118
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,720
and brings convenience to people.

119
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,680
During this period

120
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,800
he created many legends.

121
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,920
And my uncle

122
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,440
took a fancy to this opportunity.

123
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,040
I have an unforgettable experience.

124
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,180
Here we are.

125
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Is it cold?

126
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
Where is my money?

127
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,960
My money!

128
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,200
Stop shouting.

129
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,720
Sit beside you.

130
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,960
He got off a long time ago.

131
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,200
I took turns sleeping with Liu at midnight.

132
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,400
I just want to see you.

133
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,300
We fell asleep when we woke up.

134
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,220
What should I do there?

135
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,040
Protect it.

136
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,480
Cover your face.

137
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,520
Okay, get off.

138
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,920
Wait.

139
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,520
I think it's not the same

140
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,780
to follow me like this.

141
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,840
I'm not short of hands.

142
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,900
How about this?

143
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,640
I'll give you 200 yuan.

144
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,520
100 yuan.

145
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,840
The train ticket you bought.

146
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,720
What about the other 100?

147
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,450
You can buy some food in the car.

148
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,720
or drinks.

149
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,600
You can drink more.

150
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,400
You have nothing to lose anyway.

151
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,720
Who said I have nothing to be embarrassed about?

152
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,120
How can I be embarrassed?

153
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,360
You're not embarrassed now.

154
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,280
It's embarrassing now,

155
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,640
But it's more embarrassing for me to go back.

156
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,080
I told my friends and relatives three days ago

157
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,720
I need to be decent

158
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
to go back.

159
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,400
I also told Liu.

160
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,080
If I go back like this,

161
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,720
if I go back like this?

162
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,970
I have to follow you.

163
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,760
Then I can't be responsible for your brags.

164
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,720
I don't know

165
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,400
I don't know how to take responsibility.

166
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,320
Mr. Cui, you

167
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,520
you know yourself very well.

168
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,480
But I can't learn that from you.

169
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,640
I have to fulfill my bragging.

170
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,760
OK. Go realize it.

171
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,080
Don't follow us, okay?

172
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,840
But then again,

173
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,640
I have no money now.

174
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
How can I live?

175
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,160
Oh my god

176
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,640
Cover your mouth.

177
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,280
No, I don't know anyone.

178
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,720
If I don't follow you,

179
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,280
The 7,000 yuan you lost

180
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,640
might be fate.

181
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,760
It's a mistake.

182
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,840
God asks you to go home.

183
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,640
With your personality,

184
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
You're here with 7,000 yuan.

185
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,480
you might really

186
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,960
go back. Let's go.

187
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,640
Why don't you buy me a pair of pants first?

188
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,920
I'll pay you back.

189
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,080
I saw a pair of leather pants on the street.

190
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
I put on the specific spirit.

191
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,320
What do you mean?

192
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,160
There must be a reason

193
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,640
for a reason.

194
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
I lost 7,000 yuan.

195
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,940
That's the reason.

196
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,320
Besides, I'm not wearing cotton pants.

197
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,920
I don't need that much.

198
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,560
Here.

199
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,880
No leather pants.

200
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,920
Go buy a sewing bag

201
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,160
and sew up your pants.

202
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,240
and follow us.

203
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,920
That's ugly.

204
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,160
I don't have leather pants or cotton pants yet.

205
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,240
Do you understand the point?

206
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,360
You can follow us.

207
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,850
Do you want to...

208
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,560
Mr. Cui, you eat first.

209
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,000
You're welcome.

210
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,920
Come on.

211
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,040
Can you

212
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,440
sew your pants?

213
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,680
What?

214
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,280
In our village,

215
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,400
in our village.

216
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,040
That's him.

217
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
You buy a white line with black pants.

218
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,240
That's more obvious.

219
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,640
I plan to embroider

220
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,920
when I sew it later.

221
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
and embroider on the pants.

222
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
You're really talented.

223
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,040
Of course.

224
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,520
This is sour.

225
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,280
It's quite delicious.

226
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,940
It has tomatoes and potatoes.

227
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,400
Beef jam

228
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,740
It's hot

229
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
It's a little hot.

230
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,340
Straighten

231
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,120
I haven't stitched my pants.

232
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,820
before sewing your pants.

233
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,120
The beef is rotten.

234
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,360
Dacasso.

235
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,120
It's me.

236
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,530
Send it over.

237
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,260
You're scared.

238
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,360
Are you Feifei?

239
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,440
Yes.

240
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,160
Come with us.

241
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,760
Brother.

242
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,560
Where are we going?

243
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,160
I suspect you

244
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,040
who cheated our goods.

245
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

246
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,490
Are you from the police?

247
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,120
Of course not.

248
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,880
Then why should I go with you?

249
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,160
If it's not you,

250
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,280
then

251
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,440
why don't you dare to go with us?

252
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,560
I don't even know you.

253
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,040
Why should I go with you?

254
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,160
Just do as I say.

255
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,280
Cut the crap.

256
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
Stop!

257
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,760
Dada.

258
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,520
You...

259
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,760
He said he doesn't know you.

260
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,610
Why should I go with you?

261
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,360
What do you do?

262
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,040
Are you asking about my job?

263
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,160
I'm a tattoo artist.

264
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,520
I mean the front door.

265
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,800
You told me about the hip axis.

266
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,280
What does it have to do with her?

267
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
For now,

268
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,560
It's okay.

269
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,680
What?

270
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,530
You want to compete with us?

271
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,920
I didn't say I'd compete with you.

272
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,160
Disappear!

273
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,860
Do you understand?

274
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,000
Don't touch her.

275
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,220
What? You want to touch me?

276
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,360
How is it?

277
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,400
Very good.

278
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,880
Disappear.

279
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,160
I'm asking you how good

280
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,040
How is it?

281
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,640
Disappear. Do you understand?

282
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,760
I can disappear.

283
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,560
But I have to say it again.

284
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,880
Don't touch her.

285
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,040
Are you done?

286
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,520
A tiger climbs the mountain.

287
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,440
Stop fighting!

288
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,880
That woman ran away.

289
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,610
Go after her!

290
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,400
Come on.

291
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,400
Wait and see.

292
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,640
Here.

293
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,920
I'll give you 300.

294
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,040
One hundred left.

295
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,360
Go to the hospital and bandage your wound.

296
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,520
and go home. Please.

297
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,680
Now?

298
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,880
Right now.

299
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,120
It's impossible.

300
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,440
a room for three.

301
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,520
Three beds.

302
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:40,880
Okay.

303
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,440
I used to

304
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,560
when I went out.

305
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,800
Go sleep on the street.

306
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,260
The whole street is yours.

307
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,280
There's a saying in our village.

308
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,340
"Don't think it's bad to be a beggar."

309
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,640
I'm not a professional beggar.

310
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,360
I just encountered some difficulties.

311
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,640
Later,

312
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,160
wait in your room.

313
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,440
Brother Liu and I will get a board car.

314
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
to get the goods.

315
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,520
Take your luggage upstairs.

316
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,540
I want to go too.

317
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,359
What are you going to do?

318
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,040
I can't live here for free.

319
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,280
I have to help.

320
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,280
Thank you.

321
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,940
We're here.

322
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,280
About a week.

323
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,359
For this week,

324
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,880
just stay in your room.

325
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,680
That's the greatest help for us.

326
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,960
It's okay. I'll do it.

327
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,760
Good.

328
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,890
Brother Liu.

329
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
If you can eat,

330
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,360
It's really good, but it's strong.

331
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Not like Nada.

332
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,160
Good.

333
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,920
You can really eat.

334
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,640
You're a troublemaker

335
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,530
You're despicable.

336
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,760
Didn't you see

337
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,640
Did you see

338
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,680
that woman?

339
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,850
Take that bottle

340
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,480
Open it to your head.

341
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,880
What should we do?

342
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,280
We can't leave him alone.

343
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,600
We can only

344
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,560
Let him stay in the hotel.

345
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,440
He...

346
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,640
Stay here.

347
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,770
That's impossible.

348
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,440
Three down jackets.

349
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,320
for three motorcycles.

350
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,880
No.

351
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,000
Six.

352
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,840
Four.

353
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,680
No bargain.

354
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,720
Five pieces.

355
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,960
This is six.

356
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,600
Five.

357
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,680
If you bargain again,

358
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,920
I'll find my son.

359
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,370
I'll beat you up.

360
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,160
Stop talking.

361
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,300
Can you give me four sets of dolls?

362
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,200
Why should I give you four condoms?

363
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,160
You have two sons.

364
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,200
I have four children.

365
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,120
Impossible.

366
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,840
You only have one family.

367
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,980
She knows everything.

368
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,560
I have four.

369
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,120
One is my biological son.

370
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,640
The other three are my buddies.

371
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,900
I'll take care of them.

372
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,000
Okay then.

373
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,720
I'll give you four this time.

374
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,840
I won't see you off next time.

375
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,000
Okay, thank you.

376
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,320
Don't let your son hit me.

377
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,600
Can three motorcycles carry it?

378
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Yes.

379
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,560
Okay.

380
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,880
Liu,

381
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,460
It's getting late.

382
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,480
Take this down jacket back

383
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,920
and then

384
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,360
to the terminal.

385
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,360
It's not that.

386
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,320
Let me see. Car bed.

387
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,640
The bed.

388
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,640
What for?

389
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840
This is the simplest bed.

390
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,400
As long as you can cut it.

391
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,440
This is too much in St. Peter Paul.

392
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,840
It's not valuable at all.

393
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,600
And the transportation

394
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,120
the transportation fee is very high.

395
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,800
The transportation fee is more valuable than yours.

396
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,680
It's okay. Pay me the transport fee too.

397
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,680
I'll pay you with the transport fee.

398
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,120
Are you changing it with a down jacket?

399
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,920
Yes.

400
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,600
25 pieces.

401
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,100
Twenty pieces.

402
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,160
No bargain.

403
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,760
I've never done this before.

404
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,490
Okay.

405
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,880
I'll pay you five pieces as deposit.

406
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,920
I'll send them to you tomorrow.

407
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,400
Okay.

408
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,520
Let me ask you something.

409
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,960
Come here.

410
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,570
What are you making?

411
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,440
I'm going to

412
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,760
for my nephew.

413
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,420
I don't believe it.

414
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
You can change five bicycles

415
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,480
you can get five bicycles.

416
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,640
Seriously.

417
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,360
When will the bed arrive?

418
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,000
One month.

419
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,640
Let's keep each other's contact

420
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,960
and come to you tomorrow.

421
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,640
Okay.

422
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
Every day,

423
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,680
for free every day.

424
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,360
I'm so sorry.

425
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,170
Brother.

426
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
Let me ride it.

427
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
Let's take turns.

428
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,280
Forget it.

429
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,760
You tattoo artist.

430
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,200
You can't do this.

431
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,600
The technical work

432
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,920
are all the same.

433
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,120
Are you stupid?

434
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,640
There's a gate here.

435
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,760
Don't you know?

436
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,440
Isn't that someone?

437
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,120
Who?

438
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,840
The guy who fought with us at noon.

439
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,960
Up, up, up.

440
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,000
Go!

441
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,000
Come back!

442
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,920
Come back.

443
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,240
Liu.

444
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,040
Mr. Cui.

445
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,120
What are you doing here?

446
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,650
I'm here.

447
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,610
Waiting for the tattoo artist.

448
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,680
Where's the tricycle?

449
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,360
He rode the tricycle.

450
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,440
Where did he go?

451
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:17,840
He...

452
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,840
Look over there.

453
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,440
those people fighting the war.

454
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,200
He caught up.

455
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,960
I shouted

456
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,120
He's not coming back?

457
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,000
Are there many people?

458
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,960
It's quite crowded.

459
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,760
It's dark in the jeep.

460
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,360
Geep?

461
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,560
It's okay. He can't catch up.

462
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,520
I was thinking

463
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,880
What if we catch up?

464
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,090
Wait for a red light.

465
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,960
Mr. Cui,

466
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,440
is that you're kind.

467
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,880
His weakness is that he's too kind.

468
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,040
Something really happened to him.

469
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,570
It has nothing to do with us.

470
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,200
Besides, he can't catch up

471
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,730
he won't be able to catch up.

472
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,480
He'll be back soon.

473
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:25,800
You...

474
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,040
Did you buy a car bed?

475
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:28,720
Yes.

476
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,680
I think besides doing business

477
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,600
besides doing business,

478
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,360
I want to buy a car bed.

479
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,500
You're not stupid.

480
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,400
I'm not stupid.

481
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,040
I'm just uneducated.

482
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,480
I'm not stupid.

483
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,280
Let's go upstairs.

484
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:45,840
Let's go.

485
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,640
Get on.

486
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
This is yours.

487
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,880
One kilometre.

488
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,610
How much is it for the four of us?

489
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,520
Five yuan.

490
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,570
Let's go. Get in.

491
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,440
Be careful.

492
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,680
The most important thing now

493
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,200
we have to catch those who cheated us.

494
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,680
We were going to catch them today.

495
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,960
That woman

496
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,640
met the three fools.

497
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,160
The guy who hit me today

498
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,520
I had to break his legs when I grabbed him.

499
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,780
He's the most hateful.

500
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,360
Hold him.

501
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,920
Break both legs.

502
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,960
It's his fault.

503
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,680
Here we are.

504
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,680
It won't delay.

505
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,680
Come on.

506
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,720
Here.

507
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,120
Stop!

508
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,360
You don't want the money?

509
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,880
Are you frozen?

510
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,920
Thank you.

511
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,920
This is fun.

512
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,480
You're having fun.

513
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,400
Aunt.

514
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,820
Xue's dog keeps biting my turtle.

515
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,200
Your shell is so hard.

516
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,440
How can my dog bite it?

517
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,680
Who are you calling a turtle?

518
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,960
Aren't you a turtle?

519
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,520
You call me a turtle?

520
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,840
I didn't.

521
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,960
Xiao Xue didn't say anything.

522
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,840
What are you talking about?

523
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,960
My mom is still here.

524
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,360
I heard it just now.

525
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,760
Didn't you say

526
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,480
to bake my pigeon

527
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,520
roast my pigeon?

528
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,240
I didn't say I wanted to roast your pigeon.

529
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,370
I mean roasted pigeons are delicious.

530
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,240
We only have two pigeons.

531
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,170
Whose pigeons do you want to roast?

532
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,880
There are no pigeons in the barbecue restaurant.

533
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,680
You just want to roast my pigeon.

534
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,840
I really didn't.

535
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,000
I didn't even touch your pigeon.

536
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,680
But Seol's dog

537
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,410
really wants to bite my turtle.

538
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,320
It...

539
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,680
It's not broken.

540
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,440
Can I make a request?

541
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,760
Yes.

542
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,160
When my uncle comes back,

543
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,200
make a cage for Xue's dog.

544
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,400
Sure.

545
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,520
It always pisses at home

546
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,720
Grab the sofa at home.

547
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,960
Okay.

548
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,560
When will my uncle come back?

549
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,680
In two days.

550
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,170
My uncle will make a lot of money

551
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,800
make a lot of money this time.

552
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,400
I didn't expect

553
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,880
to come back safely.

554
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,880
Just say something.

555
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,330
A tattoo artist.

556
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,680
What?

557
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,640
Didn't catch up with your enemy?

558
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,520
I did.

559
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,600
Stop boasting. What are you chasing?

560
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,480
Look at your turn.

561
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,200
You didn't catch up.

562
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,840
Nothing.

563
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,600
The timing to do it.

564
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,240
What is this?

565
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,680
It's too dangerous.

566
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,200
We've just arrived and we're already fighting a war.

567
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,200
Maybe we can fight again in two days.

568
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,960
This is the military supplies.

569
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,240
Be prepared.

570
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,610
It might not be useful someday.

571
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,640
What do you mean?

572
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,170
Are you ready to be beaten here for a long time?

573
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,960
You can use it.

574
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,760
Mr. Cui and I don't need it.

575
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,440
We might all need it.

576
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,210
Don't you have no money?

577
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,720
I made it by pedaling.

578
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,440
Five yuan.

579
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,600
Painkiller.

580
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,680
bandage.

581
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,160
Gauze.

582
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,440
Five yuan is spent.

583
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,680
How about a bottle of purple medicine?

584
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,200
Sleep, sweetie.

585
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,440
Mom.

586
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,680
Can we go back to the old days?

587
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,090
When it was just the three of us,

588
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,960
we were about to buy a big house.

589
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,200
Don't think too much.

590
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,400
Sleep.

591
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,200
I don't want a big house.

592
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
I just want to go back to the old days.

593
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
Mr. Cui, eat the chicken.

594
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,680
I can't eat it anymore.

595
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,400
Look.

596
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,040
we can go home

597
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,600
We can go home in three days.

598
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,520
Okay, you decide.

599
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,160
When will you come back?

600
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
I'll treat you.

601
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,520
Will you stay here?

602
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,360
Help!

603
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,160
Help!

604
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,240
It doesn't sound like a joke.

605
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,960
It's like he's really asking for help.

606
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,490
Let's go.

607
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,840
Mr. Cui.

608
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,360
When you're out,

609
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,760
It's better to save trouble.

610
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,160
Why are we talking about this egg? Hurry up.

611
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,200
Help!

612
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,400
I think he's just next door.

613
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,920
Mr. Cui

614
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,100
Mr. Cui!

615
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,680
Help!

616
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,960
Help!

617
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,240
Help!

618
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,160
Open the door!

619
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,760
Help!

620
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,960
Help! Help!

621
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,760
What's wrong?

622
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,650
Where is the bad guy?

623
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,360
He's not a bad guy.

624
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,120
It's a mouse.

625
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,640
So scary

626
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,200
What's so scary about a rat?

627
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,280
I'd rather see a tiger

628
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,200
than see a rat.

629
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,520
Can you just leave one person behind?

630
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,400
and help me catch the rat?

631
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,240
I'm a girl.

632
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,040
It's too inconvenient.

633
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,600
You may leave.

634
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,240
Let me do it.

635
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,280
Okay.

636
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
No.

637
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,000
Brother.

638
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,200
Can you help me catch the rat?

639
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,600
Why do you pick a rat?

640
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,040
It doesn't matter who catches it.

641
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,970
It's different.

642
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,880
You look like a good person.

643
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,880
They...

644
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,440
You...

645
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,520
All of you go out. Let me do it.

646
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,520
What are you doing?

647
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,040
I'm treating the wall.

648
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,500
I'm listening.

649
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,720
How's the rat going

650
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,160
If he didn't catch it,

651
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,280
I have to help him.

652
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,360
What are you helping?

653
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,420
That woman won't let you help either.

654
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,280
We came out together.

655
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,610
We can't let Mr. Cui make mistakes.

656
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,120
No wonder that woman

657
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,850
didn't ask you to catch the rat.

658
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,760
Look at you.

659
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,280
I'm afraid Mr. Cui

660
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,340
is up to something.

661
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,120
Do you think Mr. Cui is you?

662
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,680
Tell me.

663
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,120
we met that girl at lunch.

664
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,600
We met her in a hotel.

665
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,130
Don't you think it's weird?

666
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,160
You're the weird one.

667
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,040
Don't talk.

668
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,200
Brother.

669
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,680
What's your name?

670
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
My surname is Cui.

671
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
My surname is Cui.

672
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,600
You're so nice.

673
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,000
What do you do here?

674
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,320
Let's do some business. What about you?

675
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,760
Me too.

676
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,760
The door is broken.

677
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,440
I'll tell the hotel later. I'll pay for it.

678
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,440
It's okay. I hit it anyway.

679
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,200
Let me do it.

680
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,200
I'm scared.

681
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,880
What are you doing?

682
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,200
Brother I'm scared

683
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,160
I'm scared.

684
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,000
You...

685
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,840
You...

686
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,600
Who is this wild man?

687
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,520
Tell me.

688
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,880
I'm not a wild man.

689
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,040
It has nothing to do with me.

690
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,400
He barged in on his own.

691
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,040
Really?

692
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,640
Yes.

693
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,720
Honey, he knocked the door open.

694
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,440
He came in and said he wanted to molest me.

695
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,160
Then why did you hug him?

696
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,520
He said if I didn't obey him,

697
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,760
he would strangle me to death.

698
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,280
Honey.

699
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,360
I'm not that kind of person.

700
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,850
What's going on?

701
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,960
I'm here to catch the rat.

702
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
Shut up!

703
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,880
Okay, I got it.

704
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,900
Indecent harassment, right?

705
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,440
Okay.

706
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,360
You're not leaving today.

707
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
What's going on?

708
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,960
What are you doing

709
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,680
I'm a tattoo artist.

710
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,679
Get out!

711
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,440
Yes, the three of them are together.

712
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,520
They said they'll take turns.

713
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,480
Honey.

714
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,440
Please help me.

715
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,719
Didn't you ask us

716
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,920
to catch the rat for you?

717
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,880
What do you do?

718
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,760
Are you catching a rat?

719
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,719
I'm a tattoo artist.

720
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,679
Are you three cats?

721
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,440
I want you to catch rats.

722
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,600
I said I'm a tattoo artist.

723
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,440
Okay, okay.

724
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,679
I'll stop talking.

725
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,760
Make a condition.

726
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,600
I see.

727
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,199
What do you understand?

728
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:32,760
You do.

729
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,090
Aren't you just cactus?

730
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,760
You want money,

731
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,480
we just want to go home safely.

732
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,239
Make a condition.

733
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,239
We'll agree to anything.

734
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,239
What if we can't?

735
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,199
It's up to you.

736
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,400
100,000.

737
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,380
If the three of us clean it,

738
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,860
we won't be able to sell it.

739
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
Name your price.

740
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,320
Ten thousand.

741
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,600
Brother.

742
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,920
You're a beggar.

743
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,360
You're experienced.

744
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,960
Like this.

745
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,450
At a price like this.

746
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,560
30,000.

747
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,160
20,000.

748
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,320
Enough.

749
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,120
Stop talking to me.

750
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,800
I'm a decent man.

751
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,960
I've seen the world.

752
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,700
I don't have money now.

753
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,280
Wait for me to sell the down jacket.

754
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:10,640
How about

755
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,280
I'll give you 20,000 yuan down jacket.

756
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,160
Go away.

757
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,760
There's a specialty in art.

758
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,220
I don't sell down jackets.

759
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:16,920
Tell me.

760
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,570
How many days can it be sold?

761
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,160
Three days.

762
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,320
Okay.

763
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,800
Three days. I'll give you three days.

764
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,840
But for the next three days,

765
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,760
you have to come with me.

766
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,640
I'll get someone to take care of you 24 hours a day.

767
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,600
Three days later,

768
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,640
someone will redeem you.

769
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,960
You're an open person.

770
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,160
I'm loyal too.

771
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,600
I won't give you a hard time these three days.

772
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,560
But if no one comes to redeem you in the next three days,

773
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,880
I won't be the one who makes things difficult for you.

774
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,760
Without me,

775
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,600
they can't sell down jackets.

776
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,460
How about this?

777
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,840
to bet on you?

778
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,160
No, I can't.

779
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,480
Who are you calling poor?

780
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,840
He is indeed poor.

781
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,960
But we won't refuse him

782
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,840
because he's poor.

783
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,000
What if you really don't come?

784
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,530
Tie me up.

785
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,720
Brother.

786
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,000
I have to do something for you.

787
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,840
Enough.

788
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,480
You two throw the down jacket out at the original price.

789
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,440
We really can't sell this.

790
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,770
You can sell it at the original price, Liu.

791
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,280
Three days later,

792
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,160
I'll give you the address.

793
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,240
Salvation with money.

794
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,720
Where is this?

795
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,440
Playing billiard

796
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,360
Behave yourself.

797
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,520
Don't call the police.

798
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,180
Otherwise, both you and your brothers will die.

799
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,080
This is the person

800
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,280
to watch me.

801
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,340
He is not. He is.

802
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,640
What should I say?

803
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,010
He's the same as you.

804
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,360
It's a crime of catching rats.

805
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,120
Oh my.

806
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,920
If you say so,

807
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,060
his sin is heavier than yours.

808
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,920
Well,

809
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,840
There's a stove and noodles

810
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,770
Make it yourself if you're hungry.

811
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,690
Isn't this the wine I prepared for you?

812
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,960
Are you a good friend?

813
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,560
For the next three days,

814
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,280
just stay here.

815
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,800
Don't even think about running away.

816
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,480
You can't run away.

817
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,360
Where should I sleep?

818
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,520
There's a place.

819
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,120
You two take turns to sleep.

820
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,560
Why don't you two squeeze in?

821
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,280
Just make do with it.

822
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,520
He's leaving anyway.

823
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,760
Let's go.

824
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,440
Do I look like Chu Liuxiang?

825
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,560
Are you talking to me?

826
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,210
Is there anyone else in this room besides you?

827
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,160
You don't look like Chu Ruxiang.

828
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,920
You look

829
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,080
Maybe not.

830
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,140
but they all have the same characteristics.

831
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,320
are all romantic.

832
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,040
and flirting around.

833
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,640
You were caught here

834
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,100
because you showed mercy.

835
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,000
I guess so.

836
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,170
Aren't you the same?

837
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,160
Which step

838
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,400
get caught?

839
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,120
How far did you go?

840
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,080
I was so close.

841
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,480
I was so close.

842
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,760
If they were ten seconds late,

843
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,640
I'm done.

844
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,900
Why are you asking me this?

845
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,820
What about you?

846
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,560
Did you get it?

847
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,440
Guess.

848
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,280
I didn't get it.

849
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,680
They said

850
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,560
your crime is lighter than mine.

851
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,800
Actually,

852
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,960
Feifei still likes me.

853
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,050
But I have no choice.

854
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,240
She's a professional after all.

855
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,360
I've heard of extracting teeth from a tiger's mouth.

856
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,040
The one who extracts chestnuts in fire.

857
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,400
I've never heard of

858
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,920
to find love in a fairy jump.

859
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,080
When my business is over,

860
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,920
I must talk to Feifei.

861
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,960
Such a beautiful girl

862
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,490
and has such a nice body.

863
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,160
Why

864
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,960
do this?

865
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,760
She must have had a painful past.

866
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,280
I have a friend.

867
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Dada. You two look alike.

868
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,600
What does he do?

869
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,930
A tattoo artist.

870
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
Can I ask him to do one too?

871
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,120
What do you want?

872
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,560
Just a picture of Feifei.

873
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,960
After all,

874
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,600
this is a memorable

875
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,920
love.

876
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,480
How long has it been

877
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,300
your unforgettable love?

878
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,560
Less than an hour.

879
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,920
It doesn't matter how long it takes.

880
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,800
Some people you know

881
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,000
you may not have love.

882
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,880
But when someone looks at each other,

883
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,200
may last forever.

884
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,400
So you have to believe in fate.

885
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,800
There are so many people.

886
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,340
Why did she fall for me?

887
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,600
Even if she's a liar,

888
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,960
why didn't she lie to others?

889
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,360
Could it be that among so many people,

890
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,440
You look more gullible.

891
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,520
Do I look innocent?

892
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,560
You're not simple.

893
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,560
What should I describe?

894
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,760
I'll tell you when I get out.

895
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,380
Do you want to play?

896
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,320
Come on.

897
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,760
The manufacturer directly sells down jackets.

898
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,240
100 yuan for a clearance sale.

899
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,440
The manufacturer sells down jackets directly.

900
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,040
100 yuan for a clearance sale.

901
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,880
The manufacturer sells down jackets directly.

902
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:47,320
100 yuan for a clearance sale.

903
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,520
The manufacturer sells down jackets directly.

904
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,280
100 yuan for a clearance sale.

905
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,920
100 yuan for clearance.

906
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,320
100 yuan. All 100 yuan.

907
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,880
Pick a color.

908
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,240
This one is good.

909
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,440
The manufacturer directly sells down jackets.

910
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,040
One hundred yuan per piece.

911
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,000
The manufacturer is directly selling down jackets.

912
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,560
100 yuan. All 100 yuan.

913
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,960
They sell well.

914
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,080
I guess in the next three days,

915
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,640
in the next three days.

916
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,640
Sure, it's worth it.

917
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,120
Zhao, look at your pursuit.

918
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,800
So you mean

919
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,240
we finally

920
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,920
finally caught a fat sheep.

921
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
Can't we just have some lamb soup?

922
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,480
Why don't we have a lamb feast?

923
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,840
That Cui looks smart.

924
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,080
He's experienced.

925
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,440
It's not easy to manipulate.

926
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,320
But if we don't

927
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,520
If we don't remove his hair,

928
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,400
we won't do this anymore.

929
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,960
Sure.

930
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,960
Come on.

931
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,840
So I think

932
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,480
let's make them happy.

933
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,920
Go seduce Nada again.

934
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,000
Are you stupid?

935
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,000
Even a fool

936
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,260
won't fall for the same trick in two days.

937
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,640
I sold 13 pieces today.

938
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,440
You sold more than me.

939
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,880
Me?

940
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,680
I'm not much more than you.

941
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,200
I sold 113 pieces.

942
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,600
Why did you sell more than me?

943
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,800
What about you?

944
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,130
I might have used all my strength to drink.

945
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,280
That's because I didn't drink well
