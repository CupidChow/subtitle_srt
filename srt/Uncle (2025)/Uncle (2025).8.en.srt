1
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
Li

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,720
Li Yang

3
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,040
Liu

4
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,720
What does this have

5
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,520
to do with you becoming a writer?

6
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,720
I'm telling you

7
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,039
if he hadn't had

8
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,920
that martial arts competition

9
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,280
he wouldn't have gotten the inspiration.

10
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,840
If I hadn't gone to detention,

11
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,170
I wouldn't have this inspiration either.

12
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,280
My novel is amazing.

13
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,920
My novel

14
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,120
is much grander than theirs.

15
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,580
Mine goes international.

16
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
The main villain is from Dongying.

17
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,920
His name is Gou Changzi.

18
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,600
Gou as in survival,

19
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,280
Chang as in the Spirits of Death,

20
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,360
and Zi meaning son.

21
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,479
He commits all kinds of evil,

22
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,240
absolutely unforgivable,

23
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,520
just a total villain.

24
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,040
Alright, alright.

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,170
Write if you want to,

26
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,940
but don't leave the house.

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,960
Look at me,

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,040
I

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,720
only got inspired because I fought with Dog Intestine,

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,800
that's how I got the inspiration.

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,520
If I hadn't fought,

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,920
I wouldn't have this inspiration.

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,520
Wait, so you need to go out

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,800
and get into how many fights

35
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,280
to finish this book?

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,840
You might as well

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,160
write in a labor camp.

38
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,410
The material there is much richer.

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,680
Enough. Eat your food.

40
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,280
Uncle, what's our protagonist's name?

41
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,600
Huo Dongfeng.

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,600
That's great!

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,120
You used my father's name.

44
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,840
Your father was indeed

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,600
the first hero of the Dalin Three Heroes.

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,860
So the name Huo Dongfeng is very fitting.

47
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,600
What about the villain?

48
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,280
Didn't I tell you already?

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,020
Gou Changzi and Dong Yingren.

50
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,600
Uncle,

51
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,980
how far have you gotten with the writing?

52
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,160
Gou Changzi was beaten black and blue by Huo Dongfeng,

53
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,360
foaming at the mouth.

54
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,680
So he needed the Great Revival Pill to extend his life.

55
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,840
He sent his subordinates

56
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,900
to search for the Great Revival Pill.

57
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,720
Because his subordinate was too clever,

58
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,120
he mistook a piece of dried dog poop

59
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,160
for the Great Revival Pill

60
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,620
and brought it back to him.

61
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
After eating half of it,

62
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,960
he suddenly slammed the table and stood up,

63
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,920
shouting,

64
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,680
"This isn't the Great Revival Pill!

65
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,040
This is clearly a divine delicacy!"

66
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,160
Go on.

67
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,920
What's going on?

68
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,480
Why are you laughing so happily?

69
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,280
Huo Xiaoyang is telling us about

70
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,920
his uncle's new novel.

71
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,360
Really?

72
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,160
What's it about?

73
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,420
You all seem so amused.

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,800
It's about the villain

75
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,160
who mistook dog poop for a magical pill

76
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,360
and ate it.

77
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,160
Alright, that's enough.

78
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,360
Stop talking about it.

79
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,820
Let's get ready for class.

80
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,020
How's your dance practice going?

81
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,360
Very well.

82
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,300
Alright, hurry up now.

83
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,800
How long has it been?

84
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,120
Why haven't they released him yet?

85
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,040
I'm just a junior detective.

86
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,570
I don't have the authority to release anyone.

87
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,280
Listen to me.

88
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,040
The Criminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China,

89
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,480
Article 156 states that

90
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,120
after a suspect is arrested,

91
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,080
the investigation and detention period

92
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,240
must not exceed 2 months.

93
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,480
For serious cases,

94
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,640
with the prosecutor's approval,

95
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,840
detention can be extended for one month.

96
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Am I right?

97
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,480
But how long has it been already?

98
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,360
You're right.

99
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,220
Are you suggesting we're illegally detaining him?

100
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,200
Criminal Law Article 158.

101
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,000
Do you know it?

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,600
Article 159.

103
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,240
Do you know what it says?

104
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,200
Yes, I know all of it.

105
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,840
Criminal Law Article 158.

106
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,320
Yes, theoretically,

107
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,000
you can

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,120
detain him for another month.

109
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,840
Article 159,

110
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,600
on top of that,

111
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,120
you can further

112
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,560
extend detention for another month.

113
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:58,960
The problem is,

114
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,600
you don't have

115
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,200
any key witnesses or evidence.

116
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,360
Because he didn't kill anyone.

117
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,760
So how can you convict him?

118
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,480
That's exactly why we can't convict him,

119
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,360
so we're still detaining him.

120
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,240
It's because of insufficient evidence

121
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,960
that the prosecutor's office

122
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,000
keeps sending the case back for review.

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,840
Besides,

124
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,240
didn't you,

125
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,720
in college,

126
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,480
study something about

127
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,940
spacecraft or something?

128
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,840
How come you know these legal articles

129
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,480
so well?

130
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,760
I just took the bar exam.

131
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,560
What?

132
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,600
You're becoming a lawyer?

133
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,120
Yes. That lawyer you introduced me to

134
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,880
was completely unreliable.

135
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,960
I really regret it.

136
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,480
I feel so guilty.

137
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,600
If I hadn't been so loose-lipped back then,

138
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
he wouldn't have gone fortune-telling,

139
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
and none of this mess would have happened.

140
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,120
Well, you know what,

141
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,240
you really are unreliable when they say so,

142
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,960
but when you're reliable...

143
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,200
Stop talking nonsense.

144
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,360
Do you have any solutions?

145
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,159
We need to figure something out!

146
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,240
Yes, there is one way.

147
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,690
Go study criminal investigation.

148
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,720
If you catch the real killer,

149
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,880
then he'll be proven innocent, won't he?

150
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,840
You're messing with me.

151
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,960
I'm not messing with you.

152
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,820
I think you could really learn it.

153
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,120
Criminal investigation is your job.

154
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,240
Yes, it is our job.

155
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,000
We all believe

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,659
Guo Dapao is the real culprit.

157
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,940
Anything else?

158
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,640
I'm leaving.

159
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,120
I'm busy.

160
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,650
Brother.

161
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,760
Remember that little girl

162
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,690
who was eating meat here last time?

163
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,240
I already paid the bill.

164
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,480
Has she been back?

165
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,360
She's been here twice.

166
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,240
Just wandering outside the door.

167
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,080
Too scared to come in.

168
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,760
When I called out to her,

169
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,220
she ran away immediately.

170
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
This kid.

171
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,360
Next time,

172
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,200
grab her

173
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,960
and tell her not to be afraid.

174
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,560
Let her eat until she's full.

175
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,720
Alright.

176
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,960
Grill me 30 skewers,

177
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,480
give me 5 steamed bun slices.

178
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,610
I'll take them to go.

179
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,840
Okay.

180
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,420
Make it 50 skewers.

181
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,360
Sure, sure.

182
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,880
Last time, I was chatting with Guo Dapao here.

183
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,960
I told him to find

184
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,120
a fortune teller.

185
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Did you hear that?

186
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,640
No, what's up?

187
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,720
It's fine.

188
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,560
What did Grandpa say?

189
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,440
He said

190
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,360
he won't let me eat at this kebab place

191
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,600
because last time

192
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,640
after you took me for kebabs

193
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,200
I had diarrhea for days.

194
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,320
You're eating too fast.

195
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,240
Slow down.

196
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,360
Uncle, I'm getting my lawyer's license soon.

197
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,120
When that happens,

198
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,320
I can personally defend Dalei in court.

199
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,560
Mr. Cui,

200
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,480
did you know that Huo Xiaoyang

201
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,080
is going to perform a solo dance?

202
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,840
Yes, I know.

203
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,120
What is he performing?

204
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,200
'Date with the Stars.'

205
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,960
I taught him.

206
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,760
He's practicing by himself now.

207
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,570
What do you mean?

208
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,490
Nothing, nothing. It's great.

209
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,000
Dad.

210
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,600
Get your own water.

211
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,440
I'm rushing to finish my manuscript.

212
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,370
My classmate is pressing me for it.

213
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,460
How much have you written?

214
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,980
I still need to write 20,000 to 30,000 words out of 100,000.

215
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,480
What's the title?

216
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,700
'Cleansing the Sword in the Vast Sea'

217
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,890
That's a good title.

218
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,840
Has the factory contacted you recently?

219
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,970
No contact. Why would they contact me?

220
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,320
My lawyer's license is coming soon.

221
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,240
I'll be a lawyer then.

222
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,960
Who wants to mess around with them

223
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,420
and that antique machine?

224
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,200
Children grow up and make their own decisions.

225
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,760
You're on your own now.

226
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,840
You're always talking about breaking through bottlenecks.

227
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,120
I've gotten used to it.

228
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,730
Just remember this.

229
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,000
You're not alone.

230
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,240
You have elderly parents and young children to care for.

231
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,000
Other families with just one child might manage,

232
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,200
but you have two!

233
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,560
There might be more than two in the future.

234
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,480
Who else?

235
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,880
I'm just kidding.

236
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,480
To continue our story...

237
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,120
That day, Huo Dongfeng was walking through a small grove.

238
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,120
He discovered a female warrior

239
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,840
lying in the grove.

240
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,880
This female warrior

241
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,720
was young and beautiful.

242
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,010
Huo Dongfeng was immediately stunned by her beauty.

243
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,120
Then Huo Dongfeng took out

244
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,600
his special antidote.

245
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,600
But

246
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,760
when the female warrior woke up,

247
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,200
she mistakenly thought Huo Dongfeng

248
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,930
was the one who had stabbed her.

249
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,810
So the female warrior immediately drew her sword

250
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,040
and stabbed at Huo Dongfeng.

251
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,480
Such ingratitude!

252
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,200
What a pity.

253
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,260
What happens next?

254
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,880
Huo Dongfeng was stabbed

255
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,240
and left dying by the female warrior.

256
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,440
It was then that the female warrior realized

257
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,570
she had wrongly accused Huo Dongfeng.

258
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,840
So then,

259
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,120
the female warrior found a swift horse,

260
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,720
and the two of them rode together

261
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,240
to her home.

262
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,760
Then, over several months,

263
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,840
under the female warrior's care,

264
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,200
Huo Dongfeng's wounds finally healed,

265
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,200
and he regained 90% of his martial powers.

266
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,000
That's a relief.

267
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,360
That's so tragic.

268
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,290
Did the female warrior and Huo Dongfeng get married?

269
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,320
I'll tell you about that tomorrow.

270
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,120
Let's continue tomorrow.

271
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,360
Is this a good story?

272
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,620
And what's the name of the female warrior in this story?

273
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,240
She must have a name, right?

274
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,960
Yes, tell us quickly.

275
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,240
That's right.

276
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,120
Exactly.

277
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,360
Tell us now.

278
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,960
Go on.

279
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Cui Xiaohong.

280
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Uncle.

281
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,210
Did the heroine and Huo Dongfeng end up together?

282
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,360
It's a secret.

283
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,100
How's your dance practice going?

284
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,880
Very well.

285
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,120
Show us.

286
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,000
Very good! With my level of expertise,

287
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
I can't really point out anything wrong

288
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,090
with your performance.

289
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,520
Miss Mengmeng,

290
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
what do you think?

291
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,000
I studied folk dance,

292
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,600
I don't know much about this style.

293
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,520
But it looks pretty good.

294
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,000
Thank you on behalf of Erpang.

295
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,280
Mengmeng,

296
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,120
if I become a famous writer,

297
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,240
how much do you think

298
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,480
this pen of mine would sell for?

299
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,120
One yuan.

300
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,440
I paid more than 8 yuan for it!

301
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,120
But think about it.

302
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
If you want to become a famous writer,

303
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,360
by then this pen

304
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,120
would be completely worn out.

305
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,040
The clip would probably be gone,

306
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,880
and it's already quite worn now.

307
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,960
But some things

308
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,240
are more valuable the older and more worn they get,

309
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,280
like antiques.

310
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,240
That's because those are actual antiques,

311
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,360
at least hundreds or thousands of years old.

312
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,420
How long have you been using this pen?

313
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
Besides, many classmates in our class

314
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,700
have the same pen as yours.

315
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,400
So couldn't my pen be valuable

316
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,560
because

317
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,320
I'm the one who used it?

318
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,760
Why would a pen you used be worth anything?

319
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Besides, who could prove

320
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,680
that this pen was actually used by you?

321
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,480
How about this:

322
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,000
why don't you use my pen today

323
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,720
so it can become valuable too?

324
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,200
You're my biological daughter.

325
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,920
Why do you

326
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,000
always argue with me?

327
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,680
Because when you meet unreliable people,

328
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,280
you need to debate with them,

329
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,240
otherwise they'll become

330
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,500
even more unreliable.

331
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,000
How am I unreliable?

332
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,280
You're unreliable in everything you do.

333
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,080
For example?

334
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,920
For example, you said you'd buy me

335
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,720
a Xiali car. Where is it?

336
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,010
I knew it would be like this.

337
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,760
Alright. Today

338
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,240
I'll let you witness the process of buying a Xiali car.

339
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
I've finished my manuscript.

340
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,760
My classmate works at the publishing house.

341
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,240
I'm going to meet him later.

342
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,520
You can come with me.

343
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,840
I'm not going.

344
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,240
I have dance lessons today.

345
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,160
You forgot.

346
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,560
Then you'll miss

347
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,200
a chance to witness history.

348
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,400
Can I come?

349
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,400
Uncle.

350
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,810
Wait until I change my clothes.

351
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,760
When people arrive later,

352
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,800
eat more slowly.

353
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,640
It's like I never feed you.

354
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,480
Can I have 50 more skewers then?

355
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,080
You haven't eaten anything.

356
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,840
Sure.

357
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,040
When you grow up,

358
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,480
I'll lease this skewer shop for you,

359
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,440
let you be the boss,

360
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,970
and you can eat whatever you want. How's that?

361
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,640
That would be awesome!

362
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,720
That's my dream.

363
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,000
Over here.

364
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,560
I'm a bit late.

365
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,040
Is this your son?

366
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,100
My sister's child.

367
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,520
Your sister is beautiful,

368
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,000
and your nephew looks...

369
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,640
Don't you think he looks

370
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,560
a bit like me?

371
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,490
Something about the brow line.

372
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,440
Let's talk about the manuscript.

373
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,520
Fine, let's discuss the manuscript.

374
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,320
I've read it.

375
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,000
It's brilliant.

376
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,480
The writing flows very well,

377
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,400
and the plot is very intricate.

378
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,280
But I haven't

379
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,080
told our publisher about it yet.

380
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,760
Why? Because

381
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,440
there are a few issues

382
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
I'd like to discuss with you.

383
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,480
Then I'll make some small changes

384
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,720
before sending it to the publisher.

385
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,850
I understand. Good.

386
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,000
So,

387
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,000
the main character is named Huo Dongfeng, right?

388
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,160
That local gang leader?

389
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,690
What's the problem?

390
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,400
Let him finish speaking.

391
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,720
Before we went to high school,

392
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,480
wasn't there something called the 'Three Heroes of Dalin'?

393
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,010
That name sounds familiar.

394
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,160
So I think this name...

395
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,620
Let's not change the name.

396
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,840
There are many people with the same name,

397
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,720
and besides,

398
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,840
this book will be distributed nationwide.

399
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,480
Right?

400
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,040
It doesn't really matter,

401
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,320
and

402
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,560
the name Huo Dongfeng itself

403
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,920
sounds like a hero's name.

404
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,720
Right?

405
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Okay, fine.

406
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,760
The name is a minor issue. We won't change it.

407
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,400
Let's talk about the content.

408
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,330
Regarding the content, I think...

409
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,400
Could you ask your nephew

410
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,320
to go play some video games outside

411
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,920
and come back in half an hour?

412
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,160
Why?

413
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,560
It's a bit inappropriate for children.

414
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
He can hear you saying that.

415
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,240
Take the skewers outside

416
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,500
and warm them up again.

417
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,040
Alright!

418
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,960
Eat more!

419
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,000
Chubby kid!

420
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,400
Let's start talking.

421
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,760
All the content in this book,

422
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,200
the characters,

423
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,320
the martial arts schools, the chivalrous spirit,

424
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,240
all of these are fine.

425
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,960
The problem is with

426
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,020
the main character. He's too proper.

427
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,040
Today's readers

428
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,280
all want to read something a bit risqué,

429
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,210
you understand?

430
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,520
There's not a single

431
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,920
naked woman in your book.

432
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,240
Not even a bit of that kind of content.

433
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,040
Who would want to read this book?

434
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,440
So you want me to write erotic novels?

435
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,280
That's not what I meant.

436
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,680
I mean every dozen pages or so,

437
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,080
you should add a scene like that.

438
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,080
I believe with your writing skills,

439
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
this kind of content

440
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,920
you could definitely make it vivid and exciting.

441
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,400
Let me tell you,

442
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,240
if you write it my way,

443
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,000
this book will sell at least 20,000 copies.

444
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,240
But with your current style,

445
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,970
you won't even sell 100 copies.

446
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,720
I understand.

447
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
I can write it,

448
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
but

449
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
where do you think

450
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,240
would be appropriate to add these scenes?

451
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,800
To include them?

452
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,560
It's easy.

453
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,920
The main character,

454
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,000
this Huo Dongfeng and the female warrior Cui Xiaohong,

455
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,760
they should have a bedroom scene,

456
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,440
right?

457
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,160
And then that female villain,

458
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,240
they should have another scene together.

459
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,160
That would be exciting.

460
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,000
And if you could include

461
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,240
the female bounty hunter who's chasing him,

462
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,760
and write a scene between them,

463
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,000
that would make the book thrilling.

464
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,200
All spicy. People would love to read it.

465
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,080
What do you think

466
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,440
about Huo Dongfeng and his brothers

467
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,480
having some bedroom scenes together?

468
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,340
How about that?

469
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,160
That would be fantastic!

470
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,040
I could sell 12 million copies of this book.

471
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,080
Discussing art with you,

472
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,160
real literary creation,

473
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,920
I truly regret

474
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,960
not doing this all these years.

475
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,520
This is really inspiring!

476
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,000
Please give this note to the boss for me.

477
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,640
Alright.

478
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,480
I'm going to take a leak first.

479
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
Go ahead.

480
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,800
After chatting with you today,

481
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,720
it's really wonderful.

482
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,000
Passion. Spice.

483
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,800
Um.

484
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,040
Boss.

485
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,240
Here.

486
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,450
This note is for you.

487
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,440
A note from the great writer.

488
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,040
Keep it safe.

489
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,570
For when he becomes famous.

490
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
This is great.

491
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,500
Sixty-two.

492
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,040
What's this sixty-two?

493
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,920
Number 62.

494
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,960
I didn't eat any of these skewers.

495
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,760
What does this have to do with me?

496
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,920
Isn't this you?

497
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,720
Well...

498
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,040
[Let this pervert pay the bill]

499
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,760
Where do I pay?

500
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,800
At the counter.

501
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,440
Let's go.

502
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,240
I'll cover it.

503
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,760
Thanks.

504
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,960
Want these skewers to go?

505
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,760
No, thanks.

506
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,840
Who does he look like?

507
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:43,850
Hailong?

508
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,840
Or more like his mother?

509
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,000
Come on, be happy!

510
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,040
Let me propose a toast, brother.

511
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,000
Thank you all for coming

512
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,040
to my son's one-month celebration.

513
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,120
I'll drink mine.

514
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,720
Please, everyone, drink as you like.

515
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,480
I'll use tea instead of alcohol.

516
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,320
Thank you.

517
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,880
Kids are so fun.

518
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,800
So cute.

519
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,860
Call me godfather.

520
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,600
He's only a month old.

521
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,080
Nezha? Would you dare to answer if he called you?

522
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,840
I'll call you godfather on his behalf.

523
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,500
Godmother.

524
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,360
Is this sweet and sour pork?

525
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,720
It looks like dumpling soup.

526
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,400
What's going on here?

527
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,120
How could they cook like this?

528
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,800
It's because Chef Zhang was

529
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,480
poached by Jufu Restaurant.

530
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,640
They offered him

531
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,120
twice our salary.

532
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,120
When Manager Cui was here before,

533
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,580
he felt too loyal to leave.

534
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,000
That's why I felt awkward inviting Manager Cui.

535
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,200
I'm afraid he'll get angry when he comes.

536
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,520
Keep your voice down.

537
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,560
What is this?

538
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,000
It's too salty.

539
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,560
Have some water.

540
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,040
Kids are the most fun at this age.

541
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,560
These ribs are way too salty.

542
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,240
You should stop eating. You're still...

543
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,200
Wait until he grows up like Mengmeng

544
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,120
When he gets older,

545
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,800
he'll start annoying you.

546
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,560
Just wait and see.

547
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
She deliberately annoys you.

548
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,040
That's what you get for being so unreliable.

549
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,960
Who says that? My brother Cui is very reliable.

550
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,600
He does everything properly.

551
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,840
If you pass the bar exam this time...

552
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,720
That's really impressive.

553
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,760
He's decent.

554
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,880
He got suspended.

555
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,880
I heard your company is offering severance packages.

556
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,960
He'll definitely be the first one targeted.

557
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,420
Absolutely the first one.

558
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,720
I've always been first in everything since childhood.

559
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,560
Just wait for my bar exam.

560
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,690
Wait for my results.

561
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,560
Shut up.

562
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,320
It's really too salty.

563
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:10,960
Eat it yourself. Eat it yourself.

564
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,640
Have some water. Have some water.

565
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,400
Let me pour you some more.

566
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,330
Sister-in-law,

567
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,320
I never interrupt,

568
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,080
but today I have to speak up.

569
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,200
My brother Cui

570
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,080
can do fine without working at the factory.

571
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,610
He can do anything outside.

572
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,560
With his physique,

573
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,520
he could carry sand bags.

574
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,560
What physique?

575
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,520
He could be a construction worker

576
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,850
or something like that.

577
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,400
An engineering graduate carrying sand bags?

578
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,560
When I married him,

579
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,320
I actually checked

580
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,600
his college diploma.

581
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,640
It didn't look fake.

582
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,690
But look at his behavior every day.

583
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,640
Does he look like a college graduate to you?

584
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,480
It doesn't matter if I look like one or not.

585
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,040
I am one.

586
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,040
Try this meatball.

587
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,800
It's just steamed bun.

588
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,320
Try it. Try it.

589
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,840
Here. Here. Here.

590
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,770
How's everyone enjoying the food?

591
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,560
Very good. Very good.

592
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,280
Thank you, Manager Tang,

593
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,200
for the discount.

594
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,240
Don't mention it. Don't mention it. Don't mention it.

595
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,960
Here, this is.

596
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,600
No need.

597
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,960
This is for the child,

598
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,200
not for you.

599
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
This...

600
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,240
Hurry.

601
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,840
What a loud voice!

602
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,360
He'll achieve great things in the future.

603
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,000
Keep it down,

604
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,800
you're making too much noise.

605
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,000
You'll wake the baby.

606
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,320
Manager Tang,

607
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,720
sit down and have a drink.

608
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,720
No thanks. I have other guests to attend to.

609
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,780
Enjoy your drinks.

610
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,600
Oh, by the way,

611
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,320
I'll have some good news for you in a few days.

612
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,720
What good news?

613
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,880
Tell us now!

614
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,560
I'll tell you in a few days.

615
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,020
Enjoy your drinks for now.

616
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,490
Alright, take care, Manager Tang.

617
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,480
I mean,

618
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,400
such a big guy

619
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,560
doesn't know his own strength.

620
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,220
Why are you making such a fuss?

621
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,520
He's just a manager.

622
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,400
You don't need to suck up to him like that.

623
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,040
You're criticizing way too many people.

624
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,280
When Manager Cui was here before,

625
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,680
didn't I respect him too?

626
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,800
No, well...

627
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,720
How can he compare to Old Cui?

628
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,720
We should respect people who deserve it.

629
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,760
Just look at him.

630
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,480
He doesn't look like a good person, right?

631
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,000
What gives you the right to say he's not a good person?

632
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,280
As if you're such a good person yourself.

633
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,640
Listen to yourself.

634
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,320
I'm not a good person.

635
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,520
Would you marry me?

636
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,400
If I weren't a good person,

637
00:22:59,400 --> 00:22:59,960
would you marry me?

638
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,040
I'm not a good person.

639
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,700
I'm not a good person. Come on.

640
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,640
Let's eat.

641
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,480
Try some of these braised dishes.

642
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,610
These are the only decent things here.

643
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,720
The child is so cute.

644
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,250
Looks like a little piglet.

645
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,120
What?

646
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,360
I really envy you,

647
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,560
not having to worry about anything.

648
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,480
Look at me,

649
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,120
helping my sister raise my nephew.

650
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,040
Now

651
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,880
I've got Guo Dapao's daughter

652
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,610
and her father to deal with too.

653
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,200
I wish I could be like you,

654
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,370
doing math problems every day,

655
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,120
carefree

656
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,080
and happy.

657
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,080
You need to pay for it.

658
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,320
I told you I didn't want to play with you,

659
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,240
why did you insist?

660
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,800
Stop messing with it!

661
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,890
What's going on?

662
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,080
He broke the pinhole glasses

663
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,560
that I borrowed from my deskmate.

664
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,640
I told him many times

665
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,280
not to let him play with them,

666
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,210
but he insisted.

667
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,600
Glasses?

668
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,720
So they're broken.

669
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,760
Can't we just buy another pair?

670
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,600
Exactly.

671
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,400
This is high-tech stuff,

672
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,660
it costs over 100 yuan.

673
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,120
Alright, come on.

674
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,720
Come inside.

675
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,600
What high-tech stuff?

676
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,520
This costs over 100?

677
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,800
Why?

678
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,120
They say it's high-tech

679
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,330
and can cure nearsightedness.

680
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,400
I really didn't mean to.

681
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,080
Okay, don't cry.

682
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,340
We'll buy another one.

683
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,600
Those pinhole glasses are popular in schools now.

684
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,330
And my uncle spotted a business opportunity.

685
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,040
My uncle and aunt

686
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,600
went to my grandpa's house.

687
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,320
Guess

688
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,200
what my uncle is up to?

689
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,820
It doesn't matter.

690
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,980
Why doesn't it matter?

691
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Whether my dad is chasing dogs or chickens,

692
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,640
is it really that important?

693
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,820
This time it's really promising.

694
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,040
Didn't you say the same thing about writing novels last time?

695
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,520
I bet it won't work out.

696
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,050
You two are always ganging up on me.

697
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,480
Dad's cooking is still the best.

698
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,210
The food at Dingqing Restaurant is terrible now.

699
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,120
You come here in the middle of the night

700
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
just to complain

701
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,720
that Dingqing Restaurant's food tastes bad?

702
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,760
I can't do anything about it anymore.

703
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,480
No, no,

704
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,810
that's not why I'm here.

705
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,080
Dad, look at this.

706
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,740
Aren't these the glasses that Erpang broke?

707
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,200
Why are they like this again?

708
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,560
You two are really something, father and son.

709
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,890
I want Dad to take a look.

710
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,840
What is this?

711
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,040
Where are the lenses?

712
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,840
Erpang broke them.

713
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,340
Just look at that part.

714
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Try them on.

715
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,240
It gives you that 'seeing through a tube' feeling,

716
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,760
right? But this one

717
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,560
is what they call

718
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,400
high-tech pinhole glasses.

719
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
They sell for over 100 yuan outside.

720
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,560
This...

721
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,720
What's so high-tech about this?

722
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,840
You're absolutely right!

723
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,200
I've been studying it all day.

724
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,400
What high-tech?

725
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,480
It's fake!

726
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,600
What technical value could this possibly have?

727
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,660
The frames are just ordinary frames,

728
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,120
these lens materials

729
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,200
are available everywhere.

730
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,520
So, I have a bold idea.

731
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,450
You've got another one?

732
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,560
How long has it been since your last scheme?

733
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,800
You've sold singing performances,

734
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,560
set up chess stalls,

735
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,160
written books, and now what?

736
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
Selling glasses?

737
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,120
It's like this.

738
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,450
The cost of these things

739
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,890
is only about 5 yuan.

740
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,360
But they sell them for over 100 yuan in the market.

741
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,960
What an outrageous profit margin!

742
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,240
Aren't they just profiteers?

743
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,400
Isn't this taking advantage of people?

744
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,560
Over 100 yuan for

745
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,560
an average family

746
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,320
is not something everyone can afford.

747
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,280
What I want to do

748
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,800
is bring down the price

749
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,560
so every nearsighted child

750
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,170
can wear affordable pinhole glasses.

751
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,760
So you're saving all the kids in the city?

752
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,160
I want to save children across the country!

753
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,320
I'll price them at 19.9 yuan,

754
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,720
not even 20 yuan.

755
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,560
Ordinary families can definitely afford this.

756
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,240
The cost is only about 13 or 14 yuan,

757
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,640
so I make about 6 yuan gross profit.

758
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,000
No big problem, right?

759
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,080
You're like Huo Dongfeng

760
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,640
who makes money in the fish market

761
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,560
by marking up prices in the distribution chain.

762
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,720
He's making money,

763
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,840
but he doesn't create any value.

764
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,880
What I want to do is different.

765
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,760
I create value for society,

766
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,400
make a contribution,

767
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,200
and earn money at the same time.

768
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,840
This isn't just killing two birds with one stone.

769
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,880
It's three birds.

770
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,880
How much money do you need?

771
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,080
100,000 for startup capital.

772
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,320
How much do you have?

773
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Less than 50,000.

774
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,960
Fine. I'll cover the rest.

775
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,640
Dad.

776
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,300
Dad's being generous.

777
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,120
Work hard.

778
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,960
If you're going to do it,

779
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,280
do something that benefits the country and the people.

780
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,080
Absolutely.

781
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,640
Who's coming with me tomorrow

782
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,240
to withdraw the money from the bank?

783
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,040
I will.

784
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,200
I think this time

785
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,130
I can make a fortune.

786
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,560
You

787
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,580
you're just not cut out for business.

788
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,400
All I care about now is

789
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,280
when your lawyer's license will come through.

790
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,960
You may be bad at business,

791
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,170
but you're good with words.

792
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,680
Once I get my license,

793
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,970
I'll represent Guo Dapao in court.

794
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,560
His case is tough,

795
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,760
but I'll become famous overnight.

796
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,560
After that,

797
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,320
many people will come looking for me.

798
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
I've already told

799
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,120
Guo Dapao's father

800
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,800
and his daughter about this.

801
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,660
You've already told them?

802
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,400
You told them before even passing the bar exam?

803
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,080
Can you please stop

804
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,200
counting your chickens

805
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,480
before they hatch?

806
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,600
That metaphor

807
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,200
is quite accurate.

808
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,360
But it's too crude.

809
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,330
You think that's crude?

810
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,080
Do you know before leaving work every day,

811
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,120
how much time I need to spend

812
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,800
preparing myself mentally?

813
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,120
So that when I come home and see you,

814
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,180
I can keep myself from yelling at you.

815
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,080
Just wait.

816
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,720
You'll be proud of me.

817
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,960
In the past,

818
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,320
Old Master Zhang from Dingqing Restaurant,

819
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,680
when he was alive,

820
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,480
used to say something.

821
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,850
Combining your passion

822
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,400
with making money,

823
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,730
that's what success is.

824
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,000
If you combine your passion

825
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,880
with losing money,

826
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,570
that's being wasteful.

827
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,920
I know your abilities.

828
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,400
You should

829
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,920
combine your talents

830
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,840
with making money

831
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,920
and be successful.

832
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,160
As for that factory job,

833
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,560
it's fine if you quit.

834
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,360
That's why I say

835
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,800
you're truly my father.

836
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,930
Just don't make your father

837
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,280
worry too much.

838
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,120
I'll walk you this far.

839
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,980
I need to get to the train station.

840
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,800
I've already booked tickets

841
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,460
to Wenzhou to purchase stock.

842
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,760
You're moving so quickly.

843
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,800
In martial arts,

844
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,000
speed is unbeatable.

845
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,000
Just watch me.

846
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,400
Since the reform and opening up,

847
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,320
our city's largest

848
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,320
independently operated state-owned restaurants

849
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,380
number only seven.

850
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,920
Now three of them

851
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,080
have already been contracted to private operators.

852
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,160
The higher authorities have instructed that

853
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,240
our Dingqing Restaurant

854
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,760
will also be privately contracted

855
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,720
and responsible for its own profits and losses.

856
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,520
Of course, this restaurant of ours

857
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,320
isn't something just anyone can contract.

858
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,920
There are certain requirements.

859
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,280
For example, the contracting fee

860
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,540
requires an upfront payment of 250,000.

861
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,320
I am definitely interested in taking the contract.

862
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,720
I promise that after I take over,

863
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,920
the remaining staff

864
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,320
will receive monthly salary increases of

865
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,280
150 to 300 yuan per person.

866
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,320
Of course.

867
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,320
This contract bidding

868
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,160
is open to the whole society.

869
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,920
Although I have high hopes,

870
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,280
I still hope everyone will support me.

871
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,410
We must support you.

872
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,840
In the early 90s,

873
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,880
the iron rice bowl of state-owned enterprises was broken.

874
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,140
Many factories were transferred to private contractors.

875
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,280
This was just the tip of the iceberg.

876
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,000
The clever ones seized business opportunities.

877
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,360
Individual small shops were increasing.

878
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,760
While everyone was still chatting idly in the factory.

879
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,680
They've already caught the scent of reform

880
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,840
and ventured into new businesses.

881
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,680
Sir, help me load these goods onto the truck.

882
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,280
To the factory. Thirty yuan.

883
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,920
Forty.

884
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,400
Thirty-five. Final offer.

885
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,760
Thirty-eight. Non-negotiable.

886
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,520
Thirty-seven and we go now.

887
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,520
Thirty-eight.

888
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,800
Let's go.

889
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,280
Is Guoming back yet?

890
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,080
Not yet, Dad.

891
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,720
He said he'd be home today.

892
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,130
I was worried something happened to Guoming.

893
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,360
He's fine.

894
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,160
Dingqing Restaurant

895
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,360
is switching to individual contracting.

896
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,400
Five years.

897
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,880
Who's getting the contract?

898
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,240
They say it's an open bidding process.

899
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,160
But before bidding,

900
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,360
you need to pay the first year's contract fee

901
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,480
in full,

902
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,200
250,000 yuan.

903
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,160
So when

904
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,880
do they need the payment?

905
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,420
Just these two months.

906
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,130
Has anyone taken the contract yet?

907
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,320
Manager Tang wants it.

908
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,640
If Dingqing Restaurant

909
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,880
falls into his hands, won't it be ruined, Dad?

910
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,160
Those two chefs have already left.

911
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,580
The regular customers are complaining.

912
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,800
Dad, let's take the contract.

913
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,920
You can continue as manager.

914
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,200
We don't have enough money.

915
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,120
Thank you.

916
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,160
Your surname is Cui, right?

917
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
You are...

918
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,320
You don't know me,

919
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,960
but I know you.

920
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,280
Who are you?

921
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,200
I know your brother-in-law, Huo Dongfeng.

922
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,200
A few days ago,

923
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,520
he just got out.

924
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,800
Before we could even meet,

925
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,540
I heard he went back in.

926
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,560
That man,

927
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,090
that's just his character.

928
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,000
Loyal.

929
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,800
He's never been locked up for his own mistakes,

930
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,130
always for his friends.

931
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,679
He's 47 this year.

932
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,960
Counting juvenile detention,

933
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,290
that's 24 years inside,

934
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,960
and 23 years outside.

935
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,639
Are you his friend?

936
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:32,960
Do you know about

937
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,239
the late 70s,

938
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,760
early 80s,

939
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
the Three Heroes of Dalin District?

940
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,880
You know them all?

941
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,659
Your brother-in-law was the First Hero,

942
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,000
I was the Second Hero.

943
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,770
The people sitting in front

944
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,040
are blocking my view.

945
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,800
Right away.

946
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,080
Here you are.

947
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,160
Cui.

948
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,320
My change?

949
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,400
No need for change.

950
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,960
We agreed on 38.

951
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,960
Please keep it.

952
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,400
I work for my money.

953
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,440
I'm not a beggar.

954
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,580
Brother Chuan.

955
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,890
Until we meet again.

956
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,840
See you around.

957
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,880
Dad, were you working at the construction site?

958
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,640
Why are you so dirty?

959
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,480
Isn't your father part of the working class?

960
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,240
What? Are you looking down on me?

961
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,000
Do you know

962
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,480
that workers created your

963
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,440
happy and beautiful life?

964
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,640
This TV, that pen,

965
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,560
erasers, pencil cases,

966
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,040
radios,

967
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,280
and everything in the kitchen:

968
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,320
knives, spoons, spatulas,

969
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,440
flashlights, candles, plates and bowls -

970
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,500
all of these were created by workers.

971
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,040
Which one did you create?

972
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,600
Very well.

973
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,440
Let me tell you,

974
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,730
I'll be creating things very soon.

975
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,640
Hehe.

976
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,720
What?

977
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,880
Uncle,

978
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,920
I know what you're planning.

979
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,720
Tell me.

980
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,800
Pinhole glasses.

981
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,820
I don't have anything against Manager Tang,

982
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,320
I just don't think he can manage

983
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,120
Dingqing Restaurant properly.

984
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,000
Dingqing is Dad's life's work

985
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,440
and where I've worked for over a decade.

986
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,880
I don't want to be the boss.

987
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,120
I just don't want to see

988
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,360
decades of reputation being ruined.

989
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,520
Can we

990
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,960
really bid for it?

991
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,760
Of course you can.

992
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,960
But you need 250,000.

993
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,170
There are only two months left.

994
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
What should we do?

995
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,160
Almost there.

996
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,060
What do you mean 'almost'?

997
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,800
Once I make money with my pinhole glasses,

998
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,000
we'll be close.

999
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,920
Go to sleep.

1000
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,120
Tomorrow at 7 AM,

1001
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,780
I'll get up and start working.

1002
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,840
For someone like Uncle

1003
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,080
who graduated from Engineering University,

1004
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,480
making pinhole glasses was a piece of cake.

1005
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,320
In just a few days,

1006
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,160
he created

1007
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,690
a product superior to anything on the market.

1008
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
19.90!

1009
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,720
Pinhole glasses for 19.90!

1010
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,720
Pinhole glasses for 19.90!

1011
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,880
Pinhole glasses for 19.90!

1012
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,490
Pinhole glasses

1013
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,600
for 19.90!

1014
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,360
Pinhole glasses

1015
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,800
for 19.90!

1016
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,960
Pinhole glasses for 19.90!

1017
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,880
Pinhole glasses for 19.90!

1018
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,640
Pinhole glasses for 19.90!

1019
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,600
Hey, Cui!

1020
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,200
Pinhole glasses!

1021
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,560
Miss Yang, what brings you here?

1022
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,560
Just passing by.

1023
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,440
What are you selling?

1024
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440
Pinhole glasses.

1025
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,760
Pinhole glasses?

1026
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,080
They protect your eyesight.

1027
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
I make them myself.

1028
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,240
You make them yourself?

1029
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,600
Yes.

1030
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,560
That's impressive.

1031
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,240
Let me try them.

1032
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,000
Go ahead.

1033
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,160
So many holes.

1034
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,880
Do I look good in them?

1035
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,340
You look good in anything.

1036
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,000
Of course.

1037
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,360
How much?

1038
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,160
19.90.

1039
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,640
I'll buy one.

1040
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,360
No, no.

1041
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,360
You can't buy it.

1042
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,820
Just take some, take some.

1043
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,800
What do you mean 'take'?

1044
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,360
19.90.

1045
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,920
I want to support your business venture.

1046
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,440
No way.

1047
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,440
Put the glasses away first.

1048
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,160
Hurry, let's go.

1049
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,800
We're not taking them.

1050
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,280
What are you-

1051
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
Miss Yang, hurry!

1052
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:08,800
No!

1053
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,440
I need to pay-

1054
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,240
Get in the car!

1055
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,720
Get in, Miss Yang!

1056
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,640
You can't do this!

1057
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,080
Get in!

1058
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,520
Get in!

1059
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,560
You scared me!

1060
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,080
Go, quick!

1061
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,360
I'll be going then, Brother Cui.

1062
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,140
When it collapsed,

1063
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,420
why didn't you warn me?

1064
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,780
I did it on purpose.

1065
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,000
Why?

1066
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,810
Did you notify us before selling things here?

1067
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,520
My name is Lv Jun.

1068
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,700
I'm here every day.

1069
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,000
Are you Lv Jun from the Dalin Three Heroes?

1070
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,520
That's right.

1071
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,410
Nice to meet you.

1072
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:48,800
Goodbye.

1073
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,520
These glasses

1074
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,760
cost 100 outside.

1075
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,040
I'll sell them to you for 12 yuan.

1076
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,680
You can sell them for 19.9.

1077
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,520
That's 8 yuan profit each.

1078
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,200
You gave me 10 yuan last time.

1079
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,900
And someone got stabbed here.

1080
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,100
What kind of trouble are you getting into this time?

1081
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,580
No stabbing this time.

1082
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,680
Just making money.

1083
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,760
I don't believe you.

1084
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,480
You should.

1085
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,040
Once you make money,

1086
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,760
you'll believe me.

1087
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,640
Fine.

1088
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,420
I'll take two sets for now.

1089
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,660
Is two sets enough?

1090
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,800
I'm afraid I can't even sell two.

1091
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,640
Wait.

1092
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,560
Why are you closing the door?

1093
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,080
I'm cold.

1094
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,520
Open the door.

1095
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
I'll keep 10 sets.

1096
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,200
Fine.

1097
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
So we have a deal.

1098
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,920
Add 5 more sets.

1099
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,120
15 sets?

1100
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,200
Deal.

1101
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,520
Dad,

1102
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,240
how much have you

1103
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,900
contributed to our family's better life today?

1104
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,080
It's my first day.

1105
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,240
I'm not very familiar with the business yet.

1106
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,600
I sold 13 pairs.

1107
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,640
You got over 10,000 pairs of glasses.

1108
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,680
At this rate,

1109
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,800
it'll take about three years

1110
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,800
to sell them all.

1111
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,640
I am

1112
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,760
a good product manufacturer.

1113
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,400
There's nothing wrong with my products,

1114
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,120
but that doesn't mean I'm a good marketer.

1115
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,120
I do lack skills in marketing.

1116
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,640
Hehe.

1117
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,650
Uncle, I'll help you sell them.

1118
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,400
How will you help me sell them?

1119
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,920
I'll take them to school to sell.

1120
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,180
My classmates will definitely buy them.

1121
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,520
You're very clever.

1122
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,320
That's a good idea.

1123
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,700
I'll give you 10 sets tomorrow first.

1124
