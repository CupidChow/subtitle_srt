1
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,560
Your father will be out soon.

2
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,380
Really?

3
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes.

4
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,340
In a couple of days.

5
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,720
He's been on good behavior,

6
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,520
so they're releasing him early.

7
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,640
When will my dad

8
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,400
and mom get divorced?

9
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,600
Ask him when he gets out.

10
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,720
Uncle,

11
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,759
why do you look so tired?

12
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,080
I...

13
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,760
I miss your grandmother.

14
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,919
I miss my grandma too.

15
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,160
Don't cry.

16
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,760
Uncle.

17
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,620
I want to see the train.

18
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,400
I always dream

19
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,000
that my mom and dad

20
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,080
are coming back on a train.

21
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,560
School's out.

22
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,800
Dad, why are you home so early today?

23
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,920
I'm not busy today.

24
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,780
Come here and watch the Olympics.

25
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,280
I think you, Mengmeng,

26
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,400
should do rhythmic gymnastics in the future.

27
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,520
You already have dance training.

28
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,360
If you train in rhythmic gymnastics,

29
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,280
you could win a gold medal

30
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,640
at the Olympics and bring glory to our country.

31
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,440
Sounds good.

32
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:41,960
Right?

33
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,720
What should my brother train in?

34
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,159
He's not good for training.

35
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,480
The Olympics doesn't have eating competitions.

36
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,920
I think with his build,

37
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,850
he could do judo.

38
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,440
Many judo athletes have his body type.

39
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,370
Would you train?

40
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,480
Do you have a lot of homework?

41
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,240
Not much.

42
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,760
A lot.

43
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,280
Do you want to do it first?

44
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,480
I don't want to watch TV.

45
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,040
What are you going to do?

46
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,800
Watch with me or do homework?

47
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,530
Watch first.

48
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,240
Alright.

49
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,440
I think Mengmeng

50
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,840
will respect me less and less in the future.

51
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,200
She is

52
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,050
quite troublesome.

53
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,920
Otherwise,

54
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,400
I'm thinking we should have another child.

55
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
After it's born,

56
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,720
we can use the younger one to scare the older one.

57
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
What do you think?

58
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,200
If you want another baby, go have it with someone else.

59
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,360
Besides,

60
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,980
does it need to be so complicated?

61
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,570
Isn't it necessary?

62
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,600
I'll beat you up in front of her.

63
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,200
Let's see if that scares her.

64
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,560
That's really impressive.

65
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,220
She'll definitely be scared.

66
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,120
What are you talking about?

67
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,720
This is...

68
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,380
We already have two kids and you don't think that's enough?

69
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,360
In a few days,

70
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,760
Erpang's father will be back,

71
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,560
and he'll go back to his own home.

72
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,560
Does he have a place to stay when he returns?

73
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,290
Does he have a home to go back to?

74
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,780
Let me tell you something.

75
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,200
I...

76
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,800
I'll have to work night shifts in a few days.

77
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,240
Why do you need to work night shifts?

78
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
The factory requires it.

79
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,700
There's no 'why' about it.

80
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,680
Will you get extra pay for night shifts?

81
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,010
Of course there will be compensation.

82
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,440
How much will they pay?

83
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,240
Each day, probably...

84
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,930
about 100 yuan, I guess.

85
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,480
Would they really pay that much?

86
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,360
Working day and night like that,

87
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,800
they have to pay for it.

88
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,320
Mom's hospital fees,

89
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,200
can we get the deposit back now?

90
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,460
Yes, we can get it back.

91
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,280
Then go get it tomorrow.

92
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,880
I'll go

93
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,160
when I have time.

94
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,400
It's several thousand yuan.

95
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,240
Yes, I know.

96
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,040
Okay, I got it.

97
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,720
Do this. Find someone to set it up first.

98
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,080
If they can't figure it out, I'll come over.

99
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,800
Alright.

100
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,760
I must be busy with something right now.

101
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,200
Fine.

102
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,040
Got it.

103
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,720
I'll go right away.

104
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,920
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

105
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Brother.

106
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,840
If there's something urgent over there,

107
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,720
you should go first.

108
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,840
We can wait here.

109
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,240
No matter how urgent that is,

110
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,900
it's not as important as this.

111
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,240
Brother.

112
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,920
You're just too sentimental.

113
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,560
Huo Dongfeng has been

114
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,480
locked up for over ten years.

115
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,010
What can he possibly do now?

116
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,370
Although he was once one of the Three Heroes of Dalin,

117
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,720
in today's society,

118
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,120
who's going to respect him when he gets out?

119
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Let me tell you about the other two heroes,

120
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,600
then you'll understand.

121
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,240
One of them is at the school gate

122
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,320
popping popcorn.

123
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,680
Making noise with his popper all day.

124
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,800
And the other one peddles a cart.

125
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,560
Acting all tough,

126
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,620
pedaling that cart faster than a car.

127
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,840
Is that funny?

128
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
What's wrong with popping popcorn?

129
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,440
What's wrong with pedaling a cart?

130
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
It means they're doing honest work.

131
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,260
Not getting into trouble.

132
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,200
Let me tell you something.

133
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,720
Huo Dongfeng

134
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,560
is my big brother.

135
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,809
How many scars do you have on your body?

136
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,240
Two, both right here.

137
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,400
My brother has three scars.

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,159
One of those scars

139
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,640
he took for me.

140
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,120
That was

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
in 1979,

142
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,760
when I was 18.

143
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
I was caught by some guys.

144
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,970
They were going to break my leg.

145
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,920
After my brother found out about this,

146
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,280
in the middle of the night,

147
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,760
he walked several miles all by himself.

148
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,840
Walking all night through ice and snow,

149
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,760
he found me before dawn.

150
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,480
This is my brother.

151
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,560
I'm taking him with me now.

152
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,480
Cut me once,

153
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,320
and we'll call it even.

154
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,450
Go ahead, cut me.

155
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,600
You know who I am, right?

156
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,920
Killing you guys will make me famous.

157
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,440
That scar was from taking a hit for me.

158
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,200
No wonder.

159
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,440
That's quite a debt to repay.

160
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,360
But why did he have to walk?

161
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,600
Couldn't he just ride a bicycle?

162
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,600
He was poor.

163
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,120
Couldn't afford a bicycle back then.

164
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,360
If you're poor, can't you borrow one?

165
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,320
It was 1 AM.

166
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,360
Everyone was asleep.

167
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,600
My brother was too proud.

168
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,960
You expect him to knock on doors to borrow one?

169
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,600
Back in '79,

170
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,760
people were poor,

171
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,090
but every family had at least one bicycle.

172
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,020
I'm done talking with you all.

173
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,360
Brother,

174
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,640
let's go home.

175
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,320
Is it a Lada or a Naz?

176
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,000
Crown.

177
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,620
Which department did you borrow it from?

178
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,360
It's mine.

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,840
Wait.

180
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,600
Brother.

181
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,060
This car is really stable.

182
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,170
Do you know what car this is?

183
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,480
What car?

184
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,120
Crown.

185
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:50,890
Brother,

186
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,600
come sit in the front and feel it.

187
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,240
I'll move to the back.

188
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,240
It's crowded in the back too.

189
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
No need. I can't move anyway.

190
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,200
My fault. I didn't arrange this well.

191
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,520
See if he recognizes him.

192
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,440
Who's this?

193
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,320
Who? He looks familiar.

194
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,000
Who is it? I can't remember.

195
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,880
Hongwei.

196
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,720
Oh my!

197
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,480
Hongwei!

198
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,000
Wow, it's been so many years!

199
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh my goodness.

200
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,480
You came at the perfect time!

201
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,720
Perfect timing. I

202
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,600
have something to do later.

203
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,000
You take our big brother

204
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
to get a haircut and wash first,

205
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,520
and I'll arrange everything for tonight.

206
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,250
Don't worry.

207
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,760
Leave big brother to me.

208
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,440
Tonight we'll...

209
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,080
go to Dingqing Restaurant.

210
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,520
We'll drink till we drop!

211
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,260
Dingqing Restaurant?

212
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,250
Brother, I'm sorry.

213
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,200
I forgot.

214
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,400
No, no, no. Not there.

215
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,440
Let's go to that place,

216
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,680
that seafood restaurant we always went to. What was it called?

217
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,400
Is it called Xinji Seafood Restaurant?

218
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:37,840
Yes.

219
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,200
Tonight we'll go to Xinji Seafood Restaurant for drinks.

220
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Come with us, Hongwei.

221
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,120
See you tonight.

222
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,180
Sure thing, Ermei.

223
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,640
Take this.

224
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,720
What's this?

225
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,120
Just take it.

226
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,000
Is that all?

227
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,520
This money...

228
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,840
Look, it's 100 yuan.

229
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,010
I absolutely can't take it.

230
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,960
What are you talking about?

231
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,490
How could I take your money?

232
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Listen, brother.

233
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,080
Consider it a loan from me.

234
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,360
Pay me back whenever you earn some money.

235
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,620
No, I can't pay it back.

236
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
Brother.

237
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,360
Big brother.

238
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,040
Brother, think about it. Now that you're out,

239
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,500
you're not alone anymore.

240
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,880
You're not just a single man.

241
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,240
You have a son, right?

242
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,920
His name is...

243
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,400
Called...

244
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,040
Erpang.

245
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,920
Erpang hasn't seen you for so many years.

246
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,240
He's suffered so much.

247
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,520
Now that you're out, what are you going to do?

248
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,580
Let him continue suffering with you?

249
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,200
Now that you're both out,

250
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,400
what will you eat and drink?

251
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,530
Where will you live?

252
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,560
Listen, brother.

253
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,720
You can't just wear these clothes.

254
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,960
Go see your son.

255
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,050
Alright.

256
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,160
I'll pay you back when I earn some money.

257
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,930
Hongwei, come here.

258
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,920
Let's get Hongwei some new clothes too.

259
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,060
Well...

260
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,400
Take our brother here

261
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,440
to get a haircut

262
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,700
and then take a shower.

263
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,760
Go to Dongfeng Road to buy two sets of clothes.

264
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,520
Get one for yourself too.

265
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,320
You go ahead with your business.

266
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,120
Alright, let's go.

267
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,160
See you tonight, brother.

268
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,240
See you tonight.

269
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,600
This is your hospital deposit refund.

270
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,760
6,128 yuan. Please verify it.

271
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,620
That'll be 3,000 yuan for the legal fees.

272
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,040
Here you go.

273
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,560
Based on what you've told me,

274
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,160
I understand the situation.

275
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,000
But our police

276
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,920
don't just arrest people without reason.

277
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,680
Especially in criminal cases like this.

278
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
It's not a joke.

279
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,240
If they've made an arrest,

280
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,640
they must have evidence.

281
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,760
No, my friend

282
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,680
couldn't possibly have killed anyone.

283
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,040
Don't worry.

284
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,760
Even if he did commit murder,

285
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,320
we can still find a way

286
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,450
to get him a suspended death sentence.

287
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,360
No, no.

288
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,800
Not a suspended sentence. What are you saying?

289
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,520
I...

290
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,680
I stake my reputation on this.

291
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,120
My friend couldn't possibly be a murderer.

292
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,480
He didn't do this.

293
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,920
I hope so.

294
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,480
Take this back

295
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,610
and have their family members sign it.

296
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,740
You need to trust the professionals.

297
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,360
Uncle.

298
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,920
I've hired

299
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,570
the most expensive lawyer in our city.

300
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,560
Don't worry.

301
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,600
We'll definitely win this case.

302
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,720
How would you like your hair cut?

303
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,960
Who's cutting it? You are.

304
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,280
Yes, what's wrong?

305
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,500
That's how things are now.

306
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,560
What style do you want today?

307
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,440
Whatever.

308
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,960
Don't be like that.

309
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,440
Look at you, so handsome.

310
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,080
I need to style you properly.

311
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,080
Look.

312
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,040
This is the most popular style this year.

313
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
It's called a crew cut.

314
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,760
And this is the absolute trendiest one.

315
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,280
It's called 'the beheading.'

316
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,560
That name sounds so unlucky.

317
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,290
Then let me find you a lucky one.

318
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,970
Look at this one.

319
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,400
This would suit you perfectly.

320
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,000
It'll make you look really sharp.

321
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,520
Hey, stop chatting with my brother.

322
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,600
Just get on with it.

323
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,240
Alright.

324
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,680
I'll get everything ready.

325
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,760
He's dressed like a bad guy.

326
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,500
But he doesn't look like a bad person.

327
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,900
What did he say?

328
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,760
Did he really say that?

329
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,480
Bring all the gear with you.

330
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,360
Meet at the East Square.

331
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,420
I'll be there soon.

332
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,960
Brother.

333
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,640
Why didn't you call Huo Dongfeng for the fight?

334
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,520
Isn't he that Bajiquan master?

335
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,120
Get lost.

336
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,600
Big brother just got released today.

337
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,240
And you're bringing this up with him?

338
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,640
Didn't he used to be involved in this stuff?

339
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,730
Let big brother have some peace for a few days.

340
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,060
You scared me to death!

341
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,970
What the hell is this thing?

342
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,360
It's a hair dryer.

343
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,800
Brother,

344
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,040
sit down. I'll dry your hair.

345
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,320
I thought it was that homemade gun firing at me.

346
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,800
What's a homemade gun?

347
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,000
It's just us.

348
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,400
We are the homemade guns.

349
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,810
Hurry up and dry my brother's hair.

350
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,760
Alright.

351
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,560
Got it.

352
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,880
Have you visited Erpang?

353
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,160
Yes, I have.

354
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,320
I pick him up from school every month or two.

355
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,320
I was thinking Erpang is really fat.

356
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,040
Being too skinny isn't good-looking either.

357
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,960
Nonsense.

358
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,320
Ermei is truly impressive now.

359
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,280
He's won several big battles these past two years.

360
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,920
Took down quite a few big shots.

361
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,600
Now the entire city's

362
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,840
fish markets, fruit markets,

363
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,160
dried and fresh produce markets,

364
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,760
he's monopolized them all.

365
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,000
He's got both power and money.

366
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,040
Back then, you were one of the Dalin Three Heroes,

367
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,260
but that was just in our district.

368
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,360
Now he's influential in several districts across the city.

369
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,820
He's got pull everywhere.

370
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,250
Ermei is definitely going places.

371
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,520
He's been generous and righteous since he was a kid.

372
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,720
Dongfeng Road Clothing Market

373
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,760
Whatever style you want

374
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,960
they have it all.

375
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,040
When did it open?

376
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,880
Around '85 or '86.

377
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,000
They have clothes from Guangzhou,

378
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,760
Macau,

379
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,520
and even Hong Kong.

380
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,800
I think

381
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,760
you don't quite match up to Brother Fa

382
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,080
yet.

383
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,160
How so?

384
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,040
I'm short on cash too.

385
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,730
Let's keep looking.

386
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,680
This week,

387
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,320
what's this 'bun hairstyle'

388
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,600
that's so famous?

389
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,040
It's much more famous than that street

390
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,440
near your home.

391
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,930
That's impossible.

392
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,680
This place...

393
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,080
Ping'an Cinema,

394
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,360
Hongqi Theater,

395
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,920
Workers' Cultural Palace Theater,

396
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,080
all these theaters -

397
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,850
who's in charge of them now?

398
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,880
I don't know who's in charge.

399
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,560
Maybe nobody is.

400
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,280
I'm going in.

401
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,560
Just nobody in charge.

402
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,200
Bro, tell me.

403
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,260
Hardly anyone goes to the movies these days.

404
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,720
Just 2 or 3 people per showing.

405
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,120
Back when you monopolized

406
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,520
all those movie tickets,

407
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,780
you could hustle and make good money.

408
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,280
But now,

409
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,320
even if you got all three

410
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,050
theaters' box office revenue,

411
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,290
it wouldn't amount to much.

412
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,760
Nobody watches anymore.

413
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,520
So why still show movies?

414
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,240
Of course they do.

415
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,640
They're state-owned. They won't go under.

416
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,090
They'll be demolished.

417
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,970
What's this called?

418
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,480
Street Fighter.

419
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,040
Let me try it.

420
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,080
Hit him!

421
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:15,920
Excuse me.

422
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,050
Go ask him for money.

423
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,680
Got it.

424
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,930
The screen is a bit dark.

425
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,210
Press the green button.

426
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,100
You've got talent.

427
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,200
Does Erpang play this?

428
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,440
It's not good to come here all the time.

429
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,520
I'm worried Erpang will learn bad habits.

430
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,600
Am I that bad?

431
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,660
If I say he can play, then he plays.

432
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,850
You're his father. You make the rules.

433
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
Wang Ning, what are you doing?

434
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,280
What's it to you?

435
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,300
Erpang got beaten by Wang Ning again.

436
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,960
That's for hitting me at school.

437
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,200
Brother.

438
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,040
Am I blind?

439
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:20,840
Don't move.

440
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,900
I'm going to teach you a lesson today.

441
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,680
Dad.

442
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,600
Dad.

443
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,520
Dad, you're finally back.

444
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
Do you know how much I've missed you?

445
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,640
Dad.

446
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,800
Dad, you're finally back.

447
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,200
Wang Ning from my class always bullies me.

448
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,640
And he says...

449
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,640
He also says my mom does that thing.

450
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,760
Dad, you're finally back.

451
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,560
Dad.

452
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,160
Dad.

453
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,120
That's it.

454
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,240
Alright.

455
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Go back to your uncle's house first.

456
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,680
Tell your uncle

457
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,200
give him my regards.

458
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,360
Ask him to

459
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,560
keep tomorrow evening free.

460
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,040
I want to treat him to dinner.

461
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,780
Tell him I miss him so much.

462
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,040
Your Uncle Hongwei and I

463
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,490
will rent a place tomorrow.

464
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,040
Right?

465
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,620
We'll have our own home in a day or two.

466
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,080
Stay at your uncle's for two more days.

467
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,240
Dad,

468
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,680
there's no rush.

469
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,080
My uncle treats me very well.

470
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,720
My aunt does too.

471
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,050
Later we'll live together.

472
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,560
It's still better to have our own place, right?

473
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,450
I'm going to have dinner with a friend.

474
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,780
See you tomorrow then.

475
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:08,920
Okay.

476
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,640
Off you go.

477
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,680
Dad, don't fight with others.

478
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,960
In other families, adults warn children

479
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,800
not to fight.

480
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,410
But in your family, it's the opposite.

481
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,940
Tell me, is this kid

482
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
being sensible?

483
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,100
Or are you being too immature?

484
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,260
What are you doing with yourself?

485
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,020
I might have gotten into too many fights before.

486
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,760
But when was I ever unreasonable?

487
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,120
Just tell me when I was ever unreasonable.

488
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,920
This is the only time I'm being unreasonable.

489
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,780
You're still going on about this?

490
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,370
You've encountered too many bad people and situations.

491
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,920
You've seen far more evil

492
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,720
than the average person.

493
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
Eat properly.

494
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,380
Don't leave anything.

495
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,040
This is Mengmeng's.

496
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,240
I've saved it for her.

497
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,240
You two should stop

498
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,560
fighting over food from now on.

499
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,680
Even in our hardest times,

500
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,760
your mother and I never

501
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,040
fought over food.

502
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,840
What era are we living in now?

503
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,250
It's embarrassing.

504
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,090
Did you see your father?

505
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,280
Yes, I did.

506
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,810
He just dropped me off and left.

507
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,060
Where did he go?

508
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,580
He went out for dinner.

509
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,800
He also said

510
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,360
he wants to take you out for a meal tomorrow.

511
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,820
He's treating me to a meal?

512
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,660
How is he? Is he doing well?

513
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,960
Good. Very well.

514
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,570
He's very handsome,

515
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,370
just as handsome as you.

516
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,040
Your taste

517
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,500
still needs improvement.

518
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,640
Eat quickly.

519
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Before Mengmeng comes back,

520
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,800
finish it fast.

521
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,320
You have much more than she does.

522
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,450
If she sees it, she'll scold you again.

523
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,360
I'm going for the night shift later.

524
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,820
Wash the dishes, will you?

525
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,090
What time do you get off from your night shift?

526
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,280
I don't know.

527
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,210
I'll find out after working today.

528
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,280
Is your factory always this casual?

529
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,420
That's enough.

530
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,240
I'm leaving.

531
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,570
Save this food for me. Don't throw it away.

532
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,760
Erpang.

533
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,600
If you're a real man,

534
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,440
don't touch Mengmeng's food.

535
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,340
I definitely won't eat it.

536
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,920
Mengmeng.

537
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,680
There's not enough food.

538
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,600
You...

539
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,440
Sooner or later, your appetite will be your downfall.

540
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,840
Here they come. Applaud!

541
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,570
Brother!

542
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,160
Brother!

543
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,440
Brother!

544
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,280
Come on, Brother.

545
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,920
Such a warm welcome.

546
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,200
Go up and say something.

547
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,240
Say a few words. Everyone's waiting for you.

548
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,760
Say something, Brother.

549
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,680
He's back.

550
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,840
Come on.

551
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,040
Brother.

552
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,520
Alright.

553
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,120
Brothers and friends,

554
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,000
I'm very happy to see you all here today.

555
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,520
I'd like to toast to all my brothers.

556
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,160
To you, boss.

557
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,480
Miss Yang.

558
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,160
Mr. Cui,

559
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,640
you even brought a makeup artist?

560
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,000
It wasn't really necessary,

561
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,680
but

562
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,440
before I came here,

563
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,920
I did some market research.

564
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,920
In nightclubs across the country,

565
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,480
people's interest in handsome or ugly guys

566
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,680
doesn't last very long.

567
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,860
Most people prefer someone bizarre.

568
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,200
I want to give it a try.

569
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,040
Bizarre?

570
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,560
Yes.

571
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,960
Fine. Do whatever you want.

572
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,480
Well, it's about

573
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,920
taking money and solving problems, right?

574
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,980
Let's give it a try.

575
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,000
See you on stage later.

576
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,680
Alright. I'll see just how bizarre you can be.

577
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,760
Brother,

578
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,560
are you happy?

579
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,010
If you're happy,

580
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,000
that's all that matters.

581
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,200
I always want the best for you, brother.

582
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,440
Pretty good.

583
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,480
We'll split the money I earn.

584
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,440
What for?

585
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:38,840
Brother,

586
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,120
the money you earn is yours.

587
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,800
You don't need to share with me.

588
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,260
As long as you're making money, you're good.

589
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,730
I have plenty of ways to make money.

590
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,520
Debts must be repaid.

591
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,800
Brother.

592
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,500
You haven't changed a bit.

593
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,440
You'll always be my big brother.

594
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,840
Ladies and gentlemen.

595
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,960
Let's give a warm round of applause

596
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,320
to welcome the champion

597
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,600
of the city's first karaoke competition.

598
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,720
Cui Guoming!

599
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,520
Brother.

600
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,639
Let's go.

601
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,719
What a night.

602
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,719
This is yours,

603
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,000
but consider it mine.

604
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,820
How much will we spend on drinks tonight?

605
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,280
Don't embarrass yourself.

606
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,440
You can spend as little as a few dozen yuan,

607
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,560
or as much as tens of thousands.

608
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,520
Let's go.

609
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,199
Brother, what do you think?

610
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,440
Is it good?

611
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,560
Is it okay?

612
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,320
Come on, brother.

613
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,159
Take it easy.

614
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,489
Watch your step.

615
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:47,690
Brother.

616
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,600
Today we'll sit here,

617
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,360
in the best spot, okay?

618
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,050
Brother.

619
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,160
Over here.

620
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,690
Brother.

621
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,460
Excuse me, sir, could you move aside?

622
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,380
Alright, brother,

623
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,440
is this good?

624
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,720
That singer

625
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,520
looks a lot like my brother-in-law.

626
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,360
Really?

627
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,520
Bring that flower basket

628
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,560
over there.

629
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,220
Bring the flowers.

630
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Hurry up!

631
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,970
Thank you, brother.

632
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,370
Thank you, brother.

633
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,320
He is my brother-in-law.

634
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,440
Why are these flowers being sent?

635
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,360
Don't worry about it, brother.

636
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,120
Go all out!

637
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,960
Bring the big flower basket,

638
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,890
the biggest one!

639
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,420
Bring the flowers,

640
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,800
give a tip!

641
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,600
Look at this,

642
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,680
what do you think?

643
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,680
It's fine.

644
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,320
Brother.

645
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,000
Brother-in-law?

646
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,760
Why does your brother-in-law call you 'brother'?

647
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,160
Instead of calling you 'brother-in-law'?

648
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,450
That's a good question.

649
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,290
Do you have an answer to that question?

650
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,720
No answer.

651
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,250
Would it be a good question if it had an answer?

652
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,480
Come on, brother.

653
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,240
You just got out

654
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,720
and you're making such a big show. Impressive.

655
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,850
My friends give me face.

656
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,520
I told Er Pang

657
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,650
that I'd treat you to dinner tomorrow.

658
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,000
Didn't expect today.

659
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,200
The one sitting next to you,

660
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,400
that's Er Mei, right?

661
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,120
Yes, it's Er Mei. Why?

662
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,480
Well,

663
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,080
you two.

664
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,040
You're now the most

665
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,760
popular stars in our Liudao Street.

666
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,240
AC Milan has their Three Musketeers,

667
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,240
and you two together are

668
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,760
the Twin Stars of Liudao Street.

669
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,960
With you, we'd be the Three Musketeers.

670
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,160
No, please, brother.

671
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,120
Give me a break.

672
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,800
Look, you just got out

673
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,360
and if you don't hang out with Erpang

674
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,880
but stay with Ermei instead,

675
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,840
I can basically see

676
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,040
your future already.

677
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,080
I just had a meal with Ermei,

678
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,200
and you think you've figured out my entire life?

679
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,930
Should I just stop living then?

680
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,880
Well...

681
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,960
Ermei is now

682
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,320
quite famous.

683
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,760
Not just people at work know him,

684
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,400
even schoolkids fighting mention his name.

685
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,760
All my relatives,

686
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,400
everyone knows Ermei.

687
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,730
Isn't that impressive?

688
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,240
What?

689
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,480
You're telling me all this

690
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,320
to say I'm not good enough anymore?

691
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,650
That's not what I meant.

692
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,570
I heard everything from Hongwei already.

693
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,400
Have you noticed

694
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,200
his clothes are always bulging?

695
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,960
I know he's rich now.

696
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,620
He's wearing a bulletproof vest.

697
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,600
Don't talk nonsense. Is that necessary?

698
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,160
What? Aren't you scared, bro?

699
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,220
What am I afraid of?

700
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,960
Isn't that how everyone survives out there?

701
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,620
Who wears a bulletproof vest just to get by, bro?

702
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,680
Look at how you guys used to be.

703
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,400
Getting beaten black and blue,

704
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,760
selling watches and cars,

705
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,200
then paying medical bills,

706
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,400
then going out drinking again.

707
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,240
That's what I call struggling when you're poor.

708
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,440
Not much damage done.

709
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
Things are different now.

710
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,360
This guy's even wearing a bulletproof vest.

711
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,880
Look at him spending money like water,

712
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,320
throwing it around.

713
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,360
He just doesn't know

714
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,000
when his time will be up.

715
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,360
This is

716
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,440
playing with his life.

717
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,460
Er Mei suffered since childhood.

718
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,170
His family was poor.

719
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
But he's got high ambitions.

720
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,320
If he doesn't risk his life,

721
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,200
what else can he use to get ahead?

722
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,320
Why are you making excuses for him?

723
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,800
Everyone's poor. Everyone struggles.

724
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,200
Does he have to hang out with those gangsters?

725
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,800
Just promise me

726
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,460
you'll stop hanging out with them, okay?

727
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,080
I'm not hanging out with him.

728
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,760
Who am I hanging out with?

729
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,160
I'm hanging out with you.

730
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,880
But your thing,

731
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,600
your job,

732
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,200
I can't do what you do.

733
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,000
Your thing...

734
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,200
What's wrong with what I do?

735
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,360
Am I just hanging around?

736
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,640
Is what I do anything like what you guys do?

737
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,200
I'm earning money.

738
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,660
I'm supporting my family.

739
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,800
Can you promise me

740
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,130
not to hang out with him?

741
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,480
I promise you.

742
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,160
I won't hang out with Ermei.

743
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,520
I believe you.

744
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,060
Let's talk about something serious.

745
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,360
What do you want to do next?

746
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,880
Ermei found me a job.

747
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,360
You're being disrespectful, bro.

748
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,880
I've been drinking with you all night,

749
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,880
and you're messing with me?

750
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,600
After all these years,

751
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,760
I haven't been this happy.

752
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,040
First I think of Erpang,

753
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,920
and then I think of you.

754
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,480
That's enough.

755
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,440
You're making fun of me.

756
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,160
No, no, no.

757
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,760
He found me a job selling fish.

758
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760
At the fish market.

759
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,320
Is it really just selling fish?

760
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,980
I'll be working with Hongwei.

761
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,520
Okay, wait.

762
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,560
Let me ask you one more question.

763
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,600
You're known for being loyal.

764
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,640
Very loyal. After you got out,

765
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,600
Ermei gave you such a grand welcome

766
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,040
and even found you a job.

767
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,880
If one day he gets into a fight,

768
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,480
I'm asking if you'll join in.

769
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,000
Of course I will.

770
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,200
Then everything I said tonight

771
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,400
was a complete waste.

772
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,020
That's enough.

773
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,080
Check, please.

774
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,200
Wait, wait.

775
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,220
I'll definitely join.

776
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,280
Boss, hurry up with the bill.

777
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,080
Hold on. That's not what I meant.

778
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,200
What do you mean?

779
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,440
There's one thing I'm certain of.

780
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,720
What can you be sure of?

781
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,760
If you hang out with him,

782
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,280
can you be sure you won't break the law?

783
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,120
Or can you be sure you'll survive?

784
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,240
I'm certain that

785
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,920
for something as serious as murder,

786
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,050
he wouldn't call me.

787
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,760
How can you be so sure?

788
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,880
I'm certain he won't call me.

789
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,080
I swear on this light.

790
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,400
Look at it.

791
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,320
Even the light doesn't believe you.

792
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,320
It went out, bro.

793
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:50,880
It's on.

794
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,120
See? It didn't go out.

795
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,600
I'm telling you.

796
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
I'm absolutely certain.

797
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,200
You're drunk out of your mind, bro.

798
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,800
I'm asking you for one thing.

799
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,280
Bro, now that you're out,

800
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,800
can you stay longer this time?

801
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,040
Erpang, this kid,

802
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,680
he's always wanted

803
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,200
a real family.

804
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,560
I hope this time you're out,

805
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,650
you'll take care of this first.

806
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,600
His uncle.

807
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,680
Thank you for your hard work.

808
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,920
It really is.

809
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,040
If you'd stay away from that bulletproof vest,

810
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,770
I wouldn't have to work so hard.

811
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,770
Pretty good.

812
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:46,720
Bro.

813
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:47,880
How is it?

814
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,280
The flavor is quite rich.

815
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,200
Of course it is.

816
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,000
That's how a fish market should smell.
