1
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,560
Something's happening.

2
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,360
What happened to him?

3
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,160
He's dead.

4
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,200
How did he die?

5
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,770
Sudden cardiovascular tumor.

6
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,600
Let's go.

7
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,800
Wait.

8
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,250
His name is Ji Qiang.

9
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,100
Where are the clothes?

10
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,080
What's wrong?

11
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,200
Ji Qiang

12
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,720
is dead.

13
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,200
Where did he die?

14
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,800
He died

15
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,400
in his shed.

16
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,480
Did he pass peacefully?

17
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,280
Erpang,

18
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,960
go home and don't tell your grandpa

19
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,160
that Ji Qiang is gone.

20
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,820
Did you hear me?

21
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,080
My dad went to work on his multi-speed bicycle again.

22
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,200
I suppose so.

23
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Let him tinker away.

24
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,920
If he likes to fiddle with things, let him fiddle.

25
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Actually, I know

26
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,080
why you support my dad

27
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,940
tinkering with his gear bicycle.

28
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,480
Why is that?

29
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,880
You know, my dad may seem

30
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,640
quite unreliable most of the time.

31
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,760
But actually, he

32
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,240
truly loves his job.

33
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,120
Just look,

34
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,800
when he puts on his work uniform,

35
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,680
when the machines start running,

36
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,240
his eyes light up.

37
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,880
I think

38
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,800
he loves that work uniform of his

39
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,860
more than all the clothes in our shop.

40
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,760
You really are your father's daughter.

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,560
I feel my dad

42
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,960
has become much more reliable than before.

43
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,900
Let's hope he continues to stay that way.

44
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,200
I'll kill you.

45
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,760
This is Cubism.

46
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,400
It's popular in France.

47
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,480
Fake Picasso.

48
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,400
I'll kill you.

49
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,940
What's wrong? What are you doing?

50
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,600
You may think it's shallow now,

51
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,400
but you'll thank me in 100 years.

52
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Stop, stop!

53
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,640
What's going on?

54
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,720
I'm going to kill him.

55
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,840
Tell me what happened.

56
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,640
What's going on, brother?

57
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,320
He did this tattoo for me.

58
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,840
I can't show my face in public anymore.

59
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,300
I didn't tattoo your face.

60
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,520
Calm down, calm down.

61
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,640
Wait, brother.

62
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,440
Can I take a look?

63
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,640
May I see it?

64
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,600
I'll show you.

65
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,840
Perfect.

66
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,520
Liu Ye, hold him.

67
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,440
Put it on.

68
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,760
It's really fine.

69
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,400
Brother,

70
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,440
this is all I have.

71
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,720
Take it first.

72
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,440
Find a professional

73
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,960
tattoo artist to fix it.

74
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,640
The area isn't that big.

75
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,280
I am a professional.

76
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,960
You...

77
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,880
If you want to stay in this business,

78
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,090
you'd better learn some martial arts.

79
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,760
I'll cover the money for now.

80
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,090
Remember to pay me back.

81
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,960
It's okay.

82
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,200
Don't be angry.

83
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,200
I can fix it.

84
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,900
I really can fix it.

85
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,840
I need your help, bro.

86
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,620
What theme is this supposed to be?

87
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,050
Mahavairocana Buddha.

88
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,880
Today I...

89
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,250
Thanks for your hard work, Liu.

90
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,280
20.

91
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,160
I have an idea.

92
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,840
You could incorporate

93
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,280
cupping therapy, gua sha, and even acupuncture

94
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,080
into my tattoo art.

95
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
This way we can endlessly

96
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,440
modify the original designs.

97
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,040
We can explain it however we want.

98
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,960
You see, normally

99
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
my tattoo business is a one-time deal.

100
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,760
But your cupping and gua sha are different.

101
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,400
Right?

102
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,760
I have clients with tattoos

103
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,640
that didn't turn out as expected.

104
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,960
I'll bring them over

105
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,040
and we can split the profits.

106
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,640
It's resource integration.

107
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,520
Also.

108
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,640
You know how many young people

109
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,400
when they're dating

110
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,520
like to tattoo their boyfriends'

111
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,400
or girlfriends' names

112
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,880
and portraits on their bodies

113
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,960
and when they break up

114
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,400
they deeply regret it.

115
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,840
That's when acupuncture

116
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,040
comes in handy.

117
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,960
How so?

118
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,960
Stab it! Stab their name or portrait!

119
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
Pain on the body,

120
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,050
satisfaction in the heart.

121
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
If that's not enough,

122
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,320
use a gua sha tool to scrape it,

123
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,960
scrape their face. If still not satisfied,

124
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,640
use cupping on their face,

125
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,840
just like Silver Horn King

126
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,040
trapped in the gourd.

127
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,200
Okay, okay.

128
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
I can see your artistic vision now.

129
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,040
So, brother,

130
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,440
I just have one question for you.

131
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,520
You must answer me honestly.

132
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,960
Go ahead.

133
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,600
Do you really plan to stick with

134
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,520
tattooing all the way?

135
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
To be precise,

136
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,799
I do plan to

137
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,919
follow the path of tattoo art

138
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,400
all the way to the end.

139
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,610
Everything is perfect.

140
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,160
It's just this lathe

141
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,810
that's holding us back.

142
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,650
Don't be sad, Uncle.

143
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Actually, being able to ride it

144
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,280
is already perfect.

145
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,640
That's what I think, Erpang.

146
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
About this bike,

147
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,680
let's put it aside for now.

148
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,480
I'll save up some money

149
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,400
to buy a new lathe.

150
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,480
Tomorrow I'll buy you

151
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,010
a new multi-speed bicycle.

152
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,920
No need.

153
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,160
Even the smallest business

154
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,220
requires capital.

155
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,360
Take your bag home.

156
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,000
Uncle.

157
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,800
Tomorrow you need to go to school.

158
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,400
The teacher wants to meet with a parent.

159
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,640
What's wrong? Did you get into trouble again?

160
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,640
I didn't do anything.

161
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,970
Why does the teacher want to meet parents?

162
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,280
I don't know either.

163
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,820
We'll see when we get there tomorrow.

164
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,400
Huo Xiaoyang.

165
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,160
Has he gotten into some kind of trouble?

166
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,120
No, don't worry.

167
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,880
I mainly came to see you today

168
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,210
to talk about the children's daily lives.

169
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,880
Just a casual chat.

170
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Don't be nervous.

171
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,040
I'm not nervous at all.

172
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,920
Did you make him

173
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,480
a multi-speed bicycle?

174
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,400
Could you please

175
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,880
stop him from riding that bicycle

176
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
to school?

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,040
This child,

178
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,760
although his grades are average,

179
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,520
he was never late for class.

180
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,040
That was really good.

181
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,800
But since he got that

182
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,520
multi-speed bicycle,

183
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,880
he's not only late every day,

184
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,040
but his hands are always

185
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,920
filthy,

186
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,000
covered in oil.

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,040
He spends half the class washing them.

188
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,280
How can his studies improve like this?

189
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,640
That's my fault for not being skilled enough.

190
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,920
I'll buy him a new one.

191
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,680
He ranked second to last on this exam again.

192
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,570
That's an improvement!

193
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,280
Guo Xiaoxue was last.

194
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,680
Is she living at your house too?

195
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,120
Given her situation,

196
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,160
she can only stay at our place.

197
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,800
It's rare to find friends

198
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,000
who are as loyal as you.

199
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,040
But the academic issues of both children

200
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,570
still need your attention.

201
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,040
Especially Guo Xiaoxue.

202
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,880
You need to guide her.

203
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,280
The classmates often

204
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,000
gossip behind her back.

205
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,060
Please don't let her take it to heart.

206
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,800
I've already criticized them for this.

207
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,860
That's necessary.

208
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,760
What? About her father's situation?

209
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,920
No, those kids

210
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,160
are just talking nonsense.

211
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,680
They're saying that Erpang and her

212
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,160
are living at your place,

213
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,640
and that they're married

214
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,300
and doing all sorts of things.

215
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,520
Don't mind them.

216
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,360
Kids talk nonsense. They don't know better.

217
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,240
I don't mind.

218
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,760
Right.

219
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,640
I mean... right,

220
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,480
I do mind.

221
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,480
Right, we should care about what matters

222
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,400
and ignore what doesn't.

223
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,680
Alright, thank you.

224
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,520
Sorry for the trouble.

225
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,120
Just a moment,

226
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,480
let's talk about Cui Meng's issues as well.

227
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,760
About Cui Meng,

228
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,680
she's always been an excellent student.

229
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,880
But recently her grades

230
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,360
have dropped dramatically.

231
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,760
She often feels sleepy in class.

232
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,920
She told me

233
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,000
there's a child living with her at home.

234
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,880
Is that true?

235
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,280
Yes, it's Guo Xiaoxue.

236
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,620
I know things aren't easy for you.

237
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,880
But Mengmeng

238
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,610
is really a promising student.

239
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,160
You need to nurture the promising talents first, right?

240
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,290
And she's your own daughter after all.

241
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,160
You're right.

242
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,280
Thank you both.

243
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,640
Sorry for the trouble.

244
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,360
Now let's talk about

245
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,120
the three children's

246
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,680
moral education class.

247
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,400
Please go ahead.

248
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,160
Gone to tinker with the gear bicycle again.

249
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,120
From today, the gear bicycle project

250
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,400
will be put on hold for now.

251
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,160
I'll spend more time at the shop.

252
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,160
Thank you for your hard work, honey.

253
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,280
Mengmeng.

254
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,820
Put on your clothes and shoes.

255
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,920
Come out and talk with me.

256
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,650
Put your clothes on.

257
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,760
Dad.

258
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,680
Did you call me here

259
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,240
just to watch you stare into space?

260
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,800
Haven't you been

261
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,640
sleeping well lately?

262
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,160
Yes.

263
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,000
When Xiaoxue first came to our home,

264
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
she used to grind her teeth all the time.

265
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It was too noisy.

266
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,520
Then Grandpa got her

267
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
a mouth guard.

268
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,640
She doesn't grind her teeth anymore,

269
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,680
but when she sleeps, she's always

270
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,810
startled and jumpy.

271
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,680
Sometimes she screams,

272
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,880
sometimes she curses,

273
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,810
and sometimes she even convulses.

274
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,520
And that dog she keeps

275
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,400
barks in the middle of the night.

276
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,130
How can anyone sleep like this?

277
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,480
What Xiaoxue went through...

278
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,880
Then why

279
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,610
didn't you tell me and your mom?

280
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,520
I know you and mom

281
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,400
have it tough.

282
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,640
You both meant well

283
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,840
by bringing her here.

284
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,120
She is quite pitiful indeed.

285
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,040
Look,

286
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,240
that incident with the shoes

287
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,040
already caused so much trouble.

288
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,920
If I told you both about this,

289
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,840
could she still stay in our home?

290
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,120
It's not a big deal really.

291
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,280
I'm just a little unhappy.

292
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,040
Think about it,

293
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,520
mom and dad were just mine alone,

294
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,880
now they have to be shared among three people.

295
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,210
Why should that happen?

296
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,280
Daughter,

297
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,180
Dad understands everything.

298
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,640
Dad is trying to find a way

299
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,900
to solve this problem.

300
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,220
I'm thinking about

301
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,570
getting our family a bigger house.

302
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,400
Then there will be fewer conflicts.

303
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,560
Remember, Mengmeng,

304
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,040
your mom and I

305
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,520
are your real parents,

306
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,340
not anyone else's.

307
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,360
Dad,

308
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,640
I don't want a big house.

309
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,360
I just want our family

310
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,640
to go back to how it was before,

311
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
just the three of us,

312
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,680
that's all.

313
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,400
The underground garage is right here.

314
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,280
This is our city's

315
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,640
first commercial villa.

316
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,880
They all have the same layout with four bedrooms, three living rooms, three bathrooms,

317
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,160
plus a basement.

318
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
These houses are now

319
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,940
being snatched up like crazy.

320
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,760
Three bathrooms.

321
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,040
So our three kids

322
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,360
won't have to fight anymore.

323
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,280
That's good,

324
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,280
but I'm sure the price is good too, huh?

325
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,240
450,000.

326
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,520
This is the lowest price.

327
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,160
Yes, yes, yes.

328
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,240
If you don't decide now,

329
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,160
in a few months,

330
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
the price might go up.

331
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,880
Right, that's reasonable.

332
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,280
The whole layout...

333
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,240
Yes.

334
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,880
Can...

335
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,400
So are we taking it?

336
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,160
450,000...

337
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,640
Just look at your style and elegance,

338
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,400
you look like you belong here.

339
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,120
Of course you should take it.

340
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
My style is okay.

341
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
You look good too.

342
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,280
Beautiful. You're beautiful too.

343
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,010
Alright, let me think about it.

344
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,240
I need to consider it carefully. Buying a house is no small matter.

345
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,040
Let's discuss it first.

346
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,500
Okay, let's talk about it.

347
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,040
This house is beautiful.

348
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,800
It's awesome.

349
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,680
If you like it, let's buy it.

350
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,520
We can move in.

351
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,680
Do you know how much money

352
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,640
we have left?

353
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,480
I don't know.

354
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,640
Up until now,

355
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,640
we should have had over 180,000 left,

356
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,560
but you spent some of it

357
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,880
on that transmission job.

358
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,400
At this point,

359
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,240
I think

360
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,560
if we sell our current house,

361
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,920
and add everything together,

362
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,780
we're still short about 200,000.

363
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,760
200,000 is manageable.

364
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,520
We can earn it with some effort.

365
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,480
Some effort?

366
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,760
My goodness, you're so bold.

367
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,079
I'm afraid of your 'efforts.'

368
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
Every time you make an effort,

369
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,680
at best we lose money,

370
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,040
at worst you end up in jail again.

371
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
Do you know if you go back,

372
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,440
it'll be your third time?

373
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,520
Who knows if you'll ever get out.

374
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,760
I actually wouldn't mind going back.

375
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,560
I could see Dapao and have a chat.

376
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,840
You want to go back?

377
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,900
Looking for Dapao?

378
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,010
I'll take you in.

379
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,880
What's wrong?

380
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,120
Why did you get physical?

381
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,200
Why? Why?

382
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,460
What do you mean 'why'?

383
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,560
Get up quickly.

384
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,520
There are so many people around.

385
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,720
There's nobody here.

386
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,720
Hurry up.

387
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
People are watching from the windows.

388
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,480
Practice a bit more.

389
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,960
I can't. I've lost control.

390
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,480
Are you buying the house?

391
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,280
I'm already shaking.

392
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:46,840
Will you buy it?

393
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,360
Yes.

394
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,440
Buy it? Do you have money?

395
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:48,960
Yes.

396
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,000
Where?

397
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,980
In your pocket.

398
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,700
I'm researching money-making opportunities.

399
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,980
Writing another book?

400
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,960
Let me tell you something.

401
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,520
Everyone needs to adapt to

402
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,760
social development.

403
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,440
If you don't keep up with the trends,

404
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,040
how can you make any money?

405
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,370
Erpang says he wants to raise turtles at home.

406
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,520
What?

407
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,300
What does he want to do?

408
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,560
Mengmeng says

409
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,520
Xiaoxue got a dog.

410
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,520
Erpang has a turtle.

411
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,520
As the little mistress of this house,

412
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,980
she wants to have pets too.

413
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,850
She wants to raise two pigeons.

414
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,680
This way our family

415
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,010
will have animals from sea, land, and air.

416
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,580
How are we supposed to live in this house?

417
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,680
What do you think?

418
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,840
Look.

419
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,760
Do we

420
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,360
have any way to stop them?

421
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,690
With these kids' temperament,

422
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,700
do you think you can stop them?

423
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,960
Fine.

424
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,440
Buying a villa

425
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,120
needs to be on our agenda now.

426
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,440
If we have another child,

427
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,920
what pets would they raise?

428
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,120
Alright.

429
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,240
Your Uncle Liu

430
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,200
has such great skills.

431
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,280
Really impressive.

432
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,560
Just a few needles

433
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,400
and my whole body feels so comfortable.

434
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,760
I feel like I could cook up a storm.

435
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,740
Good. Please sit down.

436
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,920
What are you reading?

437
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,720
Well,

438
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,760
I'm studying

439
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,960
our country's future

440
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,720
and our own future.

441
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,600
Have you made any progress?

442
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,560
A little bit.

443
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,130
Let me tell you about it.

444
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,040
Go ahead.

445
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,560
Well,

446
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
along

447
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,000
our country's

448
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,320
long northern border,

449
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,840
there are some

450
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,800
very inconspicuous small cities,

451
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,360
like Manzhouli,

452
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,920
Heihe, and Suihe.

453
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,520
All these cities

454
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,720
are adjacent to the former Soviet Union

455
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,040
and are key trading cities.

456
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,240
I've been studying

457
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,720
our country's policies

458
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,280
and the global situation.

459
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,720
I believe our country's future

460
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,000
definitely lies in foreign trade.

461
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,520
So you're changing careers now

462
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,580
to study politics.

463
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,520
Good, good.

464
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,560
Once you succeed in your research

465
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,320
and get discovered by the government,

466
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,280
they'll have a Longzhong meeting with you,

467
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,920
discover you from among the common people

468
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,920
and bring you out

469
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,080
and you'll become the next Zhuge Liang.

470
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,920
That's not funny.

471
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,600
You're starting to sound

472
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,760
more and more like Mengmeng.

473
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,040
Stop mocking me.

474
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,720
I really think it's good.

475
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,040
You can stay at home

476
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,800
and do your research quietly.

477
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,800
So I don't have to

478
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,280
worry about you going out and making trouble again.

479
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,210
Worry about you going back to jail.

480
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,760
Please don't be so quick to mock me.

481
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,440
Just listen to what I have to say,

482
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,040
will you?

483
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,090
Go ahead.

484
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,760
Since Stalin's era,

485
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,280
the former Soviet Union

486
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,520
has been developing heavy industry

487
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,080
for national security.

488
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,080
This has caused their light industry

489
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,800
to be almost paralyzed now.

490
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,440
Now we can

491
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,520
take two of those

492
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,760
thermos flask liners

493
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,560
and trade them for their motorcycles.

494
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,620
Can you believe it?

495
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,280
I'm not joking.

496
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,120
This is true.

497
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,970
People have already done this.

498
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,280
So now is a good time

499
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,040
for border trade.

500
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,960
I want to give it a try.

501
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,640
Suihe is my first choice

502
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,400
since it's closest to us.

503
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,720
You've only been quiet for a few days

504
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,800
and now you're starting to make trouble again.

505
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,200
That doesn't sound nice.

506
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,120
I'm striving.

507
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,600
I was striving before too.

508
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,160
I was making money, wasn't I, Dad?

509
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,560
No matter how much it was.

510
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,400
It was probably just bad luck

511
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,760
that many things

512
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,120
just got interrupted.

513
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,880
This time is different.

514
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,320
This time I have strong motivation,

515
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,040
and my goal is very clear.

516
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,600
The goal is to buy a villa for 200,000.

517
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,560
I need to improve

518
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,840
the living environment for the children.

519
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,040
So I will have strong motivation.

520
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,160
If you call this making trouble,

521
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,560
at least it's trouble for a good cause, right?

522
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,800
Fine, you can go ahead.

523
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,640
But take it easy.

524
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,280
What do you mean by 'easy'?

525
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,320
If you have 200,000,

526
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,040
use 20,000 for your venture.

527
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,000
If you have 300,000,

528
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,600
use 30,000 for your venture.

529
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,720
Don't hurt yourself.

530
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,320
Do a good job.

531
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,880
Getting a tattoo?

532
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,800
What design are you thinking of?

533
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,220
Fierce Tiger Climbing Mountain,

534
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,420
King of Hell's Three-Point Hand,

535
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,240
Tyrant Breaking Reins,

536
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,080
Take your pick.

537
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,760
Very abstract. Suits me.

538
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,880
This way please. Lie down.

539
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,010
Let me get ready.

540
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,000
Your brother Cui told me

541
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,960
your tattoo skills are cool,

542
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,120
but you keep getting beaten up.

543
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,050
He asked me to teach you some moves.

544
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,240
You must be Hongwei.

545
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
That's me.

546
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,760
It's not about my skills.

547
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,170
It's mainly because

548
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,640
I often have different artistic interpretations

549
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,160
from my customers.

550
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,160
What do you want to learn?

551
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,320
To what extent?

552
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,880
Is there something

553
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,080
that can take down

554
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,560
someone instantly?

555
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,240
There is,

556
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,040
but if you

557
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,520
mess up someone's tattoo

558
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,320
and then

559
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,650
you end up killing them,

560
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,480
is that appropriate?

561
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,320
It's not.

562
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,560
I don't need to kill them.

563
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Just need to make them submit.

564
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,890
That won't work either.

565
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,560
This technique...

566
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,600
My master never

567
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,560
taught it to me.

568
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,640
Do you know why?

569
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,040
Because all of us disciples

570
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,320
are impulsive

571
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,160
and reckless.

572
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,560
May I ask who your master is?

573
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,320
Must be from our provincial sports team, right?

574
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,400
Do you know the

575
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,280
Red Flag Bathhouse on Seventh Street?

576
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,160
Yes, I do.

577
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,040
I've been getting scrubbed there since I was little.

578
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,000
My master

579
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,720
is the bath attendant there.

580
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,160
Wait.

581
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,760
So did you learn how to scrub backs

582
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,040
or martial arts from him?

583
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,560
I know how to scrub backs too.

584
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,240
I could teach you that instead.

585
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,480
It's much easier than learning kung fu.

586
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,560
When your shop goes under,

587
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,160
you can work at the bathhouse

588
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,360
and still make a living. How about that?

589
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,090
Do you actually know any martial arts?

590
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,280
Do you know Hu Fengsan?

591
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,560
I know Hu Hansan.

592
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,560
Though their names differ by just one character.

593
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,000
Hu Fengsan

594
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
was a great hero.

595
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,640
In his thirties, he was known as

596
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,000
the number one fighter in Manchuria.

597
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,480
During the Guangxu era, in Fengtian,

598
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,360
he established the Dachuanjiu Escort Agency.

599
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,400
During the Republic era,

600
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,320
he was the chief instructor for 300,000 Fengtian troops.

601
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,800
Even General Zhang's son

602
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,400
had to learn boxing from him.

603
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,280
After the September 18th Incident,

604
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,210
he eliminated countless traitors in the Northeast.

605
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,260
That's truly impressive.

606
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,660
But what does that have to do with you?

607
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,080
He was my master's master.

608
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,080
If your master was so formidable,

609
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,410
why was he scrubbing backs at a bathhouse?

610
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,720
What else could he do?

611
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,520
After the founding of the People's Republic,

612
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,960
there were no more escort agencies.

613
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,800
What's all this talk about fighting?

614
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,360
He's a martial artist.

615
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,120
His appetite is enormous.

616
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,240
Only this bathhouse

617
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,440
can provide him with a satisfying meal.

618
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,840
Your master might have

619
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,500
even scrubbed my back before.

620
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,580
It's possible.

621
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,760
Back when we were training in martial arts,

622
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,420
it was incredibly difficult.

623
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Back then, we spent

624
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,160
three years just practicing footwork.

625
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,360
But I'll never have the talent of Xiao Cui's brother-in-law,

626
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,600
Huo Dongfeng.

627
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,640
My master's kung fu skills

628
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,440
were absolutely unparalleled.

629
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,160
But in my entire life,

630
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,320
I never saw him

631
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,640
fight against anyone.

632
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,480
Got any water? I'm thirsty.

633
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
No.

634
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,320
If Chinese kung fu is so powerful,

635
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,360
why are all those boxing champions

636
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,320
and such mostly Black people?

637
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,240
Boxing is a combat sport

638
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,240
that requires strict adherence to competition rules

639
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,720
to win. It's different from Chinese kung fu.

640
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,040
For thousands of years,

641
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,040
China has maintained millions of square kilometers of territory.

642
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,600
You think that happened by accident?

643
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,400
Of course not.

644
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,090
But Chinese kung fu can't be that magical, right?

645
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,600
It's fine if you don't believe it.

646
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,240
I should get back to work at the fish market anyway.

647
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,100
That's it then.

648
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,720
No, brother, we're just

649
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
We're just...

650
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
We're just having a chat, aren't we?

651
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,240
Are you okay?

652
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,400
My friend, I...

653
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,520
What happened to you?

654
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,780
Did you hurt yourself?

655
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,800
Master!

656
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,560
No, no, no.

657
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,600
I wasn't even

658
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,040
using my full strength.

659
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,880
This is just my basic skill.

660
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,520
Please get up, quickly.

661
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,530
Whether you admit it or not,

662
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,800
from now on, you're my master.

663
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,480
Keep your voice down.

664
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,880
Don't let others hear. It's embarrassing.

665
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,320
Alright, I'll teach you one move.

666
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,840
I'll stand over here.

667
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,480
Please show me again.

668
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,410
Come on, Master.

669
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,320
This is called 'Fierce Tiger Climbing the Mountain.'

670
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,240
Back in the day, my ancestor

671
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,120
used this very move

672
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,920
to defeat everyone in the world.

673
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
Watch carefully.

674
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,760
The final move:

675
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,360
Strike!

676
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,160
Retract!

677
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,680
Practice this 5,000 times a day.

678
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,980
I'll check on your progress in two weeks.

679
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,880
How many times?

680
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,720
5,000 times.

681
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,520
Just these few moves?

682
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,040
Yes.

683
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,280
If you want to practice 10,000 times,

684
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
that's fine too.

685
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,520
Wait, just these few moves,

686
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,400
5,000 times?

687
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,530
Do you know how many times I practiced?

688
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,320
How many?

689
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,060
Millions of times.

690
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,640
Let's go.

691
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,360
Like a tiger climbing a steep mountain.

692
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,160
Trust me. Just a few trips

693
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,020
and we'll earn enough for a villa.

694
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,000
Suihe.

695
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,360
Does Dad know?

696
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,480
Yes. He supports me.

697
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
20,000.

698
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Just 20,000.

699
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,520
Not a penny more.

700
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,400
Take it or

701
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,240
leave it.

702
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,280
30,000.

703
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,800
Are you haggling like you're buying clothes?

704
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,080
It's just a professional habit.

705
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,880
Just 20,000.

706
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
25,000. Final offer.

707
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,480
Let's not argue anymore.

708
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,120
Not a cent more.

709
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,960
20,000.

710
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,460
Tiger climbing mountain.

711
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,540
What's wrong with him?

712
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,040
He's afraid customers will beat him up.

713
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,560
So he wants to learn martial arts.

714
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,000
They say too much martial arts practice

715
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,130
can drive you crazy.

716
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,400
I think he's already a bit...

717
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,240
He definitely won't.

718
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,040
It's just because he has no customers.

719
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,880
He's bored.

720
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,530
How much longer do you think his shop can survive?

721
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,440
That depends on how much money he has saved.

722
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,520
Stop asking.

723
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
I can't even pay next month's rent.

724
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,040
He practices all day like this.

725
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,280
His back aches and legs hurt from all the training.

726
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,080
Every few days,

727
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,400
he has to come to my place for a massage

728
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,480
and cupping therapy.

729
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,210
That costs him even more money.

730
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,780
That's why he should learn to be a bath attendant

731
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,480
instead of martial arts.

732
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,920
By the way, next month

733
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,320
I need to go to Suihe.

734
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,160
Going alone

735
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
to do business

736
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,000
makes me a bit nervous.

737
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,260
Could you come with me?

738
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,120
Look at my Chinese medicine clinic.

739
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,240
Business is booming right now.

740
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,760
I really can't get away.

741
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,680
This is really troublesome.

742
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,820
Why not take Dada with you?

743
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
Are you crazy?

744
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
You want me dead?

745
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,810
Doesn't he know some moves?

746
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,600
What are you talking about?

747
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
You seem so happy.

748
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,400
No, no.

749
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,760
We were just

750
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,120
happy about your progress in martial arts.

751
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,360
Brother, hit me.

752
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,080
Too fast!

753
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,540
No, you're asking me to...

754
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,400
Just pat me.

755
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,000
Go ahead, pat me.

756
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,560
Okay.

757
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,520
Alright.

758
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,320
Pretty fast, right?

759
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,080
What do you think? Isn't that fast?

760
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,960
Fast! Amazing!

761
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,720
Not bad, right?

762
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,320
Guoming.

763
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,160
Master.

764
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,640
I still prefer this one.

765
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,320
Take it off for me later.

766
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,120
Sure.

767
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,240
Master.

768
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,260
How's it going?

769
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,800
At least 5,000 times a day.

770
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,800
Don't believe me? Ask Cui and Liu.

771
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,160
Show me one.

772
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,940
Fierce Tiger Climbing Mountain!

773
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,660
What on earth are you practicing?

774
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,330
Is this how I taught you?

775
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,690
You're disgracing our school!

776
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,600
When you go out there,

777
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,520
don't tell anyone I was your teacher.

778
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,080
What nonsense is this?

779
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,760
But...

780
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,400
aren't we doing the same thing?

781
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,720
How could they be the same?

782
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,650
You should just learn to be a bath attendant instead.

783
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,560
You're driving me crazy!

784
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,560
If there's any detail I'm doing wrong, please tell me.

785
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,960
Or you could teach me something practical.

786
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,080
What could I teach you?

787
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,740
You wouldn't learn it anyway.

788
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,600
In the old days,

789
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,560
masters would teach their apprentices

790
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,420
something like stunts or tricks.

791
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,520
Like...

792
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,360
such as...

793
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,120
breaking bricks with their heads,

794
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,520
smashing stones on their chests, things like that.

795
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,400
If they ran out of money,

796
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,040
they could perform on the streets.

797
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,760
Just in case they had nothing to eat,

798
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,890
they could earn some money to survive.

799
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,120
But to learn this,

800
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,600
the most important thing is

801
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,800
not being afraid of pain.

802
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,080
It's similar to martial arts

803
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,280
but it's not exactly that.

804
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,080
Want to learn?

805
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,360
No, no.

806
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,720
You...

807
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,080
You want to teach him this?

808
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,240
It's not necessary.

809
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,600
This is something I can do.

810
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,640
I brought you some clothes. I'll leave them here.

811
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,480
Thanks.

812
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,320
I've never been afraid of pain since I was little.

813
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,380
Then let's do this.

814
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,040
This one.

815
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,170
Alright, let me show you how it's done.

816
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,120
Master, you're amazing!

817
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,560
I want to learn this.

818
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,840
I just took one extra bite of your popsicle.

819
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,000
Do you really need to insult me like this?

820
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You call that one bite?

821
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,320
You ate my whole popsicle in one bite!

822
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Let's take him to the hospital.

823
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,820
He's still breathing.

824
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
Let's wait for my uncle to come back.

825
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,280
Is this

826
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,960
a codebook?

827
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,650
It really is a codebook.

828
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,960
Could it be

829
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,360
he's a spy?

830
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,280
You're overthinking this.

831
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,090
Let's report this quickly,

832
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,239
this old spy.

833
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,000
This is a phone book.

834
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,880
Look at it yourself,

835
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,480
these are all phone numbers.

836
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,960
Then what does this diagram mean?

837
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,679
Two sheep. That's er-yang.

838
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,239
That's sheep. Give it to me now.

839
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,530
What's going on?

840
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,560
Do you know

841
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,719
Huo Dongfeng?

842
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,080
Take a look at this.

843
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,880
I was

844
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,920
in reform with Huo Dongfeng.

845
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,960
I was released yesterday.

846
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,610
He still has one month before his release.

847
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,840
And he asked me to find you.

848
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,560
Does he need something in there?

849
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,480
He doesn't need anything in there.

850
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,760
He asked me to come

851
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,740
to tell you something.

852
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,570
He said when he comes back, he wants to open

853
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,040
a big restaurant.

854
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,240
I mean

855
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,480
a really huge one.

856
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,960
He said

857
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,560
it needs to be at least a thousand square meters.

858
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,640
He wants you to help find a location.

859
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,240
And he wants you to

860
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,360
help find some good chefs.

861
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,720
Says you know a lot of people.

862
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,700
Anything else?

863
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,120
What else is there?

864
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,400
Let me think... oh right.

865
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,760
He said when he comes back this time,

866
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,800
he won't cause any more trouble.

867
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,860
He's determined to make this business successful.

868
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,480
Why doesn't he just

869
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,280
take over the whole country while he's at it?

870
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,240
Opening a big restaurant?

871
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,040
Where would he get the money?

872
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,640
He said he has a buddy called

873
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,400
Hongwei.

874
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,080
Says he's been working at the fish market

875
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,680
and made quite a bit of money.

876
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,760
Why do you sound so weak?

877
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,520
Are you sick?

878
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,720
No, it's just that

879
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,720
I haven't eaten since I was released

880
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,280
yesterday morning.

881
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,980
You're back just in time. Come on,

882
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,780
I'll take him to get something to eat.

883
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,970
Watch the store.

884
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,120
Who is that?

885
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,600
Would you like some vegetarian dishes?

886
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,880
No, no. Nothing vegetarian.

887
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,210
It's too plain in there.

888
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,760
Don't rush. Take your time.

889
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,560
Who was that man who left with your dad?

890
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,690
I don't know. He just got out of prison,

891
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,500
from the same prison as my dad.

892
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,720
What the hell?

893
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,920
Oh my goodness!

894
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Alright, you all should go play now.

895
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,040
Water.

896
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,920
Okay.

897
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,400
Is Huo Dongfeng still in there?

898
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,200
How's he doing? Is he alright?

899
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,600
Huo Dongfeng?

900
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,360
He's a good man.

901
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,360
He never bullies people.

902
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,820
He specifically deals with the strong ones.

903
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,450
Never picks on the weak.

904
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,560
That's him.

905
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,160
So how did you end up in there?

906
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,600
It's embarrassing to talk about.

907
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,200
Come.

908
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,520
I was pedaling my cart.

909
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,880
I'd only been in the city for a couple of days.

910
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,600
You know, all these city rules.

911
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,060
I didn't understand them.

912
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,520
A traffic cop stopped me.

913
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,980
I didn't accept it.

914
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,560
So I got into a fight with him.

915
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,160
We both tumbled into a ditch.

916
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,000
After that, I was sent to labor camp.

917
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,440
It's my fault.

918
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,400
I'm not educated.

919
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,760
Those traffic lights in the city.

920
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,120
What those signs mean.

921
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,400
How would I know?

922
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,360
Fighting with the police?

923
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,680
Of course you'd end up inside.

924
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,210
I deserved that labor camp.

925
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,760
Now that you're out,

926
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,000
what do you plan to do?

927
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,000
Huo Dongfeng

928
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,360
told me when I got out

929
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,520
to find Hongwei.

930
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,000
Said I could help move fish at his place.

931
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,920
Deliver fish with my cart.

932
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,240
I may not be educated,

933
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,440
but I've got plenty of strength.

934
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,000
For hard labor in our village,

935
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,360
nobody can beat me.

936
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,520
In my village,

937
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,180
they all call me Liu the Brute.

938
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,680
Really.

939
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,940
When pedaling my cart,

940
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,320
I can go over 30 miles without getting winded.

941
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,160
Put a 200-pound package on my back,

942
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,890
and I'll run with it, I tell you.

943
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,740
Don't go to Hongwei's.

944
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,160
Why not?

945
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,560
If you go looking for Hongwei,

946
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,200
you'll end up back inside soon enough.

947
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,040
But...

948
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,520
Then...

949
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,600
what am I supposed to do now that I'm out?

950
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,880
I need to do something.

951
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,120
Until Huo Dongfeng gets out,

952
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,570
you can work with me.

953
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,960
Great.

954
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,760
I've met a good brother.

955
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,440
Who's that lady in red?

956
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,240
My wife.

957
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,920
Brother Liu.

958
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,090
Hello, Mrs. Cui.

959
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,260
He's Huo Dongfeng's prison mate.

960
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,250
I'm taking him to

961
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,440
Suihe

962
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,850
to start a business.

963
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,770
See you later, Brother Liu.

964
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,370
You must be rich now.

965
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
Starting businesses with ex-cons.

966
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,220
I finally mastered it.

967
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,560
I finally mastered it.

968
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,960
Congratulations!

969
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,720
Brother Cui.

970
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,680
Brother Hongwei.

971
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,600
I've mastered it.

972
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,480
Let go of me.

973
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,080
No way.

974
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:11,680
Will you let go?

975
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,720
If I let go, will you still hit me?

976
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
Just wait and see if I hit you or not.

977
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,720
Give me that feather duster.

978
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,200
Give it back to me.

979
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:15,960
I'm holding it down.

980
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,840
You want me to give it to you so you can hit me?

981
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,000
Watch me teach you a lesson.

982
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,040
Go ahead. How will you do that?

983
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,000
Look at the kind of people you hang out with all day.

984
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,160
Who are you always with?

985
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,560
Ex-cons, Dada,

986
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,640
street thugs, drifters,

987
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
what kind of people are they?

988
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,040
You're always with them.

989
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,400
Why are you labeling people?

990
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,320
What's wrong with ex-cons?

991
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,680
They're actually quite kind.

992
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,810
You're nice to them,

993
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,360
but not to me and Mengmeng.

994
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:33,890
Alright.

995
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,400
So annoying.

996
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,720
I wasn't finished talking.

997
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,560
Go on, speak.

998
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,240
Don't hang out with them anymore.

999
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,760
Okay.

1000
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,560
Are you done?

1001
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,200
Are you finished?

1002
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,400
Yes, I'm done.

1003
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,000
Good.

1004
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,040
Then let's prepare the shipment.

1005
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,640
We'll be there in three days.

1006
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,680
Okay.

1007
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,520
Brother Cui.

1008
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,200
I sold my shop to Liu Ye.

1009
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,440
That's good.

1010
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,520
Why aren't you surprised at all?

1011
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,280
I'd only be surprised if your shop didn't fail.

1012
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,040
So my martial arts training wasn't wasted.

1013
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,560
You can do something else in the future.

1014
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,960
You can still use your martial arts skills.

1015
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,000
I want to go to Suihe with you.

1016
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,960
To do business.

1017
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,520
What can you do?

1018
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,680
Bodyguard. I know martial arts.

1019
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,040
You'd better protect yourself first.

1020
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,080
My wife is coming back soon.

1021
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,040
I really want to go to Suihe with you.

1022
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,640
Wife.

1023
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,290
Sister-in-law.

1024
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,360
What's he doing here again?

1025
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,000
He wants to go to Suihe with me.

1026
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,930
Absolutely not.

1027
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,840
Understood.

1028
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,780
Smells good. Here.

1029
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,040
I can certainly eat a lot.

1030
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,480
But don't worry.

1031
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,720
All this money I'm eating through,

1032
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,240
I'll earn back double for you.

1033
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,640
Even if you don't, I'll still feed you well.

1034
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,660
I definitely will.

1035
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
For over 40 years,

1036
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,640
the farthest I've ever traveled

1037
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,360
was just from the village

1038
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,560
to the city.

1039
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,600
I never dreamed

1040
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,560
that you would take me

1041
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,890
to such a faraway place.

1042
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,540
I'm truly blessed because of you.

1043
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,520
When we make money,

1044
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,560
you can eat meat sticks every day.

1045
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,960
I don't need meat sticks.

1046
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,240
A pancake will do.

1047
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,410
Why are you here?

1048
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,000
Suihe is a border city.

1049
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,920
It's very close to Russia.

1050
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,920
Although Russia's economy isn't doing well now,

1051
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,200
their artistic aesthetics

1052
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,330
are undoubtedly worth learning from.

1053
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,280
So,

1054
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,800
I plan to go with you guys

1055
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,720
to Suihe

1056
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,160
to communicate with international friends

1057
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,160
about tattoo art.

1058
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,320
Combining Eastern and Western styles

1059
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,180
to become a master tattoo artist.

1060
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,360
You still haven't given up on this idea?

1061
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,960
If I gave up my life's dream

1062
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,760
because of this little setback,

1063
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,800
what would I have left to pursue?
