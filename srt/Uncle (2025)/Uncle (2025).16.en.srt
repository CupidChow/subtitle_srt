1
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,000
What's going on here?

2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,920
Xiaoxue's dog

3
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,080
killed my turtle.

4
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,090
Can't you just buy another one?

5
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,440
I want the one that died.

6
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,810
He said my dad is a rapist and murderer.

7
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,880
He said my dog is just like my dad.

8
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,680
Of course they're not the same.

9
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,240
They're different.

10
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Your dad is in prison.

11
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,860
My pigeons died of fright.

12
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,880
Why should your dog kill my turtle?

13
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,080
It wasn't on purpose.

14
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,360
Your dad is a rapist and murderer.

15
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,880
No,

16
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
my dad is not.

17
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,479
Isn't your dad in prison too?

18
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,850
Just saying.

19
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,160
Stop talking.

20
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,240
This is my home.

21
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,520
Xiaoxue.

22
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,280
Remember, your father

23
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,329
is not a rapist or murderer.

24
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,410
No matter what anyone says.

25
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,880
This is an unchangeable fact.

26
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,079
Then why

27
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,800
hasn't my father been released yet?

28
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,360
Justice

29
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,260
may be delayed sometimes,

30
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,040
but it never fails to arrive.

31
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,770
What does that mean?

32
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,079
Just take it literally for now.

33
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:58,920
I heard

34
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,520
your grades recently

35
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,650
have dropped even below Erpang's.

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,200
It's because of all this trouble with your father, isn't it?

37
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,330
My classmates talk about me every day.

38
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,960
Don't cry, Xiaoxue.

39
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,440
You need to be strong.

40
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,120
You need to become strong yourself.

41
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,160
How can I be strong?

42
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,160
Improve your grades.

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,240
For a student,

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,720
good grades mean strength.

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,680
Once your grades improve,

46
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,960
you can tell those who bully you,

47
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,800
those who speak ill of your father,

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,329
you can tell them directly.

49
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,280
You can say,

50
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,880
'What do your fathers do?

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,720
Your fathers are so outstanding,

52
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,600
so why aren't your grades

53
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,840
as good as mine?'

54
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,160
You know what?

55
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,400
My expectations for your academic performance

56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,000
are far higher than for Mengmeng and Erpang.

57
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,260
I wanted to become a lawyer

58
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,640
mainly to defend your father.

59
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,280
But now I can't become a lawyer.

60
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,560
You can.

61
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,660
Through your efforts,

62
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,840
you can get into China University of Political Science and Law,

63
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,440
become an excellent lawyer,

64
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,040
or even a judge.

65
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,960
By then,

66
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,839
you can personally defend your father.

67
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,570
Do you look forward to that day?

68
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Why do I need to go to college

69
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,000
to get my dad out?

70
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,360
Why?

71
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,920
No,

72
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,680
No, Xiaoxue.

73
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,159
I was just giving an example.

74
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,680
Maybe your father will be released tomorrow.

75
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,200
Don't cry, Xiaoxue.

76
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,960
That's not what I meant.

77
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Have a popsicle.

78
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,560
I don't want it.

79
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,690
Don't overthink it.

80
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,240
I really didn't mean it that way, Xiaoxue.

81
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,760
That's not what you meant?

82
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,980
Stop crying, Xiaoxue.

83
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,680
Have a popsicle. It's getting cold.

84
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,120
Woof! Woof! Woof!

85
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,880
I'll get you!

86
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,610
I'm gonna kill you, stupid dog!

87
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,000
Dad,

88
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
where's Guoming?

89
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,240
I'm here.

90
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,000
So,

91
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,040
how was Suihe?

92
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,410
How much money did you make?

93
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,920
Then when

94
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,360
are you planning

95
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,490
to go to Suihe again?

96
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,880
I'm not going.

97
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,760
Business isn't good.

98
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,960
Isn't your clothing store doing well?

99
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,159
Yes, but

100
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,480
I don't want to spend my whole life

101
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,080
trapped in this clothing store.

102
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,210
You're always thinking the grass is greener elsewhere.

103
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,159
Didn't you always tell me when I was young

104
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,720
that there are always higher mountains to climb?

105
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,920
So isn't it normal for me to look around?

106
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,440
Fine, let's leave it at that.

107
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,120
Anyway, I think just running this clothing store

108
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,920
I can still afford to buy a villa.

109
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,800
Is Er Pang's father getting out soon?

110
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,760
Yes, after he gets out

111
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,440
he wants to open a big restaurant

112
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,840
just like our Dingqing Restaurant

113
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,970
of the same caliber.

114
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,720
How could he have that much money in prison?

115
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,200
He doesn't have money in there.

116
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,720
His brothers are all outside

117
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
He's well-connected.

118
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,600
His business is still running outside

119
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,520
being managed for him

120
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,320
making money.

121
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,800
By the way,

122
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,000
I was thinking

123
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,780
would you like to be a manager for him?

124
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,610
What?

125
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,360
Me, be his manager?

126
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,840
No.

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,930
I'm afraid I'll end up back in jail.

128
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,720
Don't worry.

129
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,640
He's not a bad person.

130
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,960
It would be good for you to go.

131
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,360
You can keep an eye on the restaurant

132
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,000
and on him too, right?

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,960
Maybe before you know it

134
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,290
the whole family will become successful.

135
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,280
If he gets out and goes back in

136
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Er Pang should just

137
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,920
sever ties with him.

138
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,880
And you too.

139
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,120
If he commits another crime

140
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,680
you must cut ties with him as well.

141
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,280
I don't have any relationship with him anyway.

142
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,800
Think about the manager position.

143
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,160
I definitely won't go.

144
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,840
Here's what we'll do.

145
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,560
You should

146
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,960
go find our former

147
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,400
Chef Zhang or Chef Zhao.

148
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,240
If either one of them goes

149
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,720
the food

150
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,320
will definitely be excellent.

151
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,960
Anyway,

152
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,000
I won't go.

153
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,160
Your suggestion

154
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,680
is very good.

155
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,840
Okay.

156
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,450
Why didn't you answer my calls?

157
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,640
Let's talk.

158
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,680
Even if I answered your call,

159
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,680
it would be the same old story.

160
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,440
What's the current situation

161
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,320
with Guo Dapao?

162
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,980
What do you expect?

163
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,440
Another case rejection

164
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,400
for further investigation.

165
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,080
It's been rejected so many times.

166
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,760
Why haven't they released him yet?

167
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,200
How would I know?

168
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,760
You're always cornering me

169
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,760
asking about this case.

170
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,640
My boss already knows

171
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,040
that we were classmates.

172
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,400
To avoid any conflict of interest,

173
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,000
they've removed me from the special case team.

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,880
If you keep coming to me,

175
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,120
I'll probably get transferred to public security.

176
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,960
Anything else?

177
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,440
If not, I'm leaving.

178
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,680
Yes. I want to ask you,

179
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,520
do you think Guo Dapao would commit murder?

180
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,800
There's no clear evidence.

181
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,120
Don't give me that official talk.

182
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,600
I'm asking for your personal opinion.

183
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,250
At first I thought he did it,

184
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,920
but later I changed my mind.

185
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,600
If he really did it,

186
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,840
he wouldn't have recanted

187
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,880
his confession over and over.

188
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,520
He's not that tough.

189
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,680
Go talk to your boss.

190
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,320
Tell your boss your position

191
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,400
and what you think.

192
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,480
I've already spoken to my boss.

193
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,600
If I bring it up again,

194
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,530
he'll definitely transfer me out.

195
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,840
Didn't you take the bar exam?

196
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,840
This case will go to court sooner or later.

197
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,520
Why don't you represent him?

198
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,600
We're only responsible for gathering evidence,

199
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,730
not for sentencing.

200
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,480
What's wrong?

201
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,520
You didn't pass?

202
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,880
That can't be. You're so smart.

203
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,340
How could I possibly fail?

204
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,240
Good.

205
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,320
Then defend him and do a good job.

206
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,720
I have something else to do.

207
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,650
I'm leaving now.

208
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,680
Xiaozhi's baby teeth haven't fully grown in yet,

209
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,210
and you're giving him this?

210
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,600
Then you eat it.

211
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,050
That's exactly what I like to hear.

212
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,560
So this time when you went to Suihe,

213
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,680
how was business?

214
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,840
When are you going back?

215
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,300
I'm not going back for now.

216
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,240
Really?

217
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,200
You must have a new target then.

218
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,530
Where are you planning to hustle next?

219
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,720
I've been studying stamps lately.

220
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,520
These stamps,

221
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,680
you can make good money trading them.

222
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,760
Your unwavering hustle

223
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,040
is truly remarkable.

224
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,000
By the way,

225
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,640
last time

226
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,720
you asked me

227
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,440
to help you find

228
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,760
a larger storefront.

229
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,280
I actually found one,

230
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,960
and you're familiar with it.

231
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,760
Where?

232
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,600
What a coincidence.

233
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,760
I never expected

234
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,500
that the first person to buy my bar

235
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,080
would be you, Cui.

236
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,880
Such a nice place.

237
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,860
Why are you selling it?

238
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,720
Business is good,

239
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,640
but

240
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,880
it's just too stressful to manage.

241
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,600
I'm not running a bar here,

242
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,330
it's more like a fighting club.

243
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,400
Even as a woman,

244
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,680
I can't handle this anymore.

245
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,880
The other day,

246
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,800
the police station said

247
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,760
they would station

248
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,120
a patrol car outside my door permanently.

249
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,880
Tell me,

250
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,400
how am I supposed to continue my business?

251
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,880
So what are you planning to do next?

252
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
I'm thinking while I'm still young,

253
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,040
I should try my luck in the south.

254
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,440
You're leaving?

255
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,640
Yes.

256
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,760
So you want

257
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,840
to take over this place for a night club?

258
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,640
No.

259
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,600
It's kind of my brother-in-law.

260
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,260
He wants to open a restaurant.

261
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,680
Brother-in-law is brother-in-law.

262
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,520
What do you mean 'kind of'?

263
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,080
I'm just trying

264
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
to be precise.

265
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,730
It's a bit complicated.

266
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,680
My brother-in-law and my sister

267
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,880
haven't gotten their marriage certificate yet.

268
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
He went to prison.

269
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,610
But they have a child together.

270
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,200
After he got out,

271
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,440
he wanted to marry my sister,

272
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,970
but she was already abroad.

273
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,770
It's all about fate.

274
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Maybe it wasn't meant to be for them.

275
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,920
If it wasn't meant to be,

276
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,160
how did they end up with a child?

277
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
My wife and I

278
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,050
raised the child together.

279
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,160
Well, since you're the one taking over,

280
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,600
we can work out the financial details.

281
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,400
Good.

282
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,400
However,

283
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,220
this place isn't mine.

284
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,960
When your brother-in-law comes,

285
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,820
he'll need to meet with the owner.

286
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,280
Alright.

287
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,840
Transferring my shop

288
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,800
to your brother-in-law.

289
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,880
This is also fate.

290
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,890
What are you looking at?

291
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,520
That Manager Yang,

292
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,400
does she like you?

293
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,200
I don't feel that way at all.

294
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,480
I can totally tell.

295
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,060
She definitely likes you.

296
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,520
Since she likes you so much,

297
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,200
couldn't we get

298
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,000
at least a 20% discount at her store?

299
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,840
Dream on.

300
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,120
She's mentioned it five or six times already.

301
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,240
Fate, fate, fate.

302
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,440
Honestly,

303
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,280
are you interested in her?

304
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,080
Not at all.

305
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,960
Alright, I have an idea.

306
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,880
When your brother gets out,

307
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,320
let's introduce them to each other.

308
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,400
That's my brother-in-law.

309
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,860
You're really something.

310
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,360
So it's settled then.

311
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,800
Brother.

312
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,480
Brother.

313
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,760
Brother.

314
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,360
You haven't changed much.

315
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,560
Still looking great.

316
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,960
Let me buy you a drink

317
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,090
to welcome you back.

318
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,040
I can't.

319
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,940
I need to go check on my son.

320
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,000
Of course, you should.

321
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,530
Alright.

322
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,600
We'll talk again tonight.

323
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,660
I'll walk you home.

324
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,260
I won't go out tonight either.

325
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,770
I'm done with that life.

326
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,000
This time I'm really quitting the game.

327
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,090
That's good.

328
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,640
It's better that way.

329
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,120
Brother, I...

330
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,560
Actually, I want to quit too.

331
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,440
If only I didn't have so many brothers under me.

332
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
I'm quitting too.

333
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,760
Let's get in the car first.

334
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,400
We can talk inside.

335
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,930
Let's go.

336
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,480
Ermei.

337
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,300
You value loyalty.

338
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,560
I think you're a good person.

339
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,140
I knew you'd come to pick me up.

340
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,280
I'm really happy about that.

341
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,090
I'll head back with Hongwei first.

342
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,680
You...

343
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,120
What are you talking about?

344
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,680
This isn't like you at all.

345
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,400
I've taught her well.

346
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's go.

347
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,040
Brother, um...

348
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,560
Didn't you want to open that restaurant?

349
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,680
Do you have enough money?

350
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,040
Money...

351
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,760
How's the business at the fish market?

352
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,560
Not bad.

353
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,880
Not bad.

354
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,520
Isn't it the job you found for me?

355
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,600
Is there enough money to open the restaurant?

356
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,160
Almost.

357
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,400
Almost.

358
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,530
Don't worry.

359
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,880
I'll definitely tell you if anything comes up.

360
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,680
Go home now.

361
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,880
Let's go.

362
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,360
Brother,

363
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,100
just let me know if you need anything.

364
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,280
This barbecue place has changed to hot pot.

365
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,880
The owner has changed too.

366
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,120
The previous owner

367
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
took my advice

368
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,000
and started a business in the south.

369
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,760
Here, brother.

370
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,090
Everything's changed.

371
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,480
Erpang,

372
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,140
have a drink with your father.

373
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
Have you changed?

374
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,760
I haven't changed.

375
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
How did you get that injury on your face?

376
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,570
Did you get into a fight?

377
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,120
Wang Ning.

378
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,720
He always bullies me.

379
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,600
Can't you talk things out properly?

380
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,860
Can you stop fighting?

381
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,920
Be a law-abiding citizen.

382
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,320
Become someone useful to society.

383
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,680
Dad, I didn't break any laws.

384
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,120
You're growing up.

385
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,680
Isn't fighting a crime?

386
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,680
You must adopt the right attitude toward rehabilitation.

387
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,280
Understand your rehabilitation goals.

388
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,810
And follow proper rehabilitation behavior.

389
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,240
You must reflect on your past.

390
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,440
Take control of your present.

391
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,700
Move toward tomorrow.

392
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,360
Raise the sails of your life.

393
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,370
And head toward the shore of rebirth. [Clapping]

394
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:22,880
That's enough.

395
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,240
Brother.

396
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,080
Now that we're out, let's adapt to this new world.

397
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,680
Alright?

398
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,720
Let's not talk about what happened inside.

399
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,960
Okay.

400
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,320
One misstep doesn't mean eternal regret.

401
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,000
Today...

402
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,880
Drink and be merry today.

403
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,920
Tomorrow there's no wine, just empty cabinets.

404
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,360
Side inscription: Drink till you drop!

405
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,120
Cheers!

406
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,200
Erpang, I really want to slap you.

407
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
But as I just said,

408
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,460
I don't hit people.

409
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,320
Today I pledge

410
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,440
to become a new man.

411
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,320
The old Huo Dongfeng is dead.

412
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,520
The Huo Dongfeng sitting before you today

413
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,320
is a ghost!

414
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,840
The old Huo Dongfeng

415
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,680
was a bad example for Erpang.

416
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,450
The future Huo Dongfeng

417
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,280
will definitely be a positive role model.

418
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,839
Good!

419
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,760
Well said!

420
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
I'll drink it all.

421
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,119
You guys do as you please.

422
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,480
Where did you learn these bad habits?

423
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,410
Alright, alright. Just take a sip.

424
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,000
Yesterday I was full of sin,

425
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,359
ruining my bright future.

426
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Today I submit to discipline,

427
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,079
completely transform myself,

428
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,200
and become a better person.

429
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,880
Right. Let's eat.

430
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,600
Let's eat, bro.

431
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,040
Waiter!

432
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,600
Yes, we'll have

433
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,480
those boneless chicken feet.

434
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,440
After we eat,

435
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,080
we'll go to your

436
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,160
new shop to take a look.

437
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,120
Okay?

438
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,120
The price

439
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,360
is fixed.

440
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,050
It won't change no matter who rents it.

441
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,480
Which one of you wants to rent my place?

442
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,200
My brother.

443
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,200
Your surname?

444
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,760
Huo.

445
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,840
Huo Dongfeng.

446
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,280
Huo Dongfeng?

447
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,120
You're Huo Dongfeng?

448
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,200
I thought you looked familiar.

449
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,680
Do you remember me?

450
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,840
I'm Tian San.

451
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,080
I'm sorry.

452
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
We're the same age and class.

453
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,130
I also went to No. 27 Middle School.

454
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,480
When we were 17 or 18,

455
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,640
you beat me up at the Red Flag Cinema.

456
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,080
I'm really sorry about that.

457
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,880
It's fine.

458
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,560
Who remembers childhood fights anyway?

459
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,480
So now,

460
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,560
that guy who used to follow you around,

461
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,560
are you still in touch with Er Mei?

462
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,200
Yes, we are.

463
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,240
He picked me up when I got out.

464
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,080
He's definitely a big brother,

465
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,890
respected everywhere.

466
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,720
When two sides are fighting to death,

467
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,800
just one call from him

468
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,130
and they turn hostility into friendship.

469
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,920
I know.

470
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,480
What's this?

471
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,800
Opening a restaurant?

472
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,800
Yes,

473
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,880
we're looking for a location.

474
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
This place of mine

475
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,170
is definitely a prime spot.

476
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,930
I can't give anyone a discount.

477
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,040
But for you,

478
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,680
I must offer a good price.

479
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,840
Thank you.

480
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,560
This toy is expensive.

481
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,240
It cost over 20,000.

482
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
And all that's left is this powder gun.

483
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,160
Yeah.

484
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,880
At least you got a powder gun.

485
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,360
I got nothing left from that pinhole glasses project.

486
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:17,960
What?

487
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,840
Are you waiting for me to praise you?

488
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,920
Sometimes praise is deserved.

489
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,400
So we're not applying for that patent anymore?

490
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,200
No, we're not.

491
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,320
You're definitely not messing with that gear-shifting bicycle anymore?

492
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,640
No more.

493
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,400
What's the point?

494
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,720
We don't even have a lathe.

495
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,920
Well, in that case,

496
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,520
I should give you some praise.

497
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,840
Finally, one less project to waste time on.

498
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,800
Right. It's pointless.

499
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,320
Just a waste of time and money.

500
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:38,960
But what about

501
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,490
that stamp collection idea

502
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,760
I told you about? What do you think?

503
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,920
You want to mess with stamps now?

504
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,850
And IC cards too.

505
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,040
Hello?

506
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,200
Hey, Cui.

507
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,920
It's Tian San.

508
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,680
Hello.

509
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,720
Are you free now?

510
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,280
Can I treat you to dinner?

511
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,040
Dinner?

512
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,080
Yes.

513
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,520
I have something to discuss with you.

514
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,960
What is it? About renting a place?

515
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,400
There's something else too.

516
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,080
Good news.

517
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,620
Are you available?

518
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,330
I'm free.

519
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,720
Sure.

520
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,400
Xinji Seafood at 6 PM.

521
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,080
Be there or be square.

522
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,560
Okay.

523
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,930
What's this about renting?

524
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,360
What are you up to now?

525
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,160
Don't worry.

526
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,220
Erpang's father wants to rent a place

527
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,520
to open a restaurant.

528
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,800
Don't always hang out with Erpang's father.

529
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,680
He's not a bad person,

530
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,200
but

531
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,160
he's always causing trouble.

532
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,280
He doesn't look for trouble,

533
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,340
trouble finds him.

534
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,480
Anyway,

535
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,960
he seems pretty steady this time.

536
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,440
He must have turned over a new leaf.

537
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,320
Is that possible?

538
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,280
Of course it is.

539
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,320
I'm done talking about this.

540
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,050
I'm leaving.

541
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,180
Going for seafood.

542
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,240
Come back early.

543
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,560
Don't drink too much.

544
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,920
What if I just want to drink?

545
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,090
Are you asking for trouble?

546
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,360
You've gotten quite bold now.

547
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,890
What are you smiling about?

548
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Just the two of us?

549
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,240
If we're talking business, why bring so many people?

550
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,720
Is this about the rent?

551
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,560
I've got some good news for you.

552
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,440
If this deal works out,

553
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,660
we can easily sort out the rent issue.

554
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,520
Go on.

555
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,720
I want to promote your brother-in-law.

556
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,080
You know,

557
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,360
in this business,

558
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,160
whenever you want to expand,

559
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,360
you need a big shot backing you up.

560
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,480
My business scope

561
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,610
is quite extensive.

562
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,460
I need someone influential for support.

563
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,000
And also,

564
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,200
I'm planning to enter the real estate market.

565
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,800
During demolition and relocation,

566
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,680
I'll need someone to help

567
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,840
deal with those stubborn holdouts.

568
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,440
So,

569
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,920
I have an idea.

570
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,880
I provide the money,

571
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,840
the connections,

572
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,880
and join forces with your brother-in-law.

573
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,040
His martial arts skills

574
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,680
are just a bonus.

575
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,760
What's most important is that in our city,

576
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,360
among all these street people,

577
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,800
he commands respect.

578
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,000
Especially as Ermei's big brother.

579
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,060
Your brother-in-law's connections

580
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,880
are truly valuable.

581
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,640
That's all I wanted to say.

582
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,440
I understand.

583
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,600
Have you ordered the food?

584
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,360
Not yet.

585
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,680
Stop wasting money.

586
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,410
I'm leaving.

587
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,320
We were talking just fine.

588
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,560
Why are you leaving?

589
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,360
Well, that's something

590
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,920
you should tell Huo Dongfeng.

591
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,880
Why tell me?

592
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,240
Didn't he beat me up when I was a kid?

593
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,080
I'm still a bit scared of him.

594
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,400
I thought you could pass a message to him.

595
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,200
Then I'd know where I stand.

596
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,680
I thought we were here to discuss rent.

597
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,720
The rent is negotiable.

598
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,160
As long as your brother-in-law agrees,

599
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,040
I can give him a 20% discount.

600
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,000
Do you support

601
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,880
your brother-in-law doing this?

602
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,720
I don't.

603
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,960
Why not?

604
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,280
It makes good money.

605
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,640
In the past,

606
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,220
during these 15 years,

607
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,280
he spent 14 years in prison.

608
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,160
He just got out

609
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,480
and wants to run a legitimate business.

610
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,200
What you're suggesting

611
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,660
is leading him down a dangerous path.

612
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,920
How is this a dangerous path?

613
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,320
It's a highway to making money!

614
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,520
Then go ask him yourself.

615
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,760
He's older now,

616
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,640
he definitely won't hit you.

617
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
At worst, he'll just scold you a bit.

618
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,960
If he doesn't agree to help you with this,

619
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,600
will you still

620
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,720
rent the house to him?

621
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,120
Of course. That's a separate matter.

622
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,850
That's fine then. I'm leaving.

623
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,040
If you have issues, go to the police.

624
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,970
My brother-in-law can't help you.

625
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,760
Refusing to make easy money.

626
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,080
You're really crazy.

627
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,360
Tian San was talking to me this afternoon.

628
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,560
He wants to spend money

629
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,400
to promote you as a big shot

630
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,040
and be your agent.

631
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,410
What does 'agent' mean?

632
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,960
It's probably similar to being a boss.

633
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,090
Then he's dreaming.

634
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,120
So I've already

635
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,450
turned him down for you.

636
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,560
Brother,

637
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,960
where's my dad?

638
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,280
I wanted to introduce you to the chef from Dingqing Restaurant.

639
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,080
He trained them all personally.

640
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,000
Their skills are excellent.

641
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,820
Uncle mentioned that.

642
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
It's a bit spicy.

643
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,840
Thank you, Uncle.

644
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,120
You're really looking out for me.

645
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,360
I appreciate it.

646
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,200
I was too embarrassed

647
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,240
to visit him before.

648
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,920
I'll definitely pay back when I earn some money.

649
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,450
Brother,

650
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,440
I'm just glad you're safe.

651
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,600
You promised Erpang this time

652
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,280
to be a good role model.

653
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,040
Keep your word.

654
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,000
Erpang needs to stay with you for two more days.

655
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,880
Until I'm

656
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,800
completely settled.

657
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,200
Then I'll bring him back.

658
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,480
Here.

659
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,120
Here, his uncle.

660
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,960
No, no, brother.

661
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,440
His uncle is coming.

662
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,360
Take this money back, then I'll drink with you.

663
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,280
Come on.

664
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,400
You're Erpang's father,

665
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,720
but I'm also his uncle.

666
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,160
If you're going to be like this,

667
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,440
then you can raise Erpang yourself.

668
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,880
Don't say useless things.

669
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,560
Uncle, you really care about me,

670
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,600
and I care about you.

671
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,640
This is for you and Erpang.

672
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,440
Take it.

673
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,560
Brother.

674
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,600
My Ermei.

675
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,760
Ermei.

676
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,120
What's up?

677
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,200
Where are you?

678
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,260
I'm here with my brother-in-law,

679
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,120
having barbecue and hotpot.

680
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,520
Is it okay if I come over?

681
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,440
I'd like to talk with you for a while.

682
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,970
Of course it's convenient.

683
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,120
But this small shabby place,

684
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,600
won't it be beneath you?

685
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,840
Brother, don't joke.

686
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,970
Give me the address.

687
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,200
It's on the old street,

688
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,600
the barbecue place behind the nightclub.

689
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,400
I'll have Hongwei wait for you at the entrance.

690
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,040
Okay,

691
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,240
that's settled then.

692
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,490
Where are you going?

693
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,560
Wait, he's still far away.

694
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,960
I'm going to pee. You're really treating me like your lackey.

695
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,840
I'm really treating you like an uncle.

696
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,700
Let me tell you.

697
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,160
Brother, take this back.

698
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:44,920
Hongwei.

699
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,420
I'm talking to you.

700
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,760
We need to keep running the fish market.

701
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,490
We can't give up this business.

702
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,560
Old Liu, you'll work with me.

703
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,240
We'll renovate that restaurant first.

704
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,000
After it's renovated,

705
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,400
we'll continue working in the restaurant.

706
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,720
Old Liu's dream

707
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,880
is to have a wild mountain

708
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,280
and be the mountain king.

709
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,760
In those wild mountains,

710
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,000
can we hunt wild rabbits?

711
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,080
Hunt rabbits?

712
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,400
Back then, let me tell you,

713
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,640
all the rabbits on that mountain

714
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,440
would be yours, all three of you.

715
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,680
So is this Mr. Liu's dream

716
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,000
or my dream?

717
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,920
His uncle.

718
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
Let's go, Hongwei.

719
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,520
Let's find Mr. Liu

720
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,480
and go hunting for rabbits.

721
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,610
Bring the gun. We'll hunt around here.

722
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,840
Guys,

723
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,960
let's drink somewhere else.

724
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,400
Brother.

725
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,280
Brother.

726
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,760
Brother.

727
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,250
Brother.

728
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,680
You've had plenty to drink.

729
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,880
It's fine, brother.

730
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,080
I can drink a bit more.

731
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,610
This is Erpang's uncle.

732
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,280
This is Mr. Liu.

733
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,160
No need to introduce him.

734
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,080
Ermei is my good brother.

735
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,640
Look at this atmosphere.

736
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,880
There are more brothers outside.

737
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,720
Call them in.

738
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,800
Join us.

739
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,480
Brother,

740
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,160
it's cold outside.

741
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,960
Brother.

742
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,360
I've missed you so much, brother.

743
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,400
I just want to have a good chat with you.

744
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,240
I've really missed you.

745
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,800
We haven't talked for so long.

746
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,480
Brother.

747
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,720
Since you've been out,

748
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,120
I haven't had a drink with you.

749
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,440
Brother.

750
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,080
I miss you, brother.

751
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,960
Look at these two brothers,

752
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,120
neither sitting down nor leaving.

753
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,850
Who are they guarding against?

754
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:25,960
No,

755
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,040
that's not what I meant.

756
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,700
I'm saying everyone should come in and sit here.

757
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,320
It'll be more lively.

758
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,280
Go, Hongwei, go.

759
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,040
Invite everyone in.

760
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,720
Sit down.

761
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,240
What's wrong with you? What are you doing?

762
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,280
Brother.

763
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,520
Listen to me.

764
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,360
They need to stand outside.

765
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,160
In case someone follows my car

766
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,560
and finds me.

767
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,040
They'll kill me.

768
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,960
They're at the door to keep watch for me.

769
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,480
What?

770
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,120
What did you say? Who wants to kill you?

771
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,920
Brother.

772
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,120
Who wants to kill you?

773
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,520
Someone wants to kill me.

774
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,680
Someone wants to kill you too?

775
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,240
Who wants to kill you?

776
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,120
Tell me.

777
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,000
There are tons of them.

778
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,800
Just the ones I know about, there are five or six.

779
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,760
Not to mention those I don't know about.

780
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,360
Brother.

781
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,680
Come on.

782
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,420
Let me drink a big one with you.

783
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,530
Brother.

784
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,720
I toast to you.

785
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,200
They can't drink anymore.

786
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,320
I'll drink for them.

787
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:32,920
I miss you.

788
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,840
I miss you too.

789
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,320
Look at him.

790
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Let the brothers come in.

791
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,480
Come in.

792
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
Brother.

793
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,160
It's freezing cold in here.

794
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,480
Boss.

795
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,320
Everyone here is family.

796
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,080
Boss, listen to me.

797
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,800
Brothers.

798
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,200
We're all brothers here.

799
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,520
Boss, they're used to it.

800
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,400
They're used to it.

801
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,960
Come on.

802
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,360
Cheer up!

803
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,090
I'll perform something for everyone.

804
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,760
I'll do something special.

805
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,520
Brother, I'll drink it all.

806
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,520
The show is on.

807
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,320
Brother.

808
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,000
I just want to talk with you.

809
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,280
Brother.

810
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,960
Remember what I did when we were kids?

811
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,520
Back then...

812
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,720
Let's go hunting rabbits at Old Liu's place.

813
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,200
He has a mountain.

814
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,520
Right.

815
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,480
Hunting rabbits.

816
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,760
We'll talk about our childhood when we get there.

817
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,400
Brother.

818
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,600
Give me a hug.

819
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,040
How many people can talk about my childhood with me?

820
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,440
Hug me.

821
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,640
Only you.

822
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,120
Big brother.

823
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,720
Only Er Pang dares to treat me like this.

824
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,580
Let me tell you.

825
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,760
You're a bit wobbly from drinking.

826
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,120
I must keep the boss good company.

827
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,000
Slow down, brother, slow down.

828
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,800
Take it easy.

829
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,960
Come on, boss, take my car.

830
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,760
Go. You don't need to see me off.

831
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,480
We'll walk back.

832
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:20,720
Let's go.

833
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,440
Boss.

834
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,700
It'll be fine for sure.

835
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,440
Brother.

836
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,280
Follow me.

837
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,120
You all go back.

838
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,540
Where are you going, second brother?

839
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
Longhu Mountain.

840
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,240
We're here.

841
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,100
You two get out.

842
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,920
Brother,

843
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,520
take this.

844
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,120
What's wrong?

845
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,290
What's this for?

846
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,160
Nothing special.

847
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,280
You're opening a restaurant,

848
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,940
so the standards can't be low.

849
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,600
Take this 100,000 yuan first,

850
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,840
we'll talk if you need more.

851
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,720
I have enough.

852
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,650
I'll tell you if I need more.

853
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,120
Brother,

854
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,180
just take it when I tell you to.

855
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,720
You know what I'm afraid of?

856
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,410
What if on your restaurant's opening day,

857
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,540
I'm not alive to see it.

858
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,280
Why do you keep talking like that?

859
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,760
I wasn't joking just now.

860
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,080
There really are people

861
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,140
who want to kill me.

862
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,170
Several groups of them.

863
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
Some are enemies,

864
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,960
and others want to kill me

865
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,620
to make a name for themselves.

866
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,500
Just from this morning until now,

867
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,360
I've received calls

868
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,220
from five different groups threatening to kill me.

869
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,120
Who can survive in today's society?

870
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,080
Just getting by.

871
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,930
Call the police.

872
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,290
I can't call the police.

873
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,360
If I call the police, I'll lose all respect.

874
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,840
Without respect, how can I be a boss?

875
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,040
What's the point of being in this world?

876
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,300
I'll report it for you.

877
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,330
I don't care about face.

878
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,900
Things were better when we were kids.

879
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,520
Back then,

880
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,850
a fight was just a fight.

881
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,639
After fighting, at worst

882
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,920
you'd go to the hospital.

883
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,360
Sometimes the two groups who fought

884
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,159
could even become good friends.

885
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,520
Now,

886
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,690
they want your life.

887
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,600
I don't care, brother.

888
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,280
My life is worthless.

889
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,080
At worst, I'll just lose my life.

890
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,199
I just feel

891
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,000
sorry for my mother.

892
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,199
She's 70 years old,

893
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,320
all alone.

894
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,360
I...

895
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,480
A few days ago,

896
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,250
I thought about visiting my mom, brother.

897
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,200
Then I got to the door

898
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,120
and decided not to go in.

899
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,320
If the old lady saw me,

900
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,520
what if she got angry again?

901
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,040
I kowtowed three times at the door.

902
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,560
Thinking about it today,

903
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,140
I really regret it.

904
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,450
The next time my mom sees me,

905
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,920
I might be just a photo.

906
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,920
Oh God.

907
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,440
Go out and have some fun.

908
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,960
Take a trip or something.

909
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,740
Consider this money my treat.

910
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,640
Our restaurant

911
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,680
is not only bigger than Jufu Restaurant

912
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,120
but even larger than Dingqing Restaurant.

913
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,120
You'll be the head chef here

914
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,760
and your salary won't be less than what you're making now.

915
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,200
Salary isn't the main issue.

916
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,600
Then what's important?

917
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,320
A massage therapist?

918
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,160
I've already found one for you

919
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,160
and it's free.

920
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,920
What I mean is

921
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,600
the owner is Huo Dongfeng.

922
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,400
He's a real fighter.

923
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,240
When he first started dating your sister

924
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,200
I was an apprentice at Dingqing Restaurant.

925
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,120
He's the type who can't sleep at night

926
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,800
if he hasn't fought with someone.

927
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,860
That temper of his!

928
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,200
He got into a fight at the restaurant

929
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,280
and someone stabbed him.

930
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,940
I carried him to the hospital.

931
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,720
Even now

932
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,720
I can barely remember what he looks like.

933
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,200
You know why?

934
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,800
I was so scared of him, I didn't dare look at him twice.

935
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,840
I was afraid if I looked at him

936
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,440
he'd say 'What are you looking at?'

937
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,040
What could I say?

938
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,700
'I'm looking at you, so what?'

939
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,840
Then he'd beat me so badly

940
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,480
I couldn't get out of bed for days.

941
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,040
You've all demonized him.

942
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,840
He's just...

943
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,120
He does love to fight.

944
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,040
But he only targeted thugs.

945
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,080
He never bullied any decent person.

946
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,440
Trust me on this.

947
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,120
Don't think I don't know.

948
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,520
Didn't he just fight for you a few days ago

949
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,160
and got sent to labor camp for two years?

950
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,280
I know all about it.

951
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:04,960
Yes.

952
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,720
The guy he fought was a thug.

953
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,600
Look.

954
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,240
Give it a try.

955
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,080
If he ever makes you uncomfortable,

956
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,320
you can quit anytime.

957
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,040
Deal?

958
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,690
I'll think about it.

959
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,600
What's there to think about?

960
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,480
My father asked me to talk to you about this.

961
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,880
Really?

962
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,560
My master sent you to find me?

963
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,360
That's right.

964
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,880
Then let's be clear.

965
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,440
He can't lay a hand on me.

966
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,280
If he dares to touch me,

967
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,840
I'll go straight to Master Cui.

968
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,400
If he touches one of your fingers,

969
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,800
I'll break all ten of his.

970
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,560
Wait.

971
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,400
He can't get into fights with others either.

972
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,360
We're running a restaurant,

973
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,680
not a martial arts school.

974
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,520
Let's be clear.

975
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,080
If he gets into a fight

976
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,960
and comes to me for a cleaver,

977
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,160
I won't give it to him.

978
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,880
Brother, let me put it this way.

979
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,360
As long as you come work for us,

980
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,820
we'll do whatever you say.

981
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,480
Good.

982
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,480
So relaxing.

983
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Relax, relax, relax.

984
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,530
This guy can still make sounds.

985
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,240
Liu,

986
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,600
I bought water for everyone.

987
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,080
Liu really works hard.

988
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,640
He doesn't even drink water.

989
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,080
Look,

990
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,320
I'm following your design.

991
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,320
So this is where the construction is happening?

992
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,600
This space is

993
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,540
quite impressive.

994
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,880
Good.

995
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:56,800
Take a look.

996
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,120
And here,

997
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,160
I've made

998
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,840
some improvements to the cashier area.

999
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,360
Good.

1000
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,240
Look at this space.

1001
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,680
Brother, you can design it however you want.

1002
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,720
Just these four walls are load-bearing.

1003
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,440
Don't touch them.

1004
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,240
If I mess with those, it'll leak air.

1005
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,920
I'm not stupid.

1006
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,520
Good.

1007
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,050
Alright.

1008
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,760
Chef Zhang has agreed to come,

1009
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,240
but he has one condition.

1010
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,440
You absolutely cannot get into fights.

1011
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,160
If you get into a fight,

1012
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,560
he'll quit immediately.

1013
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880
Did you agree to that?

1014
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,000
Of course I did.

1015
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,200
Then I have to agree with you too.

1016
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,120
Okay,

1017
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,160
no fighting.

1018
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,410
I'll work properly.

1019
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,040
Fine.

1020
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,400
Brother,

1021
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,000
something happened to Second Brother.

1022
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,800
What happened to Ermei?

1023
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,520
Come quickly!

1024
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,960
At the district hospital, fourth floor,

1025
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,220
keep an eye on it for me.

1026
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,240
Boss.

1027
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,680
Boss.

1028
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,720
Boss.

1029
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,960
What's wrong?

1030
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,640
Someone got him.

1031
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,160
How long has he been in there?

1032
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,220
Doctor, what happened to my brother?

1033
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,720
He's not going to make it.

1034
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,040
Brother.

1035
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,440
Brother!

1036
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,040
Brother!

1037
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,500
Excuse me, let me through.

1038
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,680
Excuse me, please.

1039
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,440
Brother!

1040
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,160
You all come back later.

1041
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,120
Wait, wait.

1042
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,200
Clear the area first.

1043
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,240
Who knows what happened?

1044
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,040
You all,

1045
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,520
who knows the situation?

1046
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,640
Alright,

1047
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,970
come back with us first.

1048
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,600
Break it up. This is a hospital,

1049
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,930
no loud noises allowed.

1050
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,040
Do you know who died?

1051
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,600
Who?

1052
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,480
Ermei.

1053
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,640
This funeral procession is really grand.

1054
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,200
But no matter how grand it is,

1055
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,730
the person is already gone.

1056
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,240
I was just

1057
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,040
drinking with him a few days ago.

1058
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,400
I'm sorry.

1059
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,720
It's

1060
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,600
alright, miss.

1061
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,320
How much is this Mei Lanfang phone card?

1062
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,200
Brother.

1063
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,400
Brother,

1064
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,000
someone's trying to kill me.

1065
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,360
Brother,

1066
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,120
do you believe in Buddha?

1067
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,720
I really believe in it now.

1068
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,560
I truly believe in karma.

1069
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,160
I need to ask you something, Brother.

1070
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:35,760
If someday,

1071
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,000
if I'm really gone,

1072
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,680
please put me in this temple.

1073
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,760
Then every day,

1074
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,440
I can listen to the sutras

1075
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,400
and maybe I'll be reincarnated sooner.

1076
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,330
Will you do that?

1077
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,920
Did you plan this earlier,

1078
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,520
or did you just think of it now?
