1
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
Li

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,720
Li Yang

3
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,040
Liu

4
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,000
Go renew it.

5
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,440
Mengmeng

6
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,840
is here.

7
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,280
You won't die.

8
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,480
You can't leave me.

9
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,920
There's something I've never told you.

10
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,000
From the day I met you,

11
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,840
you've been my idol.

12
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,080
You still are.

13
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,240
I know I might not make it.

14
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
You'll be fine.

15
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,880
Trust me.

16
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,540
Do you remember Mengmeng's two white doves?

17
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,090
I actually love them very much.

18
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,160
Someday in the future,

19
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,800
if you see a white dove

20
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,840
flying by,

21
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,860
it will be me coming back to see you and Mengmeng.

22
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,960
I think the happiest days

23
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,600
were those weekends

24
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,440
when our family

25
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,560
went to Dingqing Restaurant together.

26
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,720
Why did you

27
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,920
scatter my mom's ashes here?

28
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,300
She doesn't even have a grave.

29
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,680
Someday

30
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,880
my ashes will be scattered here too.

31
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,890
I won't have a grave either.

32
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,080
Your mother liked peace and quiet.

33
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,760
She didn't like living close to others.

34
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,960
When I join her,

35
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,080
it'll be just the two of us, together forever.

36
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,960
This seashell is your mother.

37
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,120
That green snail is me.

38
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,929
Why do you have to go to your grandmother's house?

39
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,539
Isn't it nice here at home?

40
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,080
This is not my home.

41
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
My home has been gone for a long time.

42
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,520
I'm going to Beijing to study dance later this year.

43
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,850
I'll be living in a dormitory, so I won't need a home anymore.

44
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,720
New Year is coming soon.

45
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,480
Mengmeng,

46
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,400
let's go

47
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,400
to grandfather's house for New Year, okay?

48
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,020
If you want to go, just go by yourself.

49
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,720
Grandma and Grandpa just lost their daughter.

50
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,250
They need me with them more.

51
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,960
Dad,

52
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,440
could you please stop singing on the streets?

53
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Many of my classmates have seen you.

54
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,530
New Year in Northeast China is always lively.

55
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,520
Liu!

56
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,090
What are you doing here?

57
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,240
Where is Director Zhang?

58
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,000
It's Director Feng now.

59
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,080
Director Zhang has retired.

60
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,810
It's been over a month already.

61
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,680
Money.

62
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,200
Hurry up.

63
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,000
What's going on? A robbery?

64
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,860
Cut the crap. Hand over the money.

65
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,240
What are you looking at?

66
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
Don't waste time.

67
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,000
Hurry up.

68
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,020
Don't come any closer.

69
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,880
I'll really kill you.

70
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,480
Kill me. I don't deserve to live.

71
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,560
You're crazy.

72
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,560
Help me.

73
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,160
What are you doing?

74
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,360
Come on. Kill me.

75
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,080
Let go.

76
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,680
Kill me.

77
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,360
Let go. You're insane.

78
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,040
Kill me.

79
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,360
You're crazy.

80
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:18,760
Kill me.

81
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,040
Brother.

82
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,000
Please kill me.

83
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,920
Brother.

84
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,840
Listen to me.

85
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,680
I was wrong.

86
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,720
I was wrong, brother.

87
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,520
I was wrong.

88
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,760
Spare me, please.

89
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,690
Please let me go.

90
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
Brother,

91
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,080
please spare me, will you?

92
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,000
Have mercy.

93
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,120
Brother,

94
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,040
please set me free.

95
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,000
That's all.

96
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,530
Brother.

97
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,040
Thank you.

98
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,020
Happy New Year.

99
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,400
Thank you. Thank you.

100
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,520
Keep it.

101
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,080
Stay alive.

102
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,620
At this moment,

103
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,080
Beijing time accompanies us,

104
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,440
the rhythm of life,

105
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,240
1.2 billion Chinese people.

106
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,600
Here it comes.

107
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,000
In the past,

108
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,880
Old Mr. Zhang had a saying.

109
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,100
Every hurdle is hard, but every hurdle can be overcome.

110
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,480
Life is about

111
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,840
crossing one hurdle after another.

112
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,260
As long as we're alive,

113
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,880
there's no Flaming Mountain we can't cross,

114
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,610
no obstacle we can't overcome.

115
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,080
For New Year this year,

116
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,680
I only made two dishes.

117
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,640
One meat medley

118
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,420
and one vegetable medley.

119
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,400
Even in difficult times,

120
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,220
we're eating Dingqing Restaurant's special stew.

121
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,810
Aren't you all here now?

122
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,680
Erpang.

123
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,960
Eat up.

124
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,080
You usually can't wait to eat.

125
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,240
Look how thin you've gotten lately.

126
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,760
I've asked around.

127
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,080
Your father,

128
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,160
it's only 20 years.

129
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,840
If he behaves well in there,

130
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,040
with sentence reductions, it could be just 12 or 13 years.

131
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,920
By then,

132
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,810
he'll be in his fifties,

133
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,050
and you'll be in your twenties.

134
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,800
Maybe

135
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,280
by the time you start your own family,

136
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,280
your father will be out.

137
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,800
If your grades aren't good

138
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,530
and you can't get into high school,

139
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,319
it's not the end of the world.

140
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,730
I never went to high school either,

141
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,940
yet I'm still one of the top ten chefs in the province

142
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,619
and work as a general manager.

143
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,960
If you really don't want to study,

144
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,920
you can learn cooking from me for a couple of years.

145
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,800
You'll never worry about making a living.

146
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,480
And you eat better than others.

147
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,560
Grandpa.

148
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,050
I really don't want to go to school.

149
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,520
You must go to school.

150
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,880
You can learn to be a cook anytime.

151
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,020
But your grandpa is right.

152
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,640
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

153
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,200
That's right.

154
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,960
Don't be so down.

155
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,200
Old Mr. Zhang

156
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,860
always used to say something.

157
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,690
Keep planting crops even after failed harvests,

158
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,280
and one year you'll have a good harvest.

159
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,090
You're only a teenager.

160
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,080
You're not even 40 yet.

161
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,080
You're both young.

162
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,000
As long as you work hard,

163
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,560
you'll definitely have a good harvest.

164
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,360
Let's all look forward to

165
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,920
the arrival of the New Year.

166
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,400
Three, two, one.

167
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,440
Can my dad in prison

168
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,120
watch the Spring Festival Gala?

169
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,920
Yes,

170
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,420
he definitely can.

171
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,000
Can my dad ever get out?

172
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,060
He definitely can.

173
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,930
A suspended death sentence

174
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,640
is not the death penalty.

175
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,520
With good behavior, he can be released.

176
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,920
There's another way,

177
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,640
the one I told you about.

178
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,160
Study hard,

179
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,320
become a lawyer or judge,

180
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,570
and personally defend your father's innocence.

181
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,920
Hello, Dad.

182
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,140
Happy New Year!

183
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,810
This is Guoming.

184
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,440
Hello?

185
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,760
Dad, happy New Year.

186
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,280
Happy New Year.

187
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,810
Is everything good at home?

188
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,360
Everything's fine.

189
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,520
Couldn't be better.

190
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,960
From your tone,

191
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,620
things don't seem that great.

192
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,880
It's all good, really.

193
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
That's good then.

194
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,880
Let me speak to Erpang.

195
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,360
Wait.

196
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,880
Never mind.

197
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,760
You must be eating dumplings now.

198
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,090
Let's talk another day.

199
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,640
Take good care of yourself there.

200
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,000
Goodbye, Dad.

201
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,460
New Year's money for Xiaoxue.

202
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,320
This is yours.

203
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,400
Erpang, this is yours.

204
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,520
Guoming.

205
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,040
This is yours.

206
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,120
Even though you're older now,

207
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,480
in my eyes,

208
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,560
you're still a child.

209
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,080
Grandpa.

210
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,720
Grandpa.

211
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,640
Everything will be fine.

212
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,180
It will be alright.

213
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,560
Don't cry, don't cry.

214
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,600
Everything will be fine.

215
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,480
It will be alright.

216
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,120
I never really thought

217
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,720
our family would be wealthy.

218
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,000
We could just live in that small house we had before,

219
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,060
it was enough for our family of three.

220
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,720
Erpang was fine with it too.

221
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,000
On weekends, I could take Mengmeng

222
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,320
to Dingqing Restaurant to have a meal with you.

223
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,050
What a happy life that would be.

224
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,820
How much is this, brother?

225
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,680
Just take a look.

226
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,240
480.

227
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,920
Give me a discount,

228
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,720
your wife always gave me discounts

229
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,720
when she was here.

230
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,280
Where is she?

231
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,960
How much discount did she give you?

232
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,080
She usually just rounded it down,

233
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,800
like 480 would become 400.

234
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,160
Then 400 it is.

235
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
Thanks, brother.

236
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,000
Within a year, we'll definitely

237
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,600
be able to pay back the money.

238
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,650
The shop will still be ours.

239
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,720
Let's work hard together.

240
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,800
We'll be fine.

241
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,170
Who told you to hang it here?

242
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,200
It doesn't match at all.

243
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,130
If not here, where should I hang it?

244
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,040
Like this.

245
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,400
This is what you call a gradient.

246
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
You hung up and called back again.

247
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,640
Guoming,

248
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,600
let's go home.

249
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,400
Where are we going, brother?

250
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,280
Wherever.

251
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,280
No, but you...

252
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,960
Why don't you name a place?

253
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,600
Rabbit's Nest Mountain.

254
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
Now?

255
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,480
Brother, please fasten your seatbelt.

256
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,530
What do you mean?

257
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,000
Get out. Pay up.

258
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,960
Are you robbing me?

259
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,330
You're the one trying to rob me.

260
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,680
You really think I'm stupid?

261
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,360
If we get there, would I even

262
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,600
make it out alive?

263
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
I know this trick.

264
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Lure me up there,

265
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,440
then have several guys pin me down,

266
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,480
and rob me.

267
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,040
It's not easy driving a taxi.

268
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,160
We barely make any money.

269
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,000
Brother,

270
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
you've got it wrong.

271
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,560
I live here.

272
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,120
Who are you kidding?

273
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,800
You live here, brother?

274
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,160
Is this even habitable?

275
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,440
This is...

276
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,200
No, no.

277
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,560
There's a house up the mountain.

278
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,080
Drive me up there.

279
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,520
Look,

280
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,220
if you make me get out here,

281
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,880
I'll have to walk another two kilometers.

282
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,000
No more talk. Pay up and get out.

283
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,560
Give me the money.

284
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,120
Fine.

285
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,920
Don't bother looking.

286
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,760
That's hilarious.

287
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,080
It's pitch dark here.

288
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,940
Let me tell you,

289
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,680
that driver,

290
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,920
forget about bringing you here,

291
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,800
even halfway up the mountain

292
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,440
would be

293
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,200
pretty good of him.

294
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,060
Who would dare come to this place?

295
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,120
Cui.

296
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,400
Today,

297
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,720
this is...

298
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,560
Let's drink together today.

299
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,840
When we're done drinking,

300
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,960
I'll go down the mountain,

301
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,080
get to the village,

302
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,120
call for a ride,

303
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,860
and have you sent back.

304
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,860
Brother, listen to me.

305
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,160
You coming up here to see me,

306
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,600
I'm truly touched,

307
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,400
really.

308
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,120
Let me tell you,

309
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,680
it gets damn cold in the middle of the night here,

310
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,600
you won't be able to sleep at all.

311
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,640
I don't want to go home.

312
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,680
Going home

313
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,640
just reminds me of my wife.

314
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,160
Isn't your daughter still at home?

315
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,610
She went to Beijing.

316
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,640
Went to Beijing?

317
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,440
Left today.

318
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,880
Now I

319
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,680
understand why my sister, after leaving,

320
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,520
never wanted to come back.

321
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,760
Before,

322
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,960
I hated her and blamed her.

323
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,140
Now I understand everything.

324
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,940
Objects trigger memories of people.

325
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,290
The scenery reminds me of someone.

326
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,960
What did you see

327
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,040
that makes you so sad?

328
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,640
No,

329
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,000
what you're saying

330
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,560
sounds too philosophical for me.

331
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,400
I don't understand it.

332
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,080
Anyway,

333
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,160
as long as you're doing well, Cui.

334
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,320
I'll go get some coal

335
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,360
and heat up the kang bed for you.

336
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,080
You don't really know me.

337
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,080
Look at your memory.

338
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,760
Do you remember a few years ago

339
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,400
I rented this shop to you?

340
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,520
Now my son is getting out.

341
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,360
Mrs. Zhang.

342
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,800
Where's your wife?

343
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,480
She's gone.

344
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,080
I heard that

345
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,000
business is booming at your shop.

346
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,880
But we agreed early on.

347
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
This shop was only

348
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,760
temporarily for you to run.

349
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,360
After my son returns,

350
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,840
you must give it back to us.

351
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,200
If you try to deny it,

352
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,920
that won't work.

353
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,200
I'll keep my promise.

354
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,820
Whenever you want it back,

355
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,370
you can have it back.

356
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,920
My son wasn't wrong about you.

357
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,480
You're a man of principle.

358
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,480
I must say,

359
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,540
you've kept this place in good shape.

360
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,560
So you're really quitting the clothing store?

361
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,040
You're quitting?

362
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,880
What will you do now?

363
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,720
How will you make a living?

364
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,360
That's a very

365
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,560
good question.

366
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,320
I currently have

367
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,200
300,000 in debt out there.

368
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,360
I also have

369
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,520
three children.

370
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,680
Four.

371
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,290
Three and a half.

372
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
How am I

373
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,480
supposed to live?

374
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,930
I'm not in a hurry about that money.

375
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,610
If you really don't have it,

376
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,000
you don't have to pay me back.

377
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,340
Who are you cursing at?

378
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,480
[Staff Wanted Urgently]

379
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,560
Porter

380
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,720
Overseas Work

381
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,080

Make Fortune Abroad

388
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,000
Your education is impressive.

389
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,880
A graduate from Polytechnic University.

390
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,610
You came here looking for a job?

391
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,160
Are you kidding me?

392
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,960
Or are you just flirting with me?

393
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,880
No, no.

394
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,480
I...

395
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,280
I just want to find a job.

396
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,410
I need to make money.

397
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,880
With your skills

398
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,880
it's really hard to find a job.

399
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,320
You'd need a factory with tens of thousands of employees

400
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,980
to make use of your expertise.

401
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,700
Those positions are already filled.

402
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,360
Your skill is like dragon-slaying.

403
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,160
You can kill dragons,

404
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,940
but we don't know any dragons.

405
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,160
Your skills are impressive,

406
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,360
but generally not applicable.

407
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,800
I can also sing and dance.

408
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,760
Your appearance

409
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,600
isn't particularly bad.

410
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,480
But at your age,

411
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,680
do you want to debut like Little Tigers?

412
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,840
I don't want to be a star.

413
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,240
I just want to make money.

414
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,440
I'm just saying what I can do.

415
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,320
I don't know where it can be used.

416
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,490
What else can you do?

417
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,800
I might know a bit of everything.

418
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,540
So what exactly can you do?

419
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,880
I can cook.

420
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,810
Do you have a chef certificate?

421
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,640
No, I don't.

422
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,960
You don't know anything useful.

423
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,840
You...

424
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,980
I could go to Vladivostok.

425
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,400
Over there,

426
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,800
manual laborers

427
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,930
earn more than white-collar workers.

428
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,440
As long as you're willing to work hard,

429
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,920
anything is possible.

430
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,720
Do you speak Korean?

431
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,840
A little bit.

432
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,520
[Korean] Go away.

433
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,180
(Korean) You bastard.

434
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,650
By the time you get here,

435
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,040
our family will have bought

436
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,960
a Xiali car.

437
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,080
(Korean) Give it a rest.

438
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,480
I have bigger plans.

439
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,860
(Korean) You fool.

440
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,440
This thing.

441
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,320
(Korean) Get out of my way.

442
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,040
A hero doesn't settle for small change.

443
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,680
(Korean) So annoying.

444
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,480
(Korean) Get out.

445
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,920
I'm going to save all the children in the country.

446
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,800
(Korean) I'll cut you down.

447
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,280
I'll win all the lawsuits.

448
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,760
(Korean) I'll kill you.

449
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,040
I'll turn my life around in one shot.

450
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,560
(Korean) Don't mess with me.

451
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,020
(Korean) What do you want?

452
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,840
(Korean) You bastard.

453
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,680
(Korean) Move aside.

454
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,280
(Korean) Go to hell.

455
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,960
(Korean) Go to hell.

456
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,400
I can do it.

457
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,240
Here, try this one.

458
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,200
Your cooking is decent.

459
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,360
You could work at a restaurant with modest standards.

460
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,200
You'd make a good enough chef.

461
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,280
Have you taught Erpang how to cook?

462
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,000
I have.

463
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,180
Doesn't he still have to go to school?

464
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,440
But his studies...

465
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,920
He doesn't take them seriously.

466
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,080
It was 10 o'clock last night

467
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,440
when I finally dragged him home.

468
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,440
Playing arcade games again?

469
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,440
No, I went to an internet café.

470
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,640
What's an internet café?

471
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,280
It's about the internet.

472
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,120
The city's first internet café opened yesterday.

473
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,040
I was the first customer to go online there.

474
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,240
The future world

475
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,720
will be an internet world.

476
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,320
The entire Earth

477
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,050
will be like one small village.

478
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,440
Good.

479
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,719
I've read about it in the newspaper too.

480
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,080
You're sensitive to new things.

481
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,000
This proves

482
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,159
that we can always stay

483
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,820
at the forefront of the times.

484
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,600
So you're the nephew and uncle, right?

485
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,239
People like you two

486
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,520
one per family is noisy enough.

487
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,520
Our family has two.

488
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,800
Among ancient Chinese generals,

489
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,199
I admire two men the most.

490
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,239
One is

491
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,520
Huo Qubing from the Han Dynasty.

492
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,080
He was appointed as Cavalry Commander at 17.

493
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,080
And then

494
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,520
there's Li Jing from the Tang Dynasty.

495
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,880
He defeated the Turks in the fourth year of Zhenguan.

496
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,480
These two were extraordinary.

497
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,159
They were simply invincible.

498
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,120
So I believe

499
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,280
they should be called

500
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,080
the War Gods of Chinese history.

501
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,080
So these two War Gods,

502
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,719
what do they have to do with you?

503
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,719
Nothing to do with me.

504
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,560
But these two men...

505
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,920
They have one thing in common.

506
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,800
Both of them have

507
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,930
impressive uncles.

508
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,400
Huo Qubing's uncle was Wei Qing,

509
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,840
and together with Huo Qubing,

510
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,080
they were known as the Twin Jewels of Han Dynasty.

511
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,200
As for Li Jing,

512
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,120
his uncle was Han Qinhu,

513
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,540
also a famous general.

514
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,400
And in both cases, the nephews were

515
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,360
better than their mentors.

516
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,800
Alright.

517
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,280
The student has surpassed the master.

518
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,720
Just tell me straight.

519
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,050
How much money do you want to borrow today?

520
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,720
I don't want to borrow money.

521
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,770
A father knows his son best.

522
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,160
You must have

523
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,320
some ulterior motive.

524
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,760
In all these years,

525
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,820
how many times have you cooked for me?

526
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,840
Just be honest.

527
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,010
The sooner you tell me, the sooner I can relax.

528
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,340
Then I'll tell you.

529
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,960
Wait.

530
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,080
Should I take

531
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,000
my blood pressure and heart medication first?

532
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,080
No need this time.

533
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,160
It's not that serious.

534
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,360
Then tell me quickly.

535
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,480
Well, I

536
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,560
want to leave for a while.

537
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,680
When I walk on the street,

538
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,680
all the neighbors

539
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,840
always give me

540
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,120
looks of pity.

541
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,040
I don't want people's sympathy.

542
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,880
I was thinking,

543
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
didn't Mengmeng also go to Beijing?

544
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,960
I understand what you mean.

545
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,760
Just tell me where you want to go.

546
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,520
Vladivostok.

547
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,000
Vladivostok?

548
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,000
What are you going to do there?

549
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,200
Whatever I can do.

550
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,960
Good, good.

551
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,440
Go ahead.

552
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,400
It's good to see the world

553
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,260
and relax a bit.

554
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,170
That's nice.

555
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,000
Well,

556
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,960
I'll have to trouble you with Erpang then.

557
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,620
I'm still strong and healthy.

558
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,720
Besides, Erpang

559
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,020
is grown up now.

560
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,320
You can go out

561
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,730
and make your way without worries.

562
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:49,880
Dad.

563
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,520
Why didn't you

564
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,780
park your bicycle at the entrance today?

565
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,320
Sorry, Director.

566
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:11,960
I'm

567
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,200
bothering you again.

568
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,090
Your dedication to your friend

569
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,760
is very touching.

570
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,120
Although I'm retired,

571
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,440
I'm still a judge for the people.

572
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,280
When people need help,

573
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,960
I will certainly do my duty

574
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,920
and continue to follow this case.

575
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,800
Really?

576
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,280
Of course it's true.

577
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,320
I can tell you now

578
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,980
what I was thinking back then.

579
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,840
Initially, because of your feedback,

580
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,480
I had some reservations

581
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,720
about the evidence in the case.

582
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,520
But procedurally speaking,

583
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
the chain of evidence was complete.

584
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,220
Since it complied with regulations,

585
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,850
a verdict had to be reached.

586
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,320
That's right, Director.

587
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,760
Since I don't have a lawyer's license,

588
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,560
and I don't have money either,

589
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,240
there are many aspects of this case

590
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,370
that I can't handle.

591
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,360
But you saying you're willing to follow up

592
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,680
makes me really happy.

593
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,360
I was wondering,

594
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,920
could I meet

595
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,240
the family of the person involved?

596
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,920
Sure.

597
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,920
But the family member

598
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
is still a minor.

599
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,800
She's staying with my father.

600
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,460
I'm considered her guardian.

601
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,800
This is only the first trial.

602
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,400
There will be a second trial.

603
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,600
If later

604
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,240
new evidence emerges,

605
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,520
the defense still has the right to appeal.

606
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,720
There's still time for the family.

607
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,000
That's great!

608
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,440
Well,

609
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,680
Director, I'm really

610
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,360
counting on you for this.

611
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,040
Don't mention it.

612
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,920
Because I

613
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,780
need to go to Vladivostok.

614
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,720
What are you going to Vladivostok for?

615
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,080
Can't be a lawyer in China,

616
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,720
so you're going abroad to be one?

617
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,520
No, no.

618
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,960
At home...

619
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,840
Nothing. It's nothing.

620
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,040
Nothing?

621
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,840
Right.

622
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,320
If you have any trouble abroad,

623
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,920
don't forget to ask for help.

624
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,850
You still have us brothers.

625
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,760
Wait for me to

626
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,560
return home in glory.

627
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,680
Let's go.

628
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,730
Why don't you talk some sense into him?

629
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,680
He can't even figure things out here,

630
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,360
how will he survive abroad?

631
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,760
I watched a movie a few days ago

632
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,760
called 'The Shawshank Redemption.'

633
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,120
There's a line in it:

634
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,000
Some birds aren't meant to be caged.

635
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,440
I've seen it too.

636
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,560
What was it called?

637
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,760
Its feathers are very colorful,

638
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,560
right?

639
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,640
The next line should be:

640
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,680
Some jerks can't be caged either.

641
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,080
You've got it all?

642
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,040
12,000?

643
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,440
Yes. Divide it into five parts.

644
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,120
One for Mengmeng.

645
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,240
One for Xiaoxue.

646
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,080
One for Erpang.

647
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,120
One for Xiaozhi.

648
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,700
And I'll use the last part to pay you back.

649
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,880
My acupuncture business is doing well.

650
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,120
Don't worry about Xiaozhi.

651
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,000
Let me handle it.

652
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,920
We agreed it's my responsibility.

653
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,920
Don't interfere.

654
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,240
What are you arguing with me for?

655
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,200
By the way.

656
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,560
After you've paid everyone else's debts,

657
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,200
you don't need to pay me back.

658
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,520
No, I must pay you back.

659
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,800
Let's not talk about this.

660
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,320
Every two or three months,

661
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,200
could you go to Beijing for me

662
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,400
to check on Mengmeng?

663
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,170
I'm already visiting almost once a month.

664
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,570
That's good.

665
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,920
When you see her,

666
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,520
put in some good words for me.

667
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:45,760
I know.

668
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,520
Don't worry.

669
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,250
How's Erpang doing?

670
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,840
He spends all day in internet cafes.

671
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,770
What about Xiaozhi?

672
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,120
Running around everywhere. More active than his father.

673
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,600
Why is it so noisy there?

674
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,640
What are you doing?

675
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,570
Filming a movie.

676
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,240
They have an actor here called

677
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,000
Hasov.

678
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,280
He's the male lead.

679
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,210
And I'm playing a Hong Kong person.

680
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,400
[Korean] How long are you going to be on that phone?

681
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,400
[Korean] Are you going to work or not?

682
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,800
[Korean] If not, get out!

683
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,160
[Korean] Sorry, boss.

684
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,360
[Korean] Unbelievable.

685
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,880
The director is calling me to shoot now.

686
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,490
What about Hongwei?

687
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,410
Big brother got sentenced.

688
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,440
15 years.

689
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,900
That's not bad.

690
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,440
Of course.

691
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,280
With sentence reductions, he'll be out in about 10 years.

692
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,680
How are you doing abroad?

693
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,520
It's a food desert here.
