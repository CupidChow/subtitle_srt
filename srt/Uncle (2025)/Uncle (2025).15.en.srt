1
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,479
Why did you sell more than me?

2
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,680
As for you,

3
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,280
you probably used all your energy on shouting.

4
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,440
So I'm just not good at hawking, huh?

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,920
We sold a total of 12,600 today.

6
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,800
If we sell a bit more,

7
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,240
we can almost get Brother Cui

8
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,520
back.

9
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,500
Hey, can you just shut your mouth?

10
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,680
Come on,

11
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,840
bro,

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,360
let's go out for a drink.

13
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,000
Shut up.

14
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,480
Or tomorrow,

15
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,880
could you buy me a megaphone too?

16
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,840
Get lost.

17
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,060
Factory direct down jackets!

18
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,800
100 yuan each!

19
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,920
Clearance sale!

20
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,720
Clearance sale!

21
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,020
Once they're gone, they're gone!

22
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,860
Factory direct down jackets!

23
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,490
How much for one?

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,400
100 yuan each.

25
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,120
Young man,

26
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,720
how can you not recognize German marks?

27
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,280
Of course I recognize them.

28
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,880
I've even spent them before.

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,160
It's just that

30
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,480
I need yuan right now.

31
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,640
I can't use these at the moment.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,240
Do you have any yuan?

33
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,770
I only brought these today.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,860
If you won't take them, forget it.

35
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,810
Brother.

36
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,960
What's the exchange rate for these German marks?

37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,680
One to five.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,660
Isn't that the standard rate?

39
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,160
Young man,

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
you just started doing business here, right?

41
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,250
Around here,

42
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,960
German marks,

43
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,280
US dollars and yuan

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,810
all circulate the same way.

45
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,040
Ask other vendors.

46
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,440
Then you'll understand.

47
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,440
And people here

48
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,480
really like to accept

49
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,079
German marks and US dollars.

50
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,800
And why is that?

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,040
Because they hold their value.

52
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,300
Today it's one to five,

53
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,480
but next month it might be one to six.

54
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,180
Just take them.

55
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,610
I'll exchange them for yuan later.

56
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,720
How about it?

57
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Want to exchange?

58
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,480
Yes.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,060
You've never even seen marks before.

60
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,000
How are you doing business here?

61
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,520
Young man,

62
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,480
I'll

63
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,040
leave you my contact information.

64
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,400
In the future, if anyone else

65
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,000
uses German marks or US dollars

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,160
to buy things from you,

67
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,220
just give me a call.

68
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,660
I'll exchange however much you have.

69
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,820
Down jackets direct from factory

70
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,200
100 yuan each.

71
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,200
US dollars.

72
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,170
German marks

73
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,240
and euros all accepted.

74
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,050
I feel like the way you're staring at me

75
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,250
is like saying goodbye to a corpse.

76
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,120
I actually think it feels like a funeral viewing too.

77
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,680
Then why

78
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,280
are you still looking at me like that?

79
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,720
I'm just wondering,

80
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,280
why you're so good at pool.

81
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,650
Are you a professional player?

82
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,720
Just playing with you.

83
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,520
I think

84
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,480
I should look professional at everything I do.

85
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,440
When we get out of here,

86
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,880
let's talk more.

87
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,120
Talk about what?

88
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,760
Once I'm out, I'm going straight home.

89
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,960
Don't want to stay here a minute longer.

90
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,840
Cui, I think you're a good guy.

91
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,360
I've decided to tell you a secret.

92
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,280
Go ahead.

93
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,680
My brothers are coming to rescue me.

94
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,880
We'll leave together when they do.

95
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,400
Give it a rest, will you?

96
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,440
I admit defeat.

97
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,800
I'm telling the truth.

98
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,200
After we get out,

99
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
I'm definitely going to find Feifei

100
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,480
and have a good talk with her.

101
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,180
I mean, such a beautiful girl,

102
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,240
why is she doing this kind of work?

103
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,680
You go talk to her.

104
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,280
Can you let me have some peace

105
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,360
please?

106
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,920
Down jackets!

107
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,800
Super thick down jackets!

108
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,730
Selling at a loss for just 100 yuan!

109
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,640
Extra thick and extra warm!

110
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,320
Down jackets!

111
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,940
Why buy this stuff? What a waste of money.

112
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,640
I'm actually hungry.

113
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,520
What was I saying?

114
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,560
I made a foreign business deal.

115
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,960
Look at you showing off.

116
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,880
Foreign business, huh?

117
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
How did you do it?

118
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,560
Did you use gestures?

119
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,000
Speaking in sign language?

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,200
They're all Chinese. Why would I use sign language?

121
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,080
If they're all Chinese,

122
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,740
how is that foreign business?

123
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,920
I earned foreign money.

124
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,140
Foreign money?

125
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,840
Twenty euros.

126
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,360
Euros.

127
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,080
What does it look like? Let me see.

128
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,740
Where is it?

129
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,560
I've already exchanged it for yuan.

130
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,210
How much did you get?

131
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,600
100 yuan.

132
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,520
Wait, you've been talking all this time

133
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,120
and only sold one item?

134
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Hurry back to your stall.

135
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,300
We still need to bail out Brother Cui.

136
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,890
I'm trying to teach you that

137
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,520
business requires an international perspective.

138
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,780
Why aren't you interested in new things?

139
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,520
Not interested.

140
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,280
I just want to get Brother Cui back quickly.

141
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,960
That's what I'm interested in.

142
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,440
Now hurry up.

143
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,240
Hurry!

144
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,240
Quick!

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,240
Down jackets!

146
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,400
Are we still playing?

147
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:50,920
Hey.

148
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,850
Is it fun always winning like this?

149
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,000
If only my life

150
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,240
could always be winning like this.

151
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,490
Unfortunately.

152
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,600
Right now

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,730
I've probably hit rock bottom.

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,730
Don't worry.

155
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,240
People who think they've hit rock bottom

156
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,480
usually haven't yet.

157
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,480
There's an even deeper bottom waiting for you.

158
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,520
I'm locked up with you

159
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,210
and that's not rock bottom?

160
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,800
Sure thing.

161
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,240
Auntie,

162
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,770
Xiaoxue's dog bit my turtle and made it bleed.

163
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,400
Did it die?

164
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,080
No, but it's badly injured.

165
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,920
Very serious. I bandaged it up.

166
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,640
When is Uncle coming back?

167
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,200
If he doesn't come back soon to weld the dog cage,

168
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
my turtle won't survive three days.

169
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,640
What a day.

170
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,560
Hey.

171
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,960
The motorcycle and nesting dolls are all put away.

172
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,480
How are you doing over there?

173
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,280
Pretty good.

174
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,080
Well,

175
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,600
give those four nesting dolls

176
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,720
to the children.

177
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,360
Oh my goodness, Xiaozhi is still so young.

178
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,820
Can he even play with them?

179
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,400
When are you coming back?

180
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,040
Soon.

181
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,120
I need to go for a business meeting.

182
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,850
You carry on.

183
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,960
Hanging up,

184
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,480
okay?

185
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,960
You lie so easily.

186
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,820
I'm very busy with business here.

187
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,680
What am I supposed to tell my wife?

188
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,920
That I've been locked up

189
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,120
because of a honey trap?

190
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,280
If you have a wife,

191
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,200
why are you out here fooling around?

192
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,680
Who's fooling around?

193
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,600
Hello.

194
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,720
My two good friends,

195
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,890
are you comfortable staying here?

196
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
You're here.

197
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,680
Just a few more hours until it's time.

198
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,280
Are you confident about this?

199
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,480
Absolutely.

200
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,360
Why don't we make a call to confirm?

201
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,080
No need. Just wait.

202
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,020
I was just telling Brother Cui

203
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,520
that such a nice girl like you,

204
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,050
why would you be doing this?

205
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,880
Listen to me.

206
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,540
Let's change our profession.

207
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,520
You're lecturing me.

208
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,440
Then let me lecture you too.

209
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,480
In the future, when good opportunities fall from the sky,

210
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,140
especially beautiful women,

211
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,080
you'd better think twice.

212
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,680
Otherwise,

213
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,560
you'll get burned again.

214
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,680
What do you mean?

215
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,360
What do I mean?

216
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,890
There's no mirror in this pool hall

217
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,040
so you can't see yourself.

218
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,160
The way you talk is just too-

219
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,360
Shut up.

220
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,120
In a year

221
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,760
I deal with hundreds of clients.

222
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,040
But someone as decent

223
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,130
and straightforward as you

224
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,880
I don't meet even one all year.

225
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,720
But there's something I'm confused about.

226
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,640
How could someone as smart

227
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,000
and cultured as you

228
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,440
be doing business

229
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,960
with those two guys?

230
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,080
If they can't gather 20,000

231
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,200
what do you plan to do?

232
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
Just kill me then.

233
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,760
We wouldn't dare.

234
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,800
If you don't dare, then get out.

235
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,460
We'll deal with that if they can't get the money.

236
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,720
Your personality

237
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,920
I really like it.

238
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,000
If the money's not enough

239
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,880
you'll be in trouble.

240
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,800
If you've got the guts, kill me.

241
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,240
You said it yourself.

242
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,240
Do you dare?

243
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,600
Just try it.

244
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,680
Why do you think she doesn't dare to kill you

245
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,810
but dares to kill me?

246
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,160
Thirty years ago,

247
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,000
my teacher said something.

248
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,640
What was it?

249
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,890
You're not serious enough.

250
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,580
What does 'not serious enough' mean?

251
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,760
Anyway, my teacher said the same about me.

252
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,040
I have a friend outside

253
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,940
who's not serious either.

254
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,720
You two would definitely get along well if you met.

255
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,240
Direct from

256
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
Direct from

257
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,760
Direct from factory!

258
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,160
You shout, I can't.

259
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,760
We still need 2,300.

260
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,480
How many hours left?

261
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,720
100 yuan per item, only one hour left.

262
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,000
Hurry up and sell. Come on!

263
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,640
Come get your down jackets!

264
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,760
Clearance sale!

265
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,440
Clearance sale! Down jackets!

266
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,720
100 yuan each!

267
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,960
100 yuan each! Come take a look!

268
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,520
Super thick and warm!

269
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,240
100 yuan each!

270
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,840
Just 100! Come see!

271
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,800
Direct from factory!

272
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,880
100 yuan each!

273
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,840
How are these down jackets from this morning?

274
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,400
Not bad.

275
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,320
I've brought my friend here.

276
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
My friend says

277
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,760
if you can lower the price,

278
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,420
he'll take as many as you have.

279
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,080
How much cheaper do you want?

280
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,320
Not a penny less.

281
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,000
Are you stupid?

282
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,960
We're selling them for 100 yuan.

283
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,040
Right.

284
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,920
If we weren't trying to

285
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,040
get our friend back...

286
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,800
No, wait.

287
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,840
What nonsense are you talking?

288
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,440
Nonsense!

289
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,720
Five yuan off each,

290
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,760
and I'll take them all.

291
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,840
Not a penny less.

292
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,160
Two yuan off each?

293
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,400
Not a penny less.

294
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,640
How many do you have in total?

295
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,360
Over 300 pieces.

296
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,000
That's not so many.

297
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,760
Will they fit?

298
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,080
They're at the hotel.

299
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Let's go check somewhere else.

300
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,340
Too expensive.

301
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,880
It's getting dark soon.

302
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,620
Let's go with them.

303
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,280
Let's go.

304
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,800
To the hotel.

305
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,080
Move.

306
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,340
Let's go see the goods.

307
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,480
Come on!

308
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,680
Get in the car.

309
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,010
Come.

310
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,450
Get out for a moment.

311
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,440
There's a small hill, help push.

312
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,920
There's a small slope here.

313
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
You two brothers,

314
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,200
wait in the lobby.

315
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,520
Okay.

316
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,640
Quick, let's go.

317
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,840
Take it easy.

318
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,160
That's 312 pieces, right?

319
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,440
Yes, 312.

320
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,280
All accounted for?

321
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,880
All here.

322
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,640
312 pieces,

323
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,680
totaling

324
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,400
6,240 German marks.

325
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,800
Can we make money on this?

326
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,200
Definitely profitable.

327
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,720
Count it.

328
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,360
Already counted.

329
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,760
Hey.

330
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,160
I now have a large amount of

331
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,960
German... uh...

332
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,120
You mean marks, right?

333
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,240
Right.

334
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,680
I misspoke.

335
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,800
So how much do you have?

336
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,840
I have about

337
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,240
6,000 German marks.

338
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,240
You said it was a lot.

339
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,680
I thought it would be more.

340
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,600
That's still over 30,000 yuan.

341
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,320
I'm now in Yake Town.

342
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,180
How long will it take to get there?

343
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,180
About half an hour.

344
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,240
Right, wait for me in the lobby.

345
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,300
Don't go anywhere.

346
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,200
We'll wait.

347
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,800
You go ahead with your business.

348
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,000
We'll be leaving now.

349
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,570
Wait.

350
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,680
Where are you taking this stuff?

351
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,040
I can deliver it for you.

352
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,570
We've already called a car.

353
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,480
Could you help us carry it out later?

354
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,720
Sure, let's go.

355
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,720
Come on.

356
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,880
Pleasure doing business with you.

357
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,160
Pleasure doing business with you.

358
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,800
Pleasure doing business.

359
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,320
It's already past one o'clock.

360
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,850
Why hasn't your money exchanger shown up yet?

361
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,930
What's the rush?

362
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,680
What's the rush?

363
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,010
How can I not be anxious?

364
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,060
Hurry up and call that person.

365
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,280
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

366
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,960
Please try again later.

367
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,880
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

368
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,210
Please try again later.

369
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,960
This should be Peruvian currency, right?

370
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,760
Peru.

371
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,640
Is this a Peruvian?

372
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,080
Isn't this German marks?

373
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,240
This is Peruvian currency.

374
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,880
And it's an outdated version that's no longer valid.

375
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,540
Definitely not German marks.

376
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,400
Let's go ask somewhere else.

377
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,680
I suggest you two go directly to the police station.

378
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,600
File a report.

379
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,880
Hurry up.

380
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,120
Go quickly.

381
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,600
People are so cruel.

382
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,480
I've let Cui down.

383
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,780
Enough already. Stop being so pathetic.

384
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,640
Do you think we should

385
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,200
also report that incident

386
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,480
at the hotel

387
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
when we were scammed?

388
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,880
No way.

389
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,560
In that case, Cui would be the rapist.

390
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,680
Who are you calling a rapist?

391
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,540
Say that again.

392
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,330
I dare you to say that again.

393
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm just talking about the situation.

394
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,600
I'm not saying he is one.

395
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,570
So how many cases should we report?

396
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,480
How many? Just report one.

397
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,320
Come

398
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,240
take a look.

399
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,880
No problem.

400
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,410
Just sign and fingerprint.

401
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,170
Wait, you're

402
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,680
reading it upside down?

403
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,540
Right side up or upside down, it's all the same to me.

404
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,440
I've been a police officer for many years,

405
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,040
but this is the first time I've seen such a skill.

406
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,400
If you call this a skill,

407
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,080
then there are plenty of people in our village

408
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,200
who can do the same.

409
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,240
So your village is pretty impressive then?

410
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,570
Impressive? Not at all.

411
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,080
None of us can read.

412
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,800
You can't read,

413
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,360
yet you've been staring at it.

414
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,640
What are you looking at?

415
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,800
You're a police officer. If you tell me to look, how can I not?

416
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,760
Officer,

417
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,200
look at this part here.

418
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,800
Then,

419
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,160
Liu Fugui and I

420
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,400
loaded more than 300 down jackets

421
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,720
onto the truck.

422
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,680
Just this part,

423
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,560
can you delete it?

424
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,360
Why? Is there a problem?

425
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:34,880
This part

426
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,600
makes it look like we were sold

427
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,400
and then counting money for someone else.

428
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,200
It's in black and white,

429
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,440
so embarrassing.

430
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,930
Is this the truth or not?

431
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,960
Well, yes.

432
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,680
No problem.

433
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,360
Sign here

434
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
and fingerprint.

435
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,280
Officer,

436
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,400
can he sign for me?

437
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,240
Can't you write your own name?

438
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,920
I'll do the fingerprint myself.

439
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,240
Liu

440
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,800
Da?

441
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,920
Liu Da.

442
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,620
Traditional characters.

443
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,800
To be precise, it's seal script.

444
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,520
Sign in simplified characters below.

445
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,680
Calligraphy can use traditional characters.

446
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,130
So this is calligraphy?

447
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,480
Fine.

448
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,160
Looking at you two,

449
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,400
you're not really cut out for business.

450
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,250
Scams like this Peruvian currency scheme

451
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,720
disappeared from our area two years ago.

452
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,320
Today,

453
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,120
you two have broken that record.

454
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,960
Take this.

455
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,080
In the future,

456
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,100
whenever you spend over 200 yuan,

457
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,360
call this number and ask for me.

458
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,920
I'll be your free consultant.

459
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,800
Really?

460
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,210
That would be great.

461
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,770
So now we have connections in the police department.

462
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,080
Where are we going now?

463
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,860
Let's go find Brother Cui.

464
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,240
We're still short

465
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,760
about 2,000 yuan.

466
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,160
Just 18,000.

467
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,220
Take it or leave it.

468
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,720
What if they don't accept it?

469
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,200
If they don't,

470
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,880
we'll report it to the police.

471
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:32,880
Oh right,

472
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,640
don't you have a police friend?

473
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,960
That's true.

474
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,240
But I have another idea.

475
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,560
Tell me.

476
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,880
If we succeed

477
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,220
we won't need to bother my police friend.

478
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,850
Look, we still have about an hour left.

479
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,280
I have two more counterfeit bills here.

480
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,040
Why don't we try

481
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,600
to find someone even more foolish to scam?

482
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,700
Give me a break.

483
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,820
Could we find anyone dumber than you?

484
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,400
Sit down.

485
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,760
Block all the doors.

486
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,600
Block them completely.

487
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,680
Got it.

488
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,360
Get ready to leave.

489
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:08,920
My people are here.

490
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,720
Let's go.

491
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,440
Come on.

492
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,840
Move.

493
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,080
Go.

494
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,360
Is this how...

495
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,240
Brother Cui.

496
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,690
Brother Cui.

497
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,460
Fierce tiger climbing the mountain.

498
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,520
Stop fighting blindly.

499
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,920
Whoever hits Brother Cui, we hit them back.

500
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,400
Fierce tiger...

501
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,360
Hurry!

502
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,400
Old Liu!

503
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,000
Old Liu!

504
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,640
Liu! Brother Liu!

505
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,570
What's wrong with Brother Liu?

506
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,240
Brother Liu will be fine.

507
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,160
Let's go.

508
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,720
Old Liu!

509
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,800
Old Liu!

510
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,460
Hurry up, brother.

511
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,360
Quick!

512
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,080
Cui.

513
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,800
Cui.

514
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,080
I've really caused you trouble.

515
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,280
It's okay.

516
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,880
You didn't mean to.

517
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,760
People can be so deceitful.

518
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,400
But don't worry.

519
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,480
I'll definitely earn back

520
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,400
the money we were scammed out of.

521
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,640
No need.

522
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,680
I insist.

523
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,840
I must.

524
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,200
Really.

525
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,040
Doctor.

526
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,840
They're all external injuries.

527
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,400
Actually,

528
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
it's nothing serious.

529
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,920
But the patient lost a lot of blood.

530
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,880
After a few days of rest,

531
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
he should be fine.

532
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,000
Let the patient get some rest.

533
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,260
Come back tomorrow if you need anything.

534
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,640
Brother,

535
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,560
where are we going now?

536
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,760
To file a report.

537
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,800
Great.

538
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,880
I know someone

539
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,180
at the police station.

540
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,400
I really do know someone at the police station.

541
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,480
Got into another fight?

542
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,120
No, this time

543
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,800
we're reporting a fraud case.

544
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,200
A fraud case?

545
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,120
Business is really booming for you.

546
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,800
Just me alone,

547
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,960
coming to you twice in one day.

548
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,520
Thanks a lot.

549
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,690
What happened? Tell me.

550
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,960
Well...

551
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,280
It's basically this situation.

552
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,160
Let me see.

553
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
No problem.

554
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,560
Sign here.

555
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:11,880
Don't use

556
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,800
that cursive writing of yours again.

557
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Seal script.

558
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,960
You're Liu Da, right?

559
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,560
So you're saying

560
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,680
you've been here for four days?

561
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,840
Scammed twice.

562
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,280
In fights twice.

563
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,160
To be precise,

564
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,450
beaten up twice.

565
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,400
You've had it rough.

566
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,280
I think

567
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,480
maybe it's really not suitable

568
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,610
for you to stay here.

569
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,280
When are you planning to go back?

570
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,040
I'm staying here to develop my career.

571
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,720
Then maybe

572
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,850
you should reconsider this decision.

573
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,140
No need to reconsider.

574
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,400
I've made up my mind.

575
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,880
I must make something of myself.

576
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,850
If you're staying here,

577
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
we'll see each other again in a few days.

578
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,360
Definitely.

579
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,120
Aren't we friends now?

580
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,400
We'll definitely hang out often,

581
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,000
grab some food and drinks,

582
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,810
we'll definitely meet.

583
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,640
Forget it. We have regulations.

584
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,680
Before you arrived,

585
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,340
we just arrested a group of people for fighting.

586
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,520
They should be the ones who scammed you

587
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,240
and the same people who fought with you.

588
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,360
I'll take you to identify them.

589
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,020
Why didn't you say so earlier?

590
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,440
Well, we have

591
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,100
our own procedures to follow.

592
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,740
Why should I report to you?

593
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,520
Aren't we friends?

594
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,160
Let's go.

595
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,480
Follow behind.

596
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,340
Get in quickly.

597
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,320
It's them.

598
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,080
There he is.

599
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,240
Can you please put in a good word for us?

600
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,360
Please.

601
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,160
I'm sorry.

602
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,360
We know we were wrong.

603
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,600
Please, I'm begging you.

604
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,720
Please.

605
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:15,810
Brother.

606
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,530
Brother.

607
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,960
But I

608
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,320
No.

609
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,850
already made my statement.

610
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,320
I...

611
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:30,640
No.

612
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,040
It's really a misunderstanding, brother.

613
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,640
Xiaofei.

614
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,840
Cui.

615
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,080
Who's this idiot?

616
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
Who are you calling an idiot?

617
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,280
I'm talking about you.

618
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:43,920
Got a problem with that?

619
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,480
Stop.

620
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,520
Why are you hitting me?

621
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,480
Would I hit you if you didn't hit me first?

622
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,600
And you say I have a problem?

623
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,880
Let's go another round then.

624
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,400
You think I'm scared of you?

625
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,840
Bring it on!

626
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,120
Alright.

627
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,960
Everyone calm down.

628
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,200
This is a police station.

629
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,520
Don't cause trouble here.

630
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,080
Let's go.

631
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,360
Stop.

632
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,560
We're all friends here.

633
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,640
Shake hands and make peace.

634
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,440
Listen to me.

635
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,720
Do me a favor.

636
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,560
Cui,

637
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,320
is this the troublemaker friend

638
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,650
you were talking about?

639
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
What do you mean by 'troublemaker'?

640
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,120
You're both troublemakers.

641
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,650
You'll definitely become friends. Trust me.

642
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,520
Hey.

643
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,640
How have you been these days?

644
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,930
Pretty good.

645
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,200
When are you coming back?

646
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,040
It'll be a while longer.

647
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,560
Come back soon.

648
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,440
What's wrong?

649
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,000
You seem down.

650
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,090
No, I'm fine.

651
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,360
That's good then.

652
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,260
Come home soon.

653
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,600
Mengmeng and Erpang miss you.

654
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,200
I miss them too.

655
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,900
And you as well.

656
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,320
How about

657
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,320
you stay and start a business with me?

658
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,570
After losing so much money,

659
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,120
it's hard to face your wife.

660
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,720
Just watch TV.

661
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,160
What did you mean

662
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,440
by 'troublemaker'?

663
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,850
Figure it out yourself.

664
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,440
Cui.

665
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,840
You're amazing.

666
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
How could you tell

667
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,280
I was born premature?

668
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,080
It's obvious.

669
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,800
My mom said I was

670
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,000
born a full month premature.

671
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Just one month?

672
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,120
How long do you think it was?

673
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,800
At least a month and a half.

674
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,040
Really?

675
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,520
I should go back and ask my mom.

676
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,960
That guy who fought with me,

677
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,400
is he the same as me?

678
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,400
Yes, probably.

679
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,120
So he's also a month and a half?

680
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,560
He must be two months.

681
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,120
So is that good or bad?

682
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,480
Alright, he's smart.

683
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,280
Then he's smarter than me.

684
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,180
You two are about the same.

685
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,700
What are you doing?

686
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,380
I need to go to work.

687
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,000
What work?

688
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,210
Where are you going to work?

689
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
This is my job.

690
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,170
After I earn some money,

691
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,330
I'll buy canned food for Lao Liu

692
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,440
and milk powder.

693
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,960
If you have any problems, go to the police.

694
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,240
Isn't there a police phone?

695
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,600
Come back in one piece.

696
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,560
We'll go back once you're better.

697
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,800
This whole trip with you,

698
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,040
I haven't been any help,

699
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,160
and I've cost you money.

700
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Don't talk like that, Liu.

701
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,800
You got hurt because of me.

702
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,840
Being alive

703
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,260
is more important than anything.

704
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,240
Alive...

705
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,840
Just being alive is good.

706
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,080
Do you know

707
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,880
what I want to do most?

708
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,880
What is it?

709
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,280
When I have money someday,

710
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,680
I want to buy that hill next to my hometown,

711
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,000
find myself a wife,

712
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,880
and live up there together.

713
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,720
I'll be the king of the mountain.

714
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,960
I'll grow whatever I want.

715
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,520
I'll raise whatever animals I like.

716
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,760
Everything there will be mine.

717
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,840
Even if a rabbit appears on the hill someday,

718
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,290
it will have my surname Liu.

719
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,370
Where's the tattoo guy?

720
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,840
He went out on his cart

721
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,240
to buy you some milk powder

722
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,970
and nutritional supplements.

723
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,120
Hello?

724
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,800
Hi,

725
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,120
are you Cui Guoming?

726
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,650
Yes, I am.

727
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,720
About that case you reported,

728
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,560
the counterfeit Peruvian currency fraud,

729
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,760
we've recovered your money.

730
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,400
Come to our police station to sign,

731
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,720
and collect your money.

732
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,440
Great.

733
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,160
Thank you very much.

734
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,600
Here it comes.

735
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,719
I've got 6 motorcycles again.

736
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,010
But I don't have any down jackets left.

737
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,120
Why is the store next door closed?

738
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,239
No idea.

739
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,159
Yesterday a group of police officers

740
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,199
took them away.

741
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,239
It couldn't be because of illegal trafficking, could it?

742
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,920
That's certainly possible.

743
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,520
Were they trafficking for you?

744
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,440
Alright. Today

745
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,160
we're all going back home.

746
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,480
You don't need to go pedal your rickshaw anymore.

747
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,560
I'm not going back.

748
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm staying here.

749
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,080
Forget it.

750
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,800
We're checking out of the room soon.

751
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,930
Where will you stay?

752
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,600
I've already found a place.

753
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,240
90 yuan per month.

754
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,520
I won't go back until

755
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,250
I make something of myself.

756
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,840
Go to sleep.

757
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,680
Look at you,

758
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,920
buying four of everything.

759
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,840
Four chocolates.

760
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,880
Four milk powders.

761
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,880
Even four matryoshka dolls.

762
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,260
You're really exhausting yourself.

763
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,480
That's what keeps me going.

764
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,360
[In Russian] Put it back.

765
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,800
[In Russian] Don't touch if you're not buying.

766
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,360
How much?

767
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,920
[In Russian] 600.

768
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,600
Take it, brother.

769
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,720
There are foreign women over there.

770
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,520
I bought it.

771
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,080
Really?

772
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,960
If you keep insulting your customers,

773
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,920
you'll lose

774
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,650
many business opportunities.

775
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,210
[In Russian] Keep smiling.

776
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,360
Cui.

777
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,480
Is that the Soviet Union over there?

778
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,810
It's called Russia now.

779
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,360
Even countries change their names.

780
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,880
Look over there.

781
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,080
Maybe we'll see some pretty girls.

782
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,640
Cui.

783
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,720
Let me speak from the heart.

784
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
Thank you so much.

785
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,920
I grew up without parents.

786
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,180
Nobody treated me like a human being.

787
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,000
I've lived for over 50 years.

788
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,930
I've never received a gift before.

789
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,530
This is my first one.

790
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,120
I really love this.

791
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,160
You and Huo.

792
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,560
You're both good people.

793
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,040
The best people.

794
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,000
I've ever met in my life.

795
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,000
Really.

796
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:16,800
Cui.

797
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,200
In the future,

798
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,340
what would you do if you had money?

799
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,640
Well,

800
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,960
I once

801
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,420
promised my daughter I'd buy her a Xiali car.

802
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,280
Then I lost my job.

803
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,520
So that car

804
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,610
never happened.

805
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,680
Now I finally have some money.

806
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,560
But there are more children at home now.

807
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,320
They're growing up fast.

808
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,000
I need to buy them a villa

809
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,800
and create better living conditions.

810
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,280
Look at you.

811
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,680
I don't mean to criticize,

812
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,880
but you always think about others.

813
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,560
When will you think about yourself?

814
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,320
Do you know

815
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,480
why I always protect Dada?

816
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,640
Why?

817
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,680
Because there's a Dada living in my heart too.

818
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,640
He's so much like how I used to be.

819
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,160
As life went on,

820
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,880
I forgot about that Dada.

821
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,440
Now I'm

822
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,480
almost forty,

823
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,400
a man with a family to support.

824
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,000
How can we afford to think about ourselves?

825
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,800
Why wouldn't you have the right?

826
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,480
I just remembered,

827
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,940
when you go back, find a shop for Huo quickly.

828
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,970
I almost forgot about that.

829
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,160
This one you're riding now is fine.

830
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,200
Second only to me.

831
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:58,920
We're here.

832
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,720
Good.

833
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,880
It's not too late to come with us now.

834
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,560
What about this bike?

835
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,360
Leave it.

836
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,320
I have to make something of myself

837
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,250
before I go back.

838
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,720
With this?

839
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,530
This is just the beginning.

840
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,760
In a year,

841
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,640
it will become a car.

842
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,480
In three years,

843
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,800
it will become a fleet.

844
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,840
I thought it would become a train in three years.

845
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,220
So are you still getting tattoos?

846
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,920
Let's survive first.

847
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,800
I'll get back to it when I recover.

848
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,240
Brother, I've been thinking about a lot of things lately.

849
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,480
I feel that before,

850
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,320
I thought too simply

851
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,000
and acted recklessly.

852
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,520
Thank you for putting up with me.

853
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,040
I wrote you a letter.

854
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,810
Open it when you have time tonight.

855
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,760
I hope you can

856
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,220
return home in glory soon.

857
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,360
It's normal for men to brag.

858
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,200
But a real man

859
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,960
must follow through

860
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,780
on every promise he makes.

861
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,280
Take care.

862
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,440
Take care.

863
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,370
If you run into trouble,

864
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,200
you can still call me.

865
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,480
We're here.

866
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,640
Thank you.

867
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,920
Children.

868
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,680
Guess what?

869
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,240
I...

870
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,400
What gives you the right to live in our home?

871
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,360
By what right?

872
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,360
You think because you're in your house

873
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,480
you can bully us?

874
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,920
You think you can do whatever you want in your house?

875
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,240
Stop disrupting our studies.

876
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,970
You're always interfering with our schoolwork.

877
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,200
What's going on here?
