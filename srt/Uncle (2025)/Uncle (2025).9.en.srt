1
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,640
These are made by my uncle.

2
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,640
They only cost 19.9 yuan.

3
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,740
Aren't they better than those selling for over 100?

4
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,560
How does your uncle know how to do everything?

5
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,680
Of course. He's my uncle after all.

6
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,560
My uncle said,

7
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,759
take these glasses home first,

8
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,080
tell your parents

9
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,320
they only cost 19.9 yuan.

10
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,000
If your parents agree to pay,

11
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,320
bring the money to me tomorrow.

12
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,320
If they don't want to pay,

13
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,000
just return the glasses to me tomorrow.

14
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh, and

15
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,320
don't break them.

16
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,440
You'll have to pay me 19.9 yuan if you do.

17
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Great!

18
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,079
Uncle.

19
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,050
Eight classmates have paid

20
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,240
and the other two were taken by other students.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,640
Not bad, kid.

22
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,880
Can I have another 100?

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A hundred?

24
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,420
Can you really sell that many?

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,329
If I can't sell them, I'll bring them back.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
Interesting.

27
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,560
Here you go.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,760
Uncle,

29
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,820
I have another idea to share with you.

30
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,160
Wei.

31
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,600
Could you knock more quietly?

32
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,400
I thought it was a gambling raid.

33
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
I was knocking so loud.

34
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,020
I've been knocking for five minutes.

35
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,980
Look at all this fun. Hurry up.

36
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,250
Have a seat, Cui.

37
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,520
Give this to Huo.

38
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,700
What is this thing?

39
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,760
He loves Scottish bagpipes.

40
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,079
There's a tune called 'Amazing Grace'.

41
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,520
But those bagpipes are too big.

42
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,760
I couldn't find one to buy.

43
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,290
The sound is quite similar.

44
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,640
Will this work?

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
It will. Look, try it yourself.

46
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,450
What's going on?

47
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
I'm not dead.

48
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,200
You guys carry on.

49
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,450
That's terrifying.

50
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,160
They're saluting the music.

51
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,330
How's Erpang doing?

52
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,079
He's doing great.

53
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,959
He helped me sell 300 pairs of glasses the other day.

54
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,839
What glasses?

55
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,280
Pinhole glasses.

56
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,480
They correct vision.

57
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,640
You're making glasses again?

58
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,080
Yes.

59
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,040
I just started.

60
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,840
The first batch produced

61
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,900
over 10,000 pairs.

62
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,760
How is it?

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,640
Looks great.

64
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,320
Really cool,

65
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,159
man.

66
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Twelve pairs in total.

67
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,520
Let me pay you.

68
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,840
No need.

69
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,400
Don't worry about it.

70
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,720
You really don't have to.

71
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,480
These are corrective glasses.

72
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Is this enough?

73
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,520
We can adjust if needed.

74
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,400
200 is enough.

75
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,440
Twelve pairs.

76
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,850
Give me two hundred.

77
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:58,840
No.

78
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,400
Their eyesight is fine.

79
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,720
You don't actually need to buy them any.

80
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,280
Even good eyesight needs maintenance, right?

81
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,520
Their eyes are actually fine.

82
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,920
Even if you buy these, they won't wear them.

83
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,080
What card is this, Sanhua?

84
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,960
Is this a spade or a club?

85
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,960
Hey, Ermao!

86
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,720
Brother.

87
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,720
Hey, boss, where are you?

88
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,580
I can't see you.

89
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,760
Damn.

90
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,480
You guys...

91
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,520
So well-trained.

92
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,480
This is really something.

93
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,410
Without your glasses, you'll all go blind tomorrow.

94
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,840
You're short eleven pairs.

95
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,480
Walk me out. Let's go.

96
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
Take all of these.

97
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,730
Alright.

98
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,760
We must support your business.

99
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,850
But have you thought about something?

100
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,280
If one Erpang can sell so much at school,

101
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,920
what if we develop an Erpang in every school?

102
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,720
You're a genius!

103
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,180
It's like our fish market.

104
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,920
People come from many cities to buy our silver carp wholesale.

105
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,480
I have my brothers connect with each city.

106
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,840
This way we get more familiar,

107
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,480
and business keeps getting better.

108
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,000
Our city has over 100 primary and secondary schools.

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If we develop an Erpang in each school,

110
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,260
you won't worry about sales anymore.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,720
Erpang thinks just like you.

112
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,240
Genius.

113
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,200
I've been learning about business lately.

114
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,620
We have many brothers.

115
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,960
I can send my brothers

116
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,890
to help you expand to every school.

117
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,320
No.

118
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,410
No need, no need.

119
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,540
Don't be like that.

120
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,320
We've been doing legitimate business lately.

121
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,960
I know.

122
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,000
I believe you.

123
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm going now.

124
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Some of you

125
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,140
think this place is

126
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,200
too small,

127
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,920
too shabby,

128
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,440
too terrible.

129
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,200
So,

130
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,840
I want to tell you all a true story.

131
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,320
I discovered a company

132
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,000
called Sancheng.

133
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,080
Their founder

134
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,320
used to

135
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,480
sell salted fish and rice.

136
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,200
In 1979,

137
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,840
He bet all his capital.

138
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,240
And shifted to

139
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,450
the technology sector,

140
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,840
specifically the powerful semiconductor industry.

141
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,560
Today,

142
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,800
Sancheng

143
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,800
has become a world-class

144
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,200
semiconductor technology company.

145
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,060
Would you say that's impressive?

146
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,320
Tell me loudly,

147
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,480
is it impressive or not?

148
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,800
Impressive!

149
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,240
Our goal

150
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,080
is first to become Donglin's Sancheng Electronics,

151
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,560
and then to surpass Sancheng.

152
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,560
We will build our aircraft carrier here.

153
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,320
We will build our spaceship here.

154
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,080
Spaceship!

155
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,320
Great!

156
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,440
With my encouragement,

157
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,980
my uncle expanded production capacity.

158
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,800
For my first pot of gold,

159
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,040
I actively mobilized my friends

160
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,280
to join my money-making venture.

161
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,160
We're using a system where we get the goods first and pay later.

162
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,800
Each of us

163
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,520
can get 100 pinhole glasses from me.

164
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,400
The wholesale price is 16 yuan,

165
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,080
and we'll set the retail price at 19.9 yuan.

166
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,240
In the first week,

167
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,480
if we can sell all these glasses,

168
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,440
then we'll be rich.

169
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,080
Say a few more words to us.

170
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,180
When will you take me along to make money?

171
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
Just focus on selling your barbecue.

172
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
I don't want to do barbecue anymore.

173
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,440
I want to join you in the pinhole business.

174
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,200
I'll give you two words:

175
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,100
Deep cultivation.

176
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,450
What does that mean?

177
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,559
It means that you,

178
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,320
no matter what business you're in,

179
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,800
you need to master it completely.

180
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,960
This way, whatever you do,

181
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
you can become

182
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,200
a boss,

183
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,960
or even a leader.

184
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,970
The prerequisite is

185
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,570
you must have the spirit of deep cultivation.

186
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,860
Deep cultivation.

187
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,770
I'm going to take a leak.

188
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,160
Changed jobs four times in March.

189
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,240
Have you really committed to anything?

190
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,320
Can you sell these glasses any cheaper?

191
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,440
Can't do that.

192
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,600
We have a fixed price of 19.9.

193
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,760
Don't be so rigid.

194
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,880
Just sell them for 18.

195
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,480
Everyone will buy from you.

196
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,880
If you discount it by 1 yuan, I'll buy two pairs.

197
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,680
I'll buy a pair for my sister too.

198
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,520
Although Jingwei filling the sea is a mythological story,

199
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,360
however,

200
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,840
it contains very rich meaning.

201
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,320
Wang Ning.

202
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,720
Alright, 18.9 then.

203
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,320
Can't go any lower than that.

204
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,840
Stop counting.

205
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,520
Let the bank count it.

206
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,040
If you make a mistake,

207
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,320
they certainly won't.

208
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,200
I go to the bank every day.

209
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,440
Everyone there knows me now.

210
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,840
They all ask what I do

211
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,570
to make so much money every day.

212
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,160
What did you tell them?

213
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,520
How could I tell them?

214
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,800
I said it's all earned by my husband.

215
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,530
I don't know anything about it.

216
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,460
How much have we saved?

217
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,440
We've saved

218
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,040
over 170,000.

219
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,400
No, that's not right.

220
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,200
Let me see.

221
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
With this week, it should be over 190,000.

222
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Er Pang wants to organize another distribution meeting.

223
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,800
Probably

224
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,040
we can get another sum of money.

225
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,770
We're not far from 250,000 now.

226
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,840
Did you tell your father?

227
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,800
Of course I did.

228
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,080
Dad was so happy.

229
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,280
It proves that

230
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,320
Smart people are smart wherever they go.

231
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,280
I could help build a spacecraft,

232
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,680
so how could I not handle these few lousy glasses?

233
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,400
Really.

234
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,520
Just wait.

235
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,640
When I get my lawyer's license,

236
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,480
I'll post my results right on the factory bulletin board.

237
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,280
Look, there's money all over the bed.

238
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,740
It's so dirty. Take it out.

239
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,380
You're complaining that money is dirty?

240
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,560
Uncle Cui.

241
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,440
Can you come to my house?

242
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,320
My grandfather is dying.

243
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,560
What?

244
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,440
Hello?

245
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,840
My grandfather is dying.

246
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,200
Is he still alive?

247
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,800
Yes, he is.

248
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,330
Call 120 right away.

249
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,560
I did.

250
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,400
Wait at home.

251
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,530
I'll be right there.

252
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,160
Go to sleep.

253
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,200
What's wrong?

254
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,330
I need to go to the hospital.

255
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,740
Is our father sick?

256
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,400
No, it's Guo Dapao's father.

257
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,600
You scared me. It's the middle of the night.

258
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,560
Are you taking everything?

259
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,960
I'm taking it all anyway.

260
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,210
Go back to sleep.

261
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,840
What a rare visitor!

262
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,890
Who did you knock out this time?

263
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,040
You're not even injured.

264
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,450
A complete victory.

265
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,800
He's gone to the emergency room.

266
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,440
You're quite ruthless, kid.

267
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,930
Even worse than your brother-in-law.

268
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,440
Your brother-in-law hasn't been seen for days.

269
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,900
He's probably in jail now.

270
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,520
Your daughter...

271
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,260
The child is quite pretty.

272
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,080
But these clothes won't do.

273
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,940
Look at you all dressed up nicely.

274
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,720
While dressing the child like this.

275
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,160
They say raise girls rich and boys poor.

276
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,090
Girls should wear pretty clothes.

277
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,580
She's not my daughter.

278
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,800
Is it worth it?

279
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,800
Just buy some new clothes.

280
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,260
Don't abandon your child.

281
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,760
How is it?

282
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,120
We saved him.

283
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,020
But his condition isn't good.

284
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,120
How bad is it?

285
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,720
At best, he'll live a month or so.

286
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,360
And at worst?

287
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,160
Any time now.

288
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,410
Your father's hospital bills won't be cheap.

289
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,240
He's not my father.

290
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,640
He's my friend's father.

291
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,140
Where's your friend then?

292
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,500
Where do I pay the hospital bills?

293
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Grandpa.

294
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Grandpa.

295
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,440
Are you really going to bid?

296
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,680
You'll have to pay 250,000 at once.

297
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,200
That's a year's rent.

298
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,120
We have it.

299
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,440
When Old Mr. Cui was in office.

300
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,760
He took plenty of bribes.

301
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,960
My husband earned it.

302
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,180
Watch what you're saying.

303
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,720
How much did you spend at the hospital yesterday?

304
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,640
Not much.

305
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,440
How much exactly?

306
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,480
We're making quite a bit of money now.

307
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,280
Money isn't an issue.

308
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,880
What I'm worried about

309
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,540
is something else.

310
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,530
What are you worried about?

311
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,720
Well, you know,

312
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,160
Guo Xiaoxue

313
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,080
that girl,

314
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,200
she suddenly has

315
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,360
no one left.

316
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,000
Doesn't she have any relatives?

317
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,080
She's the only child for four generations.

318
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,410
So what do you want to do?

319
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,440
I don't know.

320
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,880
Do we have enough money

321
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
to take over Dingqing Restaurant?

322
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,280
Yes, definitely enough.

323
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,050
There's one more thing.

324
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,640
The bar exam results will be out soon.

325
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,900
Let's check tomorrow.

326
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,170
No need to check. It's a sure thing.

327
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,240
Looking at me?

328
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,880
Damn mouth.

329
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,200
At the second dealers' conference,

330
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
I repeatedly emphasized

331
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,360
that pinhole glasses cost 19.9 yuan

332
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,760
and that's exactly 19.9.

333
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,440
No one

334
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,300
has the right to lower the price on their own.

335
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,040
Even if I turn off the lights.

336
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,200
Even though I

337
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,200
emphasized this so clearly,

338
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,840
however,

339
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,360
among all of you here,

340
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,900
someone is still lowering prices without permission.

341
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,120
I hope

342
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,560
that you students

343
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,560
will voluntarily come forward

344
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,080
and pay the fine.

345
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,800
100 each.

346
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,340
When it's dark,

347
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,130
please close your eyes.

348
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,570
When it's light,

349
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,980
please open your eyes.

350
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,130
Very good. You're all very honest.

351
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,410
We have punishments

352
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,960
and we also have rewards.

353
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,280
Here's 600.

354
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
And personally,

355
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,410
I'm adding another 900.

356
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,120
That's 1,500 in total

357
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,400
as a reward for everyone's hard work lately.

358
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,880
Please come up

359
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,340
in an orderly manner to receive your reward.

360
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,680
Great success ahead!

361
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,520
Put it on my tab.

362
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,760
Great success ahead!

363
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,640
When will you take me to make money?

364
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,880
Do you remember what I told you last time?

365
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,680
I remember all of it.

366
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,400
Look at that pyramid.

367
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,440
There's nothing important

368
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,800
in any of this.

369
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,160
What is the important part?

370
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,690
There's only one key point:

371
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,780
Deep cultivation.

372
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,500
Deep cultivation?

373
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,839
But he didn't cultivate deeply either.

374
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,440
I guess in a month at most

375
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,040
our factory

376
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,680
will announce the first list of layoffs.

377
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,400
You

378
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,859
will definitely be the first one.

379
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,440
But I heard it's not bad though.

380
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,040
The severance package could be around 40,000 to 50,000.

381
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,520
The second batch

382
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,480
and the third batch

383
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,200
will be Zhao Hailong and me.

384
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,680
I'm not worried about you and me.

385
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,960
But if Hailong

386
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,200
gets laid off,

387
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,880
his wife

388
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,720
will take a pound of his flesh.

389
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,610
Enough, enough.

390
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,760
Hailong and his wife

391
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,800
if this continues,

392
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,600
I think something bad will happen sooner or later.

393
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,240
I heard

394
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,940
this will be contracted to individuals.

395
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,480
If that bastard Tang gets the contract,

396
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,480
I think our reputation will be ruined.

397
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,680
That would be the end.

398
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,970
Xiaomei would be finished too.

399
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,720
What if my father

400
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,290
contracted the Dingqing Restaurant?

401
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,250
What did you say?

402
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,720
Then I'll go back to Dingqing Restaurant to cook right away.

403
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,980
Then the salary can be the same as before.

404
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,440
If we contract it,

405
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,680
the salary absolutely cannot be the same as before.

406
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,000
Because it used to be a state-owned enterprise,

407
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,960
and the wages were fixed.

408
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,160
My father keeps talking at home

409
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
saying he's sorry to you

410
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,440
and has been thinking about raising your salary.

411
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
If I take over the contract,

412
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,300
you'll get paid what you deserve when you come back.

413
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,240
Young boss,

414
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,280
I mean,

415
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,880
Manager Cui,

416
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,650
I dream about returning to Dingqing Restaurant.

417
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,560
Don't speak.

418
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
I know everything.

419
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,280
You come to the door with your bag every day

420
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,240
waiting there with Ji Qiang.

421
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,880
All right,

422
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,960
it's settled.

423
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,730
The basket is all yours.

424
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,640
Is this watch accurate?

425
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,760
It must be accurate.

426
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,290
I set it by the evening news.

427
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,320
All right!

428
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,040
I'm so nervous.

429
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,320
My hands are shaking.

430
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,400
Student Cui Guoming,

431
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,160
exam score:

432
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,000
337 points.

433
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,680
What's wrong? What happened?

434
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,680
Sister-in-law, don't get excited.

435
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,800
It's almost a perfect score.

436
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,280
Sister-in-law,

437
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,960
the suspense is over.

438
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,000
Student Cui Guoming,

439
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,120
score...

440
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,320
My heart is pounding.

441
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,960
How is Brother Cui's brain wired?

442
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,040
Look at my Hailong,

443
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,240
he's like an idiot.

444
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,000
Who knows?

445
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,240
What are you all doing?

446
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,520
You're all wailing like ghosts.

447
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,240
Get back to work!

448
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,970
What's going on?

449
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,440
Do you know how many points you got?

450
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,400
I...

451
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,160
I don't know.

452
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,960
Almost a perfect score.

453
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,290
You definitely passed.

454
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,480
Is that surprising?

455
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,760
What's wrong?

456
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,100
Why aren't you excited at all?

457
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,440
Don't worry.

458
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,800
As long as I didn't write my exam number wrong,

459
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,440
this is definitely my score.

460
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
Fine, I won't chat with you anymore.

461
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,320
I'm going to buy you all soda.

462
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,480
Your good days

463
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,930
are coming soon.

464
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,680
You lowered your price more than I did.

465
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,040
Why should I be fined the same amount as you?

466
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,280
You were the first to lower the price.

467
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,940
You were the first to lower the price, you first.

468
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,160
Stop arguing.

469
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,160
Quiet down.

470
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,720
You kids,

471
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,680
why are you making such a racket?

472
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,140
What's all the fuss about?

473
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,440
We're just having some barbecue skewers.

474
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
Is that a problem?

475
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,840
Go buy me two bottles of alcohol.

476
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,320
Why should I buy you alcohol?

477
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,280
Don't you know what it means to respect your elders?

478
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
Understand?

479
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,160
25, 26, 27, 28, 29,

480
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,720
30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35.

481
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,000
That's enough, definitely enough.

482
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's definitely enough. 250,000.

483
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,730
And there's still so much left.

484
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,280
Don't get excited.

485
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,320
The best is yet to come.

486
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
I'm studying.

487
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,520
I want to study with you.

488
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,620
What are you doing?

489
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,040
Let's get him!

490
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,760
No, no. Where is he?

491
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,520
I'm just afraid those parents will give me trouble.

492
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,600
Don't do this.

493
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,280
Put those weapons down.

494
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,440
Just bring two people.

495
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,280
What happened?

496
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,280
I'll tell you on the way.

497
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,960
Just bring two people.

498
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,490
Put those weapons down now.

499
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,680
Take this.

500
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,080
Put all the tools away.

501
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,330
You two come with me.

502
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,040
I'm organizing a dealers' conference.

503
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,960
I'm an adult.

504
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,160
Look.

505
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,920
What are you doing?

506
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,720
Hey buddy,

507
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,820
why are you here again?

508
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,200
Are you having some health issues lately?

509
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,000
Is it serious?

510
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,520
Let me give you a thorough check-up.

511
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,280
No need.

512
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,520
Everything okay?

513
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,720
No, nothing's wrong.

514
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,080
I must have misunderstood.

515
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,540
Did you hurt someone else?

516
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,490
Taking someone down? Impressive!

517
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,360
Which ward are they in?

518
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,280
Take me to see them.

519
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,040
As long as they're not dead,

520
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,280
I can save them.

521
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,240
Don't worry,

522
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,680
I won't let you get into legal trouble.

523
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,000
Don't you trust my skills?

524
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,330
A child came in earlier,

525
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,720
in critical condition.

526
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,760
If any other doctor had been on duty, the kid would've been done for.

527
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,240
I only needed 20 minutes

528
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,960
to bring that child back from the brink.

529
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,680
The father was so moved

530
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,280
that he fell to his knees before me.

531
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,280
I told him, 'Get up, what are you doing?'

532
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,200
A man shouldn't kneel so easily.

533
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,600
Let's not talk about that.

534
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,200
The point is,

535
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,960
saving lives is our duty as doctors.

536
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,760
I can help him.

537
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,450
What do you mean?

538
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,520
I've already saved your child.

539
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,440
You need to trust my medical skills.

540
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,000
There won't be any aftereffects.

541
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,680
In three days, they'll be back at school

542
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,740
and ready to learn.

543
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,600
Calm down, Xiao Cui.

544
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,680
You're a good person.

545
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,240
Now that this has happened

546
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,080
we need to resolve it.

547
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,280
Can I represent you against his family?

548
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,680
Don't ask for too much.

549
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,320
If you demand 50,000 or 80,000,

550
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,000
but he can only afford 5,000 or 10,000, right?

551
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,680
It's better to settle this nicely.

552
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,760
Why not become friends?

553
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
Right?

554
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,290
Just shake hands like this.

555
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,160
See, when you pull like this,

556
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,240
what are you pulling?

557
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,320
Look, you're stronger than him.

558
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,850
That's what friendship is.

559
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,560
Isn't it nice to be friends?

560
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,520
No need. I'm not doing you any favors.

561
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,800
I would've hit him already.

562
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,760
I don't want compensation.

563
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,280
No matter how poor we are, I don't need this money.

564
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,360
Then what do you want?

565
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,490
I want to report him.

566
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,940
I'll report him to the Education Bureau.

567
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,560
I'll report him to the Commerce Bureau.

568
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,720
I'll report him to the police.

569
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,160
Alright, brother.

570
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,760
This is a hospital.

571
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,520
Why are you shouting?

572
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,080
Just tell me what you want.

573
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,520
He's scum.

574
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,080
What are you saying?

575
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,210
He's scum who even exploits children.

576
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,760
Don't you realize your words are hurtful?

577
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,680
What do I gain from this?

578
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,760
I'm trying to help you both solve a problem.

579
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,520
Why are you yelling here?

580
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,160
You're so frustrating.

581
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,560
I still have to save you, after all.

582
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,520
There aren't enough beds for everyone.

583
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,960
You should go back and check on your child.

584
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,000
Buy two cans of food for the child.

585
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,960
Let me pay for it, okay?

586
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,520
Alright.

587
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,520
He's just a scumbag.

588
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
That's enough. Don't scare the lady.

589
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
She just had surgery.

590
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,720
You need to go back to bed.

591
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,980
Your incision might reopen. Go back now.

592
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
As early as March last year,

593
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,480
authoritative overseas media

594
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,040
reported on

595
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,800
these pinhole glasses.

596
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,100
It doesn't cure myopia at all.

597
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,340
What are you all doing with your jobs?

598
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,650
Letting such a useless thing become popular in schools.

599
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,960
Many students

600
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,560
are in class

601
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
and sleeping with these glasses on.

602
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,280
Teachers can't even notice it.

603
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
What's worse,

604
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,320
the unscrupulous distributor of these glasses

605
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,280
has even organized

606
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,440
some kind of student distributor conference.

607
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,240
They caused a 10-year-old child

608
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,880
to end up in the hospital.

609
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,040
Ten years old!

610
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,000
Just ten!

611
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,800
Industry, tax, and police authorities are now conducting joint enforcement.

612
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,260
Investigate thoroughly.

613
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,210
Is Cui Guoming home?

614
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,520
Yes.

615
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,810
You're Cui Guoming, right?

616
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,200
Please have a seat.

617
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,520
I'll make some tea for you.

618
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,680
We won't sit down.

619
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,480
It's like this.

620
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,920
Get changed now

621
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,240
and come with us.

622
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,440
There are some matters

623
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,970
we need to discuss with you.

624
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,600
Can't we verify it here?

625
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
This is a summons.

626
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,280
You need to come with us.

627
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,000
If you don't understand what a summons is,

628
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,480
I can explain it to you right now.

629
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,000
No need.

630
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:53,800
That won't be necessary.

631
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,530
I'll go change my clothes then.

632
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,360
I'll change. You all...

633
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,000
Don't panic, okay?

634
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,000
Sir, please don't take my father away.

635
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,480
You all be good now.

636
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,610
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

637
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,160
Please don't take my father away.

638
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,480
My father is a good man.

639
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,480
He's just unreliable.

640
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,080
He wouldn't do anything bad.

641
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,740
Why are you dressed so nicely?

642
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,320
Isn't this out of respect for you all? What's wrong with that?

643
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,320
I suggest you...

644
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:29,800
I suggest you

645
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,860
change into something more worn out.

646
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,160
Why?

647
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,560
You look like an educated man.

648
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,360
With your scholarly appearance,

649
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,020
if you wear these nice clothes

650
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,520
when you go into the detention center,

651
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,280
those inmates will surely

652
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,560
take them from you.

653
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,250
Do I really have to go to the detention center?

654
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,200
Alright.

655
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,160
After your aunt comes back,

656
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,360
take her to Guo Xiaoxue's home.

657
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,520
Check on her and her grandfather.

658
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,160
I don't know when I'll be released.

659
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,480
I'm worried they might not have enough money.

660
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,340
Remember that.

661
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,480
And then,

662
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,600
don't worry about me.

663
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,920
Just go home now.

664
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,320
Coming, coming.

665
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,580
What's wrong with you?

666
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,570
Take this medicine.

667
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,600
Why should I take it?

668
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,560
You must take it.

669
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,560
It's absolutely necessary.

670
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,000
I don't have any symptoms.

671
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,480
Why should I take it?

672
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,520
I'll tell you after you take it.

673
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,800
Go ahead. What is it?

674
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,680
If I tell you now,

675
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,840
taking the medicine afterward will be too late.

676
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,000
Take it first, then I'll tell you.

677
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,200
Uh, you tell me first, then I'll take it.

678
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,500
If you don't take it, I won't tell you.

679
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,440
I've taken it.

680
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,680
Now tell me.

681
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,800
Wait three minutes.

682
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,240
The medicine hasn't taken effect yet.

683
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,680
Look,

684
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,680
if you don't tell me soon,

685
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,010
I'm going to have a heart attack right now.

686
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,760
Then I'll tell you the good news first.

687
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,160
You'd better tell me the bad news first.

688
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,440
No, the medicine hasn't taken effect yet.

689
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,600
I'll tell you the good news first.

690
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,400
Guoming passed the lawyer exam.

691
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,120
There's nothing special about that.

692
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,920
Of course he's good at studying.

693
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,280
That's not really good news.

694
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,880
Just tell me the bad news now.

695
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Guoming has been arrested by the police.

696
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,280
What?

697
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,640
Dad.

698
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,120
I said the medicine hasn't taken effect yet.

699
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,650
But you insisted I tell you.

700
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,880
What for?

701
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,720
Because pinhole glasses are classified as medical devices.

702
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,800
Guoming was manufacturing them illegally.

703
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,760
He wasn't just illegally manufacturing and selling them.

704
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,440
He was also evading taxes.

705
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,620
And allegedly employing minors.

706
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,480
Director,

707
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,280
guess what happened to Cui Guoming?

708
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,480
No guessing, I won't make you guess.

709
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,480
Little Cui

710
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,560
has been arrested by the police again.

711
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,680
Wasn't he making those pinhole glasses

712
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,880
and doing quite well?

713
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,320
It's exactly about those pinhole glasses.

714
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,680
I just found out myself.

715
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,040
Producing pinhole glasses

716
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,700
falls under medical devices.

717
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,760
Our Cui is quite talented.

718
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,760
He was manufacturing medical devices without a license.

719
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,880
He definitely hasn't paid a penny in taxes.

720
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,010
Who else should they arrest if not him?

721
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,760
And he even got some kids

722
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,120
to work as his distributors.

723
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,040
What would you call this behavior?

724
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,360
He's like Huang Shiren and Zhou Bapi combined,

725
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,760
a real Hu Hansan!

726
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,880
Wait a minute.

727
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,760
Did Hu Hansan exploit child workers?

728
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,080
It's been so long since I watched that movie,

729
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,880
I've forgotten.

730
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,080
Oh, of course!

731
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,720
Pan Dongzi!

732
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,800
Hu Hansan brutally beats

733
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,160
Pan Dongzi,

734
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,080
that Red Army soldier from 'Sparkling Red Star',

735
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,560
Pan Dongzi.

736
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,480
The red star shines brilliantly,

737
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,160
glowing brightly.

738
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,960
Alright,

739
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,080
enough.

740
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,140
Your skills are no match for Xiao Cui.

741
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,640
Yes,

742
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,960
my singing isn't as good as his,

743
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,320
but my heart is more righteous than his.

744
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,800
Fine.

745
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,840
Why can't you speak straightforwardly?

746
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Go sit over there.

747
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,600
I've been asking around.

748
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,320
For behavior like his,

749
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,120
a fine is

750
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,450
definitely necessary.

751
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,960
But it's at that stage where he might or might not be sentenced.

752
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,920
If we push a bit harder

753
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,800
and find the right connections,

754
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,560
he might just get sentenced.

755
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,680
Well, if

756
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,560
he gets sentenced,

757
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,760
we can fire him directly.

758
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,760
You'll have no choice but to dismiss him,

759
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,920
and it will save our factory tens of thousands.

760
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,320
Director, please stop staring at me.

761
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,640
What do you mean?

762
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,480
What do I mean?

763
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,040
I see you as

764
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,920
Zhao Gao,

765
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,800
Gao Lishi,

766
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Wei Zhongxian.

767
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,120
Li Lianying.

768
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,840
This Xiao Cui may be careless,

769
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,920
showing no respect for hierarchy,

770
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,520
and lacking proper manners.

771
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,840
But after all, he has worked in our company

772
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,080
for over ten years as a veteran employee and colleague.

773
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,160
Don't we have any class solidarity?

774
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,210
He's in trouble now.

775
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,410
It's one thing to wash our hands of him,

776
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,080
because we've wanted to lay him off for a long time.

777
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,440
But at this moment,

778
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,880
if we kick him

779
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,720
when he's down,

780
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,920
if this gets out,

781
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,000
how can I continue as factory director?

782
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,770
How will I command respect?

783
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,240
You're right.

784
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,440
I wasn't thinking as thoroughly as you.

785
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,800
True, I find this Cui quite annoying,

786
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,800
but just keep him out of my sight.

787
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,120
We don't need to go as far as sending him to prison.

788
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,480
After a fair

789
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,860
and just bidding process,

790
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,360
starting today,

791
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,080
I officially take over Dingqing Restaurant.

792
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,940
I hope everyone

793
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
will give me your full support.

794
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,880
Support!

795
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,200
Perhaps

796
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,660
some long-time employees

797
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,760
are unhappy about my taking over

798
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,540
Dingqing Restaurant.

799
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:34,960
But

800
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,280
I've put everything I have into this business.

801
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,840
I scraped together 250,000

802
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,960
It wasn't easy.

803
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,640
to make this happen.

804
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,720
I just want to do a good job

805
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,120
and lead everyone to prosperity together.

806
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,280
The name 'Dingqing Restaurant'

807
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,560
is old-fashioned and outdated.

808
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,840
What young person would like such a name?

809
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,600
I plan to give it a new name,

810
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,280
something more wild,

811
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,720
we'll call it

812
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,560
Wild Rose Dinner and Dance.

813
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,760
What do you all think?

814
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,400
If you're taking over the restaurant,

815
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,130
how much more money do you need?

816
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,920
Sister Zhou,

817
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,840
don't worry about it.

818
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,699
I've saved some money over the years.

819
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,130
You can use it first.

820
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,490
We're quite short on funds.

821
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,500
I have over 30,000.

822
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,770
Thank you, Sister Zhou.

823
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,320
But right now,

824
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,160
it's not about the money.

825
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,930
This is Guo Xiaoxue's home.

826
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,560
Let's go.

827
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,000
Okay.

828
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:50,980
This...

829
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,840
Who's there?

830
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,360
Huo Xiaoyang.

831
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,800
Guo Xiaoxue.

832
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,760
This is my aunt.

833
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,400
Hello, Aunt.

834
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,240
Are you home alone?

835
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,680
You live here?

836
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Have you been living here all along?

837
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,170
Do we have any brooms

838
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,440
or cleaning cloths?

839
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,280
Let's clean this place up

840
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,220
before we go find Grandpa.

841
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,480
Sure!

842
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,040
Where are they?

843
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,600
Where?

844
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,840
Got it!

845
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,900
It's okay, don't move.

846
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,600
You're not wearing enough.

847
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,160
Here,

848
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,960
put this on.

849
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,440
Your grandfather's name is

850
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,640
Guo Jun

851
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,840
comrade.

852
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,720
Could you please check

853
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,520
how much money is left in Guo Jun's account?

854
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,720
Are you his daughter?

855
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,840
No, I'm not.

856
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,580
His daughter-in-law?

857
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,160
No. I don't know him.

858
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,840
You don't know him?

859
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,040
He's my husband's classmate's father.

860
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,280
Where is your husband's classmate?

861
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,540
Where is your husband?

862
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,880
I brought his granddaughter here.

863
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,140
Please check it for me.

864
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,200
There's still enough for now.

865
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,840
But it's almost gone.

866
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,960
You should prepare

867
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,490
for the upcoming expenses.

868
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,920
How much more will we need?

869
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,690
Prepare 10,000 yuan first.

870
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,720
Let's go.

871
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,000
What's wrong, Dad?

872
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,000
Why are you staring at me?

873
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,210
I'm waiting for you to get my medicine.

874
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,720
No need today.

875
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,490
I just want to discuss something with you.

876
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,720
What is it?

877
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,920
That guy Tang

878
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,000
has gone ahead and

879
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,860
leased the Dingqing Restaurant.

880
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,800
That was inevitable.

881
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,020
I don't want to work under him.

882
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,040
But Guoming is still in jail.

883
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,640
If I don't have a job,

884
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,090
what will happen to our family?

885
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,920
Guoming's lawyer license

886
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,380
hadn't even been issued when this happened.

887
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,400
I've been asking around.

888
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,440
I heard about Guoming's case.

889
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,440
Just confiscating his illegal income isn't enough.

890
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,160
There will be additional fines.

891
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,280
The glasses factory will be shut down.

892
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,440
All those glasses will be destroyed.

893
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,440
He might even get sentenced.

894
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,440
Sentenced?

895
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,640
I said might.

896
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,320
The sentence probably won't be too severe.

897
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,080
At most, he'll get probation.

898
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,540
By the way, Dad.

899
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
That Tang guy

900
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,800
wants to take down our

901
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,520
Dingqing Restaurant sign.

902
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,800
He wants to rename it

903
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,880
Wild Rose Song and Dance Restaurant.

904
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,760
The entire second floor

905
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,200
will be turned into small dance halls,

906
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,120
you know, those dimly lit places,

907
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,760
that kind of nightclub.

908
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,040
What did you say?

909
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,880
There must be those

910
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,520
dirty prostitutes and such.

911
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
Get the medicine.

912
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,580
Heart pills, okay?

913
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,760
Nitroglycerin.

914
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,920
Brother's here.

915
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,320
No.

916
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,200
You've come in again.

917
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,860
Still haven't been released?

918
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,050
Here you come again.

919
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,360
What do you want from me?

920
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,400
This is a nice place.

921
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,040
You keep coming back again and again.

922
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,200
Let me get some sleep.

923
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,800
I haven't slept for a day and night.

924
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,360
Liuzi, we have guests.

925
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,290
Get two more quilts for your uncle.

926
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,140
Don't fall asleep now.

927
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,520
Cover yourself up.

928
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,040
After our renovation

929
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,320
it'll be absolutely stylish,

930
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,080
totally trendy,

931
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,200
and definitely cool.

932
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,520
We're changing the name to

933
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,680
Wild Rose Dinner and Dance,

934
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,200
not Dingqing Restaurant anymore.

935
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,880
But no matter what we call it,

936
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,080
Mr. Cui,

937
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,260
whenever you come,

938
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,060
it's absolutely on the house.

939
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,800
When it was state-owned,

940
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,120
I didn't have that authority.

941
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,640
Now that I've contracted it,

942
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,300
I definitely have that power.

943
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,520
Be careful.

944
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,920
Manager Tang.

945
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,760
I hired a tricycle.

946
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,880
Could you help carry this old plaque back?

947
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,320
No problem.

948
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,640
What do I need this old thing for?

949
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,320
Sir,

950
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,440
would you mind giving us a hand?

951
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,880
Let me help you carry it.

952
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,680
No need.

953
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,220
If this isn't being stubborn,

954
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,320
then what is?
