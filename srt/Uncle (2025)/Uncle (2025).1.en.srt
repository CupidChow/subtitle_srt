1
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
Li

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,720
Li Yang

3
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,040
Liu

4
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,360
Do you remember 1993?

5
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,560
That year

6
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,960
due to the Three Gorges Project

7
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,090
1.31 million urban and rural residents were relocated.

8
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,480
The whole nation

9
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,200
was cheering for Beijing's bid

10
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,880
for the 2000 Olympic Games.

11
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,440
The food ration coupons that had accompanied Chinese people for decades

12
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,770
officially exited the historical stage.

13
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,920
The TV series playing on television

14
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,720
was 'New Legend of White Snake'.

15
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,160
And

16
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,880
that year's stock market

17
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,640
reached a peak of 1,558 points.

18
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
In such

19
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,040
a passionate era of reform,

20
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,290
there were bound to be people who liked to stir things up.

21
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,000
If we talk about

22
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,040
the person who loved stirring things up the most,

23
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,560
I think

24
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,440
it must be him.

25
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,330
His talent for causing trouble

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,820
was unmatched in our area.

27
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,760
He was a firecracker,

28
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,920
just like those double-bang firecrackers.

29
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,880
When handling matters,

30
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,320
Cui Guoming

31
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,880
never had any proper behavior.

32
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,640
How could one live like that?

33
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
But you know what,

34
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,490
this unreliable fellow

35
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,000
Coming right away!

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,720
actually had a warm heart.

37
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,380
Here you go.

38
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,560
Even if he suffered losses himself,

39
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,800
he couldn't bear to see others suffer.

40
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,160
What can you do?

41
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,460
He's smart.

42
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,520
Loyal.

43
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,320
Didn't you ask me to keep a low profile?

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,980
He looked carefree and sloppy

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,860
but was actually quite talented.

46
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,280
Anyway.

47
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,420
When he was out making his way,

48
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,880
there was no trick he couldn't think of

49
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,680
or thing he couldn't do.

50
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,120
Thinking...

51
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,680
I understand.

52
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,880
If it weren't for those seven years

53
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,210
when I was inside writing appeals for you.

54
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,520
As for who this child is,

55
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,280
yes, it's me.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,400
And the person holding me

57
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,079
is my uncle.

58
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,480
I am your uncle.

59
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
And the story between my uncle and me

60
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,400
begins in the autumn of 1993.

61
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,560
My uncle

62
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,640
My uncle

63
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,440
is an all-around genius.

64
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,880
He can clear the table in one shot when playing pool.

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,320
He can even do bicycle kicks when playing soccer.

66
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,960
He plays Chinese chess and Go

67
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,200
and has never lost.

68
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,120
He can memorize everyone's cards when playing poker.

69
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,320
He sings better than Jacky Cheung

70
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
and dances better than Aaron Kwok.

71
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,440
Any household appliance,

72
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,300
my uncle can fix after reading the manual just once.

73
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,840
No matter how complex the instrument,

74
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,240
my uncle can master it in just a few days.

75
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
My uncle's greatest skill is cooking fish.

76
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,520
When the fish is served,

77
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,440
it still moves.

78
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,159
I asked you to write about 'My Someone'

79
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:45,040
to truthfully describe a family member,

80
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,640
not to write fairy tales here.

81
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,240
Everything I wrote is true.

82
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,100
That's enough.

83
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,120
Sit down.

84
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Who's next?

85
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Huo Xiaoyang,

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,120
why are you such a show-off?

87
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
Bragging in daily life is one thing,

88
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,080
but how could you write it in your essay?

89
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,040
Everything I said is true.

90
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,880
The teacher already said you were making things up.

91
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,960
Just admit it.

92
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,800
What I said is absolutely true.

93
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,760
If you don't believe me, go meet my uncle someday.

94
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,960
My dad knows all about your family.

95
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,000
My father told me.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,520
Your father is a convict,

97
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,560
and who knows what your mother is doing abroad.

98
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,480
Say that again.

99
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,520
Don't deny it.

100
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,640
Who knows what your mother does.

101
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,280
I-

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,640
Uncle.

103
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,400
Hello, teachers.

104
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,080
You're his uncle?

105
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,400
Yes, I am.

106
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,840
Cui.

107
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,440
Guoming.

108
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,120
Yes.

109
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,200
Yes, yes, yes.

110
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,880
You know me?

111
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,720
I do.

112
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,320
No, no, no.

113
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:16,880
I don't.

114
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,490
Well.

115
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,040
You don't know me.

116
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,440
But I know you.

117
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,040
You're from No. 27 Middle School, right?

118
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,720
I am.

119
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,240
I'm two years behind you.

120
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,200
Well, you were so popular at school.

121
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,280
Everyone knew who you were.

122
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,920
Whenever there was a school event,

123
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,520
from hosting to performing,

124
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,000
it was always you, wasn't it?

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,200
What about my nephew?

126
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,320
Your nephew?

127
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,159
Well, he...

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,200
I wanted to tell you that

129
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,840
he writes excellent essays.

130
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,960
Because his essay is titled

131
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,640
'My Uncle.'

132
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,200
That's you.

133
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,840
I think he wrote it very realistically,

134
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,960
quite vividly,

135
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,120
and with a touch of

136
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,560
childlike innocence.

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,480
So you called me here

138
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,920
because his essay was good?

139
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,240
No, no.

140
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,280
It's because there's

141
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,010
a small conflict between them.

142
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,800
This student said some inappropriate things

143
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,520
that upset Huo Xiaoyang.

144
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,640
However, I believe

145
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,800
this issue is Wang Ning's fault.

146
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,220
Then why is he standing there as punishment?

147
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,000
That's their turn to stand as punishment.

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,560
Hey,

149
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,720
Wang Ning, stand up.

150
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
It's his turn now.

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're causing trouble for me again, aren't you?

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,040
Causing trouble again.

153
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,720
It takes me an hour to get here and back,

154
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,840
losing thousands.

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,060
What are you doing?

156
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,530
You can't hit children!

157
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,760
It wasn't me.

158
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,159
Who else could it be?

159
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,360
Huo Xiaoyang hit me first.

160
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,280
You're Huo Xiaoyang?

161
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,640
He is.

162
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,680
And who are you?

163
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,760
I'm his uncle.

164
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,560
Is Cui Xiaohong

165
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,520
your sister?

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,060
Is she your sister?

167
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,920
Yes.

168
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,760
There's been a misunderstanding.

169
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,320
It's all a misunderstanding.

170
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,640
I'm your sister's classmate.

171
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,040
Your sister is so beautiful.

172
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,800
Well...

173
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,840
Um, you know...

174
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,280
You don't really look like your sister.

175
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,040
This kid...

176
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,520
This kid looks even less like her.

177
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,640
We really are from the same family.

178
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
Blood relatives.

179
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,040
Right, so you're all family?

180
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,640
Classmates fighting is normal.

181
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
The more you fight, the closer you become.

182
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,680
Right?

183
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,320
Wang Ning.

184
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,330
Shake hands.

185
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,040
Look,

186
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,800
that's nice.

187
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,760
But I still need to sort this out.

188
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,240
This matter was

189
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,360
started by Wang Ning.

190
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,200
Why is it you again?

191
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,640
That doesn't mean you can hit a child.

192
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,880
I'm telling the truth.

193
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,520
Be quiet.

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,799
Um...

195
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,680
Hey, Cui.

196
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,720
If there's nothing else,

197
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,440
you can take Huo Xiaoyang and leave first.

198
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,970
Let's go.

199
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,500
Come visit us again sometime.

200
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,920
Why did you hit someone?

201
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,480
What did he say to you?

202
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,760
He said my mom might be doing who knows what abroad.

203
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,280
Your mother is abroad

204
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,370
running a cosmetics business.

205
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,440
When is my mom coming back?

206
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
When you stop being naughty,

207
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,880
she'll come back.

208
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
I'm not being naughty.

209
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,880
Dad, why are you here?

210
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,290
Just passing by.

211
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,900
Did he get into trouble again?

212
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,840
Your brother is very well-behaved.

213
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,400
Let's go.

214
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,440
This is my sister.

215
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,840
My uncle's daughter.

216
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,380
She's looked down on me since childhood.

217
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,080
Xiaohong's brother?

218
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,680
Why don't you ride with me?

219
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,400
It's exhausting to handle two kids alone.

220
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,260
Little chubby.

221
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm not getting in.

222
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,800
Look at your tires.

223
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
They're all flat.

224
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,320
Get in.

225
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,320
Let's talk about my sister.

226
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,040
Sure, let's talk.

227
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,800
Can we talk privately?

228
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,000
Let's go.

229
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,400
Come.

230
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,880
Wait in the car.

231
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,210
Let's go.

232
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,080
How's your sister doing?

233
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,400
She's fine. Have you eaten?

234
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,000
What should we eat?

235
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,600
Let me take you somewhere nice.

236
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,480
What's there to eat here?

237
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,160
Boss.

238
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,720
Can we use your place to talk for five minutes?

239
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
No, not like that.

240
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,920
I don't need you. I've got this.

241
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,480
Here.

242
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,940
For you.

243
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,440
Then let's talk for ten minutes.

244
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,040
Such a classy person.

245
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
You went abroad.

246
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,520
No, I haven't.

247
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,080
And you didn't see my sister?

248
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,760
No.

249
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,440
But your sister is

250
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,880
very beautiful.

251
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,200
How do you know that?

252
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,930
What's my sister doing abroad?

253
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,280
I... I don't know.

254
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,650
Then how does your son know?

255
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,640
My son, he...

256
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,240
Why are you closing the door?

257
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,050
Didn't you say we'd only talk for ten minutes?

258
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,080
Dad,

259
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,640
how much was that red car they had?

260
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,970
I don't know.

261
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,800
Several classmates in my class

262
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,080
their families all bought cars this year.

263
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,520
When will our family buy one?

264
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,240
When I make some money.

265
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,240
When will you make money?

266
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,320
Soon.

267
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,520
Isn't a bicycle just as good?

268
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,180
There's not much difference.

269
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,200
You're riding in a car, not cycling.

270
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,800
Look how exhausted my dad is.

271
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
I'm not tired.

272
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,240
But for the Xiali car,

273
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
we'll buy one too.

274
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,730
Is that okay?

275
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,940
Go inside and find your mom first.

276
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,680
Ji Qiang,

277
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
studying again?

278
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,800
Need any help?

279
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,360
Don't want me to disturb you?

280
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,120
Alright,

281
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,680
I won't bother you then.

282
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,760
Sister Zhou.

283
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,040
These sunglasses look stylish,

284
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,720
don't they?

285
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,800
This is Dingqing Restaurant,

286
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,000
our province's famous establishment,

287
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,930
almost a hundred years old.

288
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,160
Grandpa told me

289
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,680
it was opened by a famous Beijing chef

290
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,000
named Old Master Zhang from the last century.

291
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,130
The signboard was personally inscribed by Xu Shichang.

292
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,140
The man cooking there is my grandfather,

293
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,520
the general manager of Dingqing Restaurant.

294
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,880
He has deep feelings for this place.

295
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,570
After all, he's been here since he was an apprentice.

296
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,480
This restaurant is his life's work and memories.

297
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,840
This is my grandmother,

298
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,480
who was a famous opera performer in the province.

299
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,200
Unfortunately, because of her heart condition,

300
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,520
her health was never good,

301
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,960
so she stopped performing.

302
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,400
You've spent your whole life at Dingqing Restaurant.

303
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,600
Now that you're really retiring,

304
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,160
what will you do?

305
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,680
Go home.

306
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,200
Go home and cook for you.

307
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Three meals a day.

308
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,680
When you retire,

309
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,320
the new general manager

310
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,360
won't be as dedicated as you.

311
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,560
As long as I'm the manager,

312
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,120
this is my home.

313
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,600
No, it's more important than our home.

314
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,360
You've made all this mess

315
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,880
for Qiangzi again.

316
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,280
He loves vegetarian dishes.

317
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,400
I'm planning to name this dish

318
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,880
called

319
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,400
Vegetable Medley.

320
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,480
It might even become

321
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,800
a famous dish nationwide.

322
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,240
Famous dish, really?

323
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,320
Come.

324
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,440
Qiangzi.

325
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,480
Ji Qiang.

326
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,540
You must be hungry.

327
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,800
Come.

328
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,400
Auntie,

329
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,320
this beautiful woman

330
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
is my aunt.

331
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,970
She also works at Dingqing Restaurant

332
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
as an accountant.

333
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,440
A soccer ball costs 20 yuan.

334
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,120
My aunt is incredibly good to me

335
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,760
and often helps me with my homework.

336
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,920
It cost 770 yuan.

337
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,640
Mr. Meng,

338
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,920
but even my aunt

339
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,980
doesn't know all the answers, right?

340
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,580
At those times,

341
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,160
we go ask Ji Qiang.

342
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,680
That's him.

343
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,000
But I heard

344
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,640
he was accepted to university before,

345
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,840
but something happened to his family,

346
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,360
and he ended up like this.

347
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,480
But he's really smart

348
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,360
and knows all the problems I can't solve.

349
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,640
It's that simple.

350
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,400
I'll leave the kid here first.

351
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,120
I need to go back to the factory for some business.

352
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,360
What time is it already?

353
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,400
And you're still going to the factory?

354
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,280
Didn't we just get a new factory director?

355
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,480
He asked us for suggestions.

356
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,800
I've written over 200 pages.

357
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,560
Just 7 or 8 pages left.

358
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,040
Then I'll be done.

359
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,720
What?

360
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,480
Over 200 pages?

361
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,480
What have you been writing about?

362
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,340
Mainly about product marketing,

363
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,640
equipment updates,

364
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
and employee benefits.

365
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,400
That's it.

366
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:30,840
Look,

367
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,120
when the new director asks for suggestions,

368
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,520
he's just being polite.

369
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,280
Putting on a show of democracy.

370
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,120
Don't actually write a massive treatise.

371
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,840
Over 200 pages?

372
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,320
Are you trying to take his job?

373
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,960
That's not it.

374
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,000
These issues affect all of us.

375
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,160
Besides, it's a rare opportunity.

376
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,920
I need to get it all off my chest.

377
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,480
Listen,

378
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,680
have you forgotten what I told you?

379
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,410
How your Uncle Zhang lost his position back then?

380
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,360
It was because he talked too much.

381
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,820
Always running his mouth.

382
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
The leaders asked for opinions,

383
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,400
but he didn't just give suggestions,

384
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,520
he started insulting people.

385
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,640
I won't insult anyone.

386
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,760
That would be so uncultured.

387
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,360
I'm just being profound and incisive.

388
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:05,880
Besides,

389
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,160
it's 1993 now.

390
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,890
Don't worry.

391
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,320
Listen...

392
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,920
Why did you come back?

393
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,000
Doesn't the factory allow suggestion letters?

394
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,920
I haven't finished writing it yet.

395
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,520
Have you two finished yours?

396
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,680
I haven't written mine either.

397
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,320
I forgot.

398
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,880
You two don't need to worry.

399
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,280
You don't need to write anything.

400
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,800
Mine will be more comprehensive.

401
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,560
What should I write?

402
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,290
You two definitely don't know.

403
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,160
Then what should I write?

404
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,920
Do you know?

405
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,170
I don't want to know.

406
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,760
What's there to argue about?

407
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,400
Isn't it good to have different opinions?

408
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,460
Go ahead and write.

409
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,720
Your dad made you such a nice kite

410
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,800
and you just threw it away.

411
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,640
I'm not a little kid anymore.

412
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,960
I don't enjoy playing with these things anymore.

413
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,080
Your father spent the whole weekend

414
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,210
making that for you.

415
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,680
This kite isn't worth anything.

416
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,079
So what if I threw it away?

417
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,359
Then tell me,

418
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,319
what do you value?

419
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,240
When Dad used to make these things for me,

420
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,440
my classmates were all quite envious.

421
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,960
But now many of them

422
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,440
have Xiali cars at home.

423
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,900
How can our little things compare with that?

424
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,440
Why don't you compete with others on something worthwhile?

425
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,319
Like studying.

426
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,280
You only care about these useless things.

427
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,520
Anyway, Dad said

428
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,380
we're going to buy a Xiali car too.

429
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,240
What?

430
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,680
When did he tell you that?

431
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,340
This afternoon when he picked me up from school.

432
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
Did he say when?

433
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,080
No,

434
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,280
but he said very soon.

435
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,660
What did you write?

436
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,250
Dear Factory Director,

437
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,280
hello,

438
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,960
I am employee Zhao Hailong.

439
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,720
I would like to make

440
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,450
some personal suggestions about the cafeteria.

441
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,080
Every winter,

442
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,570
we always eat pickled vegetables.

443
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,240
I think

444
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,480
we could buy some dried cabbage.

445
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,440
Since the price of dried cabbage

446
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,770
is almost the same as pickled vegetables.

447
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,160
Eating pickled vegetables all the time

448
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,040
can easily upset your stomach.

449
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,480
Your suggestion is excellent!

450
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:39,880
Don't you think

451
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,010
it will be accepted?

452
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,040
Well then,

453
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,600
I'll write mine here too

454
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,330
to make a stronger impression on the leadership.

455
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,640
Wait a minute.

456
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,720
What are you writing?

457
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,560
Read it to me.

458
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,400
I wrote that

459
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,040
our equipment maintenance department

460
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,000
should get two more sets of work uniforms each year.

461
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,440
We crawl inside machines every day,

462
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,960
our clothes get dirty and torn

463
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,440
much faster than other departments.

464
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,720
We're the ones who really need uniforms.

465
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,280
Those office workers,

466
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,010
what do they need uniforms for?

467
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,460
Really?

468
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,480
Well said!

469
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,000
Add mine too.

470
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,800
Sure.

471
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,290
Brother Cui.

472
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,600
What are you doing? Writing a ten-thousand-word petition?

473
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,400
Ten thousand words isn't nearly enough.

474
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,720
Mine has at least 70,000 to 80,000 words.

475
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,240
What are you writing about?

476
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,120
The first 20 pages are fairly simple.

477
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,760
Just about marketing

478
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,220
and after-sales service.

479
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,240
The next 100 pages

480
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,770
I wrote in much more detail.

481
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,840
I suggest our factory

482
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,640
should sell

483
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,600
half,

484
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,600
or at least a third of our land

485
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,000
to update our equipment.

486
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Brother Cui,

487
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,200
you know the most about technology and equipment,

488
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,480
don't you?

489
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,320
Are you really willing to sell it?

490
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,600
Our equipment

491
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,720
was built in 1957

492
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,130
with Soviet aid.

493
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,620
It's too outdated.

494
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,560
Our factory's products in the market

495
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,800
can't even compete with small southern factories.

496
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,560
If China joins the WTO,

497
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,520
our competitiveness

498
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,650
will be almost zero.

499
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,400
By that time,

500
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,010
if the factory closes down,

501
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,380
we'll all lose our jobs

502
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,640
and be laid off.

503
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,960
Brother Cui.

504
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,040
Our factory.

505
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,800
A key project built with Soviet aid,

506
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,720
how could it possibly go bankrupt?

507
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,160
Even the Soviet Union collapsed.

508
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,520
Why wouldn't our factory close down too?

509
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,040
With my business model,

510
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,840
even our most ordinary workers

511
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,080
will be able to buy a Xiali car

512
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,320
a sedan model,

513
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Do you believe it?

514
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,520
You definitely believe it.

515
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,520
Do you believe it?

516
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,720
I...

517
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,520
It's time for me to get off work.

518
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,240
I need to think about it.

519
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,700
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

520
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,720
Bro.

521
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,280
I need to go home and cook for my wife.

522
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,480
Hurry.

523
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,170
I'm leaving now.

524
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:12,960
Hey.

525
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,160
Why haven't you finished work yet?

526
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,200
When will you get here?

527
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,480
I'm writing something.

528
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,080
Wait for me. I'll be there soon.

529
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,540
See you at the usual place.

530
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
You...

531
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,160
Compared to when you were on TV,

532
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,020
you've lost quite a bit of weight.

533
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,260
They made it clear to me in detention.

534
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,360
I'm a celebrity now.

535
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,880
Celebrities need to maintain their image.

536
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,340
With so many people there,

537
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,440
why did the reporters pick you as the spokesperson?

538
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,920
I was waiting for you to ask.

539
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,000
Isn't it obvious?

540
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,410
It's crystal clear.

541
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,160
Because the TV station

542
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,800
saw that I had the best image among everyone.

543
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,000
And look at my speech.

544
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,740
How touching was my attitude when admitting mistakes?

545
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,760
Without this quality...

546
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,480
Excuse me.

547
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,640
It's a gift.

548
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,440
What do you mean?

549
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,170
It's for you.

550
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,560
That was you being interviewed on TV the other day, right?

551
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,340
You recognized me.

552
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,280
I watched it.

553
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,200
That reporter interviewing you was quite impressive.

554
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,920
This is a gift.

555
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,720
Chives.

556
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,360
Do you understand what it means?

557
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,820
Its effect is nourishing.

558
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,060
You could use that.

559
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,120
Thanks.

560
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:26,920
You're showing off.

561
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,600
Thank you.

562
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,360
Come, have a taste.

563
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,490
Don't listen to him.

564
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,520
You know, in these past two years

565
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,560
I've been on TV

566
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,280
just this one opportunity.

567
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,480
Am I a bit unlucky?

568
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,240
If you're not feeling good about it,

569
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,440
find a fortune teller

570
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,720
to break your bad luck.

571
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,600
That might make you feel better.

572
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,450
You know a lot of people and have connections.

573
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,840
Do you know any masters

574
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,240
who can solve problems like this?

575
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,960
I have connections,

576
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,800
but not that kind.

577
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,860
I don't really believe in that stuff.

578
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,080
If you want to find someone,

579
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,140
look in the mountains or by the water.

580
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,080
Those hermits

581
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,740
are the ones with real skills.

582
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,840
That makes sense.

583
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,360
Excuse me for interrupting again.

584
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,220
This is for you.

585
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,160
Lamb kidneys!

586
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,640
This is too kind.

587
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,360
Do you know what they're good for?

588
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,560
They're nutritious.

589
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
What's your name?

590
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
My surname is Guo,

591
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,640
they call me Guo Dapao.

592
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,410
That's a powerful name!

593
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,320
Look, if

594
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,160
hypothetically speaking,

595
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,760
if you get on TV again...

596
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,240
What are you talking about?

597
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,440
Just giving you good wishes.

598
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,640
What good wishes?

599
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,290
I mean...

600
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,480
I'm not good with words. I mean,

601
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,040
when you become famous,

602
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,720
you'll get lots of interviews.

603
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,160
That's fine.

604
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,640
When you get many positive interviews,

605
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,320
could you maybe mention

606
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,440
that I gave you chives

607
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,360
and kidneys,

608
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:48,960
and praise them,

609
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,920
saying they're really good?

610
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,040
That would be even better.

611
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
I get it. You want free advertising.

612
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,410
You want promotion.

613
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,100
That's exactly it.

614
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,320
If you do this,

615
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,440
next time you're on TV,

616
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:58,920
I'll give you something too.

617
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,960
Alright,

618
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,840
I'm not good with words.

619
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,040
Eat up, enjoy!

620
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,080
Come feel what advertising fees taste like.

621
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,040
I don't want any. Really.

622
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,500
Brother, excuse me again.

623
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
What do you want now?

624
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,960
I brewed this myself

625
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,040
for my own drinking.

626
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,480
I feel you need this more than I do.

627
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,200
Ginseng.

628
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,680
There's some deer antler in here,

629
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,880
really potent stuff. And goji berries.

630
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,770
Mengmeng is asleep.

631
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,360
What's going on?

632
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,040
Did you tell Mengmeng we're buying a Xiali car?

633
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,520
I...

634
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,680
I didn't.

635
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,980
Would that child lie to me?

636
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,480
She told me herself.

637
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,000
Well, I just mentioned it casually.

638
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,040
She's just a kid.

639
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,120
I didn't promise her anything.

640
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,560
I didn't say when we'd buy it, right?

641
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,440
I...

642
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,900
It's nothing, really.

643
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,240
Do you know how much

644
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,900
a Xiali sedan costs nowadays?

645
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,330
About 40 or 50 thousand.

646
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
40 or 50 thousand?

647
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,490
My classmate just bought one last week

648
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,080
for 118,000.

649
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,280
That's so expensive.

650
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,120
This won't work.

651
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,160
It's impossible.

652
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,260
Do you know how much money we have?

653
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,810
About 40 or 50 thousand?

654
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,040
Here.

655
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,180
Take a good look yourself.

656
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,610
What's this?

657
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,240
You've brought out the bankbook.

658
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,300
What are you doing?

659
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,160
44,500.

660
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,050
I have another 500 in my pocket.

661
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,760
So that makes exactly 45,000.

662
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,890
That's about right.

663
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,120
With just this much money, you still want to buy a car?

664
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
Can you please be more down to earth?

665
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,720
This 45,000

666
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,040
is what I've saved over our ten-plus years of marriage,

667
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,240
penny by penny, scraping it together

668
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,300
with great effort.

669
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,440
Money is meant to be saved,

670
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,240
not scraped together like that.

671
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,400
Then how else would we get it?

672
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,280
Rob a bank?

673
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,800
We need to earn it.

674
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,760
Find a way!

675
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,560
What era are we living in?

676
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,680
Deepening reform

677
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,560
and expanding openness.

678
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,960
Even nobodies can make money these days,

679
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,240
but I can't?

680
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,600
I don't think you can.

681
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,840
Where would you earn it?

682
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,440
By stealing machines from the factory to sell?

683
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,560
That's good. You

684
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,540
have given me a new challenge.

685
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,080
Starting today,

686
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,720
I will seriously think about

687
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,720
how to make money.

688
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,090
I never meant for you to make money.

689
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,440
Our life

690
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,040
may not be great,

691
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,690
but it's not bad either.

692
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,970
Be serious when I'm talking to you.

693
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,880
You're just too unrealistic,

694
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,280
completely out of touch,

695
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,400
coming up with new ideas every day,

696
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,200
living in your own mental world.

697
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,320
How can you brag like this to our child?

698
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,250
I wonder how you'll face Mengmeng.

699
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,960
By buying the car,

700
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,060
wouldn't that solve everything?

701
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
Zhang.

702
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,500
Director, please take a look at this.

703
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,560
Which department's feedback is this?

704
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,400
There's so much of it.

705
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,640
Equipment Maintenance Department.

706
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,120
Equipment Maintenance Department?

707
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,600
Those few people there?

708
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,440
Three people.

709
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,160
All engineers.

710
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,040
Three people wrote all this?

711
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,160
Mainly.

712
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,120
This person.

713
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,520
Cui Guoming.

714
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,220
According to his suggestion,

715
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,560
even our most ordinary factory workers

716
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,890
will all be able to drive

717
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,170
Xiali cars within three years.

718
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,820
How much does a Xiali car cost?

719
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,900
I certainly can't afford one.

720
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,480
I'm guessing

721
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,080
it's about

722
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,320
over 100,000.

723
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,680
How does this Cui Guoming usually perform?

724
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,400
In terms of technical skills,

725
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
he's quite good.

726
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,000
After all, he graduated from the Engineering University.

727
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,520
As for his personality,

728
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,920
the old factory director really appreciated him.

729
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,520
I can't afford to offend him.

730
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,640
Is that so?

731
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,800
Of course.

732
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,480
When I was in the publicity department,

733
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,640
he looked down on me.

734
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,200
He has plenty of suggestions

735
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,360
and some make sense,

736
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,020
but it's not that easy to implement them.

737
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,000
[Close the switch]

738
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,320
[Received]

739
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,490
Let's think about where to go this afternoon.

740
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,120
My uncle's painstakingly written ten-thousand-word petition

741
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,280
became waste paper

742
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,000
the very next day after submission.

743
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,240
But who would have thought

744
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,120
that what was once a laughingstock that no one believed

745
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,600
would later come true word for word.

746
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,480
Hey, buddy.

747
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,740
Why do I have to pay just to take a look?

748
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,240
50.

749
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:41,920
What?

750
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,240
At the train station and bus station entrances

751
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,040
they only charge 2 yuan.

752
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,280
The most I've seen at People's Park is 5 yuan.

753
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,610
Why are you charging 50?

754
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,160
Go complain to them then.

755
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,360
Goodbye and good riddance.

756
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,360
Well, that's how you're going to be?

757
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,640
Figure out what I do for a living.

758
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,170
If you get it right, I'll be your customer.

759
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,360
So what's this place for?

760
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,480
Wasn't my gesture clear enough?

761
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,450
Then guess what I'm here to consult about.

762
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,860
Relationship issues.

763
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,360
Master!

764
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,600
Master.

765
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,400
Do this.

766
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,480
Give me your hand.

767
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,560
Feel if this money is right.

768
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,420
Will that work?

769
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,890
Tell me about your problem.

770
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,330
I'll try my best to help.

771
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,120
You don't know?

772
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,450
These past two years...

773
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,300
I've suffered so much.

774
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,920
This outfit with this outer layer looks pretty good.

775
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,680
Not too flashy.

776
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,880
But still quite dignified.

777
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,410
And quite handsome, right?

778
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,560
What are you getting dressed up for?

779
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,520
Are you accepting an award?

780
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm going to my high school reunion.

781
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,320
What? A reunion?

782
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,980
Almost everyone from our class is going.

783
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,520
I've heard about these things.

784
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,960
For people our age,

785
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,040
nothing good comes from attending reunions.

786
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,400
These so-called reunions with classmates...

787
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,800
It means fooling around.

788
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,160
Have you heard this expression?

789
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,960
I don't fool around.

790
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,690
I just go there to eat and drink.

791
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,680
Don't think I don't know.

792
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,560
Back in high school,

793
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,760
all the girls in your class had a crush on you.

794
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,360
It was all the girls in school who had a crush on me.

795
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,420
You're shameless.

796
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,440
They had a crush on me,

797
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,700
but I'm not shameless.

798
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,720
Just wear your work clothes.

799
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,090
Wear what you usually wear. Got it?

800
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,840
Are you serious? You must be joking.

801
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,570
I'm not joking about anything.

802
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,200
You're naturally good-looking. You'll look great in anything.

803
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,640
No.

804
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,920
It's not just that the work clothes look bad.

805
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,440
They're dirty and covered in oil.

806
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,370
Just wear these.

807
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
Or don't go at all.

808
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,020
Put those away.

809
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,370
You won't need them.

810
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,960
At your class reunion,

811
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,520
will Guo Dapao be there?

812
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,080
He'll be there. He definitely will.

813
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,200
You know, in high school,

814
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,280
you were top of the class,

815
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,200
while he was at the very bottom.

816
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,440
Yet you insisted on hanging out with him.

817
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,880
What about those other good students?

818
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,740
Why didn't you hang out with them?

819
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,680
We were desk mates.

820
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,320
The most loyal friends often come from humble backgrounds.

821
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,380
He really is from a butcher's family.

822
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,920
A meat seller.

823
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,720
A family business of selling meat.

824
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,160
What about your college classmates who work in aerospace?

825
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,800
Why don't you attend reunions with them?

826
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
They're all working in aerospace now.

827
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,160
Why would they want to hang out with me?

828
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,320
I'm just a mechanic.

829
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,280
Don't be so snobbish.

830
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,280
I'm snobbish?

831
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,120
You're not?

832
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,000
What about the promise you made to your daughter?

833
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,600
Let's see how you'll keep it.

834
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,650
Have you bought that Xiali car yet?

835
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,000
Put it away.

836
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,250
We won't need it.

837
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,040
Did you give the new factory director

838
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,720
a hundreds-page proposal?

839
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,700
It went straight to the trash.

840
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,720
You're too bold.

841
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,850
Are those things you should be saying?

842
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,400
I heard

843
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,320
you suggested selling the factory land

844
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,520
to buy new equipment.

845
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,880
That's right.

846
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,920
Our factory equipment is from 1957,

847
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,650
just three years older than me.

848
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
Internationally speaking...

849
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,360
Forget about international standards.

850
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,280
Even by national standards, it's outdated.

851
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,640
If we continue like this,

852
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,240
our factory will collapse within three years.

853
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,800
What does it matter to you if it fails?

854
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,440
How could it not concern me?

855
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,719
I'm a worker here.

856
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,850
If the factory fails, don't I fail too?

857
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,120
Right, you also said

858
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,679
that if they followed your advice,

859
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,920
you could help every worker

860
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,520
buy a Xiali car.

861
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,360
The sedan model.

862
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,080
This is based on Hayek's theory.

863
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,600
Ha-what?

864
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,520
Hayek.

865
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,120
Which department is he from?

866
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,560
Human Resources.

867
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,239
Enough.

868
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,880
That statement of yours

869
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,159
has become a joke

870
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,639
among the factory leadership

871
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,679
circle now.

872
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,800
They're saying let's see if after three years of your antics,

873
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,760
you yourself can afford a Xiali.

874
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,440
Everyone becomes a joke at some point,

875
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,280
but who will have the last laugh

876
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,520
remains to be seen.

877
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,380
You're already in your thirties.

878
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,440
You're not that young college graduate

879
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,280
from ten years ago anymore.

880
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,400
Don't be so impulsive about everything.

881
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,280
You need to be more practical.

882
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,160
Keep a lower profile.

883
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,920
I know, I know.

884
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,480
Don't stick your neck out

885
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,080
when you shouldn't.

886
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Got it, got it.

887
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm heading out now.

888
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,960
Where are you going?

889
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,820
Class reunion.

890
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,920
I'd rather leave work early

891
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,200
than be late for the reunion.

892
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,760
My job at the factory

893
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,320
is to ensure that all machines

894
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,960
operate normally.

895
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,040
Today I guarantee

896
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,760
none of the machines will break down.

897
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,720
Isn't that enough?

898
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,280
I'm leaving.

899
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:22,720
Wait.

900
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,280
You're going dressed like that?

901
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,480
Didn't you tell me to keep a low profile?

902
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,600
Guoming.

903
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,400
Dajian.

904
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,700
You drive pretty well.

905
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,960
Just bought it recently.

906
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,720
I'm sorry about that.

907
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,050
I'll drink to you later.

908
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,640
Everyone's here.

909
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,480
Guoming.

910
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,560
Why are you getting your hands dirty?

911
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,090
How did you end up like this?

912
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,960
I just came from the factory.

913
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,440
Aren't you an engineer?

914
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,800
Don't touch it if it's oily.

915
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,720
Then why are you still...

916
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,880
I'm an engineer.

917
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,440
I'm a worker too.

918
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,680
Labor is glorious.

919
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,960
The thing is

920
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,200
you're not interested in any of the girls from our class,

921
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,920
so you just came dressed like this.

922
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,640
If I were your wife,

923
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,490
I would never let you go out looking like this.

924
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,880
If you were my wife,

925
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,080
how would you want me to dress?

926
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,880
What,

927
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,640
get you a Dunhill suit?

928
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,160
I prefer mink fur.

929
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,440
You said it yourself.

930
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,840
I'll get you one tomorrow.

931
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,440
Fine.

932
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,810
I'll tell your husband right away.

933
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,000
When did he become so naughty?

934
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,760
Everyone's here.

935
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,000
Hello everyone.

936
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,360
Teacher.

937
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,320
Come.

938
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,850
Please sit down, everyone.

939
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,280
Let's raise our glasses.

940
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,440
Let's toast to Teacher Li again,

941
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,700
wishing her good health and all the best.

942
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,160
Thank you, students.

943
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,880
Thank you.

944
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,520
Everyone,

945
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,120
it's been over ten years since graduation.

946
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,880
During these years,

947
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,360
our China has truly undergone tremendous changes.

948
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,160
The legendary multi-story buildings,

949
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,980
electricity and telephones,

950
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,280
every family has them now, right?

951
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,400
I dare say,

952
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,120
in another decade or so,

953
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,360
our China will undergo even more dramatic changes.

954
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,640
Everyone,

955
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,560
the country has given us such a great opportunity now,

956
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,720
we must seize it.

957
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,880
Well said.

958
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,460
Zhang Xiaoxia.

959
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,360
Mrs. Li,

960
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,020
what are you doing these days?

961
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,500
My husband and I opened a clothing store.

962
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,800
On good days, we make 2,000 to 3,000.

963
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,560
On bad days,

964
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,120
just over 1,000.

965
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,240
Not bad.

966
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,840
Li Dayong,

967
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,360
how are you doing?

968
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,200
Mrs. Li,

969
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
as everyone knows,

970
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,040
I didn't learn any skills in school.

971
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,360
I can't do anything special,

972
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,680
so now I can only drive a taxi.

973
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,720
I make about

974
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,640
3,000 to 4,000 a month.

975
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,960
That's quite a bit more than those with regular salaries.

976
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,720
Right?

977
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,200
Dajian,

978
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,380
what about you?

979
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,600
I'm the only one at this table who's not doing well.

980
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,200
Business isn't always good.

981
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:15,880
No.

982
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,760
When was the last time you had a good deal?

983
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,800
Was it last month?

984
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,540
The net profit was just over 100,000.

985
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,920
Over 100,000?

986
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,560
I'm paying today.

987
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,490
Don't anyone fight me for the bill.

988
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,400
Guoming,

989
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,120
among all the students I've taught,

990
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,380
you were the smartest.

991
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,920
How have you been lately?

992
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,680
Every month, I make

993
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,000
573.5 yuan.

994
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,840
Fixed salary.

995
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,600
We're about the same,

996
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,200
though you make 20 more than me.

997
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,800
Then you need to work harder.

998
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,240
Sure, bro.

999
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,160
Guoming.

1000
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,800
I remember you're a great singer.

1001
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,640
How about singing one for us later?

1002
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,440
Of course.

1003
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,400
My singing doesn't come cheap.

1004
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,600
Got your money ready?

1005
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,800
Money's not an issue.

1006
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,840
Here's to you.

1007
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,320
Cheers.

1008
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,760
Teacher, cheers.

1009
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,840
Drink up.

1010
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,840
But you know what?

1011
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,720
That outfit of yours

1012
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,160
looks just like the prison uniform I wore during labor reform.

1013
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,000
Don't you think so?

1014
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,200
Don't talk nonsense.

1015
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,120
I've never been in labor reform.

1016
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,880
I don't even know what a prison uniform looks like.

1017
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,740
How about this:

1018
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,020
next time you go in,

1019
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,120
bring one out so I can see for myself.

1020
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
These days,

1021
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
you can't ask me about that anymore.

1022
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,640
The real expert now

1023
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,880
is our classmate Guo Dapao.

1024
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,500
Haven't you seen the news?

1025
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,440
He got arrested at a massage parlor.

1026
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,280
Why don't I see him?

1027
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,200
Our

1028
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,320
class.

1029
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,360
has produced a

1030
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,120
celebrity.

1031
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,120
Haven't you watched TV, Ms. Li?

1032
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,040
No, I haven't.

1033
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,840
Guo Dapao was arrested and shown on TV.

1034
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,440
During the interview,

1035
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,570
he was talking like he owned the place.

1036
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,240
Really?

1037
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,640
Here, let me imitate him.

1038
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,100
You have to hold your hands like this.

1039
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,480
As everyone knows,

1040
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,400
what I did was wrong.

1041
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,680
I deeply regret my actions.

1042
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,040
I hope everyone will learn from my mistakes.

1043
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,520
Whoever breaks the law

1044
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,400
will surely be punished by it.

1045
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,680
As the old saying goes,

1046
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,240
good and evil will eventually be rewarded accordingly.

1047
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,120
The right path in life is through hardship.

1048
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,320
I hope everyone stays on the right path.

1049
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,720
Dajian,

1050
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,400
if I were you,

1051
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,900
I'd be too embarrassed to imitate Dapao.

1052
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,640
I remember your last rehabilitation

1053
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,970
was for organizing prostitution, right?

1054
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,560
Guys like Dapao were your customers.

1055
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,080
The customer is always right.

1056
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,080
How can you criticize the chef after eating the meal?

1057
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,800
He wasn't even my client.

1058
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,480
Besides, I'm not in that business anymore.

1059
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,360
Let me tell you, Ms. Li,

1060
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,560
I won't do that kind of thing again.

1061
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,880
I won't end up on TV either.

1062
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,440
If I were on TV, I wouldn't act like that.

1063
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,960
Wait,

1064
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,280
that Guo Dapao...

1065
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,280
Guo Dalei.

1066
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,240
Why didn't he come today?

1067
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,720
Police.

1068
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,660
Please cooperate with us.

1069
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,450
We have some questions for you.

1070
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,200
Wait, I just

1071
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,320
went to a hair salon.

1072
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,760
Besides, wasn't this matter already resolved?

1073
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,760
The whole city witnessed it, didn't they?

1074
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,020
Don't misunderstand.

1075
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,120
This is just an inquiry,

1076
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,040
not an interrogation.

1077
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,440
We just want to get some information from you.

1078
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,040
That stupid little incident

1079
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,600
never seems to end.

1080
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,160
No.

1081
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,160
What inquiry?

1082
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,200
What do you want to know?

1083
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,560
You want more details?

1084
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,640
It's not about that incident.

1085
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,840
It's something else.

1086
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,920
What else could I possibly be involved in?

1087
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,650
We just need some information.

1088
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,840
Let's talk at the market office.

1089
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,040
Can you tell me

1090
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,600
where you were on the night

1091
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,800
of the 17th?

1092
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,240
The 17th?

1093
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,440
The 17th?

1094
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,520
Which year and month's 17th?

1095
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,640
That was so long ago.

1096
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,360
You're asking me out of nowhere.

1097
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,640
How would I remember?

1098
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,770
I'm just asking you.

1099
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,080
What did you do on the 17th?

1100
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,080
Can you remember?

1101
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,520
I'm asking you a question.

1102
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,480
Don't answer with questions.

1103
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,810
Well, I don't remember.

1104
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,480
It's okay. Take your time.

1105
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,640
If you can't remember, we'll help you.

1106
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,240
Well, here's the situation.

1107
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,280
I did have something that day.

1108
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,560
There was an

1109
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,520
annual class reunion that night.

1110
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,840
I organized this.

1111
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,370
Everyone's waiting for me.

1112
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,440
One of my classmates is your colleague.

1113
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,240
Alright.

1114
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,920
Come on, sing.

1115
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,240
Guoming, give us one.

1116
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:33,840
I've had too much to drink.

1117
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,480
I'm not singing.

1118
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,320
Come on.

1119
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,780
Didn't you just say you'd sing if we paid you?

1120
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,040
Is this enough?

1121
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,120
I'll have to hum a bit then.

1122
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,720
So tell me

1123
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,520
how much would make you sing?

1124
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,320
118,000.

1125
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,960
I'll sing for you until dawn.

1126
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,080
