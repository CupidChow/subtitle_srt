1
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
Li. Li.

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,760
Hello. Hello.

3
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,690
Here you go. Here you go.

4
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,360
Here.

5
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,060
It's the Spring Festival.

6
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,000
Tomorrow?

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
tomorrow.

8
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,580
when Mengmeng comes back,

9
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,759
when she comes back.

10
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,039
We should

11
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,960
we should be together.

12
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,560
But I'm afraid

13
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,120
The creditors will come too.

14
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,450
You may scare Mengmeng.

15
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,360
Why is Mengmeng so fragile?

16
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,290
You're not weak.

17
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,600
You're not weak.

18
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,860
Hide in the mountains.

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,480
Tell me how much you owe me.

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,200
Just leave it.

21
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,260
I think I live a good life here.

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,420
As the saying goes,

23
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,220
the more you deal with people,

24
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,520
I still think it's good to deal with dogs.

25
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,520
Do these two dogs like to talk to you?

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,960
Tell me how much they owe.

27
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,250
I really don't know.

28
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,560
Tell me now.

29
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,480
What's the use of telling you?

30
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
You don't either.

31
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,000
I...

32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,840
have gone bankrupt

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,800
since young.

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,720
You know that.

35
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
So in this aspect,

36
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,720
I have more experience than you.

37
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,680
Why are you laughing?

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,520
You know what, your uncle

39
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,260
You can say it so proudly even if you go bankrupt.

40
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,600
I'm not as good as you.

41
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,040
I did go through a lot of bankruptcy,

42
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,880
But now,

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,160
I owe someone.

44
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,000
a penny?

45
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,520
I don't think so.

46
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,760
Absolutely not.

47
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,340
Tell me how much you owe me.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,720
Including the credit card.

49
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,940
there's more than 300,000 yuan left.

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,360
What?

51
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,400
I thought it was a lot.

52
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,520
How about this?

53
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,640
Give me the phone number of Mr. Gao.

54
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,620
I'll get this done for you.

55
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,120
But you have to promise me one thing.

56
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,120
What is it?

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,730
Wipe your hands.

58
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,800
This is...

59
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,720
Your grandfather?

60
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,760
In the 60s,

61
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,460
Ding Qing Restaurant.

62
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,800
of Dingqing Restaurant.

63
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,260
can also be called recipe.

64
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
or a recipe.

65
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,840
You have to memorize it

66
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
in half a month.

67
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,480
No.

68
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,260
This...

69
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,760
Add a few grams of seasoning.

70
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,960
How long does it take to fry?

71
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,420
This...

72
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,860
It's too complicated.

73
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,480
Can you memorize it?

74
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,760
I can.

75
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,080
Then why should I carry it?

76
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,840
I want to participate in the cooking knowledge competition.

77
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,500
I want you to learn how to cook.

78
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Uncle, you didn't teach me how to drive.

79
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,840
You want me to learn how to drive?

80
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,080
Is this something you can learn by reading?

81
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,810
Do you want to

82
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,130
go down the mountain without debt?

83
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,360
Yes.

84
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
Then memorize it.

85
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,020
Do you remember when I got a lawyer certificate?

86
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,740
Show me your strength.

87
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,400
Okay.

88
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,159
Drink slowly.

89
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,140
It's getting dark.

90
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,040
Let's set off firecrackers.

91
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,960
Okay.

92
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,760
Where did you put the cannon?

93
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,159
I put it beside the stove.

94
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,520
Uncle.

95
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,240
This is called New Year.

96
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,240
Happy New Year.

97
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,360
Happy New Year.

98
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,560
Fatty.

99
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,040
The red packet I made for you is still inside.

100
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,760
What?

101
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,840
Happy New Year.

102
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,440
Happy New Year.

103
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,480
Happy New Year.

104
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
See you tomorrow.

105
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,320
tomorrow.

106
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,120
I need you to help me with my grudges.

107
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,400
Tomorrow?

108
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,659
Change your style.

109
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,480
Show me how you bullied me.

110
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,520
I don't need you to teach me.

111
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,240
I know the way.

112
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,160
See you tomorrow.

113
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,960
What time is it?

114
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,600
9 p.m.

115
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,010
Can't I dress like this?

116
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,160
New clothes.

117
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,000
Hey.

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,060
What are you doing?

119
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,760
Good news.

120
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,440
Dean Gao told me

121
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,770
my case has been solved.

122
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,120
Good news.

123
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,040
Tomorrow,

124
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,920
I wanted you to do something with me.

125
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,560
What is it?

126
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,010
It's fine. It's solved.

127
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,159
Just focus on your case.

128
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,020
I'm hanging up.

129
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,560
Enough.

130
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,720
What do you mean?

131
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,480
I must pay you back.

132
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,720
but I can only pay you back.

133
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,080
and the interest rate of your colleague

134
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,420
I'll pay you back in two years.

135
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,040
You two

136
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,120
Are you playing with me?

137
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,400
Young man.

138
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,400
I'm

139
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,520
in the 80s.

140
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,520
I'm also a veteran.

141
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,080
I have lung cancer.

142
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
I'm dying.

143
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,720
If anything happens to my nephew,

144
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,760
I will hug you

145
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,900
and jump off the building.

146
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,360
Speaking of

147
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,960
Yes.

148
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Besides,

149
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,640
my intestines are all ruthless.

150
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,840
As you know,

151
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,000
I might die before him.

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,800
Stop it.

153
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,050
Give me an explanation.

154
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,800
Gao Tianzuo.

155
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,000
Good name.

156
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,640
I didn't know

157
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,360
You're good.

158
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,880
He's acting.

159
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
I believe it.

160
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,560
If I knew

161
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,160
If I knew you could do it, I would've done it. I wouldn't have done that.

162
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,040
In the 90s,

163
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,680
in the 90s,

164
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
we'll definitely make a fortune.

165
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,320
I wouldn't have been in there for so many years.

166
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,760
No, I don't deserve to be your partner.

167
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,760
What are you talking about?

168
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,480
Where did you get

169
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,560
Where did you get that?

170
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,000
Let me tell you.

171
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,600
whether I should say it or not,

172
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,130
Your prop is well prepared.

173
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
I made it myself.

174
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,720
You made it yourself?

175
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,160
Can you make one for me?

176
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,920
What are you doing?

177
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,440
You...

178
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,720
Give me a piece of that.

179
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,440
I'll compliment my pancake stall.

180
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,200
I'm telling you, business will be great.

181
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,760
Really?

182
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,080
You still like evil things.

183
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,080
Brother.

184
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,600
You're the one who left first. You're still scolding me after the wicked thing?

185
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,760
Okay.

186
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
I left first.

187
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,160
Uncle.

188
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,680
Good boy.

189
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,280
I've memorized them all.

190
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,800
Let's

191
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,240
memorizing it backwards.

192
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,760
I'm sure it'll be fine anyway.

193
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,680
Let me test you.

194
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,880
Do whatever you want.

195
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,240
I guess he really memorized it.

196
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,440
Okay, you eat first.

197
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,120
That's dog's.

198
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,400
It's yours.

199
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,520
Let me tell you.

200
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,120
Fatty,

201
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,240
You have to thank your uncle this time.

202
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,960
Your uncle has solved

203
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,000
your debt.

204
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,240
Why are you so quick-tongued?

205
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,680
I want to use this to get him.

206
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,560
What's there to take?

207
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,520
A kid.

208
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:13,880
No.

209
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,400
It's all settled.

210
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,440
Fatty,

211
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,160
your uncle pretended to be a cancer patient

212
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,400
to solve your problem, you know?

213
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,640
Where are you going?

214
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,880
I'm going to feed the dog.

215
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,000
Go on.

216
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,640
Let me tell you.

217
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,880
It's your uncle.

218
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,760
When we arrived, your uncle pulled the bag.

219
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,480
A fake cancer letter.

220
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,740
and put it on the table.

221
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,760
The three of you are the most worried.

222
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,680
You two.

223
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,640
My silly nephew

224
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,960
He...

225
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,500
He can't starve to death in this society.

226
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,320
But if you

227
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,880
count on him to take care of you two,

228
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,010
it's a little risky.

229
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,040
That's it.

230
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,840
Oh my god.

231
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,760
Do this

232
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,800
It's so real

233
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,380
This...

234
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,850
There's a seal here.

235
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
Why did you search her bag?

236
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,800
Look at you.

237
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,920
Don't go through my bag.

238
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,650
You're back.

239
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,560
Giferni (anticancer drug)

240
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:27,820
This...

241
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,160
It's not fake, right?

242
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,760
It's fake.

243
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,050
Didn't he just say that?

244
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,530
What about this?

245
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,120
This is the targeted drug.

246
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
That's fake too.

247
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,760
It's true too.

248
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,640
I

249
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,600
pass by the hospital,

250
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,760
at most,

251
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,080
six more months.

252
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,960
I didn't want to tell you,

253
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,880
but I kept it from you.

254
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,880
I'm tired.

255
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,920
It's okay.

256
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
This day comes.

257
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,680
What about going to the hospital?

258
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,840
Why are you wandering outside?

259
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,880
If I

260
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,340
if I go to the hospital,

261
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,800
you'll never get out.

262
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,680
I still have

263
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,920
my unfinished wish.

264
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,580
Before your grandpa left,

265
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,320
before he left.

266
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,200
but it didn't open.

267
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,000
When I see him downstairs,

268
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,000
I want to look up.

269
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,440
and tell him

270
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,120
I'll get this done.

271
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,580
How about this?

272
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,400
I have some money.

273
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,600
I'll give you all my money.

274
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,480
I won't leave a penny.

275
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,160
Let's open a hotel first.

276
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,680
Let's go to the hospital after this.

277
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,880
It's not about money.

278
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,440
Now

279
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,440
is stuck in Ding Qing Restaurant.

280
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,770
There's a beauty salon.

281
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,240
A beauty salon?

282
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,360
There's a girl.

283
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,200
is doing well.

284
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,680
No matter how much I paid her and begged her,

285
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,970
she wouldn't give me the store.

286
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,880
Thank you.

287
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,800
Thank you.

288
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,480
Hello, sir.

289
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,800
How can I help you?

290
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,560
Is your boss here?

291
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,920
I am the boss.

292
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,640
Sir, what do you want to do?

293
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,800
I want to get plastic surgery.

294
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760
Can you do it?

295
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,600
Of course.

296
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,400
What do you want to do?

297
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,760
I don't know.

298
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,040
Can you help me?

299
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,640
I don't need any adjustment.

300
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,720
Sir, your face

301
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,440
is not flawless,

302
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,360
but it's almost perfect.

303
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
It's rare for people like you

304
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,200
come to our place very rarely.

305
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,160
I

306
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,760
I'm going to a talent show.

307
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,600
So there must be no flaws.

308
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,760
Can you help me?

309
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,640
If I have to say,

310
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,760
I think your nose is a bit high.

311
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,680
I can add a fake

312
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,400
on the tip of your nose.

313
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,600
Put it on a little bit.

314
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,160
This way,

315
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,640
can make your nose more smooth.

316
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,000
Okay.

317
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,120
Then make a nose.

318
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,320
That's it

319
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:31,840
Yes.

320
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,760
I'm in a hurry.

321
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,330
When do you want to meet the doctor?

322
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,560
Today.

323
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,360
Okay.

324
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,080
I'll arrange it for you right away.

325
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,600
Okay.

326
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,360
I'll arrange it for you.

327
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,360
Pull out a can.

328
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,600
Okay.

329
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,330
Come in, please.

330
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,760
What's wrong?

331
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,120
My heart hurts.

332
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,080
Feeling uncomfortable?

333
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,680
Dada.

334
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,850
A tiger climbing the mountain.

335
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,160
Mr. Cui.

336
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,880
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

337
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,560
It's okay.

338
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,520
The floor is too slippery.

339
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,850
Waiter, come and mop it.

340
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,000
How old are you?

341
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,840
You're still like a tiger whistle (reckless).

342
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,120
Your hairstyle is worse than before.

343
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,120
Come here.

344
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,640
Mr. Cui.

345
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,079
Do you know him?

346
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,440
Of course.

347
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,079
You are

348
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,839
are married.

349
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,650
They have two children.

350
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,800
This is really...

351
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,760
Mr. Cui.

352
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,160
Since you and Liu left,

353
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,320
I've been kicking three rounds every day.

354
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,840
I was so fast.

355
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,520
I was known as Fei's legs in the Suihe City.

356
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,120
But trust me.

357
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,440
Not only did I feed myself,

358
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,770
I also saved some money.

359
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,760
But to be honest,

360
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,380
I was a little shy to say it.

361
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,290
I think about Fei every day.

362
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
When I think of her,

363
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,560
when I think of her.

364
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,010
Take the car.

365
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
In my heart,

366
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,480
she has gone astray.

367
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,980
As long as we modify it,

368
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,000
she will still be a good girl.

369
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,200
For three years,

370
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,980
we communicated every month.

371
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,040
It's good that we don't communicate.

372
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,920
The more we write, the more we know each other.

373
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,980
The more we know each other, the more we like each other.

374
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,760
In this process,

375
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,840
I worked harder

376
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
to save some money

377
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,410
and changed the tricycle to a taxi.

378
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,140
Three years later,

379
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,040
Feifei finally came out.

380
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,560
I trust her.

381
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,480
But honestly,

382
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm not sure.

383
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
I told her

384
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,850
that you can't lie to me.

385
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,520
If you lie to me again,

386
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,720
you'll have to lie to me forever.

387
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,680
After that,

388
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,960
we got married.

389
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,920
It's really simple.

390
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,360
But brother

391
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,160
Back then,

392
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,320
my parents,

393
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,560
I wanted to tell you first.

394
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,400
But when you were abroad,

395
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,160
when you were abroad.

396
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,240
After we got married, we started wild ginseng trade.

397
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,800
We mainly export Russia.

398
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,920
Be modest

399
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,480
Well done

400
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,020
I've been working there for over a decade

401
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,920
We bought a house there

402
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,680
Now we have two children

403
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,520
The child is too young.

404
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,380
I didn't bring him back this time.

405
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,920
What's wrong?

406
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,120
Try it.

407
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
Fei's hairy legs.

408
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,160
Much better, Liu.

409
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,840
I'm sorry.

410
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,360
I used you right after I came back.

411
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,520
Don't mention it.

412
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,760
I'll give you a 20% discount

413
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,480
I'll give you a 20% discount. Remember.

414
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
Okay, no problem.

415
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,080
Thank you.

416
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,730
Let me wash my hands.

417
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,600
Come on.

418
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,120
Come on.

419
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,960
Come on.

420
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,760
I'm quite touched after hearing your story.

421
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,800
Congratulations.

422
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,720
But there's something I don't understand.

423
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,480
Go ahead.

424
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,120
you like Feifei.

425
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,640
I totally understand.

426
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,320
But what does Feifei like about you?

427
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,240
What kind of question is that?

428
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,600
Tell me.

429
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,680
Answer.

430
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,120
What do you like about me?

431
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,600
I like him.

432
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
A fierce tiger climbs the mountain.

433
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
I understand

434
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,760
To be honest,

435
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,480
I found out later.

436
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,200
I think

437
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,720
she's smarter than me.

438
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,680
You need to

439
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,040
to slowly find out.

440
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,290
Brother.

441
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,800
Liu told me

442
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,800
is gone.

443
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,560
Yes.

444
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,520
He left.

445
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,880
I couldn't see him for the last time.

446
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,360
But he realized his dream.

447
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,560
It can be considered

448
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,690
die without regret.

449
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,900
Do you remember

450
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,000
He wants a mountain

451
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,720
and then

452
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,530
become a mountain king.

453
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,160
I'm the king. I'm the king.

454
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,360
It's here. It's here.

455
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,840
Here

456
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,170
It's really a good place to plant wild ginseng

457
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,800
I wish I had such a place.

458
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,040
Mr. Liu is really something.

459
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,160
Good choice.

460
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,160
Brother.

461
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,680
Sell all the ginseng

462
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,720
in the future.

463
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,760
For what?

464
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,840
For you.

465
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,440
I can give you the mountain.

466
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,400
No, brother.

467
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,100
I'll give it to you.

468
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,480
The condition is

469
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,500
take care of these two dogs for me.

470
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,800
I don't have time.

471
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,840
What do you mean?

472
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,560
What do you mean?

473
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,320
I'm busy.

474
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,780
I'm opening a shop.

475
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,500
You can't give it to me.

476
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,930
Name your price.

477
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,700
I'll buy it.

478
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,560
How much?

479
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,000
Liu

480
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,060
took this mountain with 20,000 yuan.

481
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,440
Now

482
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,680
for more than ten years.

483
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,720
Take it.

484
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,320
Okay. Okay.

485
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,040
You two dogs.

486
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,760
as our own children.

487
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,320
But we must

488
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,000
we must buy it.

489
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,690
Give us 15,000 yuan.

490
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,240
This...

491
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,240
Because of Chubby.

492
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,040
and Mengmeng.

493
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,720
are not in the mood.

494
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,760
As long as

495
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,220
take care of the dog for me.

496
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,000
Taking care of Shan

497
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,840
is my help.

498
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,160
Thank you.

499
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,160
We'll give it to you.

500
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,480
Okay.

501
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,660
Let's go! Let's go!

502
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,840
Boss.

503
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,360
Tell me what happened.

504
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,600
Do you think this is a medical accident?

505
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,360
The audition program I've been waiting for so many years

506
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,360
is about to start.

507
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,600
What do you want me to do?

508
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,000
No, that's impossible.

509
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,640
There was no such accident here.

510
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,080
Yes.

511
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,020
You never had an accident.

512
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,880
I made it in time after one accident.

513
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,040
Why am I so unlucky?

514
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,400
Sir, calm down.

515
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,160
Let go of me.

516
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,680
Well,

517
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,520
I'll take you to take a x-ray.

518
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,360
Then...

519
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,920
I'll return the surgery fee to you.

520
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,120
and make you another one for free, okay?

521
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,520
You...

522
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,720
Are you doing this again for free?

523
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,560
Guys.

524
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,800
I'm 25 years old

525
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,800
My life will be ruined if you make me look like this.

526
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,160
I live on my face.

527
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,200
Can I compensate you?

528
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,000
The money I owe you

529
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,760
I'll ruin my whole life.

530
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,200
Why do I need your money?

531
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,240
I can only...

532
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
I can only sit here and cry every day.

533
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,760
Get up first.

534
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,640
No, no, no.

535
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
Don't touch me.

536
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,320
You first.

537
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,400
Let go.

538
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,480
Let's...

539
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,240
Let's talk inside.

540
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,160
Sisters

541
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,720
Look

542
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,120
I'm only 25

543
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,960
Why did you do this to me?

544
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,200
We will help you.

545
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,240
Why should I go there?

546
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,840
The money Dada bought you the mountain

547
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,880
350,000 yuan.

548
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,440
He's afraid you won't accept it.

549
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,900
so he put it here and asked me to give it to you.

550
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,520
You signed the contract.

551
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,720
I'll send it to him after that.

552
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,120
That shabby mountain is not worth 350,000 yuan.

553
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,080
Just sign it.

554
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,640
I've asked around.

555
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,440
This price

556
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,480
is not worth 350,000 yuan.

557
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,640
It’s not worth it.

558
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,760
Dada has to buy it by force.

559
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,200
He also agreed

560
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,080
to take good care of the two dogs on the mountain.

561
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
If you don't sign it,

562
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,210
if you don't sign it.

563
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,880
How can I do that?

564
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,840
I didn’t understand

565
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,120
why you were so nice to Dada.

566
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,880
Now I understand.

567
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,400
You're doing good deeds.

568
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,720
Aren't you going to reopen Ding Qing Restaurant?

569
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,050
Do you still need money?

570
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,290
It's all here this time.

571
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,720
I don't need money.

572
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,680
But

573
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,880
I can't cash the shop.

574
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,120
He won't give it to me.

575
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,240
Dad.

576
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,200
The High School officially accepted my dad's case.

577
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,000
The trial will be set soon.

578
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,680
That's great.

579
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,960
I thought

580
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,560
hear this news again.

581
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,240
What are you talking about?

582
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,240
Just recently.

583
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,880
No, where is my dad?

584
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,840
He didn't answer my call.

585
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,400
Follow me.

586
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,260
Bye, Uncle Liu.

587
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,540
Dad, why didn't you answer the phone?

588
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,640
Have a seat.

589
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,520
Look.

590
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,760
That's my father.

591
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,200
find you a stepmother.

592
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,520
Is it fun?

593
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,440
Yes.

594
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,690
But can our stepmother follow you?

595
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,360
Sure.

596
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,980
Your father is not bad.

597
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
You're a good person.

598
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,080
The stepmother

599
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,560
is leaving with other good people.

600
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,080
You can call the past the wind.

601
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,000
Whatever.

602
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,520
The past can't be the wind

603
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,440
Why?

604
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,320
The case is not closed yet.

605
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,600
I'm here to tell you this.

606
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,640
Your case has been confirmed.

607
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,800
The trial will be set in a few days.

608
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,440
This is fun.

609
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,080
Sir.

610
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,320
We're off work.

611
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,160
Let's get off work.

612
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,660
I can't leave even if you're off work.

613
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,520
I have to keep an eye on it.

614
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,120
Don't let other people

615
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,880
be deceived by your gangster.

616
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,480
No.

617
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,520
You're so handsome.

618
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,920
Why are you so shameless?

619
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,320
Then I'm the victim.

620
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,160
How can you feel better

621
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,440
will you feel better?

622
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,500
Are you cold sitting here?

623
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,400
Bro

624
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,240
Are you just here or are you still here?

625
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,080
I have to be here if you're here.

626
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,560
If you stay here, I'll call the police.

627
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,960
If you want to call the police,

628
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,680
go ahead.

629
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,720
I'll contact my media friends too.

630
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,850
Have you had breakfast?

631
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,960
Why can't I?

632
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,360
Right?

633
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,240
At that time,

634
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,200
At that time,

635
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,640
the head of a person

636
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,600
in the end, right?

637
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,080
Besides,

638
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,800
his head hasn't completely become a dog's head yet.

639
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,960
Just talk to him.

640
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,680
Talk.

641
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,640
You're right.

642
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,220
How about this?

643
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,560
Make a condition.

644
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,960
As long as it's not too much,

645
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,080
I'll do it.

646
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,520
You asked me to bring it up.

647
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,580
Then I'll tell you.

648
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,920
Don't worry.

649
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,000
I won't extort you.

650
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,200
I don't need much money from you.

651
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
Keep your word.

652
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,360
Give me your shop.

653
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,320
beauty, plastic surgery equipment,

654
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,120
Move everything away.

655
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
How much will the renovation cost?

656
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,040
Just tell me.

657
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,100
I'll give it to you.

658
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,580
My beauty salon is so popular.

659
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,080
so popular?

660
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,810
Everyone wants to cash my shop.

661
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,860
Is there any treasure inside?

662
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,360
If you don't want to cash it,

663
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,240
It's okay, intestines.

664
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,000
I promise no matter it's raining or thundering,

665
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,600
and report on time every day.

666
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,720
I'll get going then.

667
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,160
You don't even add sausage to a meal.

668
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,560
You won't choke.

669
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,080
Uncle, isn't it strange?

670
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,360
I haven't turned on my phone since there was no signal on the mountain.

671
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,640
I went down the mountain and turned on my phone.

672
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,080
There's no debt collector either.

673
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,080
What do you think?

674
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,640
Take a guess.

675
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,050
Help me return all my credit cards.

676
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,040
What else?

677
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,800
I'm looking for Mr. Liu.

678
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,960
I asked for.

679
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,600
One by one.

680
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,360
Uncle.

681
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,080
I won't say anything.

682
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,080
Just see if I did a good job

683
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,760
That's it?

684
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,880
If you dare to fool me again,

685
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,600
I'll break your leg.

686
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,960
Who can I fool?

687
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,760
What happened to your nose?

688
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,920
Did you fight with someone?

689
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,480
or are there creditors outside?

690
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,200
Tell me.

691
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,960
It's definitely not a fight.

692
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,080
Tell me what to do.

693
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,480
You'll know soon.

694
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,320
This is my uncle.

695
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,980
He wants to cash this shop.

696
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,000
You know each other?

697
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,220
He's my nephew.

698
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
I see.

699
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,400
Your uncle wants my shop.

700
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,930
If I don't give it to him,

701
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,600
you come to my place for plastic surgery

702
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,200
and break your nose.

703
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,240
and forced me to cash this shop to you.

704
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,680
Don't slander me.

705
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,360
It's not what you said.

706
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,400
Besides, even if it's like what you said,

707
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,800
as long as you don't cash the store to me,

708
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,640
I'm sure your shop won't open for a day.

709
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,570
You're doing Sage Dance together.

710
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,080
No, Uncle Cui.

711
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,120
You used to be honest.

712
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,320
I never chased you out every time you came.

713
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,600
I didn't expect you to be like this.

714
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,920
Aren't you ashamed?

715
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,240
You are

716
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,760
like this?

717
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,440
Help me like this.

718
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,360
Help me?

719
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,520
Did I ever hit you?

720
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,980
Why did I hit you today?

721
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,840
Chubby.

722
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,680
A man.

723
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,500
You can be unreliable,

724
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,800
but you can't be evil.

725
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,520
Aren't you blackmailing me?

726
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,560
No, it's not me.

727
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,000
It's not me.

728
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,380
How embarrassing.

729
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,360
Let me tell you.

730
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,000
You're colluding in blackmailing.

731
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,400
I'll call the police and arrest you.

732
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,360
I'm not blackmailing.

733
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,160
Enough.

734
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,040
Stop talking.

735
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,040
Mr. Feng, I know him.

736
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,600
Fatty.

737
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,080
Do you know me?

738
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,960
Aunt Zhou.

739
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,440
It's not Aunt Zhou.

740
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,000
I don't care if you know him or not.

741
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,880
you can be the judge.

742
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,200
Do you think they are working together

743
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,480
to bully a little girl like me?

744
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,520
There must be a misunderstanding.

745
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,120
He's not that kind of person.

746
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,520
You...

747
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,000
Tell me.

748
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,920
Okay, calm down.

749
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,200
Ms Feng.

750
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,440
Can you give me a few minutes?

751
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,160
I'll tell you some real stories.

752
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:24,880
Okay.

753
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,370
Let's hear it out. Okay.

754
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
The first story

755
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,740
is an old man who just passed away.

756
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,400
He fled from Beijing when he was young.

757
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,490
He almost starved to death.

758
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,000
He's the boss of Dingqing Restaurant.

759
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,640
Mr. Zhang took him in.

760
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,940
and asked him to work here.

761
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,000
From that day on,

762
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,850
he has been working at Dingqing Restaurant all his life.

763
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,080
From the running hall

764
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,530
to apprentices,

765
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,810
to change the knife.

766
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,800
and the chef.

767
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,730
to the general manager.

768
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,770
he dedicated his whole life to Ding Qing Restaurant.

769
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,720
Before he died,

770
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,219
the plaque that was broken in half

771
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,400
is still under his bed.

772
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,320
Before he left,

773
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,960
before he left.

774
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,560
This place I've been working for my whole life.

775
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
The second story

776
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,560
is a middle-aged man.

777
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,580
He's also the son of the old man

778
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,920
in the first story.

779
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,480
When his wife was young,

780
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,699
when she was young.

781
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,800
Back then,

782
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,400
the best time

783
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,199
for them

784
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,480
is to take the kids

785
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,889
to Dingqing Restaurant this weekend.

786
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,679
Later his wife

787
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,560
died in a car accident.

788
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,719
Last year?

789
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,540
his daughter got married.

790
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,000
His daughter wants to

791
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,400
to have a meal here.

792
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,080
But

793
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,900
Ding Qing Restaurant is gone.

794
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,200
Go on.

795
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,920
The third story.

796
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,720
is a young man.

797
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,330
His parents are so unreliable.

798
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,290
They barely cared about him since childhood.

799
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,320
He was raised by his uncle.

800
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,640
Uncle

801
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,120
to raise three children.

802
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,930
In order to raise these three kids,

803
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,620
he went abroad to work as a coolie.

804
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,400
for ten years.

805
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,680
Later the children

806
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,120
grew up.

807
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,780
He also came back from abroad.

808
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,320
But his nephew

809
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,650
is still so unreliable.

810
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,720
and cause him trouble.

811
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,600
Now,

812
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,290
my uncle is terminally ill.

813
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,040
Maybe

814
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,370
there's not much time left.

815
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,490
He just wants to reopen Ding Qing Restaurant.

816
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,880
to fulfill

817
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,480
his father's wish.

818
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,960
My wife's wish.

819
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,370
My daughter's wish.

820
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,480
This is my third story.

821
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,120
I'm telling the truth.

822
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,060
Aunt Zhou can testify.

823
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,200
Ms. Feng.

824
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,160
I'm really sorry.

825
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
My uncle

826
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,760
my uncle has helped me a lot.

827
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,640
But I

828
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,360
I can't think of any other way.

829
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,920
How can I help him?

830
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,200
This nose

831
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,880
I hit it with my fist.

832
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,360
I'm really sorry.

833
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,480
Wait.

834
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,840
Although you made your nose,

835
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,880
but it's already inflamed.

836
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,640
I'll arrange an operation for you.

837
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,970
Take the fake out later.

838
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,560
Thank you.

839
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,840
Come in.

840
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,640
Sit.

841
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:21,880
Well,

842
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,240
I'm really sorry

843
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,560
for causing you so much trouble.

844
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,320
How much is this surgery?

845
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,880
I'll go to the reception to swipe my card.

846
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,520
No need.

847
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,440
A minor surgery.

848
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,560
That won't do.

849
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,600
I said no.

850
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,080
I'm leaving.

851
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,040
Wait.

852
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,840
You and your uncle

853
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,460
really want this shop?

854
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,440
Of course.

855
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,730
Otherwise, I wouldn't have...

856
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,100
Have a seat.

857
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,690
I've decided to transfer the store to you.

858
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,170
I already called my parents

859
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,960
I already called my parents.

860
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,100
They also agreed to let me open another restaurant.

861
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,720
Really?

862
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,760
No.

863
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,960
I don't know how to thank you.

864
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,920
This...

865
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,840
Do you know why

866
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,970
I decided to transfer this shop to you?

867
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,320
My three stories

868
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,240
are good.

869
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,120
Your three stories

870
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,480
are pretty good.

871
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,680
But it's not because of this.

872
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,460
Then...

873
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,000
Then why?

874
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,040
Because of you.

875
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,800
Handsome.

876
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,000
Because of you

877
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,160
very handsome.

878
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,520
He's born handsome.

879
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,520
I don't need plastic surgery at all.

880
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,080
And I was born

881
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,240
to handsome guys.

882
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:07,760
This...

883
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,880
All done.

884
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,880
Thank you.

885
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,520
Did you eat the dishes from Dingqing Restaurant when you were young?

886
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
Of course.

887
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,360
It was my favorite when I was young.

888
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,520
Snow-clothed soy paste.

889
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,320
Steamed pork.

890
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,200
And that one.

891
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,080
extracted eggs.

892
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,800
What was it called?

893
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,480
Crispy cabbage.

894
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,200
Yes.

895
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
Believe it or not,

896
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,480
I can tell you how much salt and soy sauce

897
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,160
I can tell you how much salt and soy sauce you add.

898
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,640
Wow!

899
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,800
That's the man I like

900
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,000
Steamed Crab with Vine Pepper.

901
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,800
with scallion oil.

902
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,280
One more fried wheat vegetable.

903
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,520
Uncle, you...

904
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,800
You're sick.

905
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,760
why do you still invite us out for dinner?

906
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,090
This meal is not for you.

907
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,200
It's my treat.

908
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,640
to give us such a good shop.

909
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,880
I'm really sorry.

910
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,860
Pour some wine.

911
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,560
We're family from now on.

912
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,880
You don't have to be so polite.

913
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,000
My nephew

914
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,720
is kind-hearted,

915
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,360
he is indeed unreliable.

916
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,520
From now on,

917
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,720
you have to discipline him.

918
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,200
She...

919
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:42,920
She...

920
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,640
Will she dare to control me?

921
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,240
Fatty.

922
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,170
Come on. Come on.

923
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,970
No bragging.

924
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,400
You'll be more handsome. You'll be more handsome.

925
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,000
Uncle.

926
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,600
Fatty told me everything.

927
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,400
He said

928
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,520
the closest family in the world.

929
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,120
closer than his parents.

930
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,600
Fatty and I

931
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,660
will listen to you.

932
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,440
Fatty.

933
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,840
I brought him up.

934
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,040
However,

935
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,280
legal immediate family

936
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,080
or his father and his mother.

937
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,090
His dad will be out soon.

938
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,240
When he comes out,

939
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,120
meet

940
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,250
He's easy to get along with.

941
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,080
He's coming out.

942
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,720
Where?

943
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,040
It seems that

944
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,120
about our situation.

945
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
When we meet,

946
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,120
she's old.

947
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,120
I don't have time.

948
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,400
Then tell them.

949
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,760
Don't make me regret.

950
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,560
My mom

951
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,760
abroad.

952
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,320
So fashionable.

953
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,680
I have

954
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,560
I have a half-brother.

955
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,460
My dad is Huo Dongfeng.

956
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,480
Have you heard of it?

957
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,580
He was one of the Three Heroes.

958
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,800
