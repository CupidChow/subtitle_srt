1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,640
I've been thinking day and night.

2
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,960
I've been wondering

3
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,240
why people

4
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,520
keep buying clothes non-stop.

5
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,360
In the past, people wore clothes

6
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,680
to cover themselves

7
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,080
and keep warm.

8
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,080
But why now

9
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,440
do they still constantly go shopping

10
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,240
for clothes?

11
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,320
Why is that?

12
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,640
Fashion.

13
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,200
So my store

14
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,120
isn't just a clothing store.

15
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,120
It's also a fashion boutique.

16
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,320
Look.

17
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,520
Fashion,

18
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,120
it covers a wide range.

19
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
For example,

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,050
the fashion in the Qing Dynasty

21
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,639
was long robes, mandarin jackets,

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,880
and qipaos.

23
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,560
A decade or so ago,

24
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,520
our fashion

25
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,560
was pure wool Zhongshan suits

26
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,120
and Dacron pants.

27
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,880
As time changes,

28
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,000
fashion is also being redefined.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,880
Fashion also varies between different regions.

30
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,610
For example,

31
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,240
Italian fashion

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,640
might be completely incomprehensible to Africans.

33
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,520
So,

34
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,120
I've been researching

35
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,060
what constitutes fashion for us Northeasterners.

36
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,200
What is this Northeastern fashion?

37
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,640
My research shows that

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,240
we Northeasterners like bright things,

39
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,520
flashy things.

40
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,079
Like what you're wearing.

41
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,340
That's pretty much it.

42
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,079
Why?

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,200
Because

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,880
during those winter months

45
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,410
when it snows heavily here,

46
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,800
once it snows,

47
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,320
the entire city turns white.

48
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,560
If you dress brightly

49
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,760
and flashily,

50
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,320
in the snow,

51
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,930
you're easy to find and won't get lost.

52
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,760
Anti-kidnapping?

53
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,640
You could say that.

54
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,000
So...

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,800
Do you know Versace?

56
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,440
That guy who sells buns next door to me?

57
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,520
That's Fan Siwei.

58
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,960
Must be his cousin

59
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,120
all with the same generation name, huh?

60
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,640
Versace sells clothes.

61
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,440
A tailor?

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,079
An Italian tailor.

63
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,000
Turn around and look,

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,079
that's his work.

65
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,960
You know what,

66
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,400
these Italians really have a style.

67
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,060
That yellow shirt over there.

68
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,200
He made this?

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,760
Is it bright?

70
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,520
Yes, it is.

71
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,800
Like a little leopard coming down the mountain.

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,640
Do you like it?

73
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,329
Take it. It's yours.

74
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,880
No, why give me

75
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,640
such an expensive gift?

76
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,440
Put it on.

77
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,740
Wear it every day. Once you understand Versace,

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,760
you'll grasp

79
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,690
the soul of Northeastern fashion.

80
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,120
I'd rather not, brother.

81
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,880
I'm just a kebab seller.

82
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,880
If I wore this, people would die laughing.

83
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,760
You don't like dressing up, right?

84
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,560
Right.

85
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,880
I've studied this too.

86
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,760
Why most men

87
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
don't like dressing up,

88
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,960
while most women

89
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,000
love to dress up

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,440
and shop so much?

91
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,880
It's because

92
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,000
our genes are at work.

93
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,120
How so?

94
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,440
Look, in primitive society,

95
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,320
we men had to go hunting.

96
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,320
And women?

97
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,640
They just carried little baskets,

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
picking wild fruits

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,240
and gathering mushrooms.

100
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,840
So they have it in their genes

101
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,580
to enjoy browsing around.

102
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
That's why in my store,

103
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,010
95% of the items are women's clothing.

104
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,080
This is also

105
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,970
the secret to making money.

106
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,640
Oh, brother!

107
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,560
I'm feeling a bit dazed here.

108
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,440
If you stand by this counter

109
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,880
with your hand like this and the spotlight on

110
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,200
you'll have that cool vibe, bro.

111
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,560
You're really something.

112
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,520
When do you think I'll be able

113
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,240
to be like you

114
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,320
and run my barbecue business

115
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,000
as thoroughly as you do?

116
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,400
Come see me whenever you're free.

117
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,860
We should chat more often.

118
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,400
Actually, I came today

119
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,000
mainly to say goodbye.

120
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,560
I'm closing my barbecue shop.

121
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,440
What happened?

122
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,300
Because of you.

123
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,800
You taught me to dig deeper.

124
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,560
I hung a map on my wall.

125
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,880
Every day I studied it

126
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,320
wondering where to open a new barbecue shop.

127
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,760
Finally, I reached a conclusion:

128
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,440
Dongguan, Guangdong.

129
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
Why go there?

130
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
I've done my research.

131
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,320
That place has

132
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,880
many Taiwanese and Hong Kong companies

133
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,560
operating there.

134
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,120
The key is that many

135
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,760
of our fellow Northeasterners work there.

136
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,320
When they get homesick

137
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,960
I'll show up and get to work

138
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,760
grilling some skewers for them.

139
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,760
Once they eat and feel happy

140
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,960
they'll bring friends from Hunan

141
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,640
and Jiangxi

142
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,880
and workers from all over China will come to eat.

143
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,880
How could this business not boom?

144
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,420
That's not bad.

145
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,920
Interesting.

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,530
I've learned a bit from you.

147
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
Don't mention it.

148
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,520
Good luck.

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,760
I came today

150
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,400
just to say goodbye to you, bro.

151
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,560
It's good to see you one more time.

152
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Well, I...

153
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Gotta go.

154
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,320
Do well.

155
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,400
Wait.

156
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,450
Take that shirt with you

157
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,000
and wear it in Guangdong.

158
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,120
Don't let down

159
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,760
the reputation of us Northeasterners.

160
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,360
Grilling barbecue in Versace, how about that?

161
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,000
Just return the hanger to me.

162
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,240
Guess how much we made in the first month?

163
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,000
How much?

164
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,120
23,000.

165
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,780
That's several years of our previous salaries.

166
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,880
We'll be able to buy a Santana soon.

167
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,450
Then I'll drive the Santana

168
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,400
to Mengmeng's grandfather's house,

169
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,880
and right in front of Mengmeng,

170
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,520
I'll slam

171
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
the car keys on the table

172
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,760
and let her mock me.

173
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,700
Your own daughter humiliates you

174
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,300
and ridicules you.

175
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,360
Shouldn't you

176
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,560
reflect on yourself?

177
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,720
In less than a year,

178
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,050
we'll buy that Santana.

179
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,120
Then you need to

180
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,760
stop causing trouble for a year.

181
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
Will you get your lawyer's license?

182
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,160
That incident with Xiaokong Glasses,

183
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,760
it created a bad public impression.

184
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,360
They now think

185
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,760
there's something wrong with my character.

186
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,640
I guess the lawyer's license

187
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,240
won't be issued to me for now.

188
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,800
What about in the future?

189
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,330
They won't give it to me either.

190
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,000
Actually,

191
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,240
it doesn't matter whether you get that license or not.

192
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
Aren't you doing well now?

193
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,520
The business is running,

194
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,650
as long as our family is safe and sound.

195
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,960
I don't necessarily need to be a lawyer.

196
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,010
But this matter with Guo Dapao,

197
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,660
what can we do about it?

198
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,240
Guo Dapao is fine,

199
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,240
but his daughter is so pitiful.

200
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,640
She's so young. What should we do?

201
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,840
Yes, what do you think

202
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,880
we should do?

203
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,260
It's worrying.

204
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,159
Should we save some of the money?

205
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
Bring me that thick stack.

206
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,850
I want to count it again.

207
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,280
I'll give you some money to burn.

208
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,000
Come on, let's race.

209
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,200
Let's race together.

210
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,640
Ready,

211
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,159
go!

212
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,880
You opened it?

213
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
Is that a problem?

214
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,000
What kind of talk is this?

215
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,880
Are you always this aggressive when you talk?

216
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,640
Even now,

217
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,120
as someone who's been around the block,

218
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,480
I don't talk like you do.

219
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,520
Yeah,

220
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,240
we've had a few scuffles before,

221
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,520
minor fights, right?

222
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,360
But I didn't come here today

223
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,000
looking for a fight.

224
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,440
So when you came in asking me

225
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:33,880
So when you first came in

226
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,120
if this was my shop

227
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,159
if I owned this place

228
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,039
What do you mean?

229
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,919
I don't own it.

230
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,780
I just work here as a salesperson.

231
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,640
Now suddenly

232
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,919
I don't want to talk about anything else.

233
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,400
So what do you want to talk about?

234
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,360
There's something I'm really curious about.

235
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,400
What exactly do you do for a living?

236
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,760
Think about it.

237
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,120
Over the past year

238
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,120
we've only met

239
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
a few times.

240
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,040
Each time you have a different job.

241
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,720
At first you said

242
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,440
your job was

243
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:54,720
an engineer at a machinery factory.

244
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,050
A mechanical engineer.

245
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,480
But when I first met you

246
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
you were a singer.

247
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,520
Right?

248
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,240
Then you set up a chess stall

249
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,280
in the park.

250
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,520
Now you're selling clothes.

251
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,280
What's going on?

252
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,600
I've had many jobs.

253
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,520
I've been a writer,

254
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:06,680
sold pinhole glasses,

255
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,640
sold vision therapy glasses,

256
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,720
and I'll do even more in the future.

257
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,760
Many more things.

258
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,520
Yeah, but what do you actually do?

259
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,040
You've got me completely confused.

260
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,120
Now I'm in fashion.

261
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,400
Aren't you selling clothes?

262
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,320
On the surface I sell clothes,

263
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,780
but really I'm in fashion.

264
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
Tell me the truth.

265
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,880
Are you

266
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,720
actually

267
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
a spy?

268
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,240
Why would you

269
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,640
think I'm a spy?

270
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,640
If you're not a spy,

271
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,400
why do you need

272
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,760
so many identities to cover yourself?

273
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,720
I'm just going to sell clothes from now on.

274
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,760
This year, next year,

275
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,240
the year after that. I'll keep selling clothes.

276
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,000
I see.

277
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,290
So you're going deep undercover, huh?

278
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,000
Let's just fight instead.

279
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,880
Talking to you is more exhausting than fighting.

280
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,810
You're not even my match in a fight.

281
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,280
Your brother-in-law would be more of a challenge.

282
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,920
Where is he?

283
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,760
Isn't he here?

284
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,480
Thanks to you, he's in jail.

285
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,400
What are you talking about?

286
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,120
In jail?

287
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,640
What happened?

288
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,160
You're being unreasonable now.

289
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,040
Look,

290
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
you brought him to fight me.

291
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
What was I supposed to do?

292
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,500
I had to defend myself.

293
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,720
Right? I couldn't just give in.

294
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,600
If I had surrendered,

295
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,400
what face would I have left?

296
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,520
How could I show my face in society?

297
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,000
Right?

298
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,000
You think you have any face in society?

299
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And selling clothes gives you face?

300
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,760
Are you buying anything?

301
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,520
If not, please leave.

302
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,840
I really don't have time to chat with you.

303
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,240
I'd love to chat with you two,

304
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,400
blabbering away here,

305
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,600
acting like you're something special.

306
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,720
Why did you just glance at me like that?

307
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,480
I've been talking to you two all this time,

308
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,520
did I give you any dirty looks?

309
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,520
If it were someone else,

310
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,120
I would've already made my move.

311
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
I would've slapped them twice across the face.

312
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,920
You know that?

313
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,840
But you,

314
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,120
even though you're quite annoying,

315
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,040
I still think you're

316
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,120
somewhat decent.

317
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,040
I mean, as someone who lives on the streets,

318
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,760
if I kept beating you up,

319
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,650
wouldn't people say I'm bullying you?

320
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,360
What did you just call me?

321
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,040
I'll say whatever I want.

322
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,370
If you don't like it, hit me or curse me.

323
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,520
Hey, buddy.

324
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,700
Stop messing with things.

325
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,480
I'll give you some clothes.

326
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,740
I'll give you some too.

327
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,600
Hey, what?

328
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,160
Do you think I need your clothes?

329
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,840
Blabbering on,

330
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,970
making me look good.

331
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,000
Where are you going, bro?

332
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,760
You haven't taken your clothes yet.

333
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,360
What kind of manners is that?

334
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,720
Even thugs have their dignity.

335
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,360
Right?

336
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,760
No.

337
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,280
Even gangsters have their pride.

338
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,210
You understand?

339
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,690
[Speaking Korean] Please eat.

340
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,180
Add some more alcohol.

341
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,280
Miss.

342
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,880
Later,

343
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,400
may I

344
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,280
ask you to dance downstairs?

345
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,880
I'm a waitress.

346
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,000
I only serve food.

347
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,160
Someone else will be available to dance with you later.

348
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,600
No.

349
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,760
I only want to dance with you.

350
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,240
I dare not dance.

351
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,920
If I dance,

352
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,280
my boss will fire me.

353
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,360
No way.

354
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,920
You have a great figure.

355
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,600
Like a Coke bottle.

356
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,240
Come in.

357
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,880
Manager Tang,

358
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,000
there's a guest downstairs looking for you.

359
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,640
Not someone causing trouble, is it?

360
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
No, very polite.

361
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,440
He doesn't seem to be Chinese.

362
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,160
I'd like to invite

363
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,690
that waitress from earlier

364
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,650
to dance with me.

365
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,840
Waitress.

366
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,040
Is it not okay?

367
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,580
Give me the bag.

368
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,240
Can you do it?

369
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,520
Is it possible?

370
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,880
Yes.

371
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,520
Thank you.

372
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,160
Sure, sure.

373
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,840
Drink up.

374
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,280
Can you help me with something?

375
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,640
What kind of help?

376
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,760
Just tell me.

377
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,160
Could you accompany the guests in the private room

378
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,290
and dance with them?

379
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,840
Manager Tang,

380
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm a respectable woman.

381
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,600
I can't do this kind of thing.

382
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,600
Don't be like that.

383
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,640
I have a husband and a son.

384
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,000
Please help me out.

385
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,120
I can't help.

386
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,520
I'm really sorry.

387
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,760
As a waiter here,

388
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,400
I can't dance with you.

389
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,400
But...

390
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,280
There are many young ladies downstairs

391
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,040
who can put on a waiter's uniform

392
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,440
and pretend to be waiters

393
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,640
to dance with you.

394
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,760
I

395
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,890
only want that waitress from just now.

396
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,760
Well...

397
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,640
Are you

398
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,040
agreeing that she can come dance?

399
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,720
Yes, yes, I agree.

400
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,160
Good.

401
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,520
Come, cheers!

402
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,490
Hello, Mr. Tang.

403
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,160
Your boss

404
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
has already agreed to let you dance.

405
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,920
Really?

406
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,200
Is that okay?

407
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,080
Your boss said

408
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,010
you won't dance with us.

409
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,040
But I find it strange.

410
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,560
I think

411
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,640
everything has a price.

412
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,720
That's how it is in Vladivostok.

413
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,440
It's not like that here.

414
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,360
Where I come from,

415
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,800
a girl like you

416
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,880
doesn't need to work.

417
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,320
No work?

418
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,680
Then what would I live on?

419
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,170
Someone would support you.

420
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Who?

421
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,180
(Korean) Me, brother.

422
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,690
I would support you.

423
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,680
These rich men

424
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,360
just love waitresses.

425
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,370
A waitress killer, huh?

426
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,480
He actually wanted

427
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,120
to dance with Zhang Xiaomei.

428
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,450
Didn't you understand?

429
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,960
He's from Vladivostok.

430
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,020
I can't understand what he's saying.

431
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
It seems

432
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,520
I need to hurry up and learn a foreign language.

433
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,360
Let's go eat ramen.

434
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,920
Why?

435
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,120
Let's go.

436
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,880
Just this once,

437
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,720
let's eat ramen, okay?

438
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,220
I'll call you when new stock arrives.

439
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,480
Uncle,

440
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,180
Guo Xiaoxue didn't come to school today.

441
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,400
Did she ask for leave?

442
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,360
No.

443
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,720
Let's go.

444
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,640
Watch the store.

445
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
What?

446
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,640
Xiaoxue.

447
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,980
Go to the hospital.

448
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,010
Bring a blanket.

449
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,560
Okay.

450
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,400
Doctor, help!

451
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,360
Doctor, please help!

452
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,800
Don't be so dramatic. It's just a fever.

453
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,600
In there.

454
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,800
Mr. Cui.

455
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,360
You're awake.

456
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Am I still alive?

457
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Of course you are.

458
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,450
You're doing just fine.

459
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,940
Don't think nonsense.

460
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,640
Get some rest.

461
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,960
You should get some rest too.

462
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,580
Close your eyes and sleep.

463
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,530
Are you feeling better?

464
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,640
You've already opened your eyes and started talking.

465
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,480
You should close your eyes.

466
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,340
Close your eyes and get some rest.

467
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,450
Is Xiaoxue feeling better?

468
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,040
That child,

469
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,100
she'll definitely recover quickly.

470
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,880
What I want to talk to you about is,

471
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,080
after she's discharged,

472
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,700
what are we going to do?

473
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,640
She's all alone.

474
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,840
And she's just a girl.

475
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,400
How can she possibly

476
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,920
live by herself?

477
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,970
So what do you want to do?

478
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
I was thinking...

479
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,160
Just say it. Get to the point.

480
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,040
I just...

481
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,440
Forget it. We've been through a lot together.

482
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,320
Since when did you become so hesitant?

483
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,450
That's not like you.

484
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,360
I'm not being hesitant.

485
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,410
I was thinking that we could...

486
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,720
Fine, you don't need to say it.

487
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,360
I know what you're going to say without you saying it.

488
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,320
I agree.

489
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,600
What?

490
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,200
I said I agree.

491
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,040
Yes, I know,

492
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,680
but you don't even know what I was going to say,

493
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,880
and you've already agreed.

494
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,720
Aren't you just thinking about taking Xiaoxue

495
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,250
and having her live with us?

496
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,800
That's fine. No problem.

497
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,200
The child is too pitiful.

498
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,720
Our financial situation has improved a bit in the past six months.

499
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,160
It's just an extra pair of chopsticks at the table.

500
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,890
We'll have to work a bit harder,

501
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,440
but we might save this child's entire life.

502
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,920
It's just that we already have two children now,

503
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,580
and there's not enough space.

504
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,040
With one more,

505
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,410
where will everyone sleep?

506
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,340
We need to think this through.

507
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,880
Yes.

508
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,680
You know you're always

509
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
so unreliable.

510
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,240
Always stirring up trouble.

511
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,900
Do you know why I still want to be with you?

512
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,340
Because I'm good and kind, right?

513
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,970
I'm not a bad person either.

514
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,080
Exactly.

515
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,960
Can we have a meeting with your dad in the next few days

516
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,680
to see how we can arrange

517
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,340
Xiaoxue's living situation?

518
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,320
Go home and take a nap.

519
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,320
I'll hold down the fort here.

520
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,560
I want to sleep here.

521
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
You're annoying.

522
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,120
Helping to raise a child

523
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,080
is no problem.

524
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,200
It's fine now

525
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,100
while she's still a child.

526
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,480
But as she grows older,

527
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,840
she'll soon reach puberty.

528
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,720
Yes.

529
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,120
And she's not

530
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,780
blood-related to our family.

531
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,400
Whether she lives with you

532
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,920
or with me,

533
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,640
it's not very convenient, is it?

534
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,720
We'll deal with that when the time comes.

535
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,780
Maybe her father will be back by then.

536
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,530
Having meals at my place

537
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,840
is fine.

538
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,120
But

539
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,450
having her live with me,

540
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,560
an old man like me

541
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,480
living with an unfamiliar young girl,

542
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,800
under the same roof,

543
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
doesn't seem appropriate, does it?

544
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,420
Dad, you're right.

545
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,560
I want to bring Xiaoxue

546
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,640
to live with us.

547
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,880
We can convert Mengmeng's bed

548
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,200
into a bunk bed for her.

549
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,400
Then your home

550
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,800
will soon become a children's playground.

551
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,480
Aren't they building

552
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,840
commercial housing now?

553
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,680
I've looked at some apartments

554
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,160
and there are larger ones available.

555
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,920
We've saved some money now.

556
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,280
In another year or two

557
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,960
we'll definitely be able to buy a big house.

558
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,160
May I ask

559
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,360
how much money

560
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,690
you've saved so far?

561
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,080
Dad, this business

562
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,740
is actually doing quite well.

563
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
After we pay off

564
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,160
all those debts,

565
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,720
we'll still have about 100,000 left.

566
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,160
We were planning to buy a car.

567
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,660
Guoming had already promised Mengmeng.

568
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:09,880
But

569
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,720
after discussing it,

570
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,780
we decided to hold off for now.

571
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,040
Our current house could sell for 70,000 or 80,000.

572
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,570
Combined with our savings,

573
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,640
in another year or two

574
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,240
we'll definitely be able to get a bigger house.

575
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,400
When Xiaoxue is discharged,

576
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,360
let her come

577
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,400
with Mengmeng and Erpang

578
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,360
to my house for meals every day.

579
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,120
Okay.

580
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,880
Guoming.

581
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,480
Actually,

582
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,640
you are now

583
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,200
a father of three children.

584
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,920
You need to be more responsible.

585
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,440
Why are you staring at me?

586
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,500
Aren't you also a mother of three?

587
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,640
This is our shared responsibility.

588
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,370
I'm leaving.

589
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,400
What's wrong with looking at you?

590
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,600
What's your problem?

591
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,360
Who told you to hang this here?

592
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,160
It doesn't match at all.

593
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,090
If not here, where should I hang it?

594
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,360
Like this.

595
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,740
You hung up and called back again.

596
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,400
Cui Guoming.

597
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,880
Cui Guoming.

598
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,200
Yang Fei.

599
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,120
Yes.

600
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,220
Wang Xiaojuan.

601
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,440
What a coincidence.

602
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,280
We haven't seen each other since high school graduation.

603
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,040
Didn't you get into the Engineering University?

604
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,970
Top of the class.

605
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,760
No, no. I was second in the class.

606
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,690
Well, second is still impressive.

607
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,560
How did you end up selling clothes here?

608
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,320
Well, you see,

609
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,600
it's my wife's shop.

610
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm just helping her out.

611
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,040
I was thinking,

612
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,840
how could a top student like you

613
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,900
end up selling clothes on the street.

614
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,920
Isn't selling clothes pretty good?

615
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,720
Getting to experience fashion.

616
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,480
So what do you do now?

617
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,720
I'm still in mechanical engineering.

618
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,520
Isn't that what I've been doing since graduation?

619
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,680
You're still doing well.

620
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,960
We saw you on TV

621
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,040
last year.

622
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,120
You still sing so well.

623
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,200
Really good.

624
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,290
You're good at whatever you do.

625
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,480
Unlike us two.

626
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,360
We didn't get into college

627
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,400
and can't do anything special.

628
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,320
We're now partners,

629
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,360
running a fur coat shop

630
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,400
on Jiudao Street.

631
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,120
Why don't you bring your wife

632
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,960
to our shop sometime?

633
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,200
Sure.

634
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,120
So your fur coats...

635
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,680
Look at you, you can only wear fur coats.

636
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,440
I have everything else here.

637
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,040
Feel free to look around.

638
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,600
And afterward,

639
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,640
take whatever you like.

640
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,640
It'll be my treat.

641
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,840
No need.

642
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,060
We can still afford these.

643
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,880
Take a look.

644
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
If you like it, take it.

645
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,840
Be happy!

646
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,850
The style is quite innovative.

647
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,680
It seems

648
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,080
pretty good.

649
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,960
Not bad.

650
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,680
Sergei.

651
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,800
Who?

652
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,120
Why are you selling second-hand goods?

653
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,680
Well,

654
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,440
we're doing business.

655
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,120
Making money is all that matters, right?

656
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,880
That's true.

657
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,200
So then.

658
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,290
It's been disinfected.

659
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,200
Actually,

660
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,080
it looks pretty nice anyway.

661
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,720
How about this,

662
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,840
when you have time, let's

663
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,680
get together sometime.

664
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,640
Sure.

665
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,400
Alright, bye then.

666
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,010
Come by anytime.

667
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
Okay, bye.

668
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,960
Good.

669
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Come here and stand still.

670
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,640
Didn't I tell you

671
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
to remove all these laundry tags?

672
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,690
Why didn't you remove them?

673
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,120
I was only responsible for half of them.

674
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,920
The other half was Er Pang's job.

675
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,490
Mom said we're not buying a Xiali car anymore.

676
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,240
We can't afford it right now.

677
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,640
Our first priority is to get a villa.

678
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
We need to move into a bigger house.

679
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,960
After that, I can buy you a Santana.

680
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,360
Okay.

681
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,840
It's fine that we don't have a Xiali now.

682
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,960
Or a Santana.

683
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,160
None of that matters.

684
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,920
But

685
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,880
I just need you to pay for

686
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,280
the cost of one Santana tire.

687
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,720
That would make me happy.

688
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,580
What do you want to buy?

689
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,320
I want a bicycle with gears.

690
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,920
Everyone in my class has one.

691
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,560
What's a bicycle with gears?

692
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,680
This is it.

693
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,160
A multi-speed bicycle.

694
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,880
So it's controlled by gears

695
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,040
that regulate

696
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,400
the speed changes, right?

697
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,440
What's the highest

698
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,980
gear available on the market now?

699
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,560
Eight.

700
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,400
This thing is a real money-maker.

701
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,640
Dad,

702
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,580
what are you planning now?

703
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,960
What do you mean?

704
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,600
You're not thinking of selling

705
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,730
multi-speed bicycles again, are you?

706
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,980
What am I supposed to do with this?

707
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,960
It's from the Justice Department.

708
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,320
They're temporarily suspending your lawyer's license.

709
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,360
Once the issue with the pinhole glasses

710
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,360
is cleared up.

711
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,890
We'll see about that later.

712
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,080
Aren't you even going to look at it?

713
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,940
I already knew this would happen.

714
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,960
My license is suspended.

715
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,560
What's the point of looking?

716
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,880
Our boutique store

717
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,210
is doing quite well now.

718
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,880
You don't have to be a lawyer.

719
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,960
What, does being a lawyer pay better than this?

720
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,960
You're right.

721
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,480
But I feel like selling clothes

722
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,920
gives me a sense of wasting my talents.

723
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,560
You've enjoyed a few peaceful days

724
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,760
and now you want to stir things up again?

725
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,200
I've been thinking

726
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,160
if I could do something

727
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,560
with better prospects.

728
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,840
What do you want to do?

729
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,680
Don't worry.

730
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,400
I just want

731
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,130
to go back to my old profession,

732
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,220
mechanics.

733
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,640
This I can support.

734
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,640
Is there a factory

735
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,840
offering you a high salary?

736
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,920
Nobody's hiring me.

737
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,650
I want to start my own business.

738
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,560
What do you want to do?

739
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,320
Sell multi-speed bicycles.

740
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:26,920
What?

741
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,320
Just hear me out.

742
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,400
It doesn't cost much.

743
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,960
The cost is almost zero.

744
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,280
The market is full of

745
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,720
six-speed and eight-speed bikes.

746
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,880
I want to develop

747
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,080
twelve-speed and sixteen-speed ones.

748
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,920
With my skills,

749
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,920
I don't think it would be difficult.

750
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,040
Then I'll apply for a patent.

751
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,880
This patent,

752
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,120
once approved,

753
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,450
will support our family for generations.

754
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
It's quick money.

755
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,880
Didn't we want to buy a house?

756
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,810
If I work on this,

757
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,800
in just a few months we

758
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,000
could buy that house.

759
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,880
Does it really not cost anything?

760
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,680
Really doesn't.

761
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,960
Just give me 10,000.

762
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,440
I need to do some research,

763
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
buy some parts,

764
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,480
and start tinkering first.

765
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,880
If I don't make any money,

766
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,900
I won't ask you for another penny.

767
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,930
Alright.

768
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,480
I won't be at the shop much anymore.

769
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,940
I need to focus on research and development.

770
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,810
That's fine.

771
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,600
But for the monthly supply trips to Guangdong,

772
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,480
you must go.

773
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,200
We need to restock the day after tomorrow.

774
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
Okay, no problem.

775
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,440
Look at you.

776
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
When you were employed,

777
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,120
you were always late and left early.

778
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,780
Now that you've been laid off,

779
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,560
suddenly you remember

780
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,760
how good your job was.

781
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,640
Come here.

782
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
I've been working at the factory since college graduation,

783
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,280
for 15 years.

784
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,280
Because of me, our factory

785
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,690
has never shut down,

786
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,480
not even once,

787
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,800
not for a minute, right?

788
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,960
That's true.

789
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,940
Hailong told me the other day.

790
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,080
In just these three months,

791
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,920
our factory has stopped production

792
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,800
four times due to mechanical failures.

793
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,530
It's still shut down right now.

794
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,720
The reason I seem so careless

795
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,360
is because of these monstrous machines.

796
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,400
For me,

797
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,610
it's just like Mengmeng's doll

798
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,240
or Erpang's slingshot.

799
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,960
I just love tinkering with it.

800
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,040
I knew you could do it.

801
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,320
Let's eat.

802
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
What about

803
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,000
the bunk beds? Are they ready?

804
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,400
Xiaoxue

805
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,960
will be discharged from the hospital soon.

806
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,360
Is that my job?

807
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,960
I'm just talking to myself.

808
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,800
I'll do it.

809
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,760
What are we eating?

810
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,960
Sauerkraut noodles.

811
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,770
Go get some chopsticks.

812
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,800
This one

813
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,980
let me borrow it later.

814
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,960
Sure.

815
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,360
You bought it for me anyway.

816
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,960
Do whatever you want with it.

817
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,250
You're quite generous.

818
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,340
I want to take it apart.

819
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,000
Uncle, you must want to study it.

820
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,760
Yes, study it,

821
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,960
imitate it,

822
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,520
surpass it.

823
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,570
Uncle, you'll definitely surpass it.

824
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,900
Do you know about luxury cars?

825
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,340
I've heard of them.

826
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,720
Do you know why

827
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,380
luxury cars are so expensive?

828
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,880
It's because every part

829
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,400
is handcrafted.

830
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,520
In the future,

831
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,440
you will have your very own

832
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,560
handcrafted multi-speed bicycle.

833
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,400
An incomparable

834
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,960
chariot.

835
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,400
Priceless.

836
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,770
No need for such formality.

837
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,940
What are you doing?

838
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,160
(Russian) I have other work to do.

839
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,130
(Russian) I must return to St. Petersburg today.

840
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,720
(Russian) Besides, I cannot complete this job.

841
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,690
(Russian) Although I'm a mechanical expert,

842
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,460
(Russian) I don't know much about this machine.

843
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,760
(Russian) I remember coming here for maintenance a few years ago

844
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,840
(Russian) and meeting a young man named Cui.

845
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,050
(Russian) His skill level is very high

846
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,480
(Russian) and he knows enough about the machine.

847
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,739
(Russian) Where is he?

848
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,570
Director, I'll translate for you in a moment.

849
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,940
(Russian) Who?

850
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,600
(Russian) Cui. Yes, that's right, Cui.

851
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,639
(Russian) He can definitely do it.

852
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,080
(Russian) I've already done my part.

853
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,800
[Speaking Russian] Goodbye.

854
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,460
[Speaking Russian] Goodbye.

855
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,440
If I'm not mistaken,

856
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,179
he was talking about Cui Guoming.

857
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,159
I think so.

858
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,920
Now that the butcher is gone,

859
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,050
we're stuck with the hairy pig.

860
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,680
It's not that bad.

861
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,600
Not that bad?

862
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,360
Really?

863
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,410
We've been shut down for 7 days.

864
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,680
So what do you suggest?

865
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,880
Find him.

866
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,080
Pay him if necessary.

867
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:06,880
Director,

868
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,000
given our relationship,

869
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,260
how can I approach him?

870
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,860
You want me to find him?

871
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,040
I have an idea.

872
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
But you...

873
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,300
need to cooperate with me.

874
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,320
Hailong, Liu Ye,

875
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,920
the director wants to see you both.

876
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,680
Hurry up.

877
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,320
We've been shut down for 7 days.

878
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,000
It's urgent.

879
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,960
Hurry!

880
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,920
We're trying to solve the problem,

881
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,520
aren't we?

882
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,960
Because of

883
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,440
mechanical failure, we can't deliver on time.

884
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,640
To the outside world,

885
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,840
I am the primary person responsible.

886
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,120
But internally,

887
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,440
you two

888
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,760
are definitely the first

889
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,120
and second responsible parties.

890
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,840
Right?

891
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,280
Currently our factory's

892
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,840
performance is extremely poor.

893
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
If this shipment

894
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,240
isn't delivered on time,

895
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,320
we're definitely finished.

896
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,200
Our second round of layoffs

897
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,240
affects 1,500 people.

898
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,120
If that happens,

899
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,840
then our second round of layoffs

900
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,040
will be 1,502 people.

901
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,730
Are you two laid off too?

902
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,840
Before 3 PM today,

903
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,720
you must fix it.

904
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,620
No matter what methods you use

905
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,680
or who you find to help,

906
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,380
Do you understand?

907
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
Director.

908
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,240
We've both been working very hard.

909
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,440
Really.

910
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,840
We can't fix it in such a short time.

911
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,880
That machine is too old.

912
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,000
What did I just say?

913
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,680
Did you two hear me?

914
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,640
This is a military order.

915
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,980
Let me say it again.

916
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,800
No matter what methods you use,

917
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,840
no matter who

918
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,960
you find to help.

919
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,940
Do you understand?

920
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,840
Director,

921
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,280
I think I understand now.

922
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,760
We'll do our best.

923
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,900
Not just your best.

924
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,160
It's mandatory.

925
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,050
Quick, get some tissue for him.

926
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,440
He's bleeding.

927
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,880
Go to the infirmary quickly.

928
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,340
Get it checked out. Hurry.

929
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,680
We'll go after lunch.

930
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,170
Who are you looking for?

931
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,580
You know, that person.

932
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,040
Take this over there too.

933
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,960
Sister-in-law,

934
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,360
Sister-in-law,

935
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,090
you're here.

936
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,160
What perfect timing!

937
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,840
I've just prepared

938
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,160
two pieces of clothing for you both.

939
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,120
Take them with you later.

940
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,520
Sure. That's kind of you.

941
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,600
What's up, brother?

942
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,930
What happened to your face?

943
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,060
My wife didn't come home until 6 AM

944
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,440
so I asked her what she was doing last night.

945
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,500
She got upset and started hitting me.

946
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,320
Why did it turn violent?

947
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,800
How badly did you hurt her?

948
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,300
I would never lay a hand on her.

949
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
She scratched me.

950
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,320
Maybe I should go talk to her.

951
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,120
She could just explain herself.

952
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,400
Why get physical?

953
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,720
Brother.

954
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,490
We came to see you today.

955
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,800
Not about this issue.

956
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,760
Coming home at 6 in the morning

957
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,890
and getting violent - that's serious.

958
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,440
Brother, my problem

959
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,520
can wait a few days.

960
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,120
We're here today for something more important.

961
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,320
What's so important?

962
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,000
The factory machine broke down.

963
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,720
We've been shut down for 7 days.

964
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,920
If we can't fix it,

965
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,330
we won't be able to deliver our orders.

966
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,920
Why are you telling me this?

967
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,360
We want to ask for your help.

968
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,880
Please come back and fix the machine.

969
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,840
We really can't fix it ourselves.

970
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,760
I can't help.

971
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,320
I'm going to pick up goods with your sister-in-law tonight.

972
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,040
I still need to.

973
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,920
Brother, please go.

974
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,720
I won't go. I'll go.

975
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,440
What would I do there?

976
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,400
I've been laid off already.

977
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,480
You've been laid off.

978
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,440
But the two of us haven't yet.

979
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,240
I won't go.

980
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,760
Mr. Cui.

981
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,880
The factory manager made an announcement today.

982
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,600
He said if we don't fix the machine today,

983
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,000
we'll both be kicked out,

984
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,580
laid off immediately.

985
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,640
So what about me?

986
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,320
If I lose my job,

987
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,850
what will happen to my wife?

988
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
Please help me one more time.

989
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,850
I'm begging you.

990
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,160
Let's go.

991
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,720
Take your clothes. Here.

992
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,720
Don't rush.

993
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,250
Thank you, sister-in-law.

994
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,720
Thanks.

995
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,360
Director,

996
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,320
you're so wise!

997
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,520
Let's go, Director.

998
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,400
Guess if I fixed the machine?

999
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,800
Go home and change your clothes quickly.

1000
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,080
Aren't you going to the train station later?

1001
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,880
I'm leaving.

1002
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,720
Xiaoxue will be discharged tonight.

1003
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,480
Don't forget to pick her up.

1004
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,680
I got it. Let's go.

1005
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,520
Hello?

1006
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,240
It's me, Hailong.

1007
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,440
I'm in Guangdong.

1008
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,400
What's wrong? Is the machine broken again?

1009
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,800
The machine isn't broken.

1010
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,120
Xiaomei has left.

1011
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,740
Where could she have gone?

1012
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,800
Yesterday when I got home,

1013
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,600
I found a letter she left me.

1014
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,780
She said she never wants to see this loser again.

1015
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,040
She's gone.

1016
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,120
She'll never let me see her again.

1017
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,200
You two have Xiaozhi now.

1018
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,440
Where could she possibly go?

1019
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,800
She's really gone.

1020
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,840
I love her,

1021
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,360
even though she doesn't love me.

1022
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,760
Isn't it better that she's gone?

1023
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,320
You can find someone else.

1024
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,450
She doesn't want me.

1025
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,160
She doesn't want Xiaozhi either.

1026
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,560
Enough.

1027
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,840
Can't you act like a man?

1028
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,760
Don't be like this.

1029
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,520
Hey.

1030
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,680
I'm watching the game.
