1
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
Li

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,720
Li Yang

3
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,040
Liu

4
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,240
Your hair

5
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,000
Is this stylish?

6
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,880
This color

7
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,360
Would you dare to dye it?

8
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,289
I wouldn't dare.

9
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,000
I heard from my dad

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,600
your business is booming.

11
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,479
Why didn't you take over my old shop?

12
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,240
You let him sell chestnuts here.

13
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
I can barely

14
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,120
manage this one shop properly.

15
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,600
That young Liu from the shop across the street

16
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,729
He's back in prison.

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,640
Back inside.

18
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,759
15 years.

19
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,280
I talked to old lady Zhang.

20
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,120
I said I wanted to take over this shop.

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,120
She said that would be fine,

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,360
but when her son returns,

23
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,720
I'd have to give the shop back.

24
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,400
So I thought,

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,640
why go through all that trouble?

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,840
After I renovate it, I'd just have to return it.

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,560
You were right not to take that shop.

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,039
It definitely has bad feng shui.

29
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,400
When I was selling clothes there,

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,560
I also went to prison.

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,320
Really?

32
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,400
Where's Old Liu?

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,400
Old Liu

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,200
passed away.

35
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,320
He left this for you.

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,440
Old Liu

37
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,600
had no children.

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
He said

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,260
he wanted to return this mountain to you two.

40
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,800
Did Old Liu

41
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,840
live here the whole time?

42
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,079
Yes,

43
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,040
until he died.

44
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,160
I wonder

45
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,920
if he really liked it here

46
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,320
or was afraid that after buying this mountain,

47
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,250
it would be a waste not to live here.

48
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,090
Old Liu didn't like crowds.

49
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,890
Maybe he also couldn't stand the heat.

50
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
It's cooler here.

51
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,560
There really is a rabbit.

52
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,880
What's the matter? Don't they have rabbits abroad?

53
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,600
You've eaten over a hundred of them.

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,260
What's so special about this?

55
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,410
I've never seen a rabbit with the surname Cui.

56
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,360
This belongs to you and your brother-in-law.

57
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,120
Maybe the one you just saw

58
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,170
has the surname Huo.

59
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,690
When will he get out?

60
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,060
I'm embarrassed to ask my dad.

61
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,520
According to Er Pang,

62
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,240
in a year or two at most.

63
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,360
They're strict now.

64
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,000
We're not immediate family,

65
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,680
so we can't visit him.

66
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,050
When he gets out,

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,640
he'll be over fifty.

68
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,960
He probably won't cause any more trouble.

69
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,240
You never know.

70
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,040
This place

71
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,100
is suitable for growing ginseng.

72
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,480
I've grown it abroad.

73
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,280
I plan to grow some here

74
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,280
and export it overseas.

75
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,800
Wait,

76
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,520
what exactly

77
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,040
did you do abroad?

78
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,320
Didn't you say you ran

79
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,180
a soup restaurant for many years?

80
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,280
When I first went there, I did all sorts of jobs.

81
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,080
You told me that you mainly

82
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,480
work in arts and culture.

83
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,280
Either making films with Hasov

84
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,800
or dancing for Takla.

85
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,160
I want to buy a house.

86
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,040
Why are you buying another house?

87
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Which property?

88
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,480
You'll see when we get there.

89
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,680
Hello.

90
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,010
Who are you looking for?

91
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,320
Do you remember me?

92
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,560
I can't recall.

93
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,440
Ten years ago you bought

94
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,280
this house from me.

95
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,080
Now I remember.

96
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,159
Yes, it's you.

97
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,200
Come in, come in.

98
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,800
Thank you.

99
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,560
Come in, come in.

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:51,960
Should I take off my shoes?

101
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,159
No need, no need.

102
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,090
Come in, come in.

103
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,920
So you're here now.

104
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,320
I've been waiting for you.

105
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,880
When I got here,

106
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,280
we bought a Xiali car.

107
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,080
For our family's Xiali car,

108
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,680
I need to grow taller quickly.

109
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,440
When you reach this height,

110
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,440
I'll buy you a Santana.

111
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,040
Mom,

112
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,160
do we not have a home anymore?

113
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,040
Dad

114
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,800
will give you back our home.

115
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,200
Are you

116
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,850
coming to see me?

117
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,920
I'd like to discuss something with you.

118
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,080
I want to buy this house back.

119
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,280
Buy it back.

120
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,040
Yes.

121
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,440
Then where will I live?

122
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,920
I'm sorry for the trouble.

123
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,440
I can offer a high price.

124
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,320
How much is a new apartment?

125
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,520
I'll pay you that amount.

126
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,560
I can buy the furniture too.

127
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,960
The average price here is 2,200.

128
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,560
A new apartment would cost 3,100.

129
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,080
No problem.

130
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,420
The thing is...

131
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,040
This apartment for me

132
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,840
is not just an apartment.

133
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,320
Then what is it?

134
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,280
Home.

135
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,640
Haven't you been making

136
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,880
shredded potatoes for him lately?

137
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,840
We've been giving him

138
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,920
that vegetable salad Manager Cui makes every day.

139
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,320
He loves shredded potatoes.

140
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Alright, I got it.

141
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,360
If you have any problems, come by anytime.

142
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,960
Sure thing.

143
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,000
Watch your step.

144
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,440
Sister Zhou.

145
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
Cui!

146
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,000
When did you get back?

147
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,440
Just came back a couple days ago.

148
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,760
So it's become a beauty salon now?

149
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,160
Yes, I'm working here now.

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,920
What about that

151
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,720
Wild Rose Dinner Club?

152
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,160
It closed long ago.

153
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,240
It shut down shortly after you left.

154
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,800
What about that Tang guy?

155
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,640
He got addicted to gambling.

156
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,280
Not only did he lose the business,

157
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,920
he also scammed a lot of people out of their money.

158
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,000
He was locked up for 7 or 8 years.

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,120
He just got out recently.

160
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,720
He came out with nothing left.

161
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,179
His wife and kids belong to someone else now.

162
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,760
Good.

163
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,600
That's what he deserves.

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,520
So it later became a beauty salon?

165
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,640
No.

166
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,840
And then they opened

167
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,480
a sporting goods store.

168
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,360
So I stayed

169
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,240
and worked at the sporting goods store.

170
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,880
After the renovation,

171
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,360
it became a beauty salon, right?

172
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,690
So I stayed and worked at the beauty salon.

173
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,130
That's just my fate.

174
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,480
From the first day

175
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,400
I started working at Dingqing Restaurant,

176
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,480
I felt I would work here my whole life.

177
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,560
And indeed, I've never left this place my entire life.

178
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,880
I'm already in my fifties.

179
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,010
Just two more years until retirement.

180
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,360
This is really

181
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,000
quite nice.

182
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,360
Seeing you here,

183
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,170
it feels like Dingqing Restaurant is still open.

184
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,160
Let me take this call.

185
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,400
Uncle! Uncle!

186
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,680
What are you shouting for?

187
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,760
I just got back from Shanghai,

188
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,400
just got off the plane.

189
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,800
I want to treat you to dinner.

190
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,920
Alright, let's eat at home.

191
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,680
No way. We must eat out.

192
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,640
My uncle's return deserves some style.

193
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,320
I've already booked Dacheng Seafood Restaurant.

194
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,160
I'll be there right away.

195
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,960
See you soon.

196
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,800
Who was that?

197
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,200
My silly nephew.

198
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Erpang?

199
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,120
It's been so long since I've seen him.

200
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,450
Is he still that chubby?

201
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,080
From the photos I've seen, he's quite thin now.

202
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,120
Then you should come back

203
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,840
and help him build up his nutrition.

204
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,640
Okay.

205
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,080
Alright then.

206
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,560
Sister Zhou, I'll come see you another day.

207
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,720
Sure.

208
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,840
I'll head back now.

209
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,640
Okay.

210
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
This way, please.

211
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,840
Which private room are you looking for, sir?

212
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
I'm not sure.

213
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,160
My nephew made the reservation for me.

214
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,320
What is your nephew's name?

215
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,200
Huo Xiaoyang.

216
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,760
Mr. Huo! Room 203.

217
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,040
This way, please.

218
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,960
Mr. Huo.

219
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,080
Mr. Huo is our triple VIP customer.

220
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,240
Uncle.

221
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,280
Uncle,

222
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,600
I've missed you so much.

223
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,240
Uncle.

224
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,280
This guy

225
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,620
hit me so hard it hurts.

226
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,930
How tall are you now?

227
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,560
About the same as you,

228
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,280
5'8".

229
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,280
I'm 5'7",

230
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,080
you're taller than me.

231
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,400
Uncle,

232
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,480
your hairstyle...

233
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,200
Remember this,

234
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,360
I'm getting the same dye job tomorrow.

235
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,680
It looks so cool, Uncle.

236
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,880
Come on, have a drink.

237
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
When we talk on the phone,

238
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,480
I always, um,

239
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,400
only catch bits and pieces of what you say.

240
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,160
Now that we're face to face,

241
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,600
let me ask how Mr. Huo

242
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,920
made his fortune.

243
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,130
Since the year you went abroad,

244
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,690
the internet industry in China has taken off.

245
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,080
And this internet

246
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,440
is absolutely China's

247
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,960
opportunity to overtake on the curve.

248
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,160
Overtake on the curve?

249
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,020
That phrase...

250
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,800
You didn't come up with that yourself.

251
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,880
Who did you learn it from?

252
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,280
I learned it in Shanghai.

253
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,880
So specifically,

254
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,850
how did you make your money?

255
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,840
I work with ringtones.

256
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,680
Every user who downloads

257
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,720
a ringtone from me

258
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,440
pays 2 yuan.

259
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,200
If all users

260
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,600
were to use these ringtones,

261
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,200
wouldn't you be making money while lying down?

262
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,320
Actually,

263
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,360
making money without effort isn't interesting.

264
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,600
So this time I went to Shanghai

265
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,840
and sold the company.

266
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,720
Why sell it if it's profitable?

267
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,880
I'm taking the money from selling the company

268
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,280
to start an even more profitable business.

269
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,780
What kind of business?

270
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,220
I haven't decided yet.

271
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,720
Although Mr. Huo hasn't decided yet,

272
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,680
he has plenty of inspiration

273
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,880
and many great ideas.

274
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,400
He'll definitely come up with something soon.

275
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,840
I learned from my uncle.

276
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,720
Uncle,

277
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,560
do you remember when I was little,

278
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,680
when you were younger,

279
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,640
you always wanted to buy our family a car?

280
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,720
A Xiali? The sedan model?

281
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,080
Yes.

282
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,720
Was that your motivation to start a business?

283
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,240
Yes.

284
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,120
I also have a motivation now.

285
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,920
Quickly bring out

286
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,650
my motivation to show my uncle.

287
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,760
Look.

288
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,200
Making

289
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,000
this airplane model expensive?

290
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,020
This isn't a model.

291
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,770
It's a Gulfstream private jet.

292
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,400
You're buying a real one?

293
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
How much does it cost?

294
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,960
About 300-400 million.

295
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,600
So how much do you have now?

296
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,320
Right now,

297
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,530
my company sold for over 1 million.

298
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,960
Great!

299
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
I support you.

300
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
Come on, give it to me.

301
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,560
As for yachts,

302
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,160
I wasn't planning to buy one.

303
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,280
I think we should take it one step at a time.

304
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,360
Let's get the plane first, then think about that.

305
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,760
So you do know how to take things gradually.

306
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,080
Dad.

307
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,280
Let's have fish tonight. I'll cook.

308
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,580
Buy a couple extra.

309
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,240
Erpang will be eating at home today too.

310
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,580
Then we need to give him a proper welcome.

311
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,920
Okay.

312
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,120
I'll carefully pick out some good fish.

313
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,090
See you tonight.

314
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,280
Cui

315
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,840
Cui Guoming

316
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,040
Long time no see.

317
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,800
When did you get back?

318
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,740
I've been back for a while.

319
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,280
It really is you.

320
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,040
Even though I'm all bundled up,

321
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,800
you still recognized me.

322
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,600
I'd recognize you even if you were burned to ashes.

323
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,800
What are you looking at?

324
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,200
I'm looking at the crabs.

325
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,400
I'm buying fish.

326
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,280
Why look at crabs when you're buying fish?

327
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Just trying to learn something.

328
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:47,800
You two, move aside.

329
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Don't buy from them.

330
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,540
Is this your stall?

331
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,000
This stall of mine

332
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,600
is the best in the whole market.

333
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,920
You only have this one fish stall now?

334
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,480
Didn't you used to control

335
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,410
the entire seafood market before?

336
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,680
Don't talk nonsense.

337
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,080
I read a book recently

338
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,080
that said

339
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,560
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

340
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,920
Now I'm running one stall legally,

341
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,160
which is much better than all that fighting

342
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,680
and trouble from before, don't you think?

343
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,200
Besides, those days are gone now.

344
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,920
If you're doing well like this,

345
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,200
when my brother gets out,

346
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,960
you can give him a hand.

347
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Absolutely.

348
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,920
You want to buy fish, right?

349
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,180
Let me get you two fish.

350
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,400
My fish are the best.

351
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
I won't be polite then.

352
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,480
But don't give me too much.

353
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,040
One is enough.

354
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,000
No need to be so formal with me.

355
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,160
It's just for Erpang and his grandfather.

356
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,440
This one is perfect.

357
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,240
Good? Let me add one more.

358
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,960
Enough, that's enough.

359
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,440
Absolutely.

360
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,300
That's enough.

361
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,000
Alright.

362
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,640
How about this?

363
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,840
Okay, these two fish are good?

364
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,600
I'm sorry.

365
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,300
Let me bag them for you.

366
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,480
You...

367
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,120
I'll get you two more later.

368
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,520
Enough already.

369
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,240
How about some crabs?

370
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,700
That's enough. This is it.

371
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,520
All set.

372
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,840
Uncle.

373
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,000
Your cooking skills haven't improved at all.

374
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,680
Have you tried it?

375
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,080
You say my skills haven't improved.

376
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,320
Take a bite first.

377
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
It looks the same as before.

378
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,760
Really hasn't improved.

379
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,360
Dad, try some.

380
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,210
Delicious. Really delicious.

381
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,360
How's your cooking skill

382
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,620
that you learned from your grandfather?

383
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,760
I...

384
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,760
The cooking skills I taught him

385
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,560
could train three master chefs.

386
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,280
But he...

387
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,240
Everyone has their own talents.

388
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,120
I just can't master this craft.

389
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,360
Do you remember

390
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,560
before my uncle went abroad,

391
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,890
who he said we were like?

392
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,160
I'm getting old.

393
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
I can't remember.

394
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,400
Like Wei Qing and Huo Qubing.

395
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,240
Both of them

396
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,560
achieved great feats for the Han Dynasty.

397
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,080
But the uncle and nephew's fighting styles

398
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,280
were completely different.

399
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,600
Different in both strategy and tactics.

400
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,520
I think my uncle and I,

401
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,160
the two of us,

402
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,520
are exactly like them.

403
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,319
Each doing our own thing, each successful.

404
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,200
Uncle,

405
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,680
what are you planning to do now that you're back?

406
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,920
I'm thinking

407
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,849
about that mountain your dad and I have

408
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
to grow some ginseng

409
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,260
and sell it abroad.

410
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:17,920
Sounds good.

411
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,960
I'll set up a website for you.

412
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,240
I can sell everything just by making phone calls.

413
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,359
If we make a website,

414
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,040
I won't be able to keep up with the supply.

415
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,760
You'll need to do it sooner or later anyway.

416
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,720
When you're ready to do it,

417
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,650
just let me know.

418
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,880
I'm starting a business recently.

419
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,440
Planning to create a website.

420
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,960
It's definitely going to be a big business.

421
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,520
Uncle, you must support me on this.

422
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,580
You have to join in.

423
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,360
What is it?

424
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,280
Well,

425
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,680
I'm planning to create a literature website.

426
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,200
This is a brand new field.

427
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,440
In our country now,

428
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,040
although there are

429
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,200
some literature websites already,

430
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,800
like Hongjiang and Yinxiu,

431
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,130
but none of them are big.

432
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,360
I'm planning to create

433
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,360
the biggest

434
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,960
literature website in our country.

435
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,440
We'll make money from clicks,

436
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,240
copyright and all that. It's definitely profitable.

437
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,120
Uncle.

438
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,360
I remember when I was little,

439
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,680
didn't you write novels?

440
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,920
You can write for me then.

441
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,960
Besides, with your ginseng,

442
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,400
you don't have to plant it yourself.

443
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,160
Then we'll just

444
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,320
have you as my contracted writer,

445
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,360
my top author.

446
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,240
You know how hard it was to get my novel published.

447
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,700
You're well aware of that.

448
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,960
Me, a top author? Come on.

449
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,420
Well...

450
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,200
You don't need to publish at all.

451
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,400
Once you become popular,

452
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,680
plenty of people will come looking for you.

453
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,880
Then you can write

454
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,760
about what's popular now,

455
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
like tomb raiding stories.

456
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,540
Can you write that, Uncle?

457
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,400
I've worked over 20 different jobs,

458
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,280
but I've never actually raided a tomb.

459
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,400
It doesn't matter if you haven't done it.

460
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,040
As long as you can write, right?

461
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,700
We're different from others.

462
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,720
We'll write about

463
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,120
not digging up some nobody's little grave.

464
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,090
We'll dig up those grand tombs.

465
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,360
Like Empress Wu Zetian's,

466
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,120
Emperor Qin Shi Huang's.

467
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,040
Whichever hasn't been excavated,

468
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,920
that's what we'll dig up.

469
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,720
They never did anything to me.

470
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,520
Why would I dig up someone's tomb?

471
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,480
They may not have done anything to you,

472
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,960
but money hasn't offended you either, right?

473
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,480
If necessary, I'll pay you a signing fee.

474
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,760
I'll buy you a new computer right away,

475
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,640
an IBM one.

476
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,940
What do you think, Dad?

477
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,520
If you can write, then write.

478
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,160
Right?

479
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,960
You're idle anyway.

480
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,410
Then I'll write.

481
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,040
But I'm not really idle.

482
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,440
I'm waiting for Mengmeng

483
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,660
to bring her boyfriend to meet me.

484
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
When are they coming?

485
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,160
In the next couple of days.

486
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,880
You must treat them well.

487
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,320
By the way.

488
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,000
Your hair

489
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,400
needs some work, doesn't it?

490
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
I think my uncle's hair looks great.

491
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,840
Energetic and handsome.

492
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:18,720
Really?

493
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,240
Then you should dye yours too.

494
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,680
I'll do it one of these days.

495
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,880
You two

496
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,880
are cut from the same cloth.

497
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,720
Coming!

498
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,640
Welcome!

499
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,360
Hello, uncle.

500
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,840
Dad.

501
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,040
Xiaolin, come in.

502
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,760
No need to change your shoes.

503
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,840
I have one more dish to prepare.

504
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,000
Please have a seat.

505
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,090
Handsome, isn't he?

506
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,360
Yes, very.

507
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,800
When I was little, after school,

508
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,730
I used to do my homework right here.

509
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,450
What would you like to drink, Xiaolin?

510
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,160
This is fine for me.

511
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,280
You don't drink alcohol?

512
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,200
No, I don't.

513
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,450
Good. It's better not to drink.

514
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,080
I'll drink with you. Cheers.

515
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,280
You're from Shanghai, right?

516
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,740
Yes, from Luwan District.

517
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,200
I also lived

518
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,340
in Luwan District for a while.

519
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,680
Back then I was working as...

520
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,840
Come, welcome.

521
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,560
Drinks.

522
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,520
No need to rush.

523
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Take your time.

524
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,760
I should give you a gift.

525
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,040
When you arrive here,

526
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,200
I'll buy you a Santana.

527
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
A Santana.

528
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,120
It's not a fancy car nowadays,

529
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,680
but

530
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,740
it's good enough for getting around.

531
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,440
Dad, keep the car for yourself.

532
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,640
We can commute to work.

533
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,840
Taking the subway is quite convenient.

534
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,080
When you were little,

535
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,480
because of this Santana,

536
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,040
you often mocked me.

537
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,600
I was

538
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,640
indeed unreliable.

539
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,720
This promise of mine,

540
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,040
though 10 years late,

541
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
but

542
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,640
has finally been fulfilled.

543
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,400
Do me a favor

544
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,800
and drive it back to Beijing.

545
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,120
Look,

546
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,130
do you remember this place?

547
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,400
They've

548
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,920
renovated it.

549
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,600
Your height marks are all gone.

550
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,880
Let me see how tall you are now.

551
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,880
Come.

552
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,600
I remember

553
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,560
when you were this tall,

554
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,600
I promised to buy you a Xiali.

555
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,400
And when you grew to this height,

556
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,000
I promised you.

557
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,240
That's enough, Dad.

558
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,740
I'll stop talking.

559
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:06,960
I'll stop.

560
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,480
I'll stop, I'll stop.

561
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,160
If you see a white dove

562
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,320
flying by,

563
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,320
it means I've come back to see you and Mengmeng.

564
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,280
What do you think

565
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,600
of Mengmeng's boyfriend?

566
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,280
This park is quite nice.

567
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,320
Of course it is.

568
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,080
This area...

569
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,410
Qigou Literature Network.

570
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,840
What are you doing?

571
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,920
You scared me!

572
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,120
So annoying.

573
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,000
Are all these people your employees?

574
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
So many of them.

575
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,640
That's the internet business.

576
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,300
It's all about burning money.

577
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,080
How many writers do you have here?

578
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,420
Aren't we about to have one right now?

579
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,560
I'm

580
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,240
Yes.

581
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,640
just one writer

582
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,760
with so many employees.

583
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,640
Uncle, you're my lead sheep.

584
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,960
I believe

585
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,280
with you as our leader,

586
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,760
more and more

587
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,220
excellent writers will come flocking to us.

588
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,480
Flocking.

589
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,320
Uncle.

590
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,080
Take this.

591
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,760
Let me tell you all,

592
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,400
my uncle is a genius.

593
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,920
With my uncle joining us,

594
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,680
we'll have more and more

595
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,000
talented writers joining our team.

596
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,520
Right?

597
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,440
Yes.

598
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,360
Uncle is so handsome.

599
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,200
I am your boss.

600
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,560
And my uncle

601
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,000
is your supreme boss.

602
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,760
Understand?

603
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Understood.

604
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,600
Come on, supreme boss.

605
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,560
Come.

606
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,840
Everyone come here.

607
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,900
Let's take a photo.

608
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,720
Get ready.

609
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,960
Cheese!

610
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,240
Watch your step.

611
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,160
Okay.

612
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,360
Well,

613
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,080
it's too cold for the ladies.

614
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,880
Everyone should go back inside.

615
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,840
You're not wearing enough.

616
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,280
Uncle, come visit us more often!

617
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,280
Sure.

618
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,240
Everyone go back now,

619
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,160
get back to work.

620
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,690
Bye-bye.

621
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,480
Is this a nightclub?

622
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,720
This isn't a startup.

623
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,840
Uncle.

624
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,880
This is called company prestige.

625
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,400
You've been abroad for too long,

626
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,060
I can't even explain it to you.

627
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,580
No matter where I've been,

628
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,920
the principles are the same.

629
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,380
When starting a business,

630
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,120
you can take small, quick steps.

631
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,120
But don't take those

632
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,250
nonsensical steps.

633
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,320
You don't have a single writer.

634
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,560
Not a single work.

635
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,920
And you're keeping all these girls around.

636
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,840
What exactly are you doing here?

637
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,440
Didn't I just tell you?

638
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,840
Internet business requires burning money.

639
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,920
Besides, which company

640
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,440
has ever succeeded by taking small steps?

641
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,640
Aren't they all driven

642
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,970
by capital investment?

643
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,960
Fine, take this.

644
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,960
What's this for?

645
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,040
With this money,

646
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,560
you can burn through another year.

647
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,920
Without this, you won't last three months.

648
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
Go ahead and play.

649
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,280
No.

650
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,200
So you're not writing anymore?

651
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,640
I am.

652
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,600
This silly nephew of mine,

653
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,440
why is he so unreliable?

654
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,080
What's wrong?

655
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,400
Doesn't that prove I'm your real nephew?

656
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,450
Ice is colder than the water it comes from.

657
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,960
The student surpasses the master.

658
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,600
What are you trying to say?

659
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,800
Nothing special.

660
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,960
How much do you have now?

661
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
Be more reliable.

662
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,520
But you can't just

663
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,760
get back on your feet

664
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,490
and then call others cripples.

665
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,760
Old Cui.

666
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,520
Secretary Zhang.

667
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,640
Now he's Director Zhang.

668
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,400
Haven't seen you for years.

669
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,530
That blonde hair looks quite stylish.

670
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,920
Getting a massage in a suit?

671
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,200
What kind of rich man's disease do you have

672
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,730
that needs treatment here?

673
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,960
That mouth of yours,

674
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,920
after all these years,

675
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,600
hasn't changed a bit.

676
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,280
I...

677
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,040
Had too much Maotai,

678
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,120
feeling unwell,

679
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,380
so I came for a massage.

680
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,120
Director Zhang is in real estate now.

681
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,440
His business has grown enormous.

682
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,720
Liu Ye told me you got yourself a mountain.

683
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,440
So what?

684
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,650
To grow ginseng.

685
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,080
That's great.

686
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,560
I support you.

687
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,530
When the time comes,

688
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
I'll buy some too,

689
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,800
to soak in my liquor.

690
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,880
Maybe

691
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,480
I won't need massages anymore.

692
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,080
Growing plants suits you well,

693
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,660
it really does.

694
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,720
Guess what

695
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,800
I'm doing?

696
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Raising animals.

697
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,400
You're worldly,

698
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,660
give me your analysis.

699
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,200
From a scientific perspective,

700
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,600
isn't growing plants

701
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,460
a bit lower than raising animals,

702
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,320
just a little bit?

703
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,010
What fancy animal are you raising?

704
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,040
Tibetan

705
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,840
mastiff.

706
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,240
Male breeding dogs.

707
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,920
Just one casual breeding session

708
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,560
and instantly

709
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,120
I make more than you earned

710
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,600
in all those years abroad.

711
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,120
So you're

712
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,400
so wealthy now.

713
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,930
And your dog is so precious.

714
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,840
You must take care of your health.

715
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,320
Don't let it happen that one day

716
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,850
both of you are in bad shape.

717
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,000
You

718
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,240
should watch your mouth first.

719
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,520
Didn't you get a mountain property?

720
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,050
Here's the deal.

721
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,040
Since we've been

722
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,570
colleagues for many years,

723
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,920
I'll let

724
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,520
my dog stay with you.

725
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,800
Your place has

726
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,400
beautiful scenery and fresh air.

727
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,520
I'll just

728
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,360
keep it at your place.

729
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,660
How about that?

730
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,240
Remember when I beat you up

731
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
at the factory?

732
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,080
I'll pay you.

733
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,040
3,000 per month for you,

734
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,840
10,000 for the dog's food.

735
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,200
Deal?

736
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,520
Sure.

737
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,840
Well then.

738
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,040
Since you've agreed,

739
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,960
you must keep your word.

740
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
Later,

741
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,440
I'll have the driver

742
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,920
bring the dog to you.

743
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,800
The dog's color

744
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,020
matches your hair.

745
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,840
Also,

746
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,970
take good care of it.

747
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,080
If you do well, there'll be a reward.

748
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,400
Mr. Zhang.

749
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,520
Take care.

750
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,660
Look at him, so smug with his little bit of power.

751
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,880
What can I do? Mengmeng wants to buy a house in Beijing.

752
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,610
We have to pay 4,000 yuan in mortgage every month.

753
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,800
Xiaoxue is here.

754
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,440
Mr. Liu.

755
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,960
I just flew back from Urumqi.

756
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,160
My back is killing me.

757
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,960
What's up?

758
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,720
The great lawyer Guo is handling another big case?

759
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,040
Not at all.

760
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,280
By the way, Mr. Liu.

761
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,960
I heard my godfather is back.

762
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,920
Who told you that?

763
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,360
Er Pang,

764
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,360
he said his uncle told him not to tell.

765
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,440
Er Pang's big mouth

766
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,970
really should be sewn shut.

767
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,960
Liu, have you seen him?

768
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,050
He must have come to see you.

769
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
I

770
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,800
did see him.

771
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,760
I saw him too.

772
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,640
Dad.

773
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,040
Dad.

774
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
Okay.

775
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,440
Actually,

776
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,000
I didn't want Er Pang to tell you.

777
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,280
I wanted to surprise you.

778
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,000
That guy talks too fast.

779
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,360
Dad, why haven't you come back for so long?

780
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,000
Alright.

781
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,000
You're a big girl now.

782
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,680
No more hugging.

783
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,440
I want to hug you.

784
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,600
What's wrong with hugging my dad?

785
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,730
I'll hug you anyway.

786
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,480
After all these years,

787
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,500
Director Zhang still lives here.

788
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,960
Mr. Zhang says he's used to living here.

789
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,600
I used to come here many times back then.

790
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,210
He refused to see me.

791
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,050
Said he'd get confused whenever he saw me.

792
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,200
That's because you didn't call ahead.

793
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,060
We made an appointment this time.

794
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,440
Let's go.

795
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,840
You are...

796
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,800
It's me, Director Zhang.

797
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,200
My father.

798
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,240
My godfather.

799
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,800
Cui Guoming.

800
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,480
This...

801
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,000
This rascal!

802
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,920
Quickly!

803
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,600
Come in, come in.

804
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,800
These here

805
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,360
are from all these years

806
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,320
when everyone was running around for this case.

807
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,200
These are train tickets.

808
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,400
These are hotel receipts.

809
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,440
And appeal letters.

810
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,080
Receipts from courts and prosecutors at all levels.

811
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,810
Everyone paid for these out of their own pockets.

812
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,680
You have no relation to my classmate,

813
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,380
yet you've put so much effort into this case.

814
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,220
Thank you for your hard work all these years.

815
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,160
I have no relation to that classmate of yours.

816
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,800
But I am closely connected to the law.

817
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,400
I've made my living from the law my entire life,

818
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,040
and I was once the dean.

819
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,080
The cases under my watch

820
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,480
cannot have any flaws.

821
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,320
Is there any chance for a retrial now?

822
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,360
It's difficult.

823
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,040
For the past decade or so,

824
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,580
everyone has been collecting evidence.

825
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,040
Although there have been no results,

826
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,320
with the current

827
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,179
advancement in investigation techniques,

828
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,679
if new evidence emerges...

829
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,679
Then we have a chance.

830
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,120
I heard that in another 2 or 3 months,

831
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,679
Guo Dalei will be released.

832
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,440
Yes.

833
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:38,360
I heard he behaved exceptionally well inside,

834
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,360
so he can be released early.

835
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,090
There are only four steps in total.

836
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,560
But don't underestimate these four steps.

837
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,480
If you mix up the order,

838
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,400
or miss just one step,

839
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,330
the ginseng might not survive.

840
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,440
We've invested a lot of money,

841
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,040
so everyone must be careful.

842
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,720
Alright?

843
00:34:59,720 --> 00:34:59,960
Okay.

844
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,280
Thank you.

845
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,360
Good, let's get to work.

846
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,960
Okay.

847
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,480
Are you feeling unwell?

848
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,840
What's wrong?

849
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,880
Tell me.

850
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,320
Boss Cui.

851
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,280
What's up, big shot?

852
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,480
Why are you like this?

853
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,960
What big shot?

854
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,360
Stop mocking me.

855
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,160
This is no joke.

856
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,120
I'm dead.

857
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,000
You've changed your identity again.

858
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,260
What identity?

859
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Please don't kill me.

860
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,600
I told you,

861
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,860
I'm not a secret agent.

862
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,600
What happened to you all these years?

863
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,000
What have you been doing?

864
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,040
Me?

865
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,560
I got into a fight before,

866
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,720
was sentenced,

867
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,320
spent 7 or 8 years inside,

868
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,080
just got released last week.

869
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,600
I'm thinking of doing some odd jobs,

870
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,260
to earn money for my business.

871
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,360
Starting a business is good.

872
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,600
What do you want to do?

873
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,320
I want to set up a decent pancake stand.

874
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,530
A prodigal son returns.

875
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,780
How much money do you need?

876
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,040
Not much.

877
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,080
Can I work first?

878
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,040
Tell me.

879
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,080
2,000 yuan.

880
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,080
For a pancake stand?

881
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,880
2,000?

882
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,730
How much do you have now?

883
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,200
I'm keeping this for bus fare.

884
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,160
Here's 2,100.

885
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,680
Take it.

886
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,770
The last time we met,

887
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,490
I was singing for money.

888
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,000
You gave me 400 then.

889
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,360
I was in a difficult situation.

890
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,160
You helped me.

891
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,680
Now I want to return the favor.

892
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,360
Alright.

893
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,020
Go work now.

894
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,280
Yes, that did happen.

895
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,600
I gave you 400 that day,

896
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,740
and now you give me so much.

897
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,000
So here's what I'll do.

898
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,640
Let me sing for you, okay?

899
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,480
I'll sing five times for you.

900
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,000
I must sing.

901
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,480
It's the code of the streets.

902
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,210
Fair is fair.

903
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,000
Go to work now.

904
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I must sing one for you.

905
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,480
Don't mess around.

906
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,040
If I could laugh, I wouldn't cry.

907
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,440
If I could find a soulmate, how could I be lonely?

908
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,360
Yet I've never encountered one.

909
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,760
Ask about the hardships marked by my footprints.

910
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,320
How can it end?

911
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,040
Let me catch my breath.

912
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,120
I'll sing for you again.

913
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,320
Four more times to go.

914
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,040
If you sing again, I'll let the dog out.

915
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,600
By the way,

916
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,760
aren't you called Dog Gut?

917
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,440
Back then you said you were almost done for.

918
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,570
How come you've got so much energy now?

919
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,330
Damn, you still remember that?

920
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,200
My guts are definitely all human.

921
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,200
That was just street talk,

922
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,320
just trying to scare people.

923
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,560
Look at me, how could I scare anyone?

924
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,440
Only these scars might be scary.

925
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,370
I was just mischievous as a kid,

926
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,360
sneaking into someone's garden to steal cucumbers.

927
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,520
Jumping over the fence, got my belly cut by the iron railing.

928
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,160
Besides, we were poor back then.

929
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,320
My stomach would get upset whenever I ate meat.

930
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,240
There's an old saying,

931
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,480
something about a dog's belly can't hold much sesame oil.

932
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,040
So the neighbors gave me a nickname,

933
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
called me Dog Gut.

934
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,120
I think it's ready now.

935
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,380
What are you doing?

936
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,240
Letting it out.

937
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,120
What are you doing?

938
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,480
Getting you a real dog intestine.

939
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,240
I don't mean what you're getting.

940
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,040
Just keep playing.

941
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,160
At your age and still acting like a child.

942
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,690
I'm going to work, alright?

943
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,520
You never change, do you?

944
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
Look at yourself.

945
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,160
If you can laugh,

946
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,440
you won't cry.

947
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,400
Eat up.

948
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:03,880
Come on.

949
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,640
Let me tell you something.

950
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,720
This old van of yours,

951
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,560
I'm getting used to driving it.

952
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,760
I often go to the mountains.

953
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,600
How about this,

954
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,200
sell it to me at a good price?

955
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
Sell? No way.

956
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,280
I'll give it to you.

957
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,610
Great, it's a deal then.

958
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,640
Can I talk to you about something now?

959
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,170
Go ahead.

960
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,210
Secretary Zhang

961
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,620
has been arrested.

962
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,840
What? What for?

963
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,520
Bribery. Just yesterday.

964
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,200
This is trouble.

965
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,480
What's the problem?

966
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,240
Shouldn't you be happy he's locked up?

967
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,320
Why are you worried?

968
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,850
His dog is still at my place.

969
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,680
He only paid one month's food money,

970
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,080
and that's just for the dog.

971
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,010
He hasn't even paid me my wages yet.

972
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,560
That's a problem,

973
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,120
but since he's locked up,

974
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,480
why don't we just sell his dog and be done with it?

975
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,880
That won't work. How will we explain it when he gets out?

976
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,340
Just tell him he didn't leave enough food money and it starved.

977
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,000
To be honest, after taking care of it for a few days,

978
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,400
I've grown attached to that dog.

979
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,360
So what are you going to do?

980
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,240
He might be in prison for eight or ten years.

981
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,400
Are you going to keep taking care of it all that time?

982
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,130
I guess I'll just have to treat it as my own dog now.

983
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,640
Eat up.

984
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,250
Big dogs get the big pieces.

985
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,320
Small dogs get the small ones.

986
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,000
Go ahead, eat.

987
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,240
Stop being picky.

988
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,730
There won't be any more big chunks of beef.

989
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,000
Even so,

990
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,500
you're eating better than your boss.

991
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,520
He's inside,

992
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,740
probably can't even get any meat.

993
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,160
I'm sorry I can't take you

994
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,130
around to do that stuff.

995
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,570
I don't know that many female dogs.

996
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,760
Your boss is just like you,

997
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,040
can't fool around anymore.

998
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,680
That's just how it is.

999
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,840
If you think

1000
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,960
you can't have fun anymore

1001
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,290
and life has no meaning,

1002
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,210
then don't eat a single bite

1003
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,690
and starve to death.

1004
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,380
But if you're more optimistic

1005
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,090
and want to keep living,

1006
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,720
then eat it all up.

1007
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,360
That's it.
