1
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,960
But you don't need to worry.

2
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,360
We live in a society governed by law.

3
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,960
You have to trust the system.

4
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,440
Isn't this person not killed by him?

5
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,360
Many pieces of evidence don't match up.

6
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,080
There's insufficient evidence.

7
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,840
The prosecutor's office will return the case.

8
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,160
After a few years of back and forth,

9
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,280
it'll all be over.

10
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,930
By then, they might catch the real killer.

11
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,360
Man,

12
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,020
you're practically a lawyer.

13
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,160
Expert! When it comes to criminal and public security matters,

14
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,220
I understand more than many lawyers.

15
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,090
Why don't you take the bar exam?

16
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,720
Do I look like a lawyer?

17
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,250
Who looks like a lawyer anyway?

18
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,720
You could be a lawyer.

19
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,810
You're good at pretending.

20
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,600
You can learn.

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,400
I can't. I've never studied law.

22
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,360
You're smart.

23
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,200
Just take the exam and you'll pass.

24
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,840
Right? Think about it.

25
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
This case is so complicated.

26
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,840
It won't be resolved for years.

27
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,600
You might as well use this time

28
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,079
to get your law license.

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,960
Once you get it,

30
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
you can represent

31
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,960
your buddy in court yourself.

32
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,040
How does that sound?

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,720
Both economical and reliable.

34
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,360
As for practical experience,

35
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,640
my buddies and I

36
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,960
can provide countless real cases.

37
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,720
I'll take it. I can do that.

38
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,160
It's settled then. I'll take the exam.

39
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,079
Do you have any books

40
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:47,940
I could look at?

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,840
Sure, buddy.

42
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,760
I'll go buy some books later.

43
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,540
It's a way forward.

44
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,040
Coming!

45
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,160
Dad.

46
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,770
He really does work at a nightclub.

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,600
I wanted to talk to him yesterday

48
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,160
and have a proper conversation.

49
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,620
But before I could finish,

50
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,600
he ran out without even putting on his coat.

51
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,800
Where did he go?

52
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,600
I don't know.

53
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,520
He came back in the middle of the night,

54
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,520
but I was angry and didn't let him in.

55
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
So what about him?

56
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Doesn't he work during the day?

57
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,040
What about his job?

58
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,360
He's been suspended.

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,600
Why was he suspended?

60
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,280
They say he got into a fight with the factory director's secretary.

61
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,410
He's always been slacking off at work.

62
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,520
He's constantly getting into arguments.

63
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,160
He won't get fired, will he?

64
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,600
It won't come to that, Dad.

65
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,200
They said there's still a chance to fix things.

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,400
Get me those heart pills.

67
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,800
Don't get upset, Dad.

68
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,329
How many do you need?

69
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,839
This kid, I swear...

70
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
Tell me where

71
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,640
his performance is taking place.

72
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,120
I'll go with you, Dad.

73
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,780
It's not convenient for you to go.

74
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,920
I'm definitely going to beat him up.

75
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,800
So you're saying

76
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,920
Cui Guoming performs punctually

77
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,280
at Yese Bar every night?

78
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,560
Absolutely.

79
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,920
Every night at 9.

80
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,800
Never been late once.

81
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,680
Director, look.

82
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,320
He's worked at our factory for over a decade

83
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,680
and has never been this reliable.

84
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,920
Last night

85
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,159
he was disheveled

86
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,960
rushing out of the stairwell.

87
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,159
What does that mean?

88
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,680
That we don't know.

89
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:40,800
Look.

90
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,040
Wearing thermal underwear and slippers

91
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,700
rushing out of the stairwell.

92
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,159
Must have been up to something.

93
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:47,920
What?

94
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,440
Fooling around.

95
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,400
Alright.

96
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,440
Of course, I didn't see it myself.

97
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,800
We shouldn't spread rumors.

98
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,080
But just think about it.

99
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,040
How could any normal person

100
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,159
be dressed like that

101
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,760
rushing out of a stairwell?

102
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,400
How's that any different from being naked?

103
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,160
Just speak.

104
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,020
Stop with the gestures, will you?

105
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,760
It's very different from being naked.

106
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,640
Isn't it written here?

107
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,040
He rushed out from his own building.

108
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,160
Must have been at a female neighbor's place.

109
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,200
Either her husband caught him

110
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,400
or his own wife found out.

111
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,680
And he didn't go home all night.

112
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,530
Just think about it.

113
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,040
What's going on here?

114
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,800
Don't make me guess.

115
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,160
Just tell me your conclusion.

116
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,680
Based on my experience,

117
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,040
he must have been

118
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,200
arrested.

119
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,520
When he was caught,

120
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
he panicked

121
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,020
and had no choice but to run like this.

122
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,960
You seem experienced with this.

123
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,800
Boss, I'm an honest person.

124
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,680
I'm just saying I've seen cases like this before.

125
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,320
Alright, enough.

126
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,320
What's this here?

127
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,280
Didn't come home all night.

128
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,440
Stayed at some

129
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,760
neighborhood next to some fish market.

130
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,560
Is this

131
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,320
also his lover?

132
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,400
No, it's a man's place.

133
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
A man?

134
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,960
You mean he has

135
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,160
that tendency?

136
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,560
You misunderstood.

137
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,720
Huo Dongfeng.

138
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,320
The one who was once

139
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,450
known as one of the Dalin Three Heroes.

140
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
The one who was at that truck parade,

141
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,400
standing in the front row.

142
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,120
He's an old-school gangster.

143
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,080
Even the famous Ermei now

144
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,240
used to be his brother back then.

145
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
Director, you have no idea.

146
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,080
These people

147
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,840
bully everyone at the fish market every day.

148
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,080
Bullying and intimidation?

149
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,520
That's putting it mildly.

150
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,320
To put it seriously, it's called

151
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,760
a criminal gang.

152
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,280
Xiao Cui went to their place.

153
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,280
Xiao Cui has joined a gang.

154
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,240
Director, that's right.

155
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,800
People from our factory office have seen it all.

156
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,159
Yesterday, at his place,

157
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,159
there were people coming in and out.

158
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,960
More than ten people!

159
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,200
Why does he have so many tricks up his sleeve?

160
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,060
Every day there's something new.

161
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,680
I saw him yesterday.

162
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,410
He got into the car of the Night Club owner's wife.

163
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,400
Who knows what he was up to.

164
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,680
Morally corrupt.

165
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,890
It's more than just moral corruption.

166
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,920
Director, yesterday,

167
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,680
I was at the entrance of the Night Club.

168
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,160
I had a brief chat with him.

169
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,160
I was just concerned about our factory's reputation.

170
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,290
I said to him,

171
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,840
How dare you

172
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,570
hang your own photo on the wall?

173
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,040
Guess what he said?

174
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,059
What did he say?

175
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,799
He said,

176
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,679
For me,

177
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,039
hanging my color photo on the wall

178
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,559
is a sign of my success.

179
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,520
If you want your photo on the wall,

180
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,100
it would have to be in black and white.

181
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,290
That's what he said.

182
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,800
Exactly.

183
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,320
If I hang my photo on the wall,

184
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,440
I'd be his ancestor too.

185
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,920
Right, his ancestor.

186
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,560
Let's go together tomorrow.

187
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,560
I really want to see for myself.

188
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,040
Check it out.

189
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,520
Because of Uncle,

190
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,880
the factory director rarely

191
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,000
set foot in a bar.

192
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,200
Sir, who are you looking for?

193
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,720
Cui Guoming.

194
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,040
Cui, someone's here for you.

195
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
Guoming.

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,760
Dad.

197
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,720
Dad, how about one more pill?

198
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,320
No need.

199
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,960
I just want to ask you

200
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,690
why exactly were you suspended from work?

201
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,080
I don't think much of our new factory director.

202
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,720
In school, you couldn't stand your teachers.

203
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,010
At work, you can't stand your boss.

204
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,930
I just don't understand

205
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,600
how unfair heaven must be to you,

206
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,480
sending so many demons and monsters

207
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,080
to make you suffer through 81 tribulations.

208
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,480
No, but

209
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,080
the former director respected me, didn't he?

210
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,120
Yes.

211
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
The old director

212
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,890
had his own way of handling things.

213
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,960
But you

214
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,490
can't just have issues with the new director.

215
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,480
Instead of reflecting on yourself,

216
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
you come to a place like this to sing.

217
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,720
What is all this? Tell me.

218
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,440
What kind of mess is all this?

219
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,960
What kind of people are these?

220
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,680
They're not bad people.

221
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,720
Just a bit strange.

222
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,960
I'm quite happy here.

223
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,480
I earn more here than at the factory,

224
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,800
at least ten times more.

225
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,240
Breaking the law pays even more.

226
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,520
Dad,

227
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,180
I'm not prostituting myself.

228
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,800
Mom was a singer too.

229
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,320
What's wrong with me singing?

230
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,560
Your mother

231
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,160
was an artist,

232
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,360
a state-recognized artist.

233
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,290
Who did she perform for?

234
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,080
And who are you performing for?

235
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,210
How can you compare?

236
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,560
As long as I'm alive,

237
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,080
I will not allow

238
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,970
you to sing in a place like this.

239
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,440
Come with me.

240
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,080
I can't leave now.

241
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,680
Dad, please don't be angry anymore.

242
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,680
I promise you

243
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,600
this is my last performance.

244
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,200
I can't just leave them hanging.

245
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,730
They need to make money too.

246
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,200
I can't just quit whenever I want.

247
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
It's the most basic integrity as a person.

248
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,000
The last time.

249
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,320
Actually, I have

250
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,040
a new plan for my future.

251
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,240
I'll talk to you about it later.

252
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,770
It's absolutely reliable.

253
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,060
Ladies and gentlemen,

254
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,780
my colleague requested a song called 'Remembering Parents' Kindness.'

255
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,440
I'm sorry,

256
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,300
I don't know how to sing this song.

257
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,440
I can sing 'Kiss My Baby' instead.

258
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,960
I'd like to dedicate this song to my colleague.

259
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,960
This song

260
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,720
can be from a father to his son,

261
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,560
or

262
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,160
from a grandfather to his grandson.

263
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,560
I hope through this song,

264
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,680
they can feel

265
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,080
the love from their elders.

266
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,960
Cui Guoming, what do you mean?

267
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,720
Who are you insulting?

268
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,360
Who are you insulting? Get down here!

269
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,080
Let go!

270
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,040
Who are you insulting? Get down here!

271
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,100
Cui Guoming, you're being completely inappropriate!

272
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,240
I'm sorry, Miss Yang.

273
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,640
For causing you trouble.

274
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't say that.

275
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,680
It's nothing.

276
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,140
This kind of thing happens here all the time.

277
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,800
It's okay.

278
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,680
No,

279
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,040
what I mean is,

280
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,520
I won't be coming back tomorrow.

281
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,320
What are you talking about, Cui?

282
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,200
I promise you,

283
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,160
the security here

284
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,520
will definitely be improved, okay?

285
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,780
I'm not afraid of them.

286
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
I'm sorry,

287
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,200
um,

288
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,720
I had a bit too much to drink last night.

289
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,640
Please don't.

290
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,360
Miss Yang, please don't do this.

291
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,520
I'm really embarrassed.

292
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,760
Cui, please don't take it personally.

293
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,440
No, no,

294
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,040
it's because my family

295
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,640
really can't take it anymore.

296
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,160
My father just cornered me.

297
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,520
My wife won't let me go home either.

298
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,000
Why don't you explain it to them?

299
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,640
Look at this situation.

300
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,200
If I could explain it,

301
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,660
why would I need to resign?

302
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,140
I was actually quite happy working here.

303
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,440
The finance department has left for today.

304
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,400
Let's leave it at that then.

305
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,160
Tomorrow,

306
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,280
come back and collect your salary.

307
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,440
No, no, Miss Yang.

308
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,720
You've been very good to me.

309
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,120
I'm very grateful to you.

310
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,280
Miss Yang, fate brought us together.

311
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,530
I heard that our factory

312
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,580
is going to lay people off with compensation for years of service.

313
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,960
You two

314
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,960
don't be afraid of this at all.

315
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,040
The 14th Party Congress

316
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,900
has stated that

317
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,400
we will maintain public ownership as the mainstay

318
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,000
while allowing diverse forms of ownership to develop together.

319
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,890
Do you understand what that means?

320
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,240
It's an opportunity.

321
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,200
If they want me to leave,

322
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,000
I'll leave right away.

323
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,930
You need capital for any business.

324
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,200
Right?

325
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,400
No, Cui, didn't you say

326
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,360
you've been wanting to buy a car?

327
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,160
The three of us combined

328
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
can't afford one.

329
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,280
Who told you

330
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,340
that you need capital to do business?

331
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,770
It's all about this.

332
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,720
You

333
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,360
should watch less of 'The Legend of White Snake'.

334
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,200
A man falling in love with a snake,

335
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,640
head over heels in love.

336
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,120
It's completely distracting you.

337
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,020
You need to arm yourself mentally, understand?

338
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
What are you laughing at?

339
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,730
No, seriously, what do you usually watch?

340
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
There's this guy.

341
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,440
You know, this guy is amazing.

342
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,240
He wants to blow up the Himalayas

343
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
and then trade canned food and underwear

344
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,120
for Soviet aircraft.

345
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,720
What kind of underwear are they trading?

346
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,400
Briefs.

347
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,680
The ones we wear.

348
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,720
Trading briefs for aircraft?

349
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,880
That's quite creative.

350
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,680
The Soviets must be really short on underwear.

351
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,440
Guys, this is for you.

352
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,800
Food. It's a gift.

353
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,600
Thank you very much.

354
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,880
It's free, right?

355
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,680
It's free.

356
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,740
Can you add more hot sauce?

357
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,280
A little is fine too.

358
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,400
Sure, any amount is fine.

359
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,360
Go for it.

360
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,880
This guy has an interesting way of talking.

361
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,640
I'm learning something new.

362
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,720
Have a seat. Let's chat.

363
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,920
Is this okay?

364
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,400
Sit down.

365
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,760
We're the only ones at this table. Please sit.

366
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,560
Then I'll respectfully comply.

367
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,920
Want a drink?

368
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm not drinking anymore.

369
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,760
Is there anything you want to ask me?

370
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,680
Absolutely.

371
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,880
I was just listening to you talk earlier.

372
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,080
Very philosophical.

373
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,960
I wanted to ask,

374
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,200
in today's society,

375
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,440
for a small barbecue shop like mine,

376
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,720
how can I

377
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,800
make money?

378
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,200
It's tough, honestly.

379
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,520
There are six or seven barbecue shops on this street.

380
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,780
Yes, even if yours is better than theirs,

381
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,400
you'd barely make ends meet.

382
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,000
So what should I do?

383
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,160
Last year,

384
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,930
I was sent on a business trip to Guangdong.

385
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,760
I discovered that in Guangdong,

386
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,020
there wasn't a single barbecue shop.

387
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,640
What does this mean?

388
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,200
If you go there, you'd be the undisputed king.

389
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,880
If they don't have any barbecue shops,

390
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,240
doesn't that actually

391
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,680
prove they don't eat skewers?

392
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,380
Let me tell you a story.

393
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,960
There was a salesman

394
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,120
who went to an island

395
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,760
full of indigenous people.

396
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,020
They all walked barefoot without shoes.

397
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,800
He was desperate.

398
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,880
Extremely discouraged.

399
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,680
So he left.

400
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,000
He went back.

401
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,800
He told another salesman.

402
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,610
That guy went crazy.

403
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,720
He took shoes and went to the island.

404
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,520
And he got everyone on the island

405
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,040
to buy a pair of shoes.

406
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,810
Do you understand this principle?

407
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,440
No.

408
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,520
This market

409
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,960
always needs you to discover

410
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,440
and always needs you to lead.

411
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,960
I'm thinking about this Guangdong matter.

412
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,440
I'll go brush on the chili sauce first.

413
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,720
Alright, I'll think about it.

414
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,380
Sure thing.

415
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,960
Put on plenty of chili sauce,

416
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,220
really lay it on thick.

417
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,400
What time is it?

418
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,820
What are you doing?

419
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,880
Why are you looking at someone else's watch?

420
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,000
Don't you have your own?

421
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,760
It's past 2 o'clock.

422
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,520
I'm done talking with you two.

423
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,240
I'm going home.

424
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,570
Where's your own watch?

425
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,040
My watch is right here.

426
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,960
You're so stingy.

427
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,920
You don't even want to look at your own watch.

428
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,240
So what?

429
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,040
Check if it's broken or what.

430
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,880
Liu Ye, oh Liu Ye.

431
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,400
I get it now.

432
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,520
You two are ganging up on me, right?

433
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,280
I'll just leave then, problem solved.

434
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,120
Where are you going?

435
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,920
Where do you think you're going?

436
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,680
The chili sauce you asked for,

437
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,000
they haven't brought it yet.

438
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,720
Why are you leaving?

439
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,440
That spicy sauce is for you two.

440
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:57,920
Put more on.

441
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,400
It's strong but good with drinks.

442
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,720
He's acting like he's doing us a favor.

443
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,440
Can you believe he thinks he's looking out for us?

444
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,160
So kind.

445
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,960
So very kind.

446
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,520
Really kind indeed.

447
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,680
Too kind for words.

448
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,720
Look at you spitting when you pick your teeth.

449
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Have you ever seen Liu Ye spit while picking his teeth?

450
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,000
Actually, no.

451
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
No, right? I haven't seen it either.

452
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,520
I've been watching.

453
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,160
After picking his teeth, he sucks on the toothpick,

454
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,040
then chews it,

455
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,220
and swallows it whole.

456
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,920
No,

457
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,960
what's wrong?

458
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,120
Boss,

459
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,640
skip the garlic,

460
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,200
I can't eat it.

461
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,730
Really, it's not like that.

462
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,040
You're really disgusting me.

463
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,000
Am I insulting you?

464
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,240
I'm just stating facts.

465
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,040
Sauce it up.

466
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,440
Show off! Come on!

467
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,000
Car's coming.

468
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,400
Let's go.

469
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,400
It's you, buddy.

470
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,240
It's me.

471
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,000
You buying today?

472
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,920
I'll buy.

473
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,640
So you're buying today.

474
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,160
Yes.

475
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,520
Then you should buy me another drink.

476
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,440
Sure, another day.

477
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,100
Let's go inside and eat first.

478
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,060
Eat. Let's eat inside.

479
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,120
Bye.

480
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,760
Let's go.

481
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,000
Iron doors and iron windows.

482
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,200
Boss, ten kidneys.

483
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,850
Do you know about Chow Yun-fat?

484
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,930
I don't care about this moment.

485
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,800
Come.

486
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,400
Have a drink with me.

487
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,400
You must like Chow Yun-fat.

488
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,640
People

489
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,370
always like those who are similar to themselves.

490
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,960
You're both tough guys.

491
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,820
I'm listening.

492
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
This criminal law book

493
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,220
is too difficult for most people to read.

494
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,640
No, I can read it.

495
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,530
I can split my brain.

496
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,920
There are methods to studying.

497
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,360
You know?

498
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,240
I memorize all the words on a page

499
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,280
by associating them with animals.

500
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,960
Ten years ago,

501
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,920
I might have liked it.

502
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,680
But not anymore.

503
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,520
This kind of life,

504
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,460
I live it every day.

505
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,760
This life, it...

506
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,740
What's this music called?

507
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,720
I don't know either,

508
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,360
but it's really nice.

509
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,290
It's beautiful.

510
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,640
Is this a suona?

511
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,120
No, no.

512
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,080
It looks like a Scottish bagpipe.

513
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,560
Scottish bagpipe.

514
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,100
You should learn this.

515
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,840
This one.

516
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,620
You learn quickly.

517
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,450
Play it for me when I die.

518
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
What are you talking about so late at night?

519
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,160
Why say such unlucky things?

520
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,360
No, no. Listen.

521
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,490
Everyone has to die.

522
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,160
Play it for me when I die.

523
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,080
Will you do that?

524
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,560
Okay.

525
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:14,520
Okay.

526
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,800
Let me enjoy

527
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,060
such a grand ceremony.

528
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,040
What's going on with you?

529
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,840
What?

530
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,040
What?

531
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,040
What's wrong?

532
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,800
What?

533
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,280
I've taken your advice to heart.

534
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,760
Didn't you tell me not to see Er Mei?

535
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,880
He invited me for drinks but I didn't go.

536
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,720
Not even once.

537
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
I'm working from dawn till dusk now.

538
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,330
Just trying to earn some honest money.

539
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,320
But...

540
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,120
I miss your sister.

541
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,320
How is she doing?

542
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,280
Brother.

543
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,800
You need to find someone.

544
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,720
You can't just

545
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,650
hang out with these guys every day.

546
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,680
Let's get to work, guys!

547
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,000
Time to work.

548
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,280
Am I ready to work?

549
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,240
Looking good.

550
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,000
Let's work. Another day.

551
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,000
8-3-1-4-5-2-1.

552
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,420
Call it three times right now.

553
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,200
Come, try this.

554
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,360
This is delicious.

555
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,040
What's all this noise?

556
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,840
Don't you know Cui is sleeping?

557
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,610
Why are you all acting like hooligans?

558
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,720
He's awake.

559
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,760
Let go of me.

560
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,040
Come on.

561
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,880
Good job.

562
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,760
Come, come.

563
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,480
Let's have a drink.

564
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,000
Come on, Xiao Cui.

565
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,040
Here, pour the drink.

566
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,200
Pour the drink. Come on.

567
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,040
I thought it was water.

568
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,200
Who poured me alcohol?

569
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,320
I did.

570
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,240
Come on.

571
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,280
Why not pour it directly into my mouth?

572
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
Come, I'll pour it into your mouth.

573
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,080
Come here.

574
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,040
I'm not your wife.

575
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,880
Drinking so early in the morning?

576
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,800
It's already 12:30.

577
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,730
Time for a drink.

578
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,840
Brothers.

579
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,320
Drink up.

580
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,220
Who made this chicken?

581
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,960
I did. Why?

582
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,240
Aren't you better at making duck?

583
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,640
You can make chicken too?

584
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,120
He said yesterday he'd stay at his brother-in-law's place.

585
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,960
You mean his brother-in-law is

586
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,760
Er Pang's father, Huo Dongfeng?

587
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
How many brothers-in-law does he have?

588
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,720
I don't know.

589
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,120
If he has other brothers-in-law...

590
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,040
I...

591
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,360
Er Pang, let's go. Take your aunt to your house.

592
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,020
I've never been there before.

593
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,240
I want to go too.

594
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,480
You stay home.

595
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,480
No, Mom.

596
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,140
I'm scared to be alone at home.

597
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,040
Let's go.

598
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,440
Hurry up and get dressed.

599
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
Lawyer Cui.

600
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,480
From now on, we're all counting on you.

601
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,240
Do we get a discount?

602
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,480
No discounts.

603
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,880
Free of charge.

604
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,280
I think Xiao Cui

605
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,540
is good at everything.

606
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,560
Our VCR broke down yesterday.

607
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,280
I called a repairman.

608
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,560
He worked for hours but couldn't fix it.

609
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,520
Xiao Cui fixed it in just a couple of seconds.

610
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,160
That's because the repairman forgot his glasses.

611
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,690
The plug wasn't connected.

612
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,800
No way.

613
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,720
It was really broken.

614
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,600
You're really amazing.

615
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,080
Can a lawyer be like a VCR

616
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,940
and just light up when plugged in?

617
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,040
Don't you need to study more?

618
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,840
That's right.

619
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,240
I'm planning to go to the bookstore this afternoon

620
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,760
to buy some more law books

621
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,570
and then register for the exam.

622
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,640
Dad,

623
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,080
Erpang.

624
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,760
Oh my goodness!

625
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,680
What a den of debauchery!

626
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,930
Sister-in-law is here.

627
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,400
I can't get up.

628
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,560
I'm just...

629
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,560
I can't get up.

630
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,820
Find somewhere to sit.

631
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,080
No need.

632
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,640
Let's go.

633
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,800
Come with me.

634
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,400
Follow me.

635
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,370
Wait, let me put on my pants.

636
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,880
Where are my pants?

637
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,960
I have them here.

638
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,160
How shameless!

639
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,760
You people... Let's go!

640
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,400
Are these your pants?

641
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,320
Why are you taking someone else's pants?

642
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,580
I put on the wrong ones.

643
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,080
Well, you guys...

644
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,280
You guys carry on. I'll

645
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,800
just be going now.

646
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,480
Erpang, let's go.

647
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,560
Pull up your pants.

648
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,400
You humiliated me today

649
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,080
in front of all these people.

650
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,690
Have you lost your mind?

651
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,520
You're wrong.

652
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,960
Then you're wrong to act like this.

653
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,880
You need to

654
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,040
show some attitude.

655
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,690
Otherwise, I...

656
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,610
We've finished what needed to be done.

657
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,520
Let's have a proper talk.

658
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
Tell me,

659
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,740
if you really get fired from the factory,

660
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,130
how do you plan to make a living?

661
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,920
I'll manage.

662
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,600
I'll find a way.

663
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,060
Tell me what you can do.

664
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,600
I can do anything.

665
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,720
What can you do to make money?

666
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,120
How about becoming a lawyer?

667
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,040
Oh my goodness,

668
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,320
you just say whatever comes to mind!

669
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,320
Do you know anything about being a lawyer?

670
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,440
Tell me,

671
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,500
how will you feed yourself tomorrow?

672
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,000
I won't starve tomorrow.

673
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,840
I can do many things.

674
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,360
What,

675
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,440
go back to singing at that filthy nightclub?

676
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,360
Why do you call it a filthy nightclub?

677
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,960
What else would you call it?

678
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,440
Look at how you dress, neither human nor ghost.

679
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,200
I'm embarrassed to even talk about it.

680
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,360
You have no shame at all.

681
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,080
Why do you keep scolding me?

682
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,520
When I'm on stage,

683
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,920
that's just my performance style.

684
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,480
In real life,

685
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,640
aren't I perfectly fine?

686
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,440
Fine.

687
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,260
Then sing and dance for me.

688
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,960
We've been married for so many years,

689
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,360
I haven't seen you dance in a long time.

690
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,320
Let me see what you can do.

691
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,280
I'm warning you.

692
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,560
You can hit me,

693
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,560
you can scold me,

694
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,800
I can even kneel before you.

695
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,440
But you can't make me sing whenever you want,

696
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,240
or dance on command.

697
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,880
I'm not your plaything.

698
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,480
Are you going to dance or not?

699
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,760
No.

700
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,440
Today you must dance for me with your shirt off.

701
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,480
Still shirtless?

702
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,440
Hey, are you going to jump or not?

703
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,240
I won't jump.

704
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,320
I'll beat you up. Will you jump?

705
00:30:59,320 --> 00:30:59,840
No.

706
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,440
Jump or not?

707
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
No.

708
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,560
Hey, are you jumping or not?

709
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,400
I won't jump.

710
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,900
Do you have any money left?

711
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,480
My money was confiscated.

712
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,480
I have about 10 yuan.

713
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,820
That's enough.

714
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,260
Do you have a day off tomorrow?

715
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
Yes.

716
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,760
Good.

717
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,720
I'll take you to make some money.

718
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,800
Make money?

719
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,960
This must be kept secret.

720
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,560
Absolutely don't let Mengmeng and your aunt know.

721
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,480
Uncle.

722
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,120
Why don't you go with my dad

723
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,560
to the fish market?

724
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,160
Isn't it profitable?

725
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,840
I'm not good at everything.

726
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,640
I have my limitations too.

727
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,280
I can't do your dad's job.

728
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,540
Then who are you going to help?

729
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,040
How is Xiaoxue doing

730
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,570
these days? Is she not well?

731
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,440
Yes.

732
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,920
It's winter now

733
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,800
but she's still wearing fall clothes.

734
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,440
She doesn't change them for days.

735
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,400
She even smells.

736
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,260
That's the least of it.

737
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,460
Her classmates say her father is a rapist and murderer.

738
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,240
I can see she's becoming withdrawn.

739
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,440
Always stabbing his arm with a compass.

740
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,440
Two yuan per game! Two yuan per game!

741
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,720
Endgames or full games available.

742
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,520
Two yuan per game! Two yuan per game!

743
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,800
Endgames or full games available.

744
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,800
Two yuan per game! Two yuan per game!

745
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,560
Endgames or full games available.

746
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,640
Seniors over 60

747
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,920
pay half price if you lose,

748
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,440
and keep all if you win!

749
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,880
Two yuan per game! Two yuan per game!

750
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,280
You're really fat!

751
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Lose some weight.

752
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,130
Am I eating at your expense?

753
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,360
Get up.

754
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,000
Make room.

755
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,800
Come on.

756
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,840
You're quite talented, aren't you?

757
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,320
Let's play a round.

758
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,240
If I lose, I'll give you 10 yuan.

759
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,700
If you lose, give me 1 yuan.

760
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,200
So confident.

761
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,760
I don't believe that in 10 rounds,

762
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,160
I can't win at least once.

763
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,680
Let's see.

764
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,000
That's amazing!

765
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,960
So impressive!

766
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,280
If you're so good, you try it.

767
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,930
One move, game over.

768
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,480
One fatal move.

769
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,760
Fatal.

770
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,840
This guy's playing style is dishonest.

771
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,680
It's extremely dishonest.

772
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,800
More than dishonest.

773
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,600
It's absolutely

774
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,760
unethical.

775
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,940
How much money do we have left?

776
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,240
Today's profits,

777
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,640
after medical expenses,

778
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,480
leave us with just over 10 yuan,

779
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,680
same as this morning.

780
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,680
That's enough.

781
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,480
Enough again.

782
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,460
We need to increase our initial investment.

783
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,320
Let's go buy a pickaxe.

784
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,360
What for?

785
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,040
To make money.

786
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,760
What kind of money

787
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,440
are you going to make with a pickaxe?

788
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,720
Going to do farm work?

789
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,120
No,

790
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,760
digging is so primitive.

791
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,220
You've really got some nerve.

792
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,800
In this condition,

793
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
you still dare to set up shop?

794
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,460
What's that supposed to mean?

795
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,960
Got new equipment

796
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,280
for standing guard?

797
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,530
Making friends through chess.

798
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,720
Come on.

799
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,480
Let's go.

800
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,280
You win.

801
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,300
I can calculate the next 30 moves.

802
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,560
I'll definitely lose this game.

803
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,890
How did you figure that?

804
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,480
You can go.

805
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,720
Remember this:

806
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,700
My name is Gou Changzi.

807
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,000
Don't you dare set up a chess stall in front of me again.

808
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,960
Got it?

809
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,360
I'm talking to you.

810
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,240
Did you hear me?

811
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,600
Hurry up.

812
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,620
At the entrance of People's Park.

813
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,970
Who are you calling?

814
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,480
My dad.

815
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,360
I just went to the bathroom

816
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,040
and you called him?

817
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,000
My dad will be here soon.

818
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,040
Let's wait here.

819
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,810
This is so frustrating.

820
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,440
Guoming.

821
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,280
Dad.

822
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,960
Where's Guoming?

823
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,000
I don't know.

824
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,930
Where's Erpang?

825
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,280
I don't know.

826
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,440
Both of them disappeared early this morning.

827
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,600
Didn't you page them?

828
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,800
I did. No response.

829
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,960
What's wrong?

830
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,500
Let's make dinner.

831
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,800
Okay, have a seat first.

832
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,000
Have some water. I'll be done soon.

833
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,280
What happened?

834
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,840
Where is everyone?

835
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,900
They're sleeping.

836
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,520
Sleeping.

837
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,300
What's wrong with you?

838
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,640
No, no. Where are they?

839
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:16,920
No, no.

840
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,640
Don't worry about us.

841
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,280
Where are they?

842
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,560
What happened to you guys?

843
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,360
We're fine.

844
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,480
Got into a fight with the fish vendor this morning.

845
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,810
Look at the state of you!

846
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,560
Where are they?

847
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,280
Forget about them.

848
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,120
You're in such bad shape.

849
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,480
Just go home.

850
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,920
Wait, do you know who did this?

851
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,040
Yes, I know them.

852
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,840
But it's not worth it.

853
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,500
I just got shocked a few times.

854
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,840
Wake up. It's okay.

855
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,480
Go home and get some rest.

856
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,640
I need to take care of something with your uncle.

857
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,400
No, wait.

858
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:36,680
Let's go.

859
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,200
Really, let it go.

860
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,360
Look at yourselves!

861
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,920
No, get in the car.

862
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,000
Are you okay?

863
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,920
It's fine. Come back.

864
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,680
Erpang, go home now.

865
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,360
I'm going.

866
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,200
Take care, Dad.

867
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,840
Get out and push.

868
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,360
Come on. One, two, three.

869
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,760
His uncle is looking outside.

870
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,800
If you don't look outside,

871
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,400
how will you find your enemy?

872
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,880
Our city has several million people.

873
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,760
Looking for him like this

874
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,440
is like finding a needle in a haystack.

875
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,320
It was just one fight.

876
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,360
There's no deep hatred between you.

877
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,440
He's not really your enemy.

878
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,520
Let's stop this, please.

879
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,960
We're almost at my house up ahead.

880
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,600
Pull over.

881
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,360
I need to go home.

882
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,920
No way. Stay put.

883
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,200
This isn't your business.

884
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,040
Right, not your business.

885
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,840
I want to get revenge for Erpang.

886
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,360
Since he was little,

887
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,360
Erpang hasn't had his parents around.

888
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,720
He's always been bullied.

889
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,160
When I was inside, I couldn't help it.

890
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,920
But now I'm out,

891
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,450
how can I let him be bullied?

892
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,760
I know you're doing this for me.

893
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,920
No,

894
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,040
it's for Erpang.

895
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,920
For Erpang.

896
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,640
For Erpang.

897
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,040
You look that way,

898
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,260
I'll look this way.

899
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,890
Where's your uncle?

900
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,600
My uncle got into a fight with someone.

901
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,200
What?

902
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,480
With whom?

903
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,760
My uncle and I

904
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,440
went to the park this morning to set up a chess stall

905
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,360
when we ran into a group of thugs.

906
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,040
What?

907
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,200
Chess stall?

908
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,480
Where is he now?

909
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,130
My dad took my uncle to get revenge.

910
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,340
Oh my goodness!

911
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,380
Here, take this medicine.

912
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,210
Oh my! I poured too much.

913
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,360
Did you find it?

914
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,920
Please stop driving.

915
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,480
Let's

916
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,440
find a place to eat first.

917
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,200
I'm hungry, brother.

918
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,700
I'll take you to a skewer restaurant.

919
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,460
We'll continue after eating.

920
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,720
Won't waste any time.

921
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,200
I'm hungry too.

922
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,520
Let's listen to big brother.

923
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,850
Big brother knows best.

924
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,410
Everyone's asleep.

925
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,340
Why not just go home to sleep? Seriously.

926
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,960
This is our last stop.

927
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,960
If we still can't find it,

928
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,760
we'll go home.

929
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,960
Let's eat something first.

930
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,040
We'll continue searching after eating.

931
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,960
No, no, no.

932
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,960
Brother.

933
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,080
I think we should try

934
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,860
not to resort to violence.

935
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,760
I'm here. Who is it?
