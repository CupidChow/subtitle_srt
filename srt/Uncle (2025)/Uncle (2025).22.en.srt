00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
Li

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,720
Li Yang

3
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,040
Liu

4
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,200
Hey.

5
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,120
Stop rushing me. I just uploaded it.

6
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,979
I even wrote 500 more words today.

7
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,400
I still have to go up the mountain every day.

8
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,680
Dig for wild ginseng and feed the dogs.

9
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,280
I come back at night without even eating dinner.

10
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,880
Just to write novels for you.

11
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,720
I am indeed your uncle.

12
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,440
But you can't work me to death.

13
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,000
No.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,920
My grandfather wants someone to come keep him company.

15
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,720
I have to go out tonight to interview an executive.

16
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,800
You're going to a nightclub for interviews at this hour?

17
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,729
How did you know?

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,680
All those executives of yours,

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,560
aren't they all recruited from nightclubs?

20
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,420
No, not a single one was recruited from nightclubs.

21
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,480
Besides, the person I'm interviewing today is a man.

22
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,680
When dealing with talent, shouldn't we be

23
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,280
enthusiastic and generous?

24
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,850
I'm going to entertain him.

25
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,680
Fine.

26
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,720
I'll go.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,760
Uncle, you're finally here.

28
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,120
So now you're recruiting talents

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,680
from nightclubs, huh?

30
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Well, for executives, what can I do?

31
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,850
I'm just showing respect to talented people.

32
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,000
How's the website doing?

33
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,360
I see my article only got about 500 clicks.

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,680
And that includes our own people

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,210
who clicked over 300 times.

36
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,480
What's the point then? Let's just quit.

37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,079
Look at Liu Bei.

38
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,120
When he was being chased everywhere,

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,180
did he give up hope?

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,240
No, he didn't.

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,360
Not only did he keep going,

42
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,960
he also sought out Zhuge Liang.

43
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,480
He visited Zhuge Liang's cottage three times.

44
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,600
And what happened in the end?

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,440
The Battle of Red Cliffs was a huge success,

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,480
forming the Three Kingdoms with Eastern Wu and Cao Wei.

47
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,680
You should talk less.

48
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,120
No, Grandpa,

49
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,520
I'm just explaining a truth to my uncle.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,720
Do you know what your uncle's

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,480
biggest problem is?

52
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,720
I know, but I'm younger,

53
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,480
I can't say it. You should.

54
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,460
Your uncle's biggest problem

55
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,960
is that he has too many skills,

56
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,520
too many ideas,

57
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,520
no persistence in anything he does,

58
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,200
and in the end, he doesn't do anything well.

59
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,520
Erpang.

60
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,720
Do you know what

61
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,200
your biggest problem is?

62
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,520
I don't know.

63
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,280
Your biggest problem

64
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,920
is that you have no skills,

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,600
but you have plenty of ideas.

66
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,530
Dad, you're absolutely right.

67
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,720
Dad.

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
What should we do?

69
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,800
Anyway, I think I can do well.

70
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,980
This guy just fell asleep sitting up.

71
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,490
He can fall asleep just leaning on his arm.

72
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,920
I'm not sleeping. I'm going back to my room.

73
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,690
You talked your grandfather to sleep.

74
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,250
You're something else.

75
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,400
I'm heading out now.

76
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,280
Where are you going?

77
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,340
To a job interview.

78
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,840
Then why did you ask me to come?

79
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,480
I didn't ask you.

80
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,080
Grandpa asked me to call you.

81
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,340
I need to hurry, Uncle.

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,000
What are our website's

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,330
unique visitors and page views this week?

84
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,640
Lucy, this should be your responsibility,

85
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,040
shouldn't you know this?

86
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,760
Yes, it is my responsibility,

87
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,960
but I can't give you the exact figures.

88
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,440
Hold on.

89
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,840
Uncle.

90
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,460
I need to discuss something with you.

91
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,060
I'm in a meeting right now.

92
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
I'm just outside.

93
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,480
Come out.

94
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,080
Alright.

95
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,210
I'll be right there.

96
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,920
Uncle, I'm really in a meeting.

97
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
You know, except for disbandment meetings,

98
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,980
all other meetings are meaningless.

99
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,890
What do you want from me anyway?

100
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,080
Your grandfather

101
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,400
I don't think he has much time left.

102
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,450
I want your mother to come back.

103
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,820
You can make that decision yourself.

104
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,120
Then give her a call.

105
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:51,960
I won't call her.

106
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,000
You call her.

107
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,120
You're her son.

108
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,320
You should be the one to call.

109
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,980
You're closer to her than I am.

110
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,120
Weren't you abroad recently

111
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,450
and spent time with her?

112
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,840
I'm not calling her anyway.

113
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,480
If someone has to call, you do it.

114
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,560
Someone has to call her.

115
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,890
I'm going upstairs now.

116
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,080
Mr. Huo.

117
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,480
Our new company has been operating

118
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,920
for over four months now,

119
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,380
and we only have a little over 100,000 yuan left in the account.

120
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,440
How much money has our new company

121
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
spent since we opened?

122
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,000
Over 1.34 million.

123
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,120
What are we going to do about next month's payroll?

124
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,380
Alright, I understand your concern.

125
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,170
You should head home early.

126
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,810
I'll be going then, Mr. Huo.

127
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,500
Hello? Who's this?

128
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,680
Hello?

129
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,040
My name is Zhou.

130
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,160
Are you the person in charge of Qigou Literature Website?

131
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,020
Yes, that's me.

132
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,610
Sorry to bother you so late.

133
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,320
I have some business matters

134
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,920
I'd like to discuss with you.

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,330
You mean about product placement, right?

136
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,160
No, I wanted to ask

137
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,140
if you would consider selling your website?

138
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,400
What?

139
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,320
Excuse me?

140
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,570
Would you consider selling your website?

141
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,450
As long as the price is reasonable,

142
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
we can discuss it.

143
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,880
Great.

144
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,400
Would it be convenient for me to visit your company?

145
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,000
Sure.

146
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,960
Would Monday next week work?

147
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,050
Yes, no problem.

148
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,180
I'll send you the address.

149
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,080
Is Gu Longju your contracted writer?

150
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,440
Yes, exclusive contract.

151
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,650
Lifetime contract.

152
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,320
Would it be possible for me to meet him too?

153
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,720
That's no problem at all.

154
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,600
Not an issue.

155
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,720
Mr. Huo.

156
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,280
Hello.

157
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,720
You must be Miss Zhou.

158
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:32,980
Yes.

159
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,960
I'm Huo Xiaoyang.

160
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,520
Hello.

161
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:35,760
Let's

162
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,000
go upstairs

163
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,919
to talk.

164
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,360
Okay.

165
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,929
This way, Miss Zhou.

166
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,920
Miss Zhou.

167
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,240
Over here.

168
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,100
Please come in.

169
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,740
Please come in.

170
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,720
Let me introduce you.

171
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,560
This is Miss Zhou from Beijing.

172
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,440
Miss Zhou's company

173
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,600
has been acquiring distinctive companies like ours

174
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,600
in the cultural and artistic website sector.

175
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:09,960
Of course,

176
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,640
we're very grateful to Miss Zhou

177
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,440
for her interest in our website.

178
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,280
Now, let's have our colleague Lucy

179
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,940
give us a brief introduction about our company.

180
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,360
Our company was established in November.

181
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,490
Excuse me, I need to interrupt.

182
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,640
Darling, please put your clothes on first.

183
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,300
Please sit.

184
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,120
I came from Beijing early this morning.

185
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,920
Besides learning from everyone

186
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,800
about operating

187
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,960
this literary website,

188
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,080
my main purpose is to meet

189
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,440
the author Gu Longju.

190
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,600
Mr. Huo, didn't I tell you before coming

191
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,330
that I wanted to meet Gu Longju?

192
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,240
I've arranged for us to meet him

193
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,120
during lunch.

194
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,200
It's already 11 o'clock now.

195
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,930
Why don't we start lunch early?

196
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,280
I have a 2:30 flight back to Beijing,

197
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,740
and I have a meeting there.

198
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,040
Then we'll skip the company introduction.

199
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,360
The true core of any literary website is always the creators.

200
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,760
The company presentation is very good.

201
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,200
Please send it to my email.

202
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,160
I'll study it carefully when I get back.

203
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,080
Sure.

204
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,200
Remember this.

205
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,640
Remember to send it to her later.

206
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,570
Let's eat first.

207
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,080
Miss Zhou, rest assured.

208
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,480
Although we currently only have Gu Longju,

209
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,880
we believe that

210
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,560
in the future, more and more

211
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,520
excellent writers like Mr. Gu

212
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,920
will join our team.

213
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,930
Where does your confidence come from?

214
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,080
Our original intention for creating this website

215
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,120
It's about providing these talented creators

216
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
with the best environment

217
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,360
and the most generous compensation.

218
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,200
Excuse me.

219
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,560
As a professional internet investor,

220
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,800
I'd like to be honest with you

221
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,660
if that's okay?

222
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,960
Your Qigou Literature website, from its design to its concept,

223
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,040
is quite frankly

224
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,640
extremely crude

225
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,920
and very amateurish.

226
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
There are not just 10,000,

227
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,520
but probably 8,000 similar sites out there.

228
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,360
If we only look at the value of your website,

229
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,320
it's not worth much,

230
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,180
not much at all.

231
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,080
Then why did you

232
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,680
come all the way from Beijing

233
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,440
and want to acquire our website?

234
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,840
Because of the writer Gu Longju.

235
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,410
Because of your contract with him.

236
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,160
Of course, don't be discouraged.

237
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,360
You have good taste,

238
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,840
signing an author like him.

239
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,080
It's really impressive.

240
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,560
His writing style is truly unique

241
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,720
and distinctive.

242
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,160
I believe that someday

243
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,960
he will become one of the greatest

244
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,160
professional writers on the Chinese internet.

245
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,800
Of course.

246
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,560
This Gulongju,

247
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,440
Actually, at first

248
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,720
I suggested he write about tomb raiding,

249
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,800
but he insisted on writing martial arts fiction.

250
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,760
The genre doesn't matter.

251
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,960
What matters is writing well.

252
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,880
So, when is he coming?

253
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,080
Artists,

254
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,850
they all have this bad habit of being late.

255
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,200
Erpang.

256
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,880
This...

257
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,610
This guy must have gotten lost.

258
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,800
Erpang is...

259
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Mr. Huo.

260
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Mr. Huo.

261
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
This is Miss Zhou from Beijing,

262
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,440
who came specifically to acquire our company.

263
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,760
Not to acquire the company.

264
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,420
I'm acquiring their website.

265
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,400
You are?

266
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,040
This is the Gu Longju you've been looking for.

267
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,680
Teacher Gu, pleased to meet you.

268
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,560
I came specifically to see you.

269
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,690
Pleased to meet you.

270
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,090
So you two already know each other?

271
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,720
Erpang this year is...

272
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,600
Mr. Huo this year is...

273
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,720
Twenty-six... twenty-five years old.

274
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,040
So we've known each other for 25 years.

275
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,240
Known him since birth.

276
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,480
I'm his uncle.

277
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,480
I see.

278
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,000
No wonder.

279
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,840
So Mr. Gu, are you a professional writer?

280
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,040
No, I'm not.

281
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,250
What do you do for a living then?

282
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,360
I grow wild ginseng professionally.

283
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,400
And I breed Tibetan mastiffs as a hobby.

284
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,600
You're from Beijing.

285
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,760
There are many rich people there.

286
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,880
They must be into dogs too.

287
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,600
The market for Tibetan mastiffs is excellent.

288
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,000
This one is a Black Pearl.

289
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,600
Good breed and fierce.

290
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
If your friends there need one,

291
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,720
you can recommend me.

292
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,840
They can come to me for breeding services.

293
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,970
It's very powerful.

294
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,220
Okay, but we can't afford such luxury right now.

295
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
You just mentioned 'now',

296
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,200
so what did you do before?

297
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,920
I was an engineer before.

298
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,760
And later,

299
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,440
well, to tell you the truth,

300
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,160
you'd have to ask me what I was doing in a specific year and month.

301
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,160
Because I've worked in

302
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,440
more than 20 different industries.

303
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,160
Do we even have that many industries in our country?

304
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,480
I've been involved in some overseas projects too.

305
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,210
Yes, my uncle has lived abroad for over ten years.

306
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
No wonder your style

307
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,420
looks quite distinctive.

308
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,400
Alright then.

309
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Let's get down to business.

310
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,600
Are you looking to acquire his website?

311
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,760
Rather than acquiring his website,

312
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,480
I'd say

313
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,320
I'm interested in buying your copyright.

314
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,000
You see, I'm not really interested in his website.

315
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm mainly interested in your work.

316
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,040
The main reason I came today was to meet you,

317
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,960
to see if there's a chance to sign you directly,

318
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,890
to make you our contracted author.

319
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,240
I... no signing,

320
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,800
no contracts. I'm not a professional writer.

321
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
I only write because he forces me to.

322
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,930
Let's get down to business.

323
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,760
How much are you willing to pay for his website?

324
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,360
If Teacher Gu completes the serialization of his work,

325
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,240
I can offer up to 300,000.

326
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,360
No, no.

327
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,480
Miss Zhou,

328
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,080
we've done the calculations.

329
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
From the founding of this website until now,

330
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,720
we've invested nearly

331
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,800
1.3 million.

332
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,880
The logic of capital

333
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,960
is never about how much you invest,

334
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,920
but how much you're worth.

335
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,520
If Mr. Gu completes the serialization of his work,

336
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,920
I can offer up to 300,000.

337
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,680
But if you think it's not suitable,

338
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,160
then we'll stay in touch.

339
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,720
If one day your website improves,

340
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,980
you can come back to me.

341
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,340
Does that work for you?

342
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,400
Or would you rather look elsewhere?

343
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,440
Okay, okay.

344
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,400
Good.

345
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,200
Just 300,000.

346
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,360
Then my conditions must be met.

347
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,780
Mr. Gu must complete the serialization of his work.

348
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,400
Important things need to be said three times.

349
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,680
This is already the third time I'm saying it.

350
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,080
That's no problem at all.

351
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,440
Wait a moment.

352
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,480
Before you agree to her request,

353
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,280
you need to agree to one condition of mine first.

354
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,600
I'll finish writing this serial.

355
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,920
You need to fire all those

356
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,240
decorative employees

357
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,620
from your company.

358
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,490
Just keep one legal and finance person

359
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
and an assistant.

360
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,120
Will you do it?

361
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,280
I mean,

362
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,170
is that okay?

363
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,380
Just tell me if you'll do it or not.

364
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,040
Yes, I will.

365
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,360
Then I have no issues.

366
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,160
Have you really not considered becoming a professional writer?

367
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,220
No, I can't do that.

368
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,720
Being forced to write

369
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,600
is painful enough already.

370
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,280
If I had a contract binding me as well,

371
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,410
I probably wouldn't live much longer.

372
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,900
I respect that.

373
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,500
Make sure you keep your promise to me.

374
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,400
Thank you. Thank you.

375
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,760
That's enough now.

376
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,000
Let me drive you to the airport.

377
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,560
No need,

378
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,160
we can take a taxi ourselves.

379
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,320
I'm going to the mountains to feed my dogs. It's on the way.

380
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Then I won't refuse.

381
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,850
Let's go.

382
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,880
Miss Zhou.

383
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
About the dogs,

384
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,730
I'm not joking with you.

385
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,860
They're good dogs.

386
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,360
Sorry,

387
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,520
the AC in this car is broken.

388
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,280
It's fine.

389
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,320
Actually, with your talent,

390
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,850
you should be driving a Bentley or something.

391
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,280
The car you drive doesn't matter.

392
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,120
Being happy is what matters.

393
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,440
You mentioned earlier that you've worked in

394
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,040
more than 20 industries.

395
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,000
Could you elaborate on that?

396
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,840
I was a singer,

397
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,280
but not a star.

398
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,490
A nightclub singer.

399
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Really?

400
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,880
More than ten years ago, around here,

401
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,369
nightclubs were very popular.

402
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,839
In those nightclubs,

403
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,319
Cantonese songs were all the rage.

404
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,319
I sing Cantonese songs at nightclubs.

405
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,640
Could you sing a bit for us?

406
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,200
Sure.

407
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,600
Fragrant but expensive.

408
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
I'm up in the mountains.

409
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,880
I'll write it when I get home.

410
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,760
That's not what I'm calling about.

411
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,360
I just called Grandpa.

412
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
He didn't answer.

413
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,280
I'm busy right now.

414
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,880
Why don't you go check on him?

415
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,730
Alright, I understand.

416
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,800
Dad.

417
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,280
Dad.

418
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,160
Dad.

419
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,380
What are

420
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,480
you doing?

421
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,560
Why are you shaking me like that?

422
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
I was just

423
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,240
taking a nap on this old plaque.

424
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,520
You scared me sleeping like that.

425
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,250
Why are you lying on this thing?

426
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't know either.

427
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,880
How did I end up on this plaque?

428
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,560
I just had a dream

429
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,240
that Dingqing Restaurant reopened.

430
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,280
I dreamed your mother came back too.

431
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Even old Mr. Zhang returned.

432
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,560
Only your sister wasn't there.

433
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,810
Then I'll call her to come back.

434
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,000
No need.

435
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,120
How are you feeling?

436
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,760
I feel like

437
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,240
my time might be coming to an end.

438
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,560
Seventy-three to eighty-four is a critical time.

439
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,600
I'm afraid I won't make it past this hurdle.

440
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,920
Stop talking nonsense.

441
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,850
What hurdle are you talking about?

442
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,680
I know my own body.

443
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,400
At my age,

444
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,000
being able to die in my own bed

445
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,860
would be a good ending.

446
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,760
My grandchildren are all grown up,

447
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,010
my granddaughter is almost getting married.

448
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,920
I have no regrets.

449
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,100
That's enough, Dad. Stop talking, you're wasting energy.

450
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,080
I want to say a few words.

451
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,890
Are you still trying to control me?

452
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,130
Go ahead, speak.

453
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,480
If I have any regrets,

454
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,120
there is one.

455
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,320
Old Master Zhang instructed me before he died

456
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,720
to keep Dingqing Restaurant running for a hundred years.

457
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,160
To pass down this culinary craft.

458
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,760
But now,

459
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,820
Dingqing Restaurant is gone,

460
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,640
and no one in our family is in this profession.

461
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,800
I've really let Old Master Zhang down.

462
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,080
So,

463
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,840
after I'm gone,

464
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,640
burn this old signboard.

465
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,200
Half for Old Master Zhang,

466
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,720
and half for me.

467
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,170
When I'm in the underworld,

468
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,160
I'll apologize to Old Master Zhang.

469
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,640
This one,

470
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,400
keep it safe.

471
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,160
Just in case

472
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,040
someone in our family

473
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,490
wants to become a chef someday,

474
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,040
give it to them.

475
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,680
In this society,

476
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,520
no matter when,

477
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,640
we'll always need chefs.

478
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,640
People need to eat.

479
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,880
With this skill,

480
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,360
you'll never starve.

481
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,130
What are you talking about?

482
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,840
What are you doing?

483
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,120
Sounds like a last will.

484
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,560
No, but what if one day I suddenly drop dead?

485
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,680
How can there be a sound if you're dead?

486
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
A cracking sound?

487
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,720
Alright,

488
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,840
go about your business.

489
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,320
Let me rest on this old signboard

490
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,620
for a little while longer.

491
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,920
Guoming.

492
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,920
Your blonde hair looks really good. Very stylish.

493
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,760
You're the only one

494
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,290
in our family who says that.

495
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,360
Well, I am your sister after all.

496
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,160
You should dye your eyebrows too.

497
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,520
Make them blonde as well. It'll look even better.

498
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,080
Really?

499
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Trust me.

500
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,760
I'll give it a try.

501
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,400
How long can you stay this time?

502
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,440
I quit my job to come back.

503
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,440
I'll stay for a while.

504
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,200
That's great.

505
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,440
Spend more time with Dad.

506
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,120
Which district is this?

507
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,450
It's so well developed.

508
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,650
Longshan District.

509
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,740
It's even better than abroad.

510
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,560
That's why I keep saying China is so good now.

511
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,720
Why do you have to

512
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,160
stay abroad all the time?

513
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,500
There wasn't a day I didn't want to come back.

514
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,640
It's not that simple.

515
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,160
Dad always says

516
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,120
if you never return to China,

517
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,560
you're either a traitor

518
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,960
or a deserter.

519
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,640
I'm definitely not a traitor.

520
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,360
So I guess I'm a deserter.

521
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,640
You can explain that to Dad yourself.

522
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,320
Go tell him

523
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,650
that you're a deserter.

524
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,800
Fine.

525
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,580
Lying on the plaque again.

526
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,000
Dad,

527
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,000
look who's back.

528
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,820
You've taken Uncle Liu home already?

529
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,240
Yes, I have.

530
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,920
Alright then.

531
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,290
What have you been up to lately?

532
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,760
I made a website and sold it.

533
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,930
How much did you sell it for?

534
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,040
Only 300,000.

535
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,800
Have you visited your father recently?

536
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,130
I go every month.

537
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,600
In about another year,

538
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,920
he should be released.

539
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,900
Has he changed?

540
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,680
Not really.

541
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,160
Just a lot more gray hair.

542
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,760
Do you have any photos of him?

543
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,280
No.

544
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,640
Could I go see him?

545
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,450
Probably not possible.

546
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,570
Only immediate family members can visit.

547
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,730
I'm not considered immediate family?

548
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,820
Have something to eat.

549
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,640
I'm not eating today.

550
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,480
Xiaohong,

551
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
where are you?

552
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,760
No matter what others say,

553
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,840
you'll always be Mom's good child.

554
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,440
Sis,

555
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,200
come home with me.

556
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,040
Let's call him

557
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,200
Erpang,

558
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,920
okay?

559
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,880
What I promised you,

560
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,440
I will definitely make it happen.

561
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
Ms. Zhou

562
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,680
Coming!

563
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,680
What are you looking for?

564
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,260
Where's my dad?

565
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,650
He went to a meeting at the Business Administration Bureau.

566
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,040
Ms. Zhou

567
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,770
I need some soup.

568
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,040
My mom is sick.

569
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,040
Manager Cui already paid when he left.

570
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,800
The soup is cooking.

571
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,960
It'll be ready in half an hour.

572
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,760
Just wait a bit.

573
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,320
Alright.

574
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,320
Didn't you order dumplings?

575
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,440
I know.

576
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,460
I also know your name is Huo Dongfeng.

577
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,500
Do you want garlic?

578
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,730
I can peel it for you.

579
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,200
What's up?

580
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,400
Hey girl,

581
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,960
are you Cui Xiaohong?

582
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,120
Wait there,

583
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,580
I'll come down to find you.

584
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,280
Gentlemen,

585
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,040
please tell me if you need anything.

586
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,500
This doesn't concern you.

587
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,120
Shut up.

588
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,800
What a surprise,

589
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,100
running into you here.

590
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,440
You're quite famous.

591
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,680
Famous for what?

592
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,240
Beautiful, pretty, and attractive.

593
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,400
Like I need you to tell me.

594
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,400
I got two movie tickets today.

595
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,400
Look, the movie's starting.

596
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,840
We still have half an hour.

597
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,440
Come watch the movie with me.

598
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,280
Three people, two tickets.

599
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,160
How are we supposed to watch?

600
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,090
Here's the deal,

601
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,240
choose one of us.

602
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,420
I can't choose.

603
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,160
Why can't you choose?

604
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,160
I'm not interested in either of you.

605
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,120
What are you laughing at?

606
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,280
Eat your dumplings.

607
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,840
Think carefully about your choice.

608
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,500
I'm quite handsome, you know.

609
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,280
Have you finished peeling?

610
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,000
Yes.

611
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,880
What exactly are you trying to do?

612
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,840
You think this store

613
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,700
belongs to you?

614
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,760
It's my family's business.

615
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,690
My dad is the general manager here.

616
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,120
Stop talking about managers and all that nonsense.

617
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,120
I asked you to watch a movie with me

618
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,800
and now you're finding problems with it?

619
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,480
I'm going to choose today.

620
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,880
I've decided on this one.

621
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,700
What are you doing?

622
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,410
I just want to watch a movie.

623
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,280
What are you doing?

624
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,040
Let go.

625
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,900
What are you doing?

626
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
Someone come quickly!

627
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,040
Zhang!

628
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,160
Help!

629
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,360
Someone help!

630
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,480
I'll kill you!

631
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,240
Help! Somebody!

632
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,440
Murder!

633
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,520
Stop! Don't run!

634
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,720
Call for help!

635
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,480
Call for help now!

636
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,090
My name is Cui Xiaohong.

637
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,460
Where's your brother?

638
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,760
My brother?

639
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,320
I thought you were inviting me to a movie.

640
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,850
He's starting school soon.

641
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,760
Let him study instead.

642
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,520
Let's go.

643
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,000
So all the theaters around here

644
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,360
are accessible to you?

645
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,280
Don't you believe it?

646
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,520
What's wrong, bro?

647
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,050
That happened too quickly.

648
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,440
Where is he?

649
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,360
It's nothing.

650
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,840
It's fine.

651
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,490
How much did you make today?

652
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,600
This.

653
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,290
A little over 20.

654
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:39,930
Here.

655
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,400
All the money you earned today is yours.

656
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,860
Buy some food for the guys.

657
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,090
Thanks, bro.

658
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,160
Go on.

659
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:46,560
Go.

660
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:51,850
Brother,

661
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,020
what happened?

662
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,840
Perfect timing.

663
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,370
I brought you the money for the movie tickets.

664
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,840
Keep it for yourself.

665
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,480
Buy some cigarettes and drinks for the guys.

666
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,210
If you say so.

667
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,320
Here.

668
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,530
Brother, I was reading a book recently

669
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,810
called 'Beacon Fire Mocks the Lords.'

670
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,680
So you're

671
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,700
just messing with us, aren't you?

672
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,840
Had enough?

673
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,860
Stop wasting time.

674
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,600
Get to work.

675
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,360
Alright,

676
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,280
let's go.

677
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,840
Selling movie tickets?

678
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,240
Sometimes I charge five cents extra.

679
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,770
Sometimes ten cents extra.

680
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,920
Profiteering! Troublemaker!

681
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,020
Are you going to arrest me?

682
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,560
Well, you're not wrong if you put it that way.

683
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,890
But I can guarantee you.

684
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,760
People who come to these theaters

685
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,840
won't lose their money.

686
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,240
Thieves are afraid of me.

687
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,400
I'll beat any one of them.

688
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,570
I'll beat a whole gang if they come.

689
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,760
Then why am I not afraid of you?

690
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,760
It's just that when I come here to watch movies in the future,

691
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,480
I'll have face being with you.

692
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,100
That goes without saying.

693
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,800
What are we watching?

694
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,240
Shaolin Temple.

695
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,960
Why don't I just look at you instead?

696
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,160
Guoming,

697
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,000
call your dad's workplace when you get to school.

698
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,130
Okay. Pass the ball!

699
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,800
Why call?

700
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,000
Afraid I'll get lost?

701
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,160
You're the one who gets lost.

702
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,520
These past few days you told Mom and Dad

703
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,000
you were staying at a classmate's house.

704
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,840
Where were you really staying?

705
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,100
You think I don't know?

706
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,290
Where was I staying?

707
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,520
I think Huo Dongfeng

708
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,650
is a pretty good guy.

709
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,320
I admire him too.

710
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,160
But his looks,

711
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,560
he doesn't look like someone from our Cui family.

712
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,600
What do you know?

713
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,120
I don't know,

714
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,320
those people who hang out in the streets,

715
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,040
whether he is one of them.

716
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,440
He looks like...

717
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,960
When he's with you,

718
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,890
he looks like your uncle, you know?

719
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,960
That's not important.

720
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,280
What matters is he's always fighting with people.

721
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,600
If he's not fighting,

722
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,800
he's on his way to a fight.

723
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,880
Living for today with no thought of tomorrow.

724
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,240
You can admire him,

725
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,960
that's fine, but living with him?

726
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,690
Mom and Dad would be terrified.

727
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
Are you scared?

728
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,840
What would I be scared of?

729
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,320
I'm not the one dating him.

730
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,840
Then that settles it.

731
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,360
Think about it some more.

732
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,000
I've already decided. It's him.

733
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,130
As long as you're happy.

734
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,170
Thanks for your effort.

735
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,400
I think

736
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,690
you should just keep it casual.

737
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,920
Huo Dongfeng

738
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,260
You don't want us to live anymore, do you?

739
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,200
If you say I don't want you to live,

740
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,800
then I don't want you to live.

741
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,360
Others may fear you,

742
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,800
but I, Xiasi, don't fear you.

743
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,720
Get him!

744
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,500
What are you doing, Huo Dongfeng?

745
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,640
I don't feel well.

746
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,050
How much longer do we have to hide here?

747
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,530
We need to wait until things cool down.

748
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,920
The police know about my place.

749
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,580
They're waiting to ambush me.

750
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,040
Good news!

751
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,680
Are you two having more children than allowed?

755
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,800
I'm broke and can't afford food.

756
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,780
You need to eat something decent.

757
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,200
That's your problem then.

758
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,210

766
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,040
What should we do?

767
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,640
What should we do? What medicine should we take?

768
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,400
I don't know.

769
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,160
You're the doctor.

771
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,460

772
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,760
