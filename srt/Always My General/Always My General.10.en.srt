00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,350
[Always My General]

00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,140
[Episode 10]

3
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,870
Are they still waiting outside?

4
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,900
Your Majesty,

5
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,220
the two princes have been kneeling outside the door.

6
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,200
They wish to confirm your physical

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,620
[Eunuch Yungong]

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,090
condition and well-being.

9
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,280
I'm afraid what they want to confirm

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,240
is not my health,

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,650
but rather

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,590
who will ultimately be chosen

13
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,390
as the Crown Prince.

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,690
Tell them to come in.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,460
Yes.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,710
Announce!

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,870
Two princes, come and meet His Majesty.

18
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,380
Father!

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,190
Father.

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,530
Father.

21
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,830
I was deceived by Zhao Lie,

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,680
the treacherous official.

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,320
I failed to save you in time during the crisis.

24
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,430
It almost led to a great disaster.

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,600
I humbly request your punishment, Father.

26
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,530
Brother, when you received the fake imperial edict from Zhao Lie,

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,750
you didn't act like this.

28
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,720
Not only did you move into the Eastern Palace,

29
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,960
but you also thought about taking a Crown Princess for yourself.

30
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,580
You...

31
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,010
Hanzhi, there's no need for sarcasm here.

32
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,190
You brought troops without authorization,

33
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,190
stormed into the palace,

34
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,430
and slaughtered indiscriminately.

35
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,780
You killed Zhao Lie and his eunuchs,

36
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,240
wiping them out completely.

37
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,750
You claim it was to protect the king,

38
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,940
but who knows

39
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,340
if it was really to silence them?

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,420
Enough!

41
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,220
I was nearly harmed by treacherous officials

42
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,500
in my own palace.

43
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,440
The smell of blood outside the Imperial Study

44
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,979
has not yet dissipated.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,410
You two brothers,

46
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,840
for the title of Crown Prince,

47
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,430
openly compete and secretly scheme.

48
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,610
Do you even have

49
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,870
me, your father in your eyes?

50
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,419
I know my fault, Father.

51
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,530
Remember,

52
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:11,520
what I give you

53
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,140
is yours.

54
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,250
What I don't give,

55
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,730
you cannot take by force.

56
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,210
Years ago,

57
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,180
the late king set up a chess game

58
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,790
by the Jade Pool in the palace gardens.

59
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,650
I racked my brains

60
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,880
and thought for an entire night

61
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,120
to barely win by half a point.

62
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,100
Only then did I secure the throne of Northern Zhao.

63
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,750
Tomorrow at noon,

64
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,090
by the Jade Pool in the palace garden,

65
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,800
it will be your turn, you two brothers,

66
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,420
to compete against each other.

67
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,260
Whoever wins

68
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,460
will be worthy of the Eastern Palace.

69
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,200
Yes.

70
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,730
The Chess Sage's endgame?

71
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,780
That's right.

72
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,680
The late king was obsessed with the art of chess.

73
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,180
Whenever there was a major decision to be made,

74
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,560
he would always play against the Chess Sage,

75
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,520
seeking inspiration.

76
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,370
That endgame is what they left behind.

77
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,350
It is said

78
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,970
to be profound and unfathomable.

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,600
If we use this game as the focal point,

80
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,480
who the final winner will be

81
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,570
is hard to say.

82
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,390
Perhaps His Majesty set up this chess game

83
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,180
without wanting there to be a winner at all.

84
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:17,980
Why?

85
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,170
A ruler fears most the loss of power to others.

86
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,750
The right to appoint the Crown Prince

87
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,079
must be held in his own hands alone

88
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,680
for His Majesty to feel at ease.

89
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,170
The title of heir apparent

90
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,550
is soaked in the blood of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry soldiers.

91
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,930
I have no way to retreat now.

92
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,010
Early tomorrow morning,

93
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,630
I will bring the elite imperial guards.

94
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,530
What was lost on the chessboard

95
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,560
must be won back in reality.

96
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,020
The chess game is like a battlefield,

97
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,470
each move like deploying troops.

98
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,100
You only need to bring me.

99
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,990
We'll enter the game together,

100
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,100
and leave them with nothing.

101
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,829
I'll have Si bring a chessboard.

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,890
Tonight,

103
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,620
let's play a few games first.

104
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,150
Shang Kefeng changed faces with the Eldest Prince,

105
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,210
stirring up the Northern Zhao court.

106
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,010
I bear the responsibility for all of this.

107
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,890
It's time to settle things with him once and for all.

108
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
[Jade Pool in the palace garden]

109
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,100
A thousand-layer treasure tower within a game within a game,

110
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,460
a tidal wave rising from the source, a strategy within a strategy.

111
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,240
This chess game is like a battle formation.

112
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,209
Can Xu Hanzhi and I alone

113
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,300
really solve this puzzle?

114
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,920
This Chess Sage's endgame

115
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,500
is a test for becoming the Crown Prince.

116
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,350
Young Master Xue,

117
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,030
not satisfied with manipulating Dengying Tower,

118
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,350
do you now set your sights

119
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,750
on the kingdom of Northern Zhao as well?

120
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,159
Are you seriously acting as the Crown Prince and believing it to be true?

121
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,000
Aren't you afraid I'll expose your identity in public?

122
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,620
Go ahead.

123
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,020
While you expose my identity,

124
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,280
the news that the rebel Zhou Chu

125
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,890
is still alive

126
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,140
will also instantly reach the ears of the King of Northern Zhao.

127
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,310
When that happens,

128
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,260
how will you deal with the consequences?

129
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,600
You touched someone you shouldn't have with your dirty hands.

130
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,380
Do you know how this will end?

131
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,010
Your Highnesses,

132
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,480
since you're both here,

133
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,130
let's begin the game.

134
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,070
My father is the one who set this up.

135
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,390
He's not here yet.

136
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,800
How dare we start without him?

137
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,470
Your Highness,

138
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,490
since Zhao Lie's rebellion,

139
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,180
His Majesty hasn't left the Imperial Study.

140
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,530
The results of this match

141
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,920
will all be

142
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,409
relayed by me to His Majesty.

143
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,190
If the yin-yang fish faces downward,

144
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,320
the Eldest Prince will go first.

145
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,409
Vice versa.

146
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,460
The second prince moves first.

147
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,180
Limited to 3 hours.

148
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,380
The game begins.

149
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,610
[Dream of Jade Pool]

150
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,720
How did I end up here?

151
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,790
Xu Hanzhi!

152
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,180
General?

153
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,980
We all faced death countless times,

154
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,630
only to return victorious.

155
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,850
Why were you named heir apparent,

156
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,010
while we were wrongly slaughtered?

157
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,120
This must be an illusion.

158
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,180
What did Shang Kefeng do

159
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,120
to the chessboard?

160
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,060
An illusion?

161
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,520
The soldiers of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry

162
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,340
were tragically surrounded and shot in the fortified city.

163
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,730
Thirteen captains fell before my eyes, one by one.

164
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,160
Their hot blood

165
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,690
in your eyes, is just an illusion?

166
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,440
Then tell me, Xu Hanzhi,

167
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,230
what is real in your eyes?

168
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,920
Time is running out.

169
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,120
Your Highness,

170
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,200
please make your move quickly.

171
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,140
This is not good.

172
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,360
He's fallen under an illusion.

173
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,300
His Highness is unwell.

174
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,620
We must stop the game.

175
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,470
How dare you!

176
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,480
This chess game

177
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,740
is a battle for the royal succession.

178
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,350
Where did this insignificant person come from,

179
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,190
daring to speak out of turn here?

180
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,860
Guards!

181
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,890
Seize him!

182
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:37,780
Yes!

183
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:39,800
Let's go!

184
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,310
Xu Hanzhi.

185
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,200
Xu Hanzhi.

186
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,000
Xu Hanzhi!

187
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,430
If we let Xue Shisan continue to cause trouble,

188
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,290
her true identity will be revealed.

189
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,430
Rather than letting her give her life to the King of Northern Zhao,

190
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,850
it's better to lure her into the illusion

191
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,710
and subdue her there.

192
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,930
All of you, withdraw.

193
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,470
I know

194
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,350
you have my second brother's deep trust.

195
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,220
Having you play on his behalf

196
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,159
is not entirely unacceptable.

197
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,240
However,

198
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,780
this chess game concerns the fate of Northern Zhao's kingdom,

199
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,780
as well as his future.

200
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,380
Such a heavy responsibility,

201
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,930
can you bear it?

202
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,960
As long as Your Highness is not afraid of losing,

203
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,680
I, Shisan, will do my duty without hesitation.

204
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,210
You think I will lose?

205
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,070
If Your Highness accepts,

206
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,330
I, your humble servant,

207
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,040
dare not say more.

208
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,980
Please proceed.

209
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,679
Xue Shisan.

210
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,419
You're no better than this.

211
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,950
You can't escape Zhou Chu's fate either.

212
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,650
You want to help Xu Hanzhi.

213
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:43,039
Then help him thoroughly.

214
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,280
Our oath of brotherhood

215
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,270
in Yaozhou City was real.

216
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,930
My love for you

217
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
is also real.

218
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,750
I originally wanted to help him,

219
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,820
but unexpectedly,

220
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,140
we ended up as star-crossed lovers.

221
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,710
Zhou Chu.

222
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,930
Knowing before I die

223
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,600
that your feelings for me were genuine,

224
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,390
I can die without regrets.

225
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,410
In our next life,

226
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,500
let's be together again.

227
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,880
General.

228
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,780
General.

229
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,570
General!

230
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,350
Zhou Chu is already dead.

231
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,340
What's the point of living anymore?

232
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,000
If we can't live together,

233
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,600
we shall die together!

234
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,250
For the rest of my life, I will witness all the clouds and the moon,

235
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,570
never failing you,

236
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,820
always my general.

237
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,060
Put yourself in a desperate situation to find a way out.

238
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,140
The fifth and sixth ranks,

239
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,510
securing the general’s head.

240
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,650
♫Sudden smoke rises♫

241
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,150
♫Through the precariously collapsing city walls♫

242
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,830
Time's up.

243
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,500
White pieces win.

244
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,730
Prince Yu wins.

245
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:13,260
♫Tearing through the night♫

246
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,270
Congratulations on reclaiming the Eastern Palace, Your Highness.

247
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,250
Then I

248
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,550
shall take my leave first.

249
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,210
♫Suddenly taking the lead, secretly stealing♫

250
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:24,550
♫Beneath the feather fan, people's hearts are dark, fading away in smoke♫

251
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,580
By His Majesty's verbal decree,

252
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,940
the player who takes the first move

253
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,020
among the two princes

254
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,440
has not been able to complete the game,

255
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,750
and the one who completes the game

256
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,560
♫How is fate rewritten?♫

257
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,350
cannot yet be said to have won.

258
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,600
Therefore, the position of Crown Prince

259
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:33,030
will be decided after I give it further consideration.

260
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:38,830
♫Who can compete with the heroes of the world?♫

261
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:33,860
However,

262
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,040
Xue Shisan has shown loyalty in protecting his master,

263
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,240
demonstrated superior chess skills,

264
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,820
and exhibited exceptional courage.

265
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,560
He is hereby promoted to the commander of the imperial guards,

266
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,430
♫The chaos of conquest♫

267
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,610
to guard the imperial palace.

268
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,010
From now on,

269
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,630
♫Is all due to my strategic game of deception♫

270
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,950
he will be under my command.

271
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,740
This is my decree.

272
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,970
♫The heavens are silent♫

273
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,550
I, Xue Shisan, accept the decree.

274

♫In the chaos, donning armor, with swords and horses♫

00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,050
♫Are just broken spears lost in the waves♫

277
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,510
I apologize, Your Highness,

278
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,580
but please hand over the imperial guards' commander's tally.

279
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:12,650
♫Centuries of bloodshed♫

Xue Shisan,

282
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,990
what exactly are you trying to do?
