[Episode 23]

3
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,930
[Post Station on the Outskirts of Yaozhou City]

4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,060
I told you

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,570
this deal couldn't be done.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,580
You should've listened to me long ago.

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:28,820
You ugly freak!

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,850
Are you looking for death?

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:34,730
Stop hitting him!

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,680
Stop hitting him!

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,070
Don't you know what day it is?

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:37,890
What day?

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,480
The new king is about to ascend the throne.

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,370
Let's hurry into the city now.

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,980
We might still

16
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,000
catch the new king's procession.

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,800
Let's go. Let's go.

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:46,960
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,160
We'll meet again.

20
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,980
How long has he been taken away?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,420
Less than an hour.

22
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,120
According to the informant,

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,280
the Eldest Prince

24
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,830
has been hidden by Xu Hanzhi.

25
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,490
Xu Hanzhi?

26
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,660
Wasn't he killed by Xue Shisan?

27
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,220
Your Highness,

28
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,750
it's not the first time this woman has deceived you.

29
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,310
Xue Shisan,

30
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,460
you betrayed me.

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,160
I will make you beg for death!

32
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,500
I will make you all die with me!

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,320
Get lost.

34
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,080
Find that useless piece of trash for me!

35
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:47,979
Yes!

36
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:48,930
Sir,

37
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,530
Northern Rong sent a pigeon with a message.

38
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,090
General Shang,

39
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,370
the antidote has been prepared.

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,460
Hurry back.

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,520
Xue Shisan,

42
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,820
Xu Hanzhi,

43
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,750
you gave me a chance to be reborn.

44
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,520
Where am I?

45
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,100
What happened?

46
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,300
At the enthronement ceremony,

47
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,130
Shang Kefeng used you as a decoy,

48
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,400
while he himself disappeared.

49
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,110
I remember that day,

50
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,480
I ran out,

51
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,380
and then I was captured by him.

52
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,500
After that…

53
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,810
I don't remember anything.

54
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,300
Then, at your enthronement ceremony,

55
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,680
announce to the whole world

56
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,510
that I am your queen.

57
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,320
Under your throne,

58
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,620
I won't need to wear armor.

59
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,270
For you, I want to...

60
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,700
Xue Shisan,

61
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,520
Xu Hanzhi,

62
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,660
just you wait.

63
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,160
I'll be back.

64
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,940
Crown Prince Xu Hanzhi,

65
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,630
by the will of Heaven,

66
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:58,440
has ascended to become the new ruler of Northern Zhao.

67
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,760
This is a grand event for the nation,

68
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,170
celebrated by the heavens and earth.

69
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,740
[National Agreement]

70
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,820
After the alliance is formed,

71
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,060
the lords of Southern Yue and Northern Zhao decided

72
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,900
that the two countries will be equal and mutually beneficial,

73
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,880
with no more wars or conflicts.

74
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,089
The alliance agreement is easy to sign,

75
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,870
but it's difficult to uphold in the long run.

76
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,839
Fifteen years ago,

77
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,630
my father

78
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,890
also signed a vassal treaty with your father,

79
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,200
but in the end,

80
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,560
he died on the way back from the tribute mission.

81
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,370
There's no need to bring up the past.

82
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,980
If you think that

83
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,409
only exchanging princes as hostages between the two countries

84
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,590
is the proper way to go,

85
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,530
it's not impossible.

86
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,930
Hanzhi, you must be joking.

87
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,909
You don't even have a queen.

88
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,740
You don't have a son to be my hostage.

89
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,110
How about

90
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,250
sending your brother to fill the role instead?

91
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,310
For the two countries to form good relations,

92
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,710
I can accept it.

93
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,340
You really should visit Southern Yue.

94
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,180
Last time,

95
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,370
you were coerced by Shang Kefeng

96
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,640
using poison.

97
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:58,050
Though the poison was neutralized,

98
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,610
it would be better to remove the root cause.

99
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,660
In Southern Yue,

100
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,830
we have not only miraculous medicines that can cure all poisons,

101
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,220
but also wonderful landscapes, talents,

102
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,350
beauties, delicacies, and scenery

103
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,590
that are unlike those in Northern Zhao.

104
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,190
I won't make you a hostage.

105
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,100
We can

106
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,410
be relatives instead.

107
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,360
Wouldn't that be nice?

108
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,730
Your Majesty, that's a good idea.

109
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,140
Since our two cities are brothers,

110
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,200
why not

111
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,840
strengthen our ties with a royal marriage,

112
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,200
making us even closer?

113
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,230
Very well.

114
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:25,880
Very well?

115
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,070
Well then,

116
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,950
in the capacity of the elder brother,

117
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,000
and on behalf of Northern Zhao,

118
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,630
I want to propose marriage between our king and Princess Xue Shisan.

119
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,370
Wait.

120
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,120
It should be...

121
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,290
General

122
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,960
Zhou Chu.

123
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,730
No.

124
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,520
It should be...

125
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,659
Princess Yunze of Southern Yue.

126
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:43,710
That's inappropriate.

127
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,210
If we make such a hasty decision,

128
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,430
Shisan will be angry.

129
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,120
My brothers of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry,

130
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,450
I, Zhou Chu, am here to see you.

131
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,480
Now, in Northern Zhao,

132
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,910
the war has stopped,

133
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,840
and all the treacherous officials have been eliminated.

134
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,970
But Shang Kefeng is nowhere to be found.

135
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,000
As long as I haven't avenged you,

136
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,330
I can't sleep a wink

137
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,760
or face you.

138
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,050
We hereby swear

139
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,050
to become sworn brothers!

140
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,690
From now on,

141
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,330
we shall stand by each other through life and death,

142
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,640
with utmost loyalty and trust!

143
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,590
Though we, the thirteen warriors of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry,

144
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,800
were not born together,

145
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,990
we will die together!

146
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,100
We were not born together,

147
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,940
but we will die together!

148
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,260
We were not born together,

149
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,310
but we will die together!

150
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,770
Among us who made the oath back then,

151
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,070
only Hanzhi and I remain.

152
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,090
I miss you all so much.

153
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,660
This year has felt as long as a lifetime.

154
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,320
I went from a fallen general

155
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,900
to a waitress in a restaurant,

156
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,520
then from a general of Northern Zhao

157
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,220
to a princess of Southern Yue.

158
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,720
At this moment,

159
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,270
I don't know what identity to use to face you guys.

160
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,020
Whether you are Zhou Chu or Xue Shisan,

161
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,310
whether you are General Yunhui

162
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,400
or the Young Princess of Southern Yue,

163
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,770
I will never change.

164
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,200
Chief General Zhou Chu of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry,

165
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,280
receive the decree!

166
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,370
I, Zhou Chu, am listening.

167
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,170
The soldiers of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry made outstanding contributions,

168
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,610
showing unmatched loyalty and courage.

169
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,070
They repelled powerful enemies

170
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,600
and sacrificed themselves to protect the nation.

171
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,060
They were wrongly accused and humiliated in the past,

172
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,000
and now, a national memorial tomb is being established in their honor.

173
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,020
This is to announce to the world

♫The world is sorrowful, and we met by chance♫

175

will be protected by me.

you can rest in peace.

to ask the brothers

189
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,100
in the underworld to witness something.

190
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,500
♫For twenty years, I abandoned my identity to become a bandit♫

191
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,940
I want to propose marriage to Xue Shisan to make her my queen.

192
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,200
From now on, we shall be united in heart and soul,

193
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,540
♫On Ximo River, who was left alone?♫

194
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,570
and never part in life or death.

195
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,030
Though I am a king,

196
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,900
I swear to be loyal and devoted to her,

197
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,030
and never take another wife.

198
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,420
Brothers in the underworld, please bear witness for me.

199
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:21,170
♫Reality, piece by piece, shattered the little hope I have left♫

200
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,820
♫Cold blades layer upon layer, curling up the glimpse of heaven I once saw♫

201
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,460
♫The letter has long turned yellow, leaving only two lines of tears in silence♫

202
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,930
♫Time has weathered our old home♫

203
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,670
♫Swallows in pairs make me envious♫

204
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,180
♫Every scene in my dreams is a place I can never reach♫

205
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,980
♫You're resting beneath yellow earth, with your bones dissolving, while I, in the mortal world, am covered in snow♫

206
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,940
♫What do you look like now?♫
