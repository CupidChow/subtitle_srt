Only by tasting them personally

can one tell the difference.

112
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,310
But testers usually fall into two extremes—

113
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,300
either they can only tell the truth,

114
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,030
or their internal organs are torn apart, and they die instantly.

I knew it from the very beginning.

166

Looking at people is never done with the eyes,

171
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,090
I know you didn't mean to hurt my eyes.

172
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,630
That was because of the secret technique,

173
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,600
right?

174
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,040
I also know that all you care about is revenge,

175
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,980
but please don't push me away,

176
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,850
okay?

177
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,020
Okay.

178
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,350
It's the feeling of my internal organs being torn apart.

179
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,300
I found it.

180
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,700
Be careful.

181
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,680
Xu Hanzhi,

182
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,090
do you still hate me?

183
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,330
I never have.

184
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,360
You ate the Autumn Frost Grass,

185
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,480
and now your internal organs are torn apart.

186
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,180
What if you die?

187
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,550
I tested the medicine for you

188
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,190
and found the antidote.

189
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,140
I'll die without regret.

190
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,110
Die without regret?

191
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,330
You make it sound easy.

192
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,220
If I die,

193
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,040
would you be sad?

194
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,670
No.

195
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,490
Because I won't let you die.

196
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,690
Then I have one more question.

197
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,530
Do you have me in your heart?

198
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,460
Back then, I used the Southern Yue secret technique to restore your appearance,

199
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,150
but I left this slave mark,

200
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,620
just to remind you of your place.

201
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,390
No.

202
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,090
Tomorrow morning, when he wakes up,

203
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,870
his vision will be restored.

204
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,570
I have to say something to you.

205
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,980
You are in worse condition than Xu Hanzhi,

206
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,900
yet you were running around looking for a cure for him.

207
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
The poison in your body

208
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,770
has already entered your veins.

209
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,000
Can you worry about your own safety?

210
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,580
As long as he recovers.

211
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,470
It doesn't matter.

212
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,610
You...

213
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,360
If you

214
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,300
survive the next two days,

215
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,320
you should

216
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,500
go to Southern Yue.

217
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,500
Their royal family

218
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,180
has a way to cure your poison.

219
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,790
However,

220
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,030
it's just a rumor.

221
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,080
The chances are slim.

222
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,500
If it doesn't work,

223
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,320
next year I'll pull the grass off your grave.

224
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,750
Thank you, Sir.

225
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,150
It's just a small favor.

226
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,360
You may leave now.

227
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,350
Just leave Si here.

228
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,120
Yes.

229
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,900
Yes.

230
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,670
What are you doing?
