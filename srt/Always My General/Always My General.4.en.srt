1
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,280
[Always My General]

2
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,000
[Episode 4]

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:18,760
Give it to me.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,190
Don't touch it.

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,140
I'll hold it for you.

6
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,080
Eldest Prince has arrived.

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,760
That woman ran into this room.

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,470
Are you sure?

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,390
Yes.

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,850
I was wondering why Dengying Tower

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,030
is so lively today,

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,300
turns out it's because my royal brother is here.

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,750
Is there

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,980
anything I can do for you?

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,530
Your Highness, you are too kind.

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,770
The Minister

17
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,580
has been my teacher for ten years,

18
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,080
but he was tragically murdered last night here at Dengying Tower.

19
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,610
I'm here to investigate the case,

20
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,590
and while I'm here,

21
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,530
I want to ask you for an explanation.

22
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,760
Explanation?

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The Ministry of Justice

24
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,220
hasn't concluded the case of the Minister's death yet.

25
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,210
What explanation can I give you?

26
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,739
If the Crown Prince won't give me an explanation,

27
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,070
then I'll

28
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,470
find one myself.

29
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,470
Greetings, Your Highness.

30
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,620
That night,

31
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,530
the woman in front of the Minister's body

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,710
was you, right?

33
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,360
What's your name?

34
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,430
My name

35
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,350
is Xue Shisan.

36
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,060
Take her away.

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,860
Who dares?

38
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,350
What?

39
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:47,970
Your Highness,

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,670
now you can give me an explanation?

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,640
The Minister died

42
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,870
by self-immolation

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,400
because someone put

44
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,680
a Red Flame Scarab in his wine.

45
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,220
And within the Northern Zhao,

46
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,000
the only ones who use these insects as a fire source

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,920
to create weapons

48
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,550
are the Jet Black Armored Cavalry.

49
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,780
If I remember correctly,

50
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,590
before Your Highness became Crown Prince,

51
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,640
you were a member of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry, right?

52
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,410
But after His Highness became Crown Prince,

53
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,150
the Jet Black Armored Cavalry was gone,

54
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,390
and thousands of military families lost their loved ones.

55
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,360
Someone used their methods

56
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,400
to kill within the Crown Prince's private territory for revenge.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,140
It wouldn't be strange, would it?

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,030
Shut up.

59
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,190
He actually blocked the blade for me.

60
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,750
You barged into my place with your men

61
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,730
and hit my maid for no reason.

62
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,070
Brother,

63
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,110
are you trying to declare war on me?

64
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,590
I've already

65
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,070
made myself clear.

66
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,070
As for the murderer,

67
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,680
you can investigate that yourself.

68
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,290
But if you keep making a scene,

69
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,490
I'll make sure Father hears about

70
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,290
your attempt to harm me.

71
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,540
You...

72
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,250
Don't try to use Father to pressure me.

73
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,600
The debts between us,

74
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,400
I will settle

75
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,030
all the scores with you, one by one.

76
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,950
Let's go.

77
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,690
Because you're so weak and soft-hearted,

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,030
Xu Hanzhi didn't die from the poison.

79
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,579
That just proves your poison isn't as effective as you think.

80
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,140
I'm still alive, aren't I?

81
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,350
You are alive

82
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,900
because I gave you the deadliest poison,

83
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,770
the one that can counter every other poison.

84
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,850
Without it,

85
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,250
you'd already be dead.

86
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,610
I suggest you follow our plan.

87
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,000
This poison can save you,

88
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,980
but it can also kill you.

89
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,110
Be wise about it.

90
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,850
Today,

91
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,570
thanks to Your Highness's quick thinking,

92
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:58,280
otherwise,

93
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,780
my life would be in danger.

94
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,520
It was careless of me

95
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,910
to speak recklessly about the Jet Black Armored Cavalry

96
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,680
in front of Your Highness.

97
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,710
Who exactly are you?

98
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,430
You're so smart that it makes me feel dangerous.

99
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,680
Your Highness...

100
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,680
I'm already used to living in constant danger.

101
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,680
Instead of getting rid of the danger,

102
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,590
I'm more curious about who you are.

103
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,280
It doesn't matter who I am.

104
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,870
What matters is

105
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,280
how I feel about Your Highness.

106
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,100
Xu Hanzhi,

107
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,380
you can't escape this time.

108
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,800
You know who I'm thinking of.

109
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,790
Jet Black Armored Cavalry.

110
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,500
[Dengying Tower]

111
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,110
Since you talked about the Jet Black Armored Cavalry twice,

112
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,460
you must've heard about it.

113
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,280
Rumor has it that

114
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,830
I did anything, even sacrifice my comrades' lives,

115
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,390
to secure

116
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,110
the Crown Prince's position.

117
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,360
Pretentious.

118
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,110
Xu Hanzhi.

119
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,290
Well,

120
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,100
every time I see you,

121
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,450
I feel a strange sense of comfort.

122
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,370
[Dengying Tower]

123
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,600
It's as if

124
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,390
my General didn't die,

125
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,530
and the Jet Black Armored Cavalry is still around.

126
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,630
[Dengying Tower]

127
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,490
You slept soundly.

128
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,560
This needle should wake you up.

129
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,250
Here's

130
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,610
what you'll be dealing with today.

131
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,780
Let's start with a thick needle.

132
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,850
Ever since you walked into this Dengying Tower,

133
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,870
my life's been nothing but trouble.

134
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,640
The Crown Prince aws ambushed at the watchtower,

135
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,970
yet you didn't even get a scratch.

136
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:36,800
Spill it!

137
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,700
Who sent you here as a spy?

138
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,980
Xu Hanzhi.

139
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,680
-You're lucky this time.
-You're not going to tell me?

140
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,960
Are you going to tell me or not?

141
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:44,960
No.

142
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,790
Madam Rong!

143
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,460
Darn it, Si!

144
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,960
Who do you think you are?

145
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,750
I'll teach you a lesson today.

146
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,680
Hurry.

147
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,190
Go.

148
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,240
Go find the Crown Prince.

149
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,409
Don't worry about me!

150
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,560
Hurry!

151
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,610
Xue Shisan,

152
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,820
you're in my hands now,

153
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,630
not even God can help you today!

154
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,930
I have to put up with this despicable lady,

155
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,020
otherwise, all my efforts will be in vain.

156
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,120
It was too dangerous last night.

157
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,040
From now on, wherever you go,

158
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,750
you should take me with you.

159
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,130
Where is Xue Shisan?

160
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,640
She's locked up in the storeroom,

161
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,470
waiting for Your Highness to decide what to do with her.

162
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,890
What happened last night has nothing to do with her.

163
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,330
Bring her here.

164
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,970
Yes, Your Highness.

165
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,150
Lord Han.

166
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:39,390
Lord Han!

167
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,750
Lord Han!

168
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,670
Your Highness.

169
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:42,950
Hurry!

170
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,980
Please help Shisan.

171
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,530
You're pretty tough with your words.

172
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,180
I bet you went through a lot of training

173
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,200
before taking on this undercover mission.

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,710
Do you know that you're fat and ugly?

175
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,090
Do you have any idea

176
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,240
what you look like?

177
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,130
I'll stab you to death today!

178
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,360
Madam Rong.

179
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,490
How dare you

180
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,320
to make a scene here?

181
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,790
Lord Han.

182
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,370
Help me!

183
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,180
Someone from the Jet Black Armored Cavalry is still alive?

184
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,500
That's great.

185
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,390
I have to find him

186
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,460
and keep him safe,

187
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,180
so the same mistake won't happen again.

188
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,720
But if there's a survivor from the Jet Black Armored Cavalry,

189
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,370
why would he shoot at the General?

190
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,170
She can't be the General.

191
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:32,980
Your Highness.

192
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,330
It's my fault.

193
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,320
I just wanted Madam Rong

194
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,390
to keep an eye on her,

195
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:37,820
but didn't expect she'd punish her without permission.

196
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,460
I've already beaten her for you.

197
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,000
Go beat her again!

198
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,600
Yes, Your Highness.

199
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:46,960
Come here.

200
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,880
Isn't this gunpowder from the Jet Black Armored Cavalry?

201
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,020
-Is there still a survivor left from the Jet Black Armored Cavalry?
-Is there still a survivor left from the Jet Black Armored Cavalry?

202
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,040
Did you notice anything?

203
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,040
I was just wondering

204
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,110
how such a tiny bullet

205
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,180
could have so much power.

206
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,440
Besides,

207
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,640
why would Your Highness risk your life

208
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,220
to save me in such a critical moment?

209
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,140
Maybe it's because of your face.

210
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,370
When I was in the army,

211
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,630
I'd always be ready

212
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,240
to protect my General from anything,

213
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,090
even if it meant sacrificing myself.

214
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,880
But when he needed me most,

215
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,890
I let him down.

216
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,340
This isn't your concern anymore.

217
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
Go to the clinic

218
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,570
and bring me some medicine for external wounds.

219
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:04,840
Yes, Your Highness.

220
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,060
Wait.

221
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,680
Also, grab some herbs from the doctor

222
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,840
and treat your own wounds

223
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,930
while you're there.

224
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,000
Those needle marks on your hands

225
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,540
are quite disturbing.

226
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,420
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

227
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,900
You're hiding something from me.

228
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,120
Not telling you

229
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,870
and hiding it from you are two different things.

230
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,670
Back at Dengying Tower,

231
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,960
you didn't tell me there was still a survivor from the Jet Black Armored Cavalry!

232
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,270
I ran into him while searching for you by the river.

233
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,140
He had been slashed and had his eyes blinded.

234
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,430
I know who you are.

235
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,320
You're the pathetic leader of the Southern Yue army!

236
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,250
Don't think you can take advantage of my misfortune

237
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,630
to set traps for me!

238
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,810
So what?

239
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,830
It's not easy to shave off the rotten flesh from your face.

240
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,020
If you make a move now,

241
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,340
you'll lose

242
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,240
more than just one eye,

243
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,350
but your life.

244
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,820
You're just a disabled soldier

245
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,010
betrayed by your own vice general.

246
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,180
You're already in such a terrible state.

247
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,500
Do you really think I need to set traps for you?

248
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,230
Get your head straight.

249
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,170
The war between Southern Yue and Northern Zhao is over.

250
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,860
Northern Zhao is your battlefield.

251
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,110
Xu Hanzhi is your enemy.

252
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,890
Don't you want

253
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,790
to avenge your comrades and general?

254
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,040
Is there anyone else alive?

255
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,190
No.

256
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,140
Where can I find him?

257
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,070
He's in the south of the city,

258
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,000
at a bathhouse where bandits like to hang out.

259
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,440
The Crown Prince's men

260
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,210
are probably searching the whole city for him.

261
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,250
I suggest you don't walk right into this trap.

262
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,500
[South City Bathhouse]

263
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,570
I came to your esteemed place

264
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,540
for an old friend named He.

265
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,230
I hope you gentlemen

266
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,470
will show me some understanding.

267
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,510
Understanding for what?

268
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,080
How did a woman get in here?

269
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,160
Get out of here!

270
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,770
My best friends

271
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,660
are waiting for me in heaven.

272
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,760
Who are you?

273
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,740
Who am I?

274
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,110
Thirteen sworn brothers from Yaozhou City,

275
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,810
Zhou Chu.

276
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,400
General Zhou?
