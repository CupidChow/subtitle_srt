[Always My General]

2
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,700
[Episode 19]

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,440
Here are two cups of wine.

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,870
One is poisoned, and the other is not.

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,360
Let fate decide.

6
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,410
What are you doing?

7
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:40,860
Shisan,

8
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,420
After the fortified city incident,

9
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,920
my heart became harder than iron,

10
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,010
and I've been focusing only on avenging my brothers.

11
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,340
But then you appeared,

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,020
rekindling the fire in my heart.

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,070
♫The world is sorrowful, and we met by chance♫

14
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,500
I cannot bear losing you again.

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,459
♫The matters of the mortal world are trivial; I'm sleeping in the land of Eternals♫

16
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,370
This time, let me die for you.

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,850
♫In dreams, mountain flowers shine like jade♫

18
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,480
Xu Hanzhi,

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,070
why are you being so foolish?

20
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,250
♫I only long for the return of an old friend♫

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,890
♫The flying dragon blocked the clouds and sunlight♫

22
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,430
♫A startled swan chases, breaking through snow♫

23
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,980
Another pair of lovesick fools.

24
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:28,900
This wine...

25
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,880
♫For twenty years, I abandoned my identity to become a bandit♫

26
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,670
isn't poisoned.

27
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,500
♫On Ximo River, who was left alone?♫

28
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,380
♫Reality, piece by piece, shattered the little hope I have left♫

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,920
♫You're resting beneath yellow earth, with your bones dissolving, while I, in the mortal world, am covered in snow♫

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,310
♫What do you look like now?♫

31
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,229
Since I ascended to the throne,

32
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,539
I have had no intention of war.

33
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,240
All I want is to protect my homeland

34
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,500
and let my people live in peace.

35
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,170
After the battle at the Northern Border,

36
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,160
Shang Kefeng slipped out of my control.

37
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,620
His ambitions are plain to see.

38
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,550
As for what he's done in your Northern Zhao,

39
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,020
I've heard bits and pieces.

40
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,900
I have no intention of being an enemy to Northern Zhao,

41
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,870
nor do I want

42
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,550
to be involved in this conflict.

43
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,350
Since you don't want to get involved,

44
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,060
then please give me the antidote,

45
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,570
and I'll deal with him for you.

46
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,770
I can't help you.

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,670
Why?

48
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,820
This poison is a secret technique from your royal family.

49
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,500
Who else can I ask

50
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,760
but you?

51
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,900
It's not that I don't want to help you,

52
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,900
but it's...

53
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,050
not convenient for me to do so.

54
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,329
While there's still time,

55
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,220
you'd better cherish

56
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,840
the moments you have together.

57
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,829
Don't end up like me,

58
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,930
regretting half a lifetime.

59
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,300
This is the hair dye that King Linyuan sent.

60
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,750
Dyeing your hair will make you look more lively.

61
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,650
Does white hair make me look bad?

62
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,760
You look good with both black and white hair.

63
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,150
Tomorrow, I'll go find King Linyuan again.

64
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,710
I don't understand.

65
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,010
Why does he clearly want to help us,

66
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,270
but refuse to help us?

67
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,480
Your Highness, why did you

68
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,670
call me here alone?

69
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,600
Take General Yunhui and leave.

70
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,790
Leave Southern Yue

71
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,920
and don't return to Northern Zhao.

72
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,300
In her final days,

73
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,370
stay by her side.

74
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,880
Though this pill

75
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,150
can't cure her poison,

76
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,190
it will make her last moments

77
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,450
less painful.

78
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,870
Your Highness, why don't you just

79
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,800
give us the antidote directly?

80
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,550
Perhaps, even if I were willing,

81
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,000
you wouldn't be.

82
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,520
What do you mean?

83
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,760
Southern Yue is surrounded

84
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,850
by powerful enemies.

85
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,980
To protect our clan, the royal family

86
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,280
has studied poison control and manipulation techniques for generations,

87
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,340
eventually leading to

88
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,780
our blood becoming the current Qilin Blood, which is immune to all poisons.

89
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,920
The Qilin Blood

90
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,870
is the only way to cure this poison.

91
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,960
To cure the poison,

92
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,610
one must either possess the Qilin Blood

93
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,310
or

94
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,050
have it merged with their body.

95
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,399
The only way for blood to merge...

96
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,510
is through intercourse.

97
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,740
What are you thinking about?

98
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,550
Nothing.

99
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,630
Look.

100
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,080
How does your hair look after dyeing it?

101
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,540
My hair has been white lately.

102
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,870
I've almost forgotten what I looked like before.

103
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,690
Do you think I looked a little scary

104
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,080
with white hair?

105
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,540
How should I tell Shisan

106
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,950
about the antidote?

107
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,980
Did I look scary or not?

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,370
I just think

109
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,010
you look especially cute when you're angry.

110
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,150
Xu Hanzhi!

111
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,860
Whether you live or die, I will stay by your side

112
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,760
for the rest of my life

113
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,150
and face it with you.

114
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,630
You are the most important person to me.

115
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,980
Why did you wake up so early today?

116
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,500
You're not me.

117
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,550
You don't understand.

118
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,180
With such a beauty by my side,

119
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,330
even blinking feels like a luxury.

120
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,860
Who would want to sleep?

121
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,180
Why are you

122
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,550
being so sweet today?

123
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,110
But...

124
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,830
what's going on here?

125
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,130
Is it because it's so hot today?

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,470
Oh,

127
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,910
you dare to make fun of me?

128
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,630
you dare to mock me?

129
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,790
Don't avoid my gaze.

130
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,310
Xu Hanzhi.

131
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,380
Mrs. Xu,

132
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,930
please give your orders.

133
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,890
When did we get married?

134
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,790
I've never asked you

135
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,970
when you fell in love with me.

136
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,290
When did I fall in love with you?

137
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,650
Perhaps...

138
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,050
it was when we met again at Dengying Tower,

139
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,400
in our new identities,

140
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,540
or maybe

141
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,940
it's this very moment.

142
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,480
Anyway,

143
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,030
I love every moment

144
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,610
I spend with you.

145
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,620
Idiot.

146
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,960
Why is my nose bleeding?

147
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,270
The poison in Shisan's body has already spread to her heart and veins.

148
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,120
Please save her.

149
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,910
It's not that I don't want to help,

150
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,560
but I truly can't.

151
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:06,850
These days,

152
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,040
I've been searching through the ancient books

153
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,690
left since the founding of the dynasty,

154
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,480
trying to find another way to cure the poison.

155
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,630
But...

156
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,410
Could the only method...

157
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,430
really be intercourse?
