[Always My General]

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,070
[Episode 16]

3
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,710
[Palace Corridor]

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,670
Your Highness,

5
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,910
the wedding ceremony is ready to begin.

6
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,790
Please welcome the Crown Princess in.

7
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,300
All of you may leave now.

8
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:17,800
Xue Shisan's hand is made for wielding a sword,

9
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,940
with calluses on her palm and purlicues.

10
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,980
Only you would be so naive

11
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,080
to think you could fool me like this.

12
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,390
What are you doing?

13
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,870
This is

14
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,570
a hairpin for your hair.

15
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,500
If you want to kill me, just do it.

16
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,800
I thought we were sisters,

17
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,090
but you're the one who has deceived me the most.

18
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,590
Sister,

19
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,810
let me explain.

20
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,050
Don't call me "sister"!

21
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,520
You don't deserve to be my sister.

22
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,000
Do you think I didn't know what you've been doing?

23
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,380
I've been watching you in secret.

24
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,430
I marked the commander's tally with fluorescent ink.

25
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,370
Your actions have been exposed.

26
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,460
Tell me,

27
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,430
who's pulling the strings behind you?

28
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,400
The Grand General of Southern Yue,

29
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,980
Shang Kefeng.

30
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,590
So you were the first mole

31
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,130
he planted in Northern Zhao?

32
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,560
So our first encounter at Dengying Tower

33
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,380
was part of your scheme.

34
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,430
Is that true or not?

35
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:45,820
True.

36
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,070
Shang Kefeng kept you around me

37
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,230
just to keep an eye on everything I do.

38
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,390
Is that true or not?

39
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:54,950
True.

40
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,620
So you made me think we were close sisters

41
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,790
to earn my trust,

42
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,320
only to be ready to take me down at any moment.

43
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,230
Is that true or not?

44
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,270
No!

45
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,390
I genuinely see you as my sister,

46
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,400
and I never intended to harm you.

47
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,290
It's just that we're on opposite sides,

48
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,820
each serving our own masters.

49
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,680
Enough!

50
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,579
Give me the commander's tally,

51
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,720
and all our past grievances will be forgotten.

52
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,500
Alright.

53
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,590
Sister,

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,100
Si won't let you down this time.

55
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,800
I'll ask for your forgiveness in the next life.

56
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,480
Pass my command!

57
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,430
Close the palace gates and assemble the guards.

58
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,820
Capture Xue Shisan!

59
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,180
Where do you think you can run?

60
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,210
Your parents' lives

61
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,750
are in my hands now,

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,110
and you still dare to betray me?

63
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,500
Don't you even worry about what will happen to them?

64
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,830
Trying to escape?

65
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,330
[Yongming Gate]

66
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,300
[Yaozhou City Gate]

67
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,140
[Yongming Gate]

68
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,820
Shisan.

69
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,960
Xu Hanzhi?

70
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,980
When I saw that the bride's figure wasn't you,

71
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,050
I thought,

72
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,550
could this be part of your plan?

73
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,230
Sure enough,

74
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,140
I found you in the back room,

75
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,970
so I just brought you out first.

76
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,240
Where's Si?

77
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,860
Isn't this also your plan?

78
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:58,960
Oh no,

79
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,180
Si is in danger.

80
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,230
We need to save her.

81
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,330
This maid

82
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,680
attempted to assassinate the new king in the palace,

83
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,340
and has been executed.

84
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,200
Her body will be hung at the city gates for three days

85
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,120
as a warning to others.

86
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,190
[Yongming Gate]

87
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,310
Si.

88
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,740
Shisan.

89
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,030
Si!

90
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,820
Si!

91
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,530
Si!

92
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,610
I'm going to kill Shang Kefeng!

93
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,720
I'm going to kill him!

94
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,320
If we return now,

95
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,490
we'll definitely die.

96
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,150
The city is swarming with Shang Kefeng's men,

97
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,900
and Si's death will have been for nothing.

98
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,390
But I can't allow her die

99
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,890
and still suffer such humiliation.

100
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,520
Si.

101
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,680
She's my sister.

102
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,730
She's my sister!

103
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,550
She's my sister!

104
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,870
[Yongming Gate]

105
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,980
Si.

106
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,500
Si.

107
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:58,970
Are you alright?

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,140
Are you hurt?

109
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,130
Sister.

110
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,810
I'm going to reunite with my family.

111
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,230
Where are you going?

112
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,020
Could you please stay?

113
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,050
All this time,

114
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,210
I've always thought of you as my own sister.

115
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,240
I know.

116
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,390
So,

117
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,360
you must take good care of yourself.

118
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,030
Otherwise, I'll worry about you.

119
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,790
Also,

120
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,380
remember that you're a girl too.

121
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,460
So whatever you do,

122
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,870
don't push yourself too hard.

123
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,780
If there's...

124
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,200
a boy you like,

125
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,809
remember to tell me

126
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,309
secretly in your dreams,

127
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,000
and I'll help you out.

128
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,470
Please don't go.

129
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,110
Please don't leave me.

130
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,310
Please don't go.

131
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,540
Well, I'm leaving then.

132
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,700
Don't leave me.

133
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,030
Si!

134
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,810
Please don't go!

135
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,920
Si!

136
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,190
Si!

137
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,140
Did you have a dream?

138
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,240
This was found

139
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,510
in the cloth bag that Si prepared for you.

140
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,030
May this letter serve as my presence.

141
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,810
By the time you read this,

142
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,120
I might already be gone.

143
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,990
We met at Dengying Tower,

144
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,890
but our fate was destined

145
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,350
long before that.

146
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,880
While you were leading the Jet Black Armored Cavalry outside Yaozhou City,

147
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,490
fighting fiercely against the Southern Yue Cavalry,

148
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,830
[Si]

149
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,020
I had already been arranged by Shang Kefeng

150
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,810
to infiltrate Dengying Tower.

151
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,530
Is my name

152
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,170
Si?

153
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,280
I was the first mole Shang Kefeng

154
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,990
Let me try.

155
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,170
planted in Northern Zhao.

156
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,160
Like this.

157
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,050
Before I reached the Northern Border,

158
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,000
I thought I could do anything, no matter the consequences,

159
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,440
as long as it could get my father out of prison,

160
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,580
until I met you.

161
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,280
In others' eyes,

162
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,030
I was nothing but a slave,

163
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,790
a servant, or a pawn.

164
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,670
Only you treated me like family.

165
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,680
Shisan?

166
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,080
I have no regrets...

167
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,380
Why are you called Shisan?

168
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,160
serving you, even in death.

169
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,160
Sister, does it look good?

170
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,130
It looks great.

171
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,030
What is this?

172
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,110
Chicken wings.

173
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,760
No, no.

174
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,630
It's Phoenix.

175
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,560
Right,

176
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,300
it's called Phoenix...

177
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,790
Phoenix Nirvana?

178
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,320
Yes!

179
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,420
Phoenix Nirvana.

180
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,950
Shisan,

181
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,770
it's okay now.

182
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,340
I'll always be here with you.

183
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,830
Shisan.

184
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,560
Your hair...
