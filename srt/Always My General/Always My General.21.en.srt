1
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,910
[Always My General]

2
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,490
You fled the palace

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,830
[Episode 21]

4
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,110
and had a maid marry in your place,

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,560
making me humiliate myself in public

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,000
and become the laughingstock of the realm.

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,960
How dare you even come back and beg me?

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,570
I met you on the battlefield

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,080
and came to know you through revenge.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,180
Each bit we learned about each other

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,990
came with bloodshed and scheming.

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,890
You could say you want to kill me or torture me,

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,580
but you suddenly said you wanted to marry me.

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,680
How could I not run away?

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,380
Then why have you come back now?

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,270
You weren't afraid of death when you left,

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,880
but now you've started to care about your life?

18
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,760
At the darkest moment of my life,

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,050
you gave me this new body

20
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,140
and a reason to live on.

21
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,060
I will never forget this kindness.

22
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,300
Now,

23
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,290
I have fallen into the dust again,

24
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,190
without even a star to light my way.

25
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,880
If I don't come to you...

26
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,289
who else can I turn to?

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,390
What I hate...

28
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,500
is never your lingering feelings

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,440
for Xu Hanzhi,

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,490
nor your leaving without a word.

31
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,980
What I truly hate is

32
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,930
that after everything we've been through,

33
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,620
there's still

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,160
no place for me in your heart.

35
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,370
Then cut out my heart right now

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,350
and see for yourself.

37
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,270
If what you say is true,

38
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,210
then pretend you never saved me.

39
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:58,650
I gave you your life.

40
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,550
Even if I were to take it back,

41
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,970
it's not your turn to make that decision.

42
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,070
When I want to see your true feelings

43
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,889
and decide how to test them,

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,660
I will let you know.

45
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,930
Until then...

46
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,560
live properly

47
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,850
and wait patiently.

48
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,350
Shang Kefeng,

49
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,400
you've come to believe in me again.

50
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,820
It seems that after all,

51
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,870
you still can't break free from the chains of your feelings.

52
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,040
You've done so many evil things.

53
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,500
It's time for us

54
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,370
to settle this once and for all.

55
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,120
You may go now.

56
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,160
Yes.

57
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,390
Shisan,

58
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,300
I've left a gift for you

59
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,930
behind the dressing table.

60
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,380
The royal city stands solitary in the north, facing south and west.

61
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,560
The true king's whereabouts are a mystery within a mystery.

62
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,400
Our secret intelligence reports

63
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,980
that just as Ningde and Xu Hanzhi entered the city,

64
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,710
the main force of the Xiqiang Wolfguards

65
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,300
had already quietly advanced toward Northern Zhao.

66
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,170
Their vanguard

67
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,190
will reach the outskirts of the city by tomorrow at the latest.

68
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,380
Once all the Wolfguards are in position,

69
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,170
given our current forces within Northern Zhao,

70
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,870
we are no match for them at all.

71
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,120
Any word from Southern Yue?

72
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,510
None of the carrier pigeons

73
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,460
we sent has returned.

74
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,490
Ever since Xue Shisan and others went there,

75
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,520
Yue has been unusually quiet.

76
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,580
A storm is brewing.

77
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,180
I have a feeling that something will go wrong at tomorrow's coronation ceremony.

78
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,750
Gather all of our best men

79
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,950
in Northern Zhao.

80
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,950
Tonight,

81
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,220
I will make the Prince of Ning's Mansion run red with blood.

82
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,030
I'll make the arrangements right away.

83
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,400
I'll lead the team myself.

84
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,190
Wait.

85
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,650
You just provide support from the sidelines.

86
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,280
As for Xu Hanzhi and Ningde...

87
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,650
I want Xue Shisan to personally

88
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,510
submit this pledge of loyalty to me by killing them.

89
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,380
Your Highness.

90
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,920
The royal city stands solitary in the north, facing south and west.

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,840
The true king's whereabouts are a mystery within a mystery.

92
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,270
Is this

93
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,350
a secret code that you used in the Jet Black Armored Cavalry?

94
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,840
This is the location of the King of Northern Zhao's secret chamber.

95
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,790
Send a message by carrier pigeon to Shisan,

96
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,950
telling her to meet me there.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,570
Yes.

98
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,990
Wait!

99
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,330
Let me go with you.

100
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,600
You are now a regional lord commanding a large army.

101
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,220
Your movements

102
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,460
would draw attention.

103
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,930
It's better for you to stay here for now.

104
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,070
Clearly, you just don't want to take me.

105
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,960
Just piling up excuses, one after another.

106
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,570
I...

107
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,320
I'm not the king.

108
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,100
You are the king.

109
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,950
I'm not the king.

110
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,260
You are the Eldest Prince.

111
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,159
Brother,

112
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,140
it's me.

113
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,680
Quick, unchain him.

114
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,950
You've finally come to save me!

115
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,380
It's alright now.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,490
At tomorrow's coronation ceremony,

117
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,390
let's pull that impostor off

118
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,680
the throne together.

119
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,380
Coronation ceremony?

120
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,460
Is

121
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:43,850
Father...

122
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,670
Father passed away over half a month ago.

123
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,770
The cause of his death is still unknown.

124
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,980
I don't care who becomes king.

125
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,250
I just don't want to die.

126
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,600
Listen to me.

127
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,290
If Shang Kefeng ascends to the throne of Northern Zhao,

128
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,210
none of us in this secret chamber

129
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,640
will survive.

130
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,610
As long as you're alive,

131
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,660
with you being my elder brother,

132
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,460
we'll have a way to bring him down.

133
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,350
I've been withholding the antidote from you.

134
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,580
Aren't you anxious?

135
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,100
Your Highness won't save me until you've confirmed my true feelings.

136
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,560
So, what's the use of being anxious?

137
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,460
Xu Hanzhi

138
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
is mobilizing troops to the capital.

139
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,920
His rebellious intentions

140
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,390
are now clear as day.

141
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,320
Today, you go to the Prince of Ning's Mansion to send him on his way.

142
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,250
At tomorrow's grand ceremony,

143
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,520
you and I will join hands to claim the throne of Northern Zhao.

144
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,210
With my current physical condition,

145
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,180
I'm afraid I no longer have the strength

146
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,600
to fight against Xu Hanzhi.

147
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,670
Won't you even look at me?

148
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,140
My guards are at your disposal.

149
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,990
It's do or die.

150
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,260
Don't say I didn't give you a chance.

151
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,950
Then let me

152
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,970
act out this play with you properly.
