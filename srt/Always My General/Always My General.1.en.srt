Dengying Tower

4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,000
is a decadent playground of fame and fortune,

5
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,390
but more importantly, it's a gathering place for the Crown Prince to collect intelligence.

[Xue Shisan; Maid in the Dengying Tower]

7

Leaving you insects to be slaughtered by me.

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,070
So much for brothers who swore to live and die together.

35
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,970
How ridiculous.

Now you dare to come to our camp alone—

63
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,540
aren't you afraid you won't make it back?

64
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,540
The land beneath your feet

65
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,120
has always been the territory of our Northern Zhao,

66
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,510
and moreover,

67
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,890
my Jet Black Armored Cavalry still has ten thousand elite soldiers

68
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,440
Why should I be afraid?

71
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,870
You have guts.

72
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,130
They all say that you, General Yunhui, are invincible,

73
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,540
all because of your half ghost mask

74
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,079
that can capture people's souls.

75
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,560
Today,

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,079

I'm afraid?

81
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,820
I'm afraid I want to see

82
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,370
which is harder—

83
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,620

84
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,300
You're indeed privileged and pampered.

85
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,240
I didn't expect

86
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,100
that you're actually a woman.

87
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,430
Aren't you afraid that the Emperor of Northern Zhao will kill you?

88
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,050
Or

89
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,330
you could become mine.

90
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,230
Okay.

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,510
As Chief Generals,

92
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,670
it's time we find an opportunity

93
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,780
to cease fire and end the war.

94
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,440
You agreed so readily—

95
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,190
who knows if there's a trick?

96
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,250
But then again,

97
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,260
if you wish to prevent more casualties,

98
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,550
surrendering the city is your only option.

99
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,909
If you release the grain,

100
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,610
I'll give myself to you.

101
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,409
Fine.

102

How much do you want?

103

Ten thousand dans.

105

all to you.

106
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,290
Then tonight,

107
