00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,840
[Always My General]

2
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,660
[Episode 5]

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,290
Sir, how have I offended you?

4
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,750
Theft

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,620
isn't under the imperial guards' jurisdiction, is it?

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,340
I'll return the money pouch to them in a moment.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,280
I want to ask you about someone.

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,570
Please go ahead.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,610
[Bag; Informant in Yaozhou City]

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,780
I know everything about

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,790
Yaozhou City.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,230
A few days ago, outside Dengying Tower,

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,550
there was a one-eyed man who used a firearm

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,660
and did something big.

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,100
Do you know about it?

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,100
I

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,910
have heard about it.

18
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,560
He's a newly emerged tough guy.

19
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,350
He served

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,640
in the military.

21
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,340
Where is his hideout?

22
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,750
I dare not say.

23
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,350
He even dared to attempt assassinating the Crown Prince.

24
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,570
If he knows I leaked the information,

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,900
he'll surely skin me alive.

26
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,950
If you don't tell me,

27
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,960
I'll skin you alive right now.

28
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,260
General Zhou.

29
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,130
General Zhou.

30
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,730
Greetings, General Zhou!

31
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,140
Greetings, General Zhou!

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,270
Please rise.

33
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,210
General,

34
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,410
they are all orphans of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry

35
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,560
and are also a formidable force, ready at

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
any moment to die for you.

37
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,580
Just give the order,

38
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,330
and we'll storm the Eastern Palace for you at any time!

39
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,170
I am no longer a general,

40
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,259
and I don't need a formidable force.

41
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,690
I only hope that my former soldiers

42
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,120
and their families

43
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,100
can live well.

44
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,850
General, do you no longer consider me a brother?

45
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,300
Do you not consider these children

46
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,380
to be your own?

47
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,370
What nonsense are you talking about?

48
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,090
You and I will always be sworn brothers.

49
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:01,990
Then, General,

50
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,580
do you still remember our oath of brotherhood?

51
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,560
We shall follow each other in life and death

52
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,960
with utmost loyalty and trust.

53
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,210
Not born together,

54
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,990
but we'll die as one!

55
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,410
Not born together,

56
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,150
but we'll die as one!

57
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,600
Not born together,

58
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,560
but we'll die as one!

59
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,740
Not born together,

60
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,000
-The torch of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry hasn't been extinguished.
-but we'll die as one!

61
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,870
They, like their fallen fathers and brothers,

62
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,910
are fearless in the face of death!

63
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,180
Just like you, General,

64
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,510
they bear deep-seated grudges!

65
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,010
Their hearts yearn for battle!

66
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,040
But what are we really fighting for?

67
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,660
We fight

68
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,830
to protect the common people,

69
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,850
to end the war,

70
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,290
and to ensure that our next generation

71
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,590
won't have to pick up swords

72
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,060
and wear that jet-black armor again.

73
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,790
As the general,

74
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,120
I could order you

75
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,910
to risk your lives for revenge.

76
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,440
But as your brother,

77
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,829
I hope that you can reunite with your families

78
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,000
and live peaceful lives.

79
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,470
This is my responsibility.

80
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,630
I can't accept it.

81
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,990
I can't accept that these children

82
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:27,980
must bear shame

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,230
and live in hiding

84
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,400
as we have been doing!

85
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,550
I really can't accept it.

86
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,600
As long as I'm here,

87
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,200
I won't let

88
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,990
them bear shame forever.

89
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,510
I won't let those who truly deserve to die

90
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,700
continue living in hiding.

91
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,320
I believe

92
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,960
our brothers in heaven will see that day.

93
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,800
And I will definitely let you

94
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,750
see that day too!

95
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,520
General...

96
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,300
Enough!

97
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,940
After the battle at the watchtower,

98
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,880
Xu Hanzhi has become alert.

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,079
The imperial guards under his command

100
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,430
may come here at any moment.

101
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,400
If you still recognize me as your general,

102
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,790
leave this place now!

103
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,360
General!

104
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,020
Leave!

105
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,240
Leave now!

106
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,680
To the southern city post station.

107
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,520
I have arranged everything there.

108
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,100
And also...

109
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,339
thank you for not being surprised to see me...

110
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,450
in a dress, brother.

111
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,010
Mu Guiying led armies,

112
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,750
and Hua Mulan joined the army for her father—

113
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,340
each of them protected their home and country

114
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,330
and fought valiantly in wars.

115
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,770
To us, Zhou Chu is simply General Yunhui;

116
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,100
gender matters not.

117
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,070
Take care,

118
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,020
General.

119
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:38,370
He Xiaowei...

120
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,130
take care.

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,310
Didn't I order you to get medicine from the clinic?

122
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,580
Where is it?

123
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,030
The herbs are here.

124
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,150
Please examine it, Your Highness.

125
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,380
Why come here instead of returning to the Dengying Tower...

126
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,350
after getting the medicine?

127
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,830
The doctor prescribed

128
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,240
two prescriptions for medicinal baths.

129
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,480
One can treat Your Highness's burns,

130
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,480
and the other can heal my wounds.

131
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,400
Then I've come at just the right time, haven't I?

132
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,610
Why wait for a better time?

133
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,270
Xu Hanzhi,

134
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,470
now that you're within my grasp,

135
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,500
why don't I just kill you today?

136
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,350
Your Highness,

137
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,690
are you just going in the bath fully clothed?

138
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,020
Then, Your Highness, please rest and recover here.

139
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,670
I shall take my leave first.

140
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,480
You are my personal maid.

141
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,290
Stay and serve me.

142
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,420
Let's share this bath

143
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,150
and treat our wounds together.

144
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,260
This scoundrel,

145
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,250
how dare he...

146
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,690
Very well,

147
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,940
you can wait until I deal with you.

148
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,840
Your time is up.

149
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,070
Xue Shisan.

150
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,790
You're quite the actor.

151
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,300
But despite your dedicated performance,

152
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,230
I still caught that assassin.

153
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,500
What did he say?

154
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,710
Don't worry;

155
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,040
before I find out

156
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,050
your relationship with that assassin,

157
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,810
I won't harm you.

158
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,440
But don't even think about leaving my side.

159
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:51,970
What?

160
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,130
We hereby swear

161
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,290
to become sworn brothers!

162
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,760
We, thirteen warriors of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry,

163
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,710
were not born together,

164
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,930
but we'll die as one!

165
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,990
Not born together,

166
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,130
but we'll die as one!

167
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,970
Not born together,

168
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,890
but we'll die as one!

169
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,970
Not born together,

170
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,950
but we'll die as one!

171
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,180
Yesterday at the bathhouse,

172
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,730
what did you do with Xu Hanzhi?

173
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,190
You're asking what you already know.

174
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,150
The betrayer of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry hasn't been killed yet,

175
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,909
but you've become a new betrayer yourself!

176
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,110
I was simply playing along

177
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,870
to protect He Xiaowei.

178
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,570
I saved you.

179
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
What you can

180
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,510
and cannot do

181
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,830
is for me to decide.

182
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,630
Back then, I used Southern Yue's secret technique

183
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,720
to restore your appearance,

184
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,630
[Slave]

185
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,200
but left only this slave mark.

186
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,620
Do you know why?

187
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,240
It's just to remind you

188
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,310
of your place!

189
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,070
I'm a knife that you've planted in Dengying Tower,

190
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,760
and you are a knife that Southern Yue has planted in Northern Zhao.

191
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,260
But a knife that doesn't draw blood is no different from scrap metal.

192
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,830
Now, I have a plan

193
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,000
that might make the Eldest Prince and Xu Hanzhi kill each other.

194
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,320
I'd like to hear the details.

195
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,929
Let go of me!

196
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,669
Let go of me!

197
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,390
No.

198
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,549
I'm the Crown Prince's maid!

199
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,430
So what?

200
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,820
Don't use the Crown Prince to intimidate me.

201
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,300
Listen well,

202
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,290
serve me well.

203
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,590
Otherwise,

204
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,580
I'll make the entire Dengying Tower suffer!

205
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,640
Let go of me!

206
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,270
I'm the Crown Prince's maid!

207
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,200
Let go of me!

208
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,500
By the Eldest Prince?

209
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,230
That's impossible.

210
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,340
Why would it be impossible?

211
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,200
I saw it with my own eyes.

212
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,080
How could it be fake?

213
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,080
But aren't the Eldest Prince

214
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,000
and the Crown Prince always at odds?

215
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,410
Let alone bullying a maid,

216
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,220
if the Eldest Prince were to appear

217
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,530
on the street outside Dengying Tower,

218
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,260
the imperial guards would surely report it, right?

219
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,500
The conflict between those two princes

220
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,960
is like a battle of the gods.

221
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,230
If you were just a guard,

222
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,680
would you dare to meddle in their affairs?

223
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,630
Last time, the Eldest Prince

224
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,880
lost face publicly

225
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,080
because of Xue Shisan.

226
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,390
This time, he forced himself on her

227
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,720
to regain his face.

228
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,590
Repeat what you just said!

229
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,870
Your Highness,

230
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,720
I only saw the Eldest Prince and Xue Shisan

231
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,670
coming out of a guest room on the second floor separately.

232
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,390
As for what happened in that room,

233
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,220
that was just my imagination.

234
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,320
Anyone who dares to discuss this further

235
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,690
will be executed without exception.

236
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,470
I wouldn't dare to do it again, Your Highness.

237
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,260
I wouldn't dare to do it again, Your Highness.

238
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,020
I wouldn't dare to do it again, Your Highness.

239
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,840
I wouldn't dare to do it again, Your Highness.

240
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,350
-I wouldn't dare to do it again, Your Highness.
-I wouldn't dare to do it again, Your Highness.

241
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,210
Greetings, Your Highness.

242
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,990
Turn your face toward me.

243
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,460
Your Highness,

244
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,640
Shisan has caught a cold

245
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,590
and is resting now.

246
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,700
[Slave]

247
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,790
[Slave]

248
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,890
Your Highness,

249
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,650
the Eldest Prince said if Shisan didn't comply,

250
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,000
he'd raze Dengying Tower to the ground.

251
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,090
[Slave]

252
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,060
[Slave]

253
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,880
I will settle this account for you.

254
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,490
The little tricks we usually use on Madam Rong

255
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,030
can even fool the Crown Prince.

256
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,160
Looks like I really can't underestimate you.

257
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,350
Now, I have a plan

258
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,390
that might

259
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,150
make the Eldest Prince and Xu Hanzhi kill each other.

260
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,200
I'd like to hear the details.

261
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,260
During my time at the border,

262
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,910
I heard countless tales of the secret techniques of Southern Yue.

263
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,720
The most common was healing scars,

264
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,780
and the most legendary

265
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,710
was face-swapping.

266
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,120
Can you do it?

267
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,860
Whose face do you want me to change into?

268
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,570
The Eldest Prince.

269
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,280
How is it?

270
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,580
-Don't use the Crown Prince to intimidate me.
-Let go of me!

271
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,080
Serve me well.

272
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,630
Let go of me!

273
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:10,800
If anything happens,

274
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,830
I'll punish the entire Dengying Tower!

275
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,720
Target: Prince Jing's mansion.

276
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:17,760
Move out.

277
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,450
Yes, Your Highness.

278
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,520
He Xiaowei?

279
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,290
General.

280
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,530
Can you still find the firearm?

281
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,100
I hid it in the rocky hills in the outskirts before I was arrested.

282
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:43,830
Go retrieve it.

283
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,050
Xu Hanzhi has gone to Prince Jing's mansion.

284
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,270
Let's kill them all in one fell swoop.

285
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,440
I will do my utmost, General.

286
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:49,900
Let's go.

287
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,450
[Prince Jing's Mansion]

288
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,330
Greetings, Your Highness.

289
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,080
Ever since my second brother became the Crown Prince,

290
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,580
you imperial guards

291
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,530
have become more and more unruly.

292
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,710
You barge into my mansion

293
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,820
armed to the teeth without reason.

294
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,330
What the hell do you want?

295
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,420
The Crown Prince's personal maid

296
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,030
was humiliated and defiled at Dengying Tower.

297
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,570
The Crown Prince wants Your Highness

298
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,540
to give an explanation.

299
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,660
Absurd!

300
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,430
My status is so noble,

301
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,870
and the women around me

302
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,290
are as numerous as fish in a river.

303
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,770
Would I be interested in Xu Hanzhi's maid?

304
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,470
Trying to throw mud at me.

305
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,140
Do you have any evidence?

306
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,590
Madam Rong!

307
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,790
Tell us what you saw.

308
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,220
This morning, I

309
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,640
indeed saw Your Highness

310
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,760
in a guest room at Dengying Tower

311
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,550
with

312
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,370
Xue Shisan, who was disheveled.

313
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,220
This is outrageous!

314
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,070
Good, I'll settle all past and present grievances

315
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,040
with him once and for all.

316
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,330
Do you see Xu Hanzhi?

317
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,450
This is bad.

318
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,420
Where's Xu Hanzhi?

319
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,020

all of this was part of your scheme, Xue Shisan.
