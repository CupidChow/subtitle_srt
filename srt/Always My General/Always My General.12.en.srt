00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,330
[Always My General]

2
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,980
[Episode 12]

3
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,880
[Northern Zhaozhao Imperial Prison]

4
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,060
Northern Zhao is such an interesting place.

5
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,170
A person's fate

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,600
can change so suddenly.

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,850
Out.

8
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,520
Do you know

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,980
why I didn't let them

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,170
harm your face?

11
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,360
Because it was my gift to you,

12
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,190
the symbol of my claim over you.

13
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,870
You saved my life once,

14
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,640
but if you're using that

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,039
as an excuse to manipulate me,

16
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,750
then I'll give it back to you.

17
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,950
As a Southern Yue envoy

18
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,450
and a defeated general,

19
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,170
I risked everything in Northern Zhao's territory,

20
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,710
making plans at every turn,

21
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,039
and finally gave you this appearance

22
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,450
and the identity at Dengying Tower.

23
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,210
Yet you chose Xu Hanzhi instead.

24
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,350
I gave you chances,

25
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,840
but you betrayed me

26
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,150
over and over again!

27
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,870
From the moment you decided to conquer Northern Zhao,

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,310
we were destined to be enemies.

29
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,700
Didn't you want to claim me?

30
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,880
Then let's go to hell together.

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,979
Hell?

32
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,500
For someone like me, with such a humble background,

33
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,470
isn't this world already hell?

34
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,860
But if you're willing to return to me,

35
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,830
you'll get your freedom immediately,

36
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,110
and even share this land with me.

37
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,550
I'd rather die!

38
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,420
If you want to die,

39
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,520
I'll make sure your death is as grand as possible.

40
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,760
Your Highness,

41
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,810
is there really no chance

42
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,370
to reconcile with His Majesty?

43
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,570
If we let Xue Shisan go,

44
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,570
His Majesty will lose his authority.

45
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,730
Authority

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,130
is the lifeblood of a ruler.

47
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,350
Please let me

48
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,579
go rescue General Zhou on my own.

49
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,829
If you get involved,

50
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,670
there will be no chance for you to turn things around.

51
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,120
I've fought many tough battles where we were outnumbered.

52
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,820
The key is

53
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,990
that the commander

54
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,220
must always lead the charge.

55
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,510
Inform our men

56
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,210
to set up an ambush near the imperial prison.

57
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,160
We'll start our operation at midnight tonight.

58
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,790
Yes, Your Highness.

59
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,810
Back at the eastern suburban training ground,

60
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,150
I was wondering

61
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,790
why someone as brave as you

62
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,670
wasn't in my army.

63
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,170
It turns out you're the famous General Yunhui,

64
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,420
and this title of yours

65
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,500
was also bestowed upon you by me.

66
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,690
The entire Jet Black Armored Cavalry

67
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,470
has countless warriors as brave as I am.

68
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,960
Haven't they all perished at your hands?

69
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,290
In your eyes,

70
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,440
I'm just a brutal tyrant.

71
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,540
But from my perspective,

72
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,790
aren't you also

73
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,660
a dangerous criminal?

74
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,410
I guarded the Northern Border for eight years,

75
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,360
commanded hundreds of battles, large and small,

76
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,710
and killed countless enemies.

77
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,710
And you consider me a dangerous criminal?

78
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,270
How can you even say that, Your Majesty?

79
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,750
I have

80
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,140
only two sons.

81
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,019
My eldest son,

82
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,840
though highly esteemed by the noble families,

83
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,800
is unfortunately

84
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,420
arrogant and reckless,

85
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,090
with no talent in governance.

86
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,140
Fortunately,

87
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,630
my youngest son has military achievements

88
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,930
that can keep him in check,

89
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,000
so

90
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,930
there's no major issue.

91
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,760
But Hanzhi has you

92
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,400
and ten thousand Jet Black Armored Cavalry under his command.

93
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,330
So,

94
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,530
who should I find

95
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,060
to keep him in check?

96
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,750
Didn't you originally plan

97
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,270
to give the throne to Xu Hanzhi?

98
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,790
Why are you treating him like an enemy now?

99
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,560
General Zhou truly doesn't understand the mind of an emperor.

100
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,420
When a ruler reaches my age,

101
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,260
there are only two things they fear the most,

102
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,340
having no successor,

103
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,370
and having a son who would usurp the throne.

104
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,320
If that's really the case,

105
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,990
then being born in a royal family

106
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,250
is the most tragic thing in the world.

107
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,660
To wear the crown,

108
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,110
you have to bear its weight.

109
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,920
If you want to secure the throne,

110
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,000
some loyal ministers,

111
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,240
elders,

112
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,250
must be executed.

113
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,120
Some beloved consorts,

114
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,980
even children,

115
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,230
may also need to be dealt with, if necessary.

116
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,650
Do you have any last wishes?

117
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,680
Say them,

118
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,420
and I...

119
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,290
will try to grant them.

120
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,120
After I die,

121
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,640
Your Majesty, please restore the reputation of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry

122
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,690
and take care of the soldiers' families.

123
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,730
The shame of being a traitor

124
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,100
is something, I, Zhou Chu, will bear alone.

125
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,070
Granted.

126
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,090
Xu Hanzhi,

127
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,200
we'll meet in the next life.

128
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,950
Who's there?

129
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,170
You're asking for trouble?

130
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,820
I apologize for my bluntness!

131
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,020
I hope you'll forgive me, Your Highness!

132
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,280
Where's the prisoner?

133
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,170
Your Highness,

134
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,700
when I came for my shift,

135
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,030
the prisoner had already been executed.

136
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,130
Executed?

137
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,240
What did you say?

138
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
I've made it clear to everyone

139
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,720
in this prison

140
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,270
that without my orders,

141
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,720
no one is allowed to lay a finger on her!

142
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,870
Which fool gave the order for the execution?

143
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,530
It was...

144
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,650
His Majesty who gave the order.

145
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,159
That old fool,

146
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,650
I haven't even gone to see him,

147
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,150
and he dares to touch my person first?

148
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,730
I didn't hear anything.

149
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,240
I didn't hear anything!

150
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,570
You didn't hear anything?

151
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,190
Then I will...

152
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,640
say it again.

153
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,640
I'm going to kill that old fool, the King of Northern Zhao,

154
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,820
to honor the spirit of Xue Shisan.

155
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,790
[King of Northern Zhao's Palace]

156
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,140
You weren't summoned,

157
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,610
yet you barged in with a sword.

158
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,480
Are you planning to rebel?

159
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,720
Zhou Chu has already lost her military power

160
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,810
and been thrown into the imperial prison.

161
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,010
Why did you still behead her in prison?

162
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,670
Eliminating Zhou Chu

163
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,220
was the condition for you

164
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,750
to drop your claim to the throne.

165
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,159
I was just

166
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,190
fulfilling the promise.

167
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,160
Fulfilling the promise?

168
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,140
Father,

169
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,950
you're so cruel.

170
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,160
You're not...

171
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,890
It's too late...

172
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,560
for you to realize it.

173
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,600
What I want...

174
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,669
is the woman I love

175
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,190
and the land of Northern Zhao.
