00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,330
[Always My General]

2
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,060
[Episode 24]

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:19,950
Your Highness,

4
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,820
His Majesty wants you

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,920
to check everything for the wedding,

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,130
including the gifts from neighboring countries.

7
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,590
I don't really know much about

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,570
these pearls, jade, and silk.

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,240
If His Majesty approves, then that's fine by me.

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,060
Your Highness,

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,890
His Majesty also said that since Princess Ningde has arrived,

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,400
he won't be coming to see you.

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,570
I see.

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,530
You may leave now.

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,270
Yes, Your Highness.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,180
There's no way he would go see Ningde and not see me.

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,960
He must be lying.

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,750
But...

19
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,000
what if?

20
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,290
Men can be so unpredictable.

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,830
Oh, no,

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,180
I'm the esteemed General Yunhui,
how could I think like that?

23
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:20,890
Why are you here?

24
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,630
Weren’t you supposed to go find Ningde?

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,590
Do you like these?

26
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,480
Hey,

27
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,420
look who else is here.

28
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,060
Brother.

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,850
Why are you here?

30
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,690
Your wedding with Your Highness is approaching.

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,670
As your elder brother,

32
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,979
how could I not come to deliver the dowry?

33
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:41,580
Yunze,

34
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:42,979
regarding the royal wedding,

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,990
I'd like to have a private talk with Your Highness.

36
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,280
As the bride-to-be,

37
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,130
could you please

38
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,870
give us a moment?

39
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,370
You're asking me to leave?

40
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,460
Don't make things hard for His Majesty.

41
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,259
Fine.

42
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,680
What's wrong?

43
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,600
Your Majesty,

44
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,910
something serious has happened.

45
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,950
The Northern Rong has been frequently causing trouble on our border,

46
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,830
using all kinds of strange poisons.

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,680
Now,

48
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,949
half of Southern Yue's people are poisoned,

49
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,180
and there's no cure.

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,820
But Northern Rong has never used poisons before.

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,290
That's what's suspicious.

52
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,600
It's clear that someone is using Southern Yue's poison-making techniques

53
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,780
to cultivate even deadlier poisons.

54
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,090
Your Majesty,

55
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,860
where's the mask

56
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,570
my sister used to wear

57
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,380
when she was with Jet Black Armored Cavalry?

58
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,000
When Shisan was under Shang Kefeng's control and poisoned,

59
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,980
the mask fell into Shang Kefeng's hands.

60
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,270
That matches up.

61
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,610
The border guards say

62
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,930
that the person leading the Northern Rong army

63
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,420
is wearing a mask.

64
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,000
We must not let Shisan know about this,

65
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,990
or she will certainly risk her life alone

66
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,750
to fight against Shang Kefeng

67
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,579
to the death.

68
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,079
I was thinking the same thing.

69
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,250
Brother,

70
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,300
after the royal wedding,

71
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,660
I will personally lead the army

72
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,910
to help you defeat the rebels.

73
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,910
Southern Yue and Northern Zhao are closely connected, 
one cannot live without the other.

74
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,320
I can't thank you enough for such a big favor.

75
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,160
You and I

76
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,770
must keep this from Yunze.

77
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,810
[Northern Border Battlefield]

78
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,610
General Han,

79
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,830
the Northern Rong army launched a surprise attack on our camp,

80
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,130
and their force was overwhelming.

81
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,350
I led a thousand soldiers to break out,

82
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,110
but we lost nearly all of them, either dead or wounded.

83
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,850
The Xiqiang Wolfguards are brave and skilled in battle,

84
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,480
yet they couldn't withstand the Northern Rong Cavalry?

85
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,880
The Northern Rong Cavalry was only about three thousand men,

86
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,300
but their attack was ruthless.

87
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,120
Their swords and blades were coated with poison,

88
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,120
and even a single touch meant certain death.

89
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,150
Northern Zhao and Northern Rong have no history of conflict,

90
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,150
so I don't understand why they would strike us so ruthlessly!

91
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,350
Report!

92
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,490
Report, General Han!

93
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,840
A hundred thousand troops from the Northern Border

94
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,210
are marching towards our camp
at a pace of twenty miles per day.

95
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,150
Beat the drums in the main camp.

96
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,450
Prepare for battle!

97
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,160
Yes, General!

98
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,740
Greetings, Your Majesty.

99
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,170
Shisan,

100
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,730
why are you dressed like this?

101
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,760
Your Majesty,

102
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,980
the Northern Rong's army is approaching,

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,970
and the Northern Border is in danger.

104
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,540
I request Your Majesty's permission to lead an army of 100,000 men

105
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,170
to the border to defend!

106
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,050
A king doesn't send his queen to battlefield.

107
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,310
Northern Zhao has plenty of generals,
there's no need to send you.

108
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,150
Your Majesty,

109
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,210
the enemy is coming with overwhelming force this time.

110
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,220
Besides,

111
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:07,870
is there anyone in the court

112
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,710
more qualified to lead the army than I am?

113
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,140
I'm the one who leads the troops.

114
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,680
Our wedding is approaching,

115
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,730
and you're a woman,

116
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,190
I want you by my side

117
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,180
where I can protect you.

118
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,060
Defending our country isn't about gender.

119
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:20,860
We've fought side by side,

120
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,980
won so many battles together.

121
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,490
Have you forgotten?

122
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,630
That's precisely why

123
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,390
I can't let you go to battle.

124
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:26,930
I swear

125
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,680
I'll keep you away from the danger.

126
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll protect you.

127
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,620
I don't need anyone's protection.

128
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:33,890
Our responsibility

129
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,260
is to protect the people together.

130
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,330
Have you forgotten?

131
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,420
You're the queen now,

132
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,940
and you need to represent the dignity of the nation.

133
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,940
No, Your Majesty.

134
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,310
I'd rather

135
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,980
be General Yunhui than a queen.

136
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,070
Zhou Chu.

137
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,500
If Her Majesty had known

138
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,780
His Majesty stayed up for three days and nights

139
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,030
making this silver spear for her,

140
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,030
she wouldn't have left...

141
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,610
so heartbroken.

142
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,620
Was she heartbroken?

143
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,070
Actually,

144
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,320
she wasn't that heartbroken.

145
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,850
You may leave now.

146
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,380
Wait.

147
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:43,930
Give this to her.

148
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

149
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,780
I'm sure

150
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,890
Shisan will love this silver spear.

151
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,760
Your Majesty,

152
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,710

00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,320
I will return to the court in triumph.

188
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,780
In my younger days, I rode freely,

189
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,060
as a brave young hero,

190
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,800
wielding the spear and fighting across the lands,

191
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,409
swearing to protect our beautiful country.

192
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,770
There will be a day when I return victoriously,

193
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,950
and I'll share that beautiful night with you.

194
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,320
I long to spend my life with you,

195
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,150
wish...

196
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,990
to be comrades-in-arms with you.

197
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,810
♫Before dawn breaks♫

198
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,040
[Northern Prairie]

199
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,850
Hya!

200
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,290
♫I will leap into the strange storm of calamity♫

201
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,630
Hya!

202
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,140
Hya!

203
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,380
What does the Jet Black Armored Cavalry do?

204
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,020
♫Who will end it?♫

205
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,750
To protect the common people.

206
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,480
Who are the common people?

207
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,630
You and I.

208
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,190
♫The sparks will set the plains ablaze♫

209
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,810
We're all common people.

210
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,630
♫History is written by the victors' songs♫

211
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,640
♫How will it replay?♫

212
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:40,049
♫Who can compete with the heroes of the world?♫

213
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:47,880
♫Who can compete with the heroes of the world?♫

214
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,060
♫The chaos of conquest♫

215
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,700
Your Majesty, why are you here?

216
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,290
Because...

217
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,660
♫Is all due to my strategic game of deception♫

218
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,510
I'm your Vice General.

219
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,780
And you...

220
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,800
will always be my general.

221
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,640
♫The heavens are silent♫

222
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,540
♫In the chaos, donning armor, with swords and horses♫

223
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,660
♫Even kings and nobles♫

224
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,370
Hya!

225
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,940
♫Are just broken spears lost in the waves♫

226
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,000
Hya!

227
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,800
Hya!

228
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,330
Hya!

229
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,260
In the rest of my life, I will gaze upon the clouds and the moon...

230
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:21,660
♫Centuries of bloodshed♫

231
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,650
I'll be faithful to my general and be faithful to you.

232
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,120
If the general remains unmarried,

233
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,610
then you and I are meant to be together!

234
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,600
♫The plans for the world♫

235
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,190
Hya!

236
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:32,780
[From then on, the years of conflict finally came to an end, and the people lived in peace and prosperity.]

237
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:32,780
[During the flames of war, Shang Kefeng died on the Northern Border Battlefield.]

238
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,200
Hya!
