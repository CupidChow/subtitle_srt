1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,820
[Always My General]

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,680
[Episode 3]

3
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,230
I've been

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,660
in the army with you for so many years.

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,580
Do you really think changing into a woman's clothes

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,430
will fool me?

7
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,410
You're hurting me.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,930
First,

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,240
you need to speak in a higher pitch.

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,870
I'm just

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:42,890
a humble maid

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,460
in Dengying Tower.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,350
How dare I

14
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,490
deceive you, Your Highness?

15
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:47,820
Plus,

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,580
I'm not even surnamed Zhou.

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,520
My surname is Xue,

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,250
and my first name is Shisan.

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,450
-Then prove it to me!
-You don't need to do it!

20
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,590
If you still don't believe me,

21
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,760
then I'll prove it to you.

22
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,920
I'm being ridiculous.

23
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,289
How could General possibly be a woman?

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,250
Your Highness,

25
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,770
do you want me to continue?

26
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,460
General is covered in wounds.

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,750
She is not him.

28
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,570
Enough!

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,640
Put your clothes on.

30
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,780
Your Highness!

31
00:01:58,979 --> 00:01:59,750
Your Highness,

32
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,010
who's this lady?

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,780
This is the suspect who sneaked into Dengying Tower

34
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,850
and killed the Minister.

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,390
Tomorrow morning, take her out of the city

36
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,889
and execute her publicly.

37
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,220
Who in this city doesn't know that

38
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,620
Dengying Tower is your private property?

39
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,490
You've only recently been appointed as the Crown Prince,

40
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,460
and now a high-ranking official has been murdered here.

41
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,480
Even if you have me take the blame,

42
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,680
it probably won't stop the gossip.

43
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,170
So?

44
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,840
So,

45
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,700
I want to set dawn as the deadline

46
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,760
to help you find the real culprit.

47
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,340
If I fail,

48
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,760
I'm willing to be

49
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,630
the scapegoat for you.

50
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,370
For me?

51
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,750
Alright.

52
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,050
I'll give you one night.

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,590
I'd like to see

54
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,040
what you can do.

55
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,690
Your Highness, do you know what this is?

56
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,890
This is a flying insect from the Western Regions

57
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,890
that feeds on wine lees and fragrant fruit,

58
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,570
called the Red Flame Scarab.

59
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,180
Its wings ignite when they vibrate,

60
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,810
which is why its lifespan is very short.

61
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,360
The poor people along the border and the traveling caravans

62
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,890
often use them as a source of fire.

63
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,160
One single Red Flame Scarab

64
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,840
can burn a person like this?

65
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,590
One alone couldn't,

66
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,750
but

67
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,090
a group can.

68
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,310
How dare you!

69
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,260
[Wine]

70
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,500
Using the Red Flame Scarabs to kill?

71
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,740
Not many people could come up with this idea.

72
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,530
Speak.

73
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,150
Who hired you to kill the Minister?

74
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,210
[Hongluan, counselor of Dengying Tower]

75
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,560
What's there to say?

76
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,990
I took the money,

77
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,530
so I did the job.

78
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,110
Since you've caught me,

79
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,880
today,

80
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,650
one of us

81
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,660
must die!

82
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,500
Reckless fool.

83
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,460
How dare you cause trouble in my territory?

84
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,560
You really are ruthless.

85
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,690
It's one thing to kill the Minister

86
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,150
to intimidate the various factions in the court,

87
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,870
but you don't even spare your own loyal subordinates.

88
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,110
What do you mean?

89
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,980
The Northern Zhao Jade.

90
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,560
It's only reserved for the current King and the Crown Prince.

91
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,310
That thumb ring

92
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,070
is a royal accessory, made from the same ore

93
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,880
as the adornment on your head.

94
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,450
The true culprit who killed the Minister

95
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,200
is obvious now, isn't it?

96
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,080
You're meticulous in thought

97
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,480
but loose-lipped.

98
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,360
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

99
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,150
I came to Northern Zhao

100
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,010
to share a piece of the cake

101
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,000
in this rich land.

102
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,530
How could I earn the chance

103
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,030
to serve you

104
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,780
if I don't prove my worth?

105
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,530
I like ambitious people.

106
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,610
But those who are full of ambition

107
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,650
but overly conspicuous

108
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,020
annoy me.

109
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,520
People like you

110
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,710
should learn

111
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,580
to be restrained and patient.

112
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,870
Xu Hanzhi,

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
why did you kill the Minister?

114
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,120
Are you turning against each other?

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,850
[Wine]

116
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,810
Take him away.

117
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,560
Yes.

118
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,560
We underestimated

119
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,000
Xu Hanzhi too much.

120
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,700
You underestimated me too much.

121
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,430
This is what I found in the room

122
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,600
where the Minister died.

123
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,590
It says that

124
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,890
three days later,

125
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,880
there will be a fireworks display to celebrate the designation of the Crown Prince of Northern Zhao.

126
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:51,090
Find a master skilled in firearms.

127
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,550
[Minister of Northern Zhao]

128
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:50,870
[The fireworks display will be the highlight of the celebration.]

129
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,870
[It will be meticulously prepared by the finest craftsmen in the country. The scale of the event will be...]

130
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,870
[We will do everything in our power to ensure the success of the celebration and meet the expectations of the people.]

131
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,270
During the opening

132
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,220
of the fireworks display,

133
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,159
I will personally serve as bait

134
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,650
to lure Xu Hanzhi to the watchtower.

135
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,340
If you take him to the watchtower,

136
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,950
I can't guarantee your safety.

137
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,940
What I want is for the assassin to strike him in one hit.

138
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,300
I never asked you to guarantee my safety.

139
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,050
To revenge,

140
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,100
you must prepare two coffins:

141
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,490
one for the enemy,

142
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,520
and one for yourself.

143
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,990
[Prince Jing's Mansion]

144
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,840
The Minister tragically died at Dengying Tower.

145
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,040
Your Highness,

146
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,850
please seek justice for our master!

147
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,850
[Minister]

148
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,880
The Minister was the head of the officials

149
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,060
and my right-hand man.

150
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,650
He mysteriously died

151
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,000
in the Crown Prince's territory.

152
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,580
My dear Hanzhi,

153
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,450
you dealt me such a great blow

154
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,970
when you just became the Crown Prince.

155
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,520
Eunuch Zhao,

156
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,400
what's Father's attitude towards this?

157
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,630
Your Highness,

158
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,200
this morning, His Majesty issued a decree

159
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,730
to posthumously award the Minister

160
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,730
the title of

161
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,870
Protector of the Nation

162
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,870
and ordered

163
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,940
a grand funeral.

164
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,190
So the Minister

165
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,800
died in vain?

166
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,670
If my father doesn't investigate,

167
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
doesn't that mean

168
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,040
he supports the Crown Prince?

169
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,940
In that case, if I continue to make things difficult for him in court,

170
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,790
it would likely be useless.

171
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,710
Your Highness,

172
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,110
it can't just end like this!

173
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:25,920
Shut up!

174
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,480
Let me ask you,

175
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,220
is the woman with the short sword,

176
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,780
who appeared after the Minister's death,

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,100
still in Dengying Tower?

178
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,600
Get to the heart of the matter.

179
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,680
Start with that woman,

180
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,240
and there will definitely be some gains.

181
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:42,880
Let's go.

182
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,820
I'm Shang Kefeng, the envoy of Southern Yue.

183
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,050
Greetings to Your Highness.

184
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,960
It just so happens that you have been appointed as the Crown Prince.

185
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,820
On behalf

186
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,280
of Southern Yue,

187
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,880
I have brought gifts to congratulate you.

188
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,520
I have countless treasures in my mansion.

189
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,970
General Shang, please take them back.

190
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,410
Is this attitude of yours

191
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,100
an indication that you look down upon Southern Yue's gifts?

192
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,920
I just look down on you.

193
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,470
Not only do the people of Southern Yue lose battle after battle,

194
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,050
but even their judgment in selecting envoys

195
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,320
is so poor.

196
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,690
Entrusting the fate of the country

197
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,670
to a defeated general

198
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,930
is bound to lead to a bad outcome.

199
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,750
Am I right,

200
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,890
little fish?

201
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,030
My visit to Northern Zhao

202
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,059
is sincerely aimed at seeking peace.

203
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,320
If things don't go as planned,

204
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,110
I wouldn't mind meeting you

205
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,559
on the battlefield.

206
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,390
I only lost to Zhou Chu,

207
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,360
but I have never lost to you.

208
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,560
What's wrong with you?

209
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,540
Why did you show up so rashly?

210
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,110
Why can't I come?

211
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,080
Lingzhi is not

212
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,440
the only thing inside, right?

213
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,010
Lingzhi is indeed the only thing,

214
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,380
but...

215
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,470
it's coated with a layer of poison powder.

216
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,710
Anyone who opens this box

217
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,260
will be poisoned immediately.

218
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,250
Why did you change our plan

219
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,230
without telling me?

220
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,150
Given your current status and position,

221
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,780
it's already difficult for you to get close to him,

222
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,640
let alone assassinate him.

223
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,810
Didn't you also get rejected

224
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,830
when you tried to present gifts as an envoy?

225
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,600
But I did send the poison

226
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,750
into Dengying Tower.

227
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,460
As long as you find an opportunity to get close to him

228
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,490
and open the box in front of him,

229
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,210
Xu Hanzhi will surely die.

230
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,210
I can give it a try.

231
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,030
But if it fails,

232
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,020
I hope you have a backup plan.

233
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,350
Of course.

234
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,180
[Dengying Tower]

235
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,930
Stop.

236
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,640
What are you hiding?

237
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,670
Take it out.

238
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,150
It's nothing.

239
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,440
You barely earn any money.

240
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,100
How could you afford this?

241
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:34,960
Tell me.

242
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,150
Where did you steal it from?

243
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,620
You misunderstand.

244
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,270
This is a Lingzhi I bought.

245
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,030
I want to give it to the Crown Prince as a gift.

246
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,890
The girls in Dengying Tower

247
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,820
all have the same intention.

248
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,470
But in the end,

249
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,960
the one who can serve the Crown Prince at any time

250
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,730
is only me.

251
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,960
Your Highness,

252
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,570
this is a thousand-year-old Lingzhi I found.

253
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,530
It's a small token of my appreciation.

254
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,070
Your Highness,

255
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,940
please forgive me.

256
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,590
Recently,

257
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,610
I've just recovered

258
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,670
from a cold.

259
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,780
And there are many affairs to handle in Dengying Tower.

260
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,060
It's yours.

261
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,510
Well...

262
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,290
Thank you, Your Highness.

263
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,630
Oh no.

264
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,700
Don't touch it!

265
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:20,780
You can't touch it.

266
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,750
-You are so nervous.
-Give it to me!

267
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,890
It seems this gift

268
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,120
is quite special.

269
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,780
It's because...

270
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,060
Actually, this gift

271
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,170
is something I wanted to give you.

272
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,780
So, no one else can touch it.

273
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,380
I don't care!

274
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,750
Give it to me!

275
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,700
You...

276
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,910
Where's Xue Shisan?

277
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,100
Hand over that maid, Xue Shisan!
