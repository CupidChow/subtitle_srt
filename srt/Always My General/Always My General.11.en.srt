00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,260
Why did you come with me

00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,390
to the eastern suburbs?

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,300
If I say it's for your safety,

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,270
would you believe me?

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,780
You used to always entrust your back to me,

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,490
but now you keep your thoughts so hidden.

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,670
From the moment the Jet Black Armored Cavalry died,

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,240
I stopped trusting anyone.

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,480
General,

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,000
there are many people eyeing you in the court.

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,820
You've barely managed to survive.

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,490
I don't want you to attract any more attention,

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,070
nor do I want anything to happen to you.

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,140
Do you think I'm afraid,

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,890
I am!

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,190
Is that okay?

20
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,890
I just want you to live well,

21

far away from any disputes.

22
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,220
I don't want you to face any more danger.

23
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,990
Are you afraid of me being in danger,

24
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,100
or of the king of Northern Zhao being in danger?

25
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,400
I dare you.

26
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,640
What wouldn't I dare to do?

27
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,590
Zhao Lie, the Prime Minister, was killed by you.

If you dare to lay a finger on him,

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,880
you'll have to deal with me first.

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,530
just admit it.

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,490
You do have selfish intentions.

36
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,640
I've been fighting on battlefields since I was young,

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,009
experiencing deceit and scheming.

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,410
The only thing that could comfort me

39
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,320
was my brothers in the army.

40
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,160
If you dare to stop me,

41
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,280
I will definitely kill you!

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,890

Xu Hanzhi, are you out of your mind?

46

In a royal family,

47
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,380
being cold-hearted is the hardest thing to avoid.

48
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,040

188
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,020
I want to hear from General Xue.

189
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,780
Oh, right.

190
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,100
Now we should call her

191
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,600
General Zhou, right?

192
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,010
I was wrongly accused and hid in Dengying Tower.

193
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,500
Now that my identity has been exposed, I have nothing to say.

194
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,880
Your Majesty, you may punish me as you wish.

195
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,190
I only ask that others not be implicated.

196
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,000
Very well.

197
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,610
I will grant your wish.

198
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,810
Throw her into the imperial prison.
