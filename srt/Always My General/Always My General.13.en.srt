[Always My General]

00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,690
[Episode 13]

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,440
[A Hut Outside Yaozhou City]

4
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,300
You're awake.

5
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,530
How did I survive?

6
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,210
A brother from the imperial guards

7
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,820
swapped you out.

8
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,890
The important thing is that you're alive.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,450
Who died in my place?

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,420
-Si.
-Your Highness.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,430
Go and call Han Qi.

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,510
It's time to go.

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,070
Captain Han left

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,000
two hours ago.

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,710
Where did he go?

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,800
Two hours ago,

17
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,960
a brother from the imperial guards reported

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,070
that His Majesty personally led the guards to the imperial prison.

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,240
Captain Han was afraid of implicating you,

20
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,660
so he went ahead.

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,500
He said

22
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,050
that in the next life, he'd follow you again.

23
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,770
And Shisan

24
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,700
would be sent to the thatched cottage outside the city

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,100
by his old subordinates who are planted in the imperial prison.

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,200
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:36,400
I'm sorry, Xu Hanzhi.

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,370
I really wish I were the one who had died.

29
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,380
Another innocent person has died because of me.

30
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,220
But I don't know why.

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,210
It's like I'm cursed.

32
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,600
Every time, I'm the one who survives.

33
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,660
Shisan,

34
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,530
it's not like that.

35
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,200
None of this is your fault.

36
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,520
I'm sad too.

37
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,240
Let's leave here now.

38
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,449
We can't let Han Qi die in vain,

39
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,500
okay?

40
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,740
Han Qi died with unfinished business.

41
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,870
Do you know who's behind all of this?

42
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,360
I am the source of everything.

43
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,110
Do you know that?

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,900
If I told you...

45
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,920
that the current Eldest Prince of Northern Zhao

46
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,910
is our old enemy,

47
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,310
would you still be able to remain this calm?

48
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,670
What do you mean?

49
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,070
During the incident at the fortified city,

50
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,740
the reason I survived

51
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,670
was all because of Shang Kefeng's rescue.

52
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,560
He used a secret technique unique to Southern Yue

53
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,100
and healed my fatal wound

54
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,630
and the scar on my face.

55
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,610
On the night the Minister died,

56
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,430
he sent me to Dengying Tower

57
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,770
to prepare for revenge against you.

58
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,570
But it's also because of this secret technique that saved me

59
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,850
that I became a tool controlled by Shang Kefeng.

60
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,680
It could always control my mind at specific moments,

61
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,180
making me obey Shang Kefeng's every command.

62
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,050
So it was Shang Kefeng

63
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,180
who was behind all of this.

64
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,630
When I caught Captain He,

65
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,540
I originally wanted to protect him,

66
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,810
but he seemed possessed

67
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,590
and killed himself with a sword right in front of me.

68
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,990
Could all of this be the work of those secret techniques?

69
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,320
The road ahead is perilous,

70
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,450
but I won't give up like this.

71
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,940
No one

72
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,140
is meant to be controlled.

73
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,450
Shang Kefeng,

74
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,560
I won't let you off.

75
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,360
You're controlled by the secret technique.

76
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,050
Your life is basically in Shang Kefeng's hands.

77
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,310
I can't take you into the city to go to the king's aid.

78
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,870
Kill Xu Hanzhi.

79
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:22,750
Go to Yaozhou City

80
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,480
and wait for my news.

81
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,530
No need.

82
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,190
The entire Northern Zhao

83
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,110
will never hear from you again.

84
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,110
My eyes!

85
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,760
My eyes!

86
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,920
It hurts so much!

87
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,790
Rush to the royal palace

88
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,130
to meet the new king.

89
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,150
Rush to the royal palace

90
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,280
to meet the new king.

91
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,270
Rush to the royal palace

92
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,620
to meet the new king!

93
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,570
Welcome home.

94
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,660
Why did you control me to hurt him?

95
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,810
Those who aspire to rule the world

96
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,300
must keep everything under their control.

97
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,940
I even had the King of Northern Zhao

98
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,400
wrapped around my finger.

99
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,160
So, how could your every move

100
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,440
escape my notice?

101
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,370
Our Northern Zhao suffers this calamity

102
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,000
all because I trusted a madman like you!

103
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,750
It seems you know nothing about the power of

104
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,090
Southern Yue's secret techniques.

105
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,430
My guards are stationed outside the palace gates,

106
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,210
ready to storm that dilapidated hut at my command at any moment,

107
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,120
bring Xu Hanzhi back, and crush him to dust.

108
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,930
Let's make a bet.

109
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,330
If you can make it out of the palace gates,

110
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,560
I'll call off this operation.

111
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,110
Deal.

112
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,540
Shang Kefeng,

113
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,580
you're not keeping your word.

114
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,480
I won't let you get away with this.

115
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,810
[Inner Palace of Northern Zhao]

116
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,080
I've told you before,

117
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,120
you can only be mine.

118
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,990
I'll treat you well from now on,

119
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,270
as long as you don't leave me.

120
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,460
You are right, Your Highness.

121
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,710
I will certainly obey your every word

122
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,990
and won't let you down.

123
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,580
You should have been obedient earlier,

124
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,170
and then you wouldn't have suffered so much.

125
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,590
Xu Hanzhi...

126
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,810
I feel pity for him.

127
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,700
You took away his sight with your own hands.

128
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,400
He wouldn't have suffered so much either.

129
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,380
Do you feel sorry for him?

130
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,840
No, I don't.

131
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,430
Good.

132
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,370
Enjoy the glory and wealth that I give you.

133
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,980
I'll take you out of the palace today.

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,850
A country

135
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,560
cannot go one day without a ruler.

136
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,960
For the lasting peace and prosperity of Northern Zhao,

137
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,260
I have decided

138
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,880
to ascend to the throne immediately.

139
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,520
My loyal ministers,

140
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,130
what are your thoughts?

141
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,880
Your Highness,

142
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,540
the King has passed away,

143
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,540
yet the cause of his death is unclear,

144
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,950
and the Second Prince

145
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,020
has gone missing.

146
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,510
If you were to hastily ascend the throne,

147
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,420
I'm afraid

148
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,770
it would be difficult to gain the support of the people.

149
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,860
[Duan Feng, Minister of Northern Zhao]

150
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,970
Minister Zhong, loyal and filial,

151
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:45,840
has followed our late king to the afterlife.

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,460
My dear ministers,

153
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,000
do you have any other thoughts?

154
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,420
Long live the King!

155
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,770
Long live the King!

156
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,740
Revenge is mine.
