00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,310
[Always My General]

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,010
[Episode 14]

3
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,750
[Yaozhou City Market]

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,210
Brothers of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,210
followed me to battle at the frontier.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,060
They have witnessed the white mountains and black waters,

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,590
and the desolate deserts,

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,920
but they have never experienced the prosperity before us,

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,150
the flourishing era.

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,560
Although they have not experienced it,

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,640
every brick and tile

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,180
was exchanged with their blood and lives.

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,600
It's a pity that the fruits of victory

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,310
are all taken by the noble families.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,490
The people of Northern Zhao

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,060
can hardly touch any of it.

17
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,560
The hard work of the Southern Yue people throughout the year

18
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,880
all goes to Northern Zhao.

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,660
This is why we see

20
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,360
the grand scene of the first city in the Central Plains.

21
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,780
For ten years,

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,600
it has always been this way.

23
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,470
You came here ten years ago?

24
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,810
Ten years ago,

25
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,270
I was still a bodyguard of the Southern Yue royal family,

26
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,560
and escorted the King of Southern Yue

27
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,860
and his family to pay tribute.

28
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,519
Since Southern Yue was once a vassal of Northern Zhao,

29
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,130
why did they lead troops to invade year after year?

30
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,130
Because back then,

31
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,940
on the way back from paying tribute,

32
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,430
the King of Southern Yue was killed by the King of Northern Zhao outside Yaozhou City.

33
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,680
That catastrophe

34
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,360
not only heavily damaged the Southern Yue royal family,

35
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,450
but also made us lose a very important person.

36
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,760
Who?

37
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,360
The Southern Yue Princess I was responsible for protecting closely.

38
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,730
The Southern Yue Princess?

39
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,520
Since then...

40
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,039
-Perhaps with this clue...
-I swore...

41
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,030
We can get something.

42
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,910
To take revenge on this untrustworthy

43
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,759
and militaristic country.

44
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,360
I didn't expect

45
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,460
someone like you,

46
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,240
a complete ambitious person,

47
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,690
to have such a deep, affectionate side?

48
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,410
Since ancient times, deep feelings have always left only hatred,

49
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,810
and those with deep feelings are always hurt by the heartless.

50
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,020
Today I reveal my heart to you,

51
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,240
hoping you can move forward with this burden.

52
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,740
Life is vast like the sea,

53
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,090
with mountains and rivers stretching far and wide.

54
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,590
Who can guarantee that they will never let anyone down

55
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,040
throughout their entire life?

56
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:27,840
If true feelings are useless,

57
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,120
then turn them into a tool.

58
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,290
Your Highness!

59
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,420
Han Qi?

60
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,680
What happened to Your Highness's eyes?

61
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,560
You're still alive?

62
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,640
Who allowed you to act on your own

63
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,320
and run to the imperial prison to sacrifice yourself?

64
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,090
You think you're familiar enough with me

65
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,050
to disregard military laws and regulations?

66
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,750
I know I acted without orders.

67
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,780
My crime is unforgivable.

68
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:58,230
But it's better than Your Highness risking your life.

69
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,320
Even if I die,

70
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,520
I have no regrets.

71
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,050
Your crime is not acting on your own,

72
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,800
but almost causing me to lose

73
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,360
a loyal brother.

74
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,490
Back then, when the Jet Black Armored Cavalry was wiped out in the fortified city,

75
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,870
all our brothers perished.

76
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,700
How can I allow you to be so reckless again?

77
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,760
Now that I have returned alive

78
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,040
to continue serving Your Highness,

79
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,700
I shall cherish every moment.

80
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,170
However, regarding the matter of the imperial prison,

81
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,860
there are too many suspicious aspects.

82
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,540
What's suspicious?

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,320
The one who attacked Miss Shisan in the imperial prison

84
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,540
wasn't a prison guard at all.

85
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,540
but His Majesty's personal guard and attendant.

86
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,960
Are you Captain Han?

87
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,260
I am Han Qi.

88
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,460
The back of the blade was used when striking.

89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,540
The person is just unconscious.

90
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,770
Quickly find a headless corpse.

91
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,480
Change the clothes.

92
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,770
Regarding the gold bars given by Miss Si,

93
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,760
we can consider it accounted for.

94
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,780
You've returned from Yaozhou City.

95
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,680
Do you have any news about His Majesty and Shisan?

96
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,530
Your Highness,

97
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,180
His Majesty...

98
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,710
What happened to His Majesty?

99
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,450
His Majesty has passed away.

100
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,230
What happened to His Majesty?

101
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,200
His Majesty has passed away.

102
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,210
His Majesty suddenly passed away,

103
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,130
and the court officials nominated the Eldest Prince to succeed the throne.

104
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,310
Many were still waiting to see how things would unfold,

105
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,360
but when Xue Shisan, the commander of the imperial guards

106
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,770
entered the palace for an audience today,

107
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,830
almost everyone became convinced

108
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,050
that Northern Zhao is destined to be the Eldest Prince's domain.

109
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,010
Xue Shisan.

110
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,870
Hanzhi.

111
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,670
Where are you?

112
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,409
Xue Shisan.

113
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,500
Hanzhi!

114
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,490
Where are you?

115
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,060
Hanzhi.

116
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,840
Hanzhi.

117
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,160
Take me back to Yaozhou City.

118
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,510
Why not go to the northern border first

119
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,120
to organize an army to capture the king,

120
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,510
and then return to Yaozhou City?

121
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,810
Capturing the king

122
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,390
means civil war.

123
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,710
As long as I'm here,

124
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,930
he won't be in charge of the country.

125
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,740
[Yongming Gate]

126
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,330
Hanzhi?

127
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,570
Where have you been?

128
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,630
We couldn't find you when Father passed away.

129
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,730
I didn't have anyone to consult with.

130
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,560
What happened to your eyes?

131
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,950
Who did this?

132
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,640
I'll make them

133
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,420
pay.

134
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,600
The reason I came back

135
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,900
is to investigate the cause of Father's death

136
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,870
to give an explanation to all the court officials,

137
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,790
and to give myself an explanation.

138
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,640
Alright.

139
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,850
Then, as your elder brother,

140
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,850
I'll let the Grand Marshal

141
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,410
lend you a hand.

142
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,600
Grand Marshal

143
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,980
Xue Shisan requests an audience.

144
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,450
Shisan,

145
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,990
investigating the cause of the late king's death

146
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,330
is a matter of great importance.

147
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,200
I trouble you

148
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,700
to take good care

149
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,900
of Hanzhi.

150
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,290
Yes, Your Highness.

151
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,470
The title of Guardian

152
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,580
is only bestowed upon founding dynasty's renowned generals

153
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,230
with unparalleled military achievements.

154
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,110
Now that it's bestowed upon General Xue,

155
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:39,130
it's quite fitting.

156
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,800
Your Highness flatters me.

157
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,210
My current position

158
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,650
is merely a result of luck.

159
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,320
Luck?

160
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,960
General Xue, you deposed two princes of Northern Zhao

161
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,720
and put a defeated general on this dragon throne.

162
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,890
You call this luck?

163
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,830
Hanzhi,

164
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,160
I understand.

165
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,630
These past few days,

166
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,840
we've all experienced many changes.

167
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,340
You must be tired.

168
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,270
I barely understood

169
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,510
any of what you said.

170
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,930
You don't need to understand.

171
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,520
Why are you so tired, sister?

172
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,570
Xu Hanzhi has returned.

173
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,090
How is His Highness doing?

174
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,620
Thanks to me,

175
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,710
he is now blind.

176
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,530
What?

177
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,930
No wonder,

178
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,720
the Eldest Prince just sent someone to give me orders,

179
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,910
telling me to return to Dengying Tower to take care of His Highness.

180
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,120
I was wondering

181
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,430
why he would care so much

182
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,560
about his brother.

183
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,770
So it's because His Highness

184
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,200
is no longer a threat to him.

185
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,440
As long as Xu Hanzhi is alive,

186
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,440
he will always be a threat to him.

187
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,390
So the Eldest Prince

188
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,890
will make a move against him sooner or later.

189
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,080
Si,

190
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,410
leave now

191
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,580
and go to Dengying Tower immediately.

192
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,330
Help me take good care of him.

193
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,660
If there's any sign of trouble,

194
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,080
send me a message right away.

195
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,240
Don't worry, sister.

196
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,560
You called for me?

197
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,190
The backlash from manipulating secret techniques is getting worse.

198
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,070
I don't have much time left.

199
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,470
General Shang, you are about to ascend the throne.

200
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,000
Once we take Northern Zhao,

201
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,690
merge with Southern Yue and obtain the royal family's antidote,

202
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,070
won't it be easy?

203
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,560
The commander's tally of Northern Zhao is in Xue Shisan's hands.

204
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,080
She still has feelings for Xu Hanzhi.

205
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,480
If we can't secure military power,

206
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,920
how can I intimidate the Southern Yue royal family?

207
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,220
And how can I rescue your parents who are imprisoned

208
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,350
in Southern Yue's prison?

209
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,710
Just tell me what you want me to do.

210
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,410
However, I have something to say first.

211
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,680
Xu Hanzhi and Sister Shisan have both treated me well.

212
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,720
I absolutely refuse to do anything that will stain my hands with blood.

213
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,010
Don't worry.

214
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,630
You're the daughter of a thief.

215
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,220
You just need to return to Dengying Tower

216
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,200
to steal back the commander's tally.

217
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,140
As for the bloody business,

218
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,570
I'll leave that to those who specialize in killing.

219
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,140
When General Shang unifies Southern Yue and Northern Zhao,

220
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,480
don't forget to fulfill your promise to save my parents.

221
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,690
You still like this outfit, as expected.

222
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,910
The General Yunhui who single-handedly invaded Southern Yue

223
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,220
has returned again.

224
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,140
So what if I'm back?

225
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,670
Aren't I still under your control?

226
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,470
You look so fragile right now.

227
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,770
If Xu Hanzhi weren't blind,

228
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,180
and he saw you like this,

229
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,720
he would be heartbroken.

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,510
In my current state,

231
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,050
aren't you afraid the court officials will become suspicious?

232
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,750
Aren't you worried about the secret technique

233
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,030
being discovered by everyone?

234
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,560
You want me to give you the antidote?

235
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,770
Once you're no longer under my control,

236
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,530
you'll surely side with Xu Hanzhi again.

237
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,120
I won't take such a risk.

238
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,230
Then at your coronation ceremony,

239
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,050
announce to the whole world

240
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,540
that I am your queen.

241
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,520
♫Sudden smoke rises♫

242
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,530
Do you mean it?

243
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:08,880
♫Through the precariously collapsing city walls♫

244
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,560
Beneath your throne,

245
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,930
I don't need to wear armor.

246
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,160
For you, I'm willing to...

247
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,990
♫Tearing through the night♫

248
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,940
♫Suddenly taking the lead, secretly stealing♫

249
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:26,280
♫Beneath the feather fan, people's hearts are dark, fading away in smoke♫

250
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:32,290
♫How is fate rewritten?♫

251
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,580
Wear a phoenix crown.

252
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,430
Then I want Xu Hanzhi

253
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,170
to crown me personally

254
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,170
and swear allegiance.

255
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,570
If he refuses,

256
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,240
I will kill him with my own hands.

257
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,620
Indeed.

258
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,010
Once people have power,

259
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,020
they will certainly obtain

260
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,930
what they desire.

261
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,800
♫Before dawn breaks♫

262
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:15,390
♫I will leap into the strange storm of calamity♫

263
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:20,760
♫Who will end it?♫

264
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,090
♫The sparks will set the plains ablaze♫

265
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:32,640
♫History is written by the victors' songs♫

266
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:38,380
♫How will it replay?♫

267
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:47,790
♫Who can compete with the heroes of the world?♫

268
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:55,830
♫Who can compete with the heroes of the world?♫

269
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,800
♫The chaos of conquest♫

270
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,850
♫Is all due to my strategic game of deception♫

271
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,850
♫The heavens are silent♫

272
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,210
♫In the chaos, donning armor, with swords and horses♫

273
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,570
♫Even kings and nobles♫

274
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,070
♫Are just broken spears lost in the waves♫

275
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:29,350
♫Centuries of bloodshed♫

276
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,590
♫The plans for the world♫
