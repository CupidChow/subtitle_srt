1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,220
[Always My General]

2
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,040
[Episode 8]

3
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,590
Prince of Ning.

4
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,380
Forgive me, I failed

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,620
to teach my daughter properly,

6
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,150
which led to Ningde's arrogance and reckless behavior,

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,460
causing trouble

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,210
for Your Highness.

9
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,830
Princess Ningde came to visit the Crown Prince

10
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,280
after a long journey,

11
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,240
and on a whim, she had a few more drinks.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,150
Right now,

13
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,460
Princess Ningde is quite drunk,

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,580
so it's unlikely she'll be able to leave anytime soon.

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,770
Lord Ning,

16
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,560
would you like to join us for a few drinks?

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,220
May I ask,

18
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,360
what is your honorable name?

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,390
Father, you've become so forgetful.

20
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,500
This is my future husband,

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,490
the Crown Prince of Northern Zhao,

22
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,420
Brother Hanzhi.

23
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,280
Nonsense!

24
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:13,890
Guards!

25
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,630
Yes, my Lord!

26
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,730
Take her home.

27
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,460
Yes, my Lord!

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,280
It's getting late today.

29
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,550
I'll take my leave now.

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,570
I'll come another day to apologize properly.

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,580
You're too formal with me, Prince of Ning.

32
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,200
I'll be at Dengying Tower at any time,

33
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,490
awaiting your esteemed presence.

34
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,000
How could you disregard your status as a princess

35
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,320
and spend all your time with him?

36
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,240
What will the other noble families in Yaozhou City think of this?

37
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:54,850
You control the Xiqiang Wolfguards

38
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,020
and govern a region.

39
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,880
Why should you care what they think?

40
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,250
If I marry Brother Hanzhi,

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,890
you will be the future father-in-law of the nation.

42
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,260
Why bother playing political games

43
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,690
with a bunch of old men?

44
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,500
You...

45
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,770
Since you've made up your mind,

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,920
invite him over for a chat.

47
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,770
Sure.

48
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,210
Thank you, Father.

49
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:29,960
My Lord,

50
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,780
are you going to fight against the Crown Prince?

51
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,250
Everything just feels

52
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,320
too staged.

53
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,270
Why not take the initiative

54
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,280
instead of waiting to be taken down?

55
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,770
The Crown Prince

56
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,270
and that fake one,

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,900
I won't

58
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,790
let either of them off the hook.

59
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,970
Si,

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,170
where's Shisan?

61
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,590
She said that drinking while injured

62
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,360
would slow down Your Highness's recovery,

63
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,530
so she went out early this morning to get some nutrients for you.

64
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,120
Was she wearing men's clothes or women's clothes?

65
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,710
Men's clothes.

66
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,100
Gather the guards.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,140
Come with me to rescue her.

68
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,640
Yes, Your Highness!

69
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,930
Greetings, Prince of Ning.

70
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,250
Ningde.

71
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,720
Go check if the banquet is ready.

72
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,910
I'm going to have a good talk

73
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,090
with the Crown Prince.

74
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,110
Yes, Father.

75
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,329
You're pretending to be the Crown Prince and causing trouble,

76
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,400
and now you're targeting me?

77
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,100
Tell me,

78
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,980
who exactly are you?

79
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,290
Prince of Ning, for someone as noble as you,
your memory certainly seems short.

80
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,150
I'm Zhou Chu,

81
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,080
the soul who was killed by your longbows

82
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,870
in the Fortified City!

83
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,140
You...

84
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,649
You're Zhou Chu?

85
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,760
If it weren't for the Prince of Ning's invitation,

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,680
I, Zhou Chu,

87
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,200
would never have had such an opportunity

88
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,659
to be this close to you, within just ten steps.

89
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,970
Within ten steps,

90
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,220
even if I die right here,

91
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,260
I'm sure I can still

92
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,450
be able to kill you.

93
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,440
Stop!

94
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,110
I can't believe you used your own daughter

95
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,820
to set up a banquet trap in your mansion.

96
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,550
Do you really see Ningde

97
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,320
as nothing more than a tool?

98
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,180
You can choose whom you love

99
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,510
based on your feelings,

100
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,890
but I

101
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,640
can't deal with my political enemy based on how I feel!

102
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,540
We can't let him leave today.

103
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,570
Otherwise,

104
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,360
the Prince of Ning's Mansion will never have peace!

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,040
So you think that if your daughter dies in front of you,

106
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,510
the Prince of Ning's Mansion will be at peace?

107
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,770
Let's go.

108
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,470
Follow them.

109
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,220
Yes, my Lord.

110
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,290
[Fisherman Pier]

111
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,040
My father will never let you off the hook

112
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,430
unless he kills you.

113
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,800
The safest plan right now

114
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,390
is for you to join the Meng City merchant caravan.

115
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,140
Here's the nomadic clothing inside.

116
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,390
Just put it on

117
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:53,590
and stick the fake beard on your face.

118
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,280
Remember,

119
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,890
once you're out,

120
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,530
you must not say a word.

121
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,610
I'll miss you so much.

122
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,060
Go!

123
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,320
Ningde.

124
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,960
Wait.

125
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,880
Ningde.

126
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,290
I can't leave.

127
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:04,870
If you don't leave,

128
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,870
what are you staying here for?

129
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,630
You're not even the real Crown Prince.

130
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,240
So she already knew?

131
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,440
It's precisely because I'm not the real Crown Prince

132
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,110
that I have even less reason to leave.

133
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,870
Can't I be a reason for you to leave?

134
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,330
Whether you're the real Crown Prince

135
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,550
or even Xu Hanzhi, it doesn't matter.

136
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,830
What matters is that

137
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,550
I want to be with you.

138
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,520
I want to escape

139
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,110
this web of deceit with you.

140
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,830
I never thought the ruthless Prince of Ning

141
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,010
would have such an innocent daughter.

142
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,750
Now that she's falling for me,

143
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,930
I can't hurt her more.

144
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,100
After all, I still have to

145
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:47,840
kill her father.

146
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,020
Ningde,

147
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,040
wait for me outside the city gate.

148
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,500
After tonight,

149
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,340
I will definitely give you an explanation,

150
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,180
okay?

151
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:07,600
Hya!

152
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,490
Hya!

153
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,320
The noble families fear that I am intimidating.

154
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,490
I laugh at them for not knowing how hard it is

155
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,340
for a woman to make her way in the world.

156
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,460
Where is my daughter?

157
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,650
Gone.

158
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,159
Attack!

159
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,680
Shisan,

160
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,950
don't do anything impulsive.

161
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,070
I must give an explanation to the Jet Black Armored Cavalry today!

162
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,000
General Zhou Chu,

163
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,000
the traitor who betrayed his country,

164
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,430
must be executed without mercy!
