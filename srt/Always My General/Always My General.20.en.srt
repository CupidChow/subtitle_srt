00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,330
[Always My General]

2
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,140
[Episode 20]

3
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,080
It's not that I don't want to help,

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,780
but I really can't.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,000
Is there truly no other way

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,150
except for intercourse?

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,250
I'll keep searching,

8
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,900
but you need to be prepared.

9
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,210
Thank you.

10
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,100
Why are you up getting dressed

11
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,670
instead of resting?

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,670
I've spent most of my life

13
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,790
dressed as a man,

14
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,349
and I've never really had the chance

15
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:06,510
to enjoy dressing up.

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,860
Besides,

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,430
I don't want to face you

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,430
every day looking like a wreck,

19
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,620
especially in these final moments.

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,890
Nonsense!

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,260
You're in your prime,

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,820
as beautiful as a flower.

23
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,060
We still have a long life ahead of us.

24
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,180
That's right.

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,850
But I think

26
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,690
when you meet the right person,

27
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,560
even a brief moment

28
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,700
can feel like eternity.

29
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,200
Hanzhi,

30
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,370
after all this time together,

31
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,910
we've been to so many places.

32
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,710
I'm truly content.

33
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,229
I'm not content.

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,060
I still want to watch the sun rise and set with you,

35
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,580
enjoy the flowers and birds,

36
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,280
and grow old

37
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,930
with you.

38
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,360
I'll spend the rest of my life watching the clouds and the moon...

39
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,979
I will never let my general down.

40
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,090
I won't let you down.

41
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
Shisan,

42
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,230
you've drugged the wine.

43
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,990
Hanzhi,

44
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,870
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,620
I don't want you to see me

46
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,360
in this state, consumed by poison.

47
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,370
Just remember me as I am now.

48
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,090
You...

49
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,470
You're decisive in battle,

50
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,020
but when it comes to drugging, you're not quite there.

51
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,510
You can't fool me.

52
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,060
I told you,

53
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,980
don't even think about leaving me.

54
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,760
I've heard there's a way to cure the poison,

55
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,470
but if that's the only way,

56
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,310
I'd rather die.

57
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,500
If you've made up your mind,

58
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,690
then I'll die with you.

59
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,180
You still have Northern Zhao to take care of.

60
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,170
You still have the people of Northern Zhao to consider.

61
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,680
You need to find a way to save them!

62
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,560
We made an oath with the brothers of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry.

63
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,010
We'll live together and die together.

64
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,400
We must avenge them together.

65
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,360
And I, Xu Hanzhi,

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,829
made a vow to you, Xue Shisan.

67
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,470
I'll hold your hand,

68
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,120
and this will never change forever.

69
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,580
I've found a way to neutralize the poison.

70
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,140
Come with me.

71
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,890
Look at these.

72
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,450
What are these things?

73
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,770
These jars contain

74
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,510
the remains of fallen soldiers,

75
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,770
from which a thousand poisonous insects have been cultivated.

76
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
If one can endure being devoured by these insects,

77
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,870
maybe the poison can be used to counteract

78
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,230
and cure the toxin in you.

79
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,640
So you're saying

80
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,590
Shisan has to try it herself?

81
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,180
I searched through the entire library

82
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,290
and finally found this secret detox method

83
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,890
in an old Southern Yue book.

84
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,950
But...

85
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,630
this method has been lost for a long time.

86
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,880
We don't know if it's real.

87
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,120
Moreover,

88
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,950
this method is extremely risky,

89
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,340
with a 90% chance of death.

90
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,520
Do you dare to try it?

91
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,320
I'll try.

92
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,100
Shisan.

93
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,909
Go wait for me outside.

94
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,310
All lives

95
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,990
have their fate.

96
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,230
Heaven knows,

97
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,340
how I wish I could take her pain for her.

98
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,480
Every scream she makes

99
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,240
feels like a thousand arrows through my heart.

100
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,460
I feel

101
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,200
every bit of her pain.

102
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,790
This night

103
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:36,970
feels like it has lasted for a century.

104
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,340
How is this possible?

105
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,300
Could she have Qilin Blood?

106
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,630
Is she my...

107
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:13,930
Shisan,

108
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,710
are you alright?

109
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,300
I'm fine.

110
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,270
When I first went in,

111
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,720
I thought I was dying.

112
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,860
It felt like a thousand arrows piercing my heart.

113
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,450
But then,

114
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,710
everything just became clear.

115
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,840
I don't know what happened.

116
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,930
With all those poisons devouring you,

117
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,140
yet you're completely fine.

118
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,270
There's only one explanation,

119
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,460
you must have

120
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,790
Qilin Blood in you!

121
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,460
That means...

122
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,640
you are the princess of our Southern Yue.

123
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,810
You're my younger sister!

124
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,240
What?

125
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,770
Fifteen years ago,

126
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,960
Father and Mother left me to govern

127
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,980
while they took my sister

128
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,290
to pay tribute to Northern Zhao.

129
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,710
However, all three of them

130
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,050
tragically died

131
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,500
in Yaozhou City,

132
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,260
leaving only this

133
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,780
memory of us.

134
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,370
After that battle, with my loved ones gone,

135
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,540
I buried all the painful memories.

136
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,470
Father!

137
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,910
Mother!

138
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,810
The Jet Black Armored Cavalry took me in...

139
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,080
Wake up, please,

140
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,450
allowing us to meet again.

141
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,809
Father.

142
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,549
Mother.

143
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,340
So, in that case,

144
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,850
my Father

145
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,840
is the one who killed your father?

146
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,670
Aren't my hands

147
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,550
also stained with the blood of my own people?

148
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,320
The King of Northern Zhao killed my parents,

149
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,780
initiating the eight-year war

150
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,270
between Northern Zhao and Southern Yue.

151
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,000
In the end, it was you and I who worked together

152
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,390
to bring an end to this war,

153
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,630
which should've ended long ago.

154
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,600
We did what we could

155
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,830
and all we were supposed to do.

156
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,740
Let our fathers' grudges

157
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,950
stay in the past.

158
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,240
The most important thing right now

159
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,770
is to stop Shang Kefeng

160
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,840
from dragging these two regions

161
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,870
into the abyss again.

162
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,770
Brother,

163
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,020
from now on,

164
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,320
you need to cut off all communication between Southern Yue

165
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,020
and Shang Kefeng.

166
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,080
Also, you need to take down

167
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,550
his old network within the military.

168
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,980
Your Highness,

169
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,280
after we get back to Northern Zhao,

170
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,500
you'll have to help me set up a scene for Shang Kefeng,

171
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,310
so I can find a way to slip back into his circle.

172
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,170
Alright.

173
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,890
There's someone else waiting for us in Northern Zhao.

174
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,230
That person is clearly waiting for you.

175
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,520
Brother,

176
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,870
we need to return to Northern Zhao as soon as possible.

177
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,450
We'll meet again in the future.

178
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,120
Alright.

179
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,340
Even if I see a friend off for a thousand miles,

180
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,180
in the end, we still have to part ways.

181
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,600
Your journey back

182
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,860
will be full of uncertainties.

183
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,590
Xu Hanzhi,

184
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,060
you must protect my sister well.

185
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,140
In terms of national strength,

186
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,620
Southern Yue may not be powerful,

187
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,890
but when it comes to the art of poison,

188
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,580
no one dares to challenge us.

189
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,190
Understood.

190
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,520
Brother,

191
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,480
farewell.

192
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,380
Hya!

193
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:21,870
Hya!

194
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:22,450
Hya!

195
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,700
Hya!

196
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,260
Hya!

197
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,290
Hya!

198
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,460
If I remember correctly,

199
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,930
you're still waiting for an answer from me.

200
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,030
It doesn't matter.

201
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,740
I'm glad you're back.

202
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,380
We have returned,

203
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,140
but we're about to lose our home.

204
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,400
Shang Kefeng is about to take the throne,

205
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,650
and two hundred years of Northern Zhao’s history

206
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,480
are coming to an end.

207
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,000
But now the entire court

208
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,550
is under Shang Kefeng's control.

209
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,970
What should we do?

210
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,250
We're the only ones

211
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,260
who still have the power to stop him.

212
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,800
Are you willing to join us?

213
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,530
Sure.

214
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,810
♫Sudden smoke rises♫

215
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:56,360
♫Through the precariously collapsing city walls♫

216
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,730
Let's split up.

217
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,680
You two disguise yourselves and enter the palace

218
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,320
to search for clues about Eldest Prince.

219
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:02,350
♫Tearing through the night♫

220
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,720
I'll approach Shang Kefeng

221
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,770
to find out his next move.

222
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,380
♫Suddenly taking the lead, secretly stealing♫

223
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:13,920
♫Beneath the feather fan, people's hearts are dark, fading away in smoke♫

224
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:19,770
♫How is fate rewritten?♫

225
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:27,830
♫Who can compete with the heroes of the world?♫

226
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,470
♫The chaos of conquest♫

227
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,710
♫Is all due to my strategic game of deception♫

228
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,000
♫The heavens are silent♫

229
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,740
♫In the chaos, donning armor, with swords and horses♫

230
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,810
♫Even kings and nobles♫

231
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,170
♫Are just broken spears lost in the waves♫

232
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,800
♫Centuries of bloodshed♫

233
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,130
♫The plans for the world♫
