1
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,350
[Always My General]

2
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,070
[Episode 22]

3
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,350
Shang Kefeng's guards

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,420
were originally

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,980
expanded from my garrison troops.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:22,560
But

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,150
now the commanders of each battalion

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,490
have all been replaced by his trusted men from Southern Yue.

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,850
I have already marked

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,390
the defensive positions for you.

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,180
Although the Xiqiang Wolfguard troops are formidable,

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,960
if we want to defeat them,

13
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,580
it will inevitably be a fierce battle.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,080
May Shisan's operation tomorrow

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,450
goes smoothly.

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,560
Otherwise,

17
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,380
this will be our last time

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,280
seeing this palace's

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,430
magnificent splendor.

20
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,750
Man proposes,

21
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,120
Heaven disposes.

22
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,600
Your Highness,

23
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,020
Shang Kefeng's men are coming to kill us.

24
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,570
It seems Xue Shisan is leading them.

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,070
Was her poison

26
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,210
not completely removed?

27
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,910
If you saw Xue Shisan attack

28
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,310
and still managed to return alive,

29
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,510
it proves she's already gone easy on us.

30
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,960
She's buying us time.

31
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,210
Han Qi.

32
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,510
You take my brother and leave through the back door first.

33
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:14,260
Ningde and I

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
will help divert the pursuers for you.

35
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,080
Yes.

36
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:16,660
Hanzhi,

37
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,539
you can do it.

38
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,990
I'll be waiting for your good news.

39
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,480
Han Qi,

40
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,870
let's go.

41
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,289
Yes.

42
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,120
We meet again.

43
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,020
Vice General Xu,

44
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,300
Back then, you used the Red Flame Scarab to set fire to our camps.

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,960
You killed my three younger brothers.

46
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,830
Today,

47
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,530
I'm here to settle the score with you.

48
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
One got away.

49
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,160
What a pity.

50
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,690
You almost hit me by mistake.

51
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,810
The body wasn't found.

52
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,030
What makes you say

53
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,130
Xu Hanzhi is dead?

54
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,210
I used

55
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,210
a heavy bow.

56
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,470
Any living creature hit by the arrow

57
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,890
has no chance of survival.

58
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,260
Enough.

59
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,560
Anyway, I

60
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,280
had someone apply poison to the arrowheads in advance.

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,720
As long as there's

62
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,190
even a small wound on the body,

63
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,410
he has absolutely no chance of survival.

64
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,990
After tonight,

65
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,330
no one will be able to shake my reign.

66
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,530
Xu Hanzhi.

67
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,290
You must not come to any harm.

68
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,170
Aren't you tired of holding it up like this?

69
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,870
As long as you like it,

70
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,660
I'm willing to hold it forever.

71
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,540
The lanterns here are so beautiful.

72
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,400
♫Climb the city tower and look at the vast land♫

73
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,600
If only time could stop here.

74
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,760
I'm afraid I won't be able to see

75
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:50,010
♫Yet why sigh by the railing?♫

76
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,940
such beautiful lanterns again.

77
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,329
Why do you say that?

78
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,270
♫From youthful battles to now, hair frosted with gray♫

79
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,950
I'm just saying.

80
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:02,660
♫Though ruling the world, it's hard to hold her once more♫

81
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,410
Here.

82
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:00,260
Have a bite.

83
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,310
Is it good?

84
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:08,810
♫The northern wind chills to the bone♫

85
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:05,870
Delicious.

86
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,360
♫This night, snow blankets the shoulders♫

87
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,200
Shisan,

88
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,740
no matter what happens,

89
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,940
♫Iron hooves shatter golden armor♫

90
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,029
don't leave me behind.

91
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,329
♫Banners flutter fiercely in the wind♫

92
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,410
Got it.

93
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,530
♫A bright moon reflects spilled blood♫

94
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,810
♫Three decades of relentless battles♫

95
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,400
♫Now no one remains by my side♫

96
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,310
♫What use is reclaiming the land?♫

97
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,080
Let's go ahead and release the blessing lanterns.

98
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,450
♫Unfulfilled and incomplete♫

99
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,170
♫A sudden pipa echoes beyond the city walls♫

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,250
♫A vision of you gently plucking the strings♫

101
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,140
-I hope he...
-I hope she...

102
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,980
♫Playing a melody♫

103
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,140
-Lives the rest of his life in peace and happiness.
-Lives the rest of her life in peace and happiness.

104
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,060
♫Until tears run dry and hearts break apart♫

105
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
What wish did you make?

106
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,950
If you tell your wish, it won't come true.

107
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,100
But if you don't say it,

108
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,800
how will the other person know?

109
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,130
Then I'll tell you

110
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,790
what my wish is.

111
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,720
♫The northern wind chills to the bone♫

112
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,110
♫This night, snow blankets the shoulders♫

113
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,880
♫Iron hooves shatter golden armor♫

114
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,830
♫Banners flutter fiercely in the wind♫

115
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,460
You're very lucky.

116
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,050
Half an inch more

117
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,510
and the arrow would have pierced your vital point.

118
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,740
This isn't luck.

119
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,840
It's understanding.

120
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,690
This copper coin

121
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,190
was chosen from the first salary I received

122
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,130
after joining the Jet Black Armored Cavalry.

123
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,740
Every captain in the Jet Black Armored Cavalry

124
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,850
chooses a copper coin

125
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,400
and places it over their heart.

126
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,780
This method

127
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,409
was thought up by Shisan

128
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,590
before we deliberately got captured

129
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,140
and entered the military camp

130
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,880
during the battle in Northern Zhao.

131
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,550
What?

132
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,550
To create the illusion of infighting?

133
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,700
To infiltrate the enemy,

134
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,090
implicating each other to gain trust

135
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,520
is unavoidable.

136
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,330
However,

137
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,590
I trust Shisan.

138
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,520
You trust Shisan,

139
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,590
and you should trust me too.

140
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,520
Your Highness,

141
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,360
Shisan has sent a message asking us to start the operation.

142
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:35,840
Xu Hanzhi.

143
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,900
Han Qi.

144
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,890
You lead the border troops to block the passage,

145
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,020
contain the imperial guards,

146
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,370
and protect the inner palace.

147
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,500
Ningde.

148
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,440
The Eldest Prince.

149
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,360
You lead the local troops and Xiqiang Wolfguard

150
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,540
to directly enter the inner court,

151
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,640
protect the court officials,

152
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,840
and execute the traitors.

153
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,890
I humbly

154
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,430
congratulate Your Majesty on ascending the throne.

155
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,530
May Your Majesty

156
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,290
live forever

157
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:02,940
and ever,

158
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,090
for countless ages to come!

159
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,500
I, Princess Ningde,

160
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,430
wish Your Majesty

161
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,510
eternal reign

162
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,770
and everlasting prosperity for all people.

163
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,750
Everyone is in position as planned,

164
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,290
except for the Eldest Prince.

165
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,000
However,

166
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,990
the inner court of the royal city is under our control.

167
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,810
There won't be any chaos.

168
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,680
Brother Hanzhi will enter the palace soon.

169
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,320
We only need to delay for a moment.

170
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,550
Rise.

171
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,050
Thank you, Your Majesty.

172
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,500
Should I

173
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,430
address you as

174
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,750
Queen Xue

175
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,890
or General Zhou?

176
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,050
Whatever Your Majesty wishes me to be,

177
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,650
that is what I shall become.

178
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,880
From the Northern Border

179
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,420
to Yaozhou,

180
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,150
from

181
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,030
Dengying Tower

182
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,370
to this throne,

183
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,240
I want to ask you,

184
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,220
where have your scars gone?

185
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,600
The scars have always been in my heart,

186
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,110
but now the scars in my heart are gone,

187
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,420
so the scars on my face have disappeared as well.

188
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,210
Then besides scars, what else is in your heart?

189
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,400
What else is there?

190
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,800
Betrayal,

191
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,680
revenge,

192
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,530
foolishness,

193
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,290
and death.

194
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,090
Am I right?

195
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,570
You're quite familiar with the taste of death, aren't you?

196
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,200
Indeed,

197
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,409
I witnessed with my own eyes from a young age

198
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,240
my parents slain by treasonous guards who betrayed their master and nation.

199
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,970
How could I ever forget the taste of death?

200
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,390
I also witnessed with my own eyes

201
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,960
my brothers-in-arms from the Jet Black Armored Cavalry, who fought alongside me,

202
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,510
their blood spilling in the fortified city.

203
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,800
How could I ever forget the taste of death?

204
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,340
Now, with constant conflicts throughout the land

205
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,770
and people suffering immensely,

206
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,960
how could I ever forget the taste of death?

207
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,700
Everyone is here.

208
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,900
What can you do to me?

209
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,680
I am the king of Northern Zhao.

210
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,600
I am the ruler of three thousand li in the north.

211
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,490
And you...

212
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,780
You are the queen of Northern Zhao.

213
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,730
Southern Yue.

214
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,210
Southern Yue.

215
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,790
Southern Yue.

216
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,880
Western Rong.

217
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,870
Western Rong.

218
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,490
You betrayed me.

219
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,780
You ruined my carefully planned imperial map.

220
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,080
You fell in love with Xu Hanzhi.

221
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,180
You must die.

222
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,490
I, General Yunhui,

223
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,180
Zhou Chu,

224
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,130
now protect the country and punish

225
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,320
the traitor Shang Kefeng.

226
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,000
Wait!

227
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,420
That's not right.

228
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,270
He is not Shang Kefeng.
