[Always My General]

00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,630
[Episode 17]

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,390
I'll go by myself!

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,580
[Outside the City]

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,280
Shisan!

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,070
[Outside the City]

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,730
Even if you choose to fight your way back for revenge,

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,560
would that bring Si back to life?

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,940
From the day the Jet Black Armored Cavalry was slaughtered,

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,200
I was already dead!

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,860
I've been on a path of vengeance,

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,400
and along the way, I met Si.

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,170
We became as close as family.

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,730
Now she has died for me,

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,020
and her body is hanging on the city gate.

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,780
But I can't do anything about it!

17
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,300
I brought in the wolf.

18
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,680
I brought in Shang Kefeng.

19
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,750
I don't even know now

20
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,860
what the meaning of my existence is.

21
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,510
If the meaning of my existence is only

22
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,280
to cause those closest and dearest to me

23
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,840
to leave me one by one,

24
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,540
and if that's really the case,

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,600
then I should be the one to die!

26
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,550
You are Zhou Chu, brave and skillful in battle,

27
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,850
and more importantly, you are General Yunhui, who protects the people

28
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,480
and upholds the honor of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry.

29
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:22,870
I know.

30
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,630
Every decision you made then

31
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,450
was right for that moment.

32
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,500
We all wanted to march straight to the fortified city

33
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,880
and defeat Shang Kefeng in one fell swoop.

34
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,160
But now you're poisoned with a strange poison,

35
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,200
and with my current forces,

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,430
I'm no match for him.

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,680
If you really want to go back and take revenge,

38
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,780
I'll be with you until the very end.

39
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,450
But not now.

40
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,370
I don't want you

41
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,880
to be in danger again, and I don't wish for that either.

42
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,520
Being born into the imperial family,

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,570
I have experienced much coldness and helplessness.

44
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,360
But after joining the Jet Black Armored Cavalry,

45
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,240
I met you

46
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,890
and our brothers,

47
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,330
and then I learned the true meaning of feelings,

48
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,050
brotherhood,

49
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,560
and what you mean to me.

50
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,280
We fight on the battlefield

51
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,860
for the people to live in peace and prosperity,

52
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,040
yet inadvertently cause suffering to innocent lives.

53
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,170
This is not what either of us wanted.

54
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,320
We've been through so much together.

55
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,810
How can we give up so easily?

56
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,390
If we don't have absolute certainty,

57
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,970
wouldn't the sacrifices of our brothers

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,440
be in vain?

59
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,100
For my sake...

60
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,810
and for the sake of

61
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,160
the only person you can trust,

62
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,630
let's wait a little longer...

63
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,850
okay?

64
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,780
The road ahead stretches for eight thousand miles, leading straight to Southern Yue.

65
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,900
Let's go and hunt down all of Shang Kefeng's henchmen together!

66
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,650
Yes,

67
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,240
General.

68
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,030
The day we return to Northern Zhao

69
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,590
will be the day Shang Kefeng

70
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,240
is beheaded.

71
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,480
Speak.

72
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,170
Where did they go?

73
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,590
If you don't tell me,

74
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,740
then you can forget about ever playing music with these hands again.

75
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,540
How would I know where they are?

76
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,410
If you've got the guts, just kill me!

77
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
You want to die?

78
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,140
It won't be that easy.

79
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,170
If you die,

80
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,100
how can you live up to this beautiful crown I'm wearing,

81
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,660
how can you live up to your exquisite appearance,

82
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,079
and how can you live up to

83
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,160
your father

84
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,980
and your family?

85
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,470
Do you think that if you kill me,

86
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,579
they will spare you?

87
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,610
Fine.

88
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,130
I'll spare your life.

89
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,910
I'll let you see

90
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,760
how your Northern Zhao becomes mine.

91
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,030
Like a silkworm

92
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,170
trapped in its own cocoon.

93
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,790
Xue Shisan.

94
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,980
Xu Hanzhi.

95
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,460
Do you really think you could fight against me?

96
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,570
The result of fighting against me,

97
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,440
Si is the best proof.

98
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,290
Your revenge is done.

99
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,390
You should return to Southern Yue now.

100
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,990
The King of Northern Zhao has passed away.

101
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,670
I have avenged both

102
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,540
the Jet Black Armored Cavalry

103
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
and your personal vendetta.

104
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,940
But now,

105
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,430
I don't want to leave anymore.

106
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,460
You...

107
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,070
While you and Xu Hanzhi were

108
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,620
immersed in your passionate and blissful moments,

109
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,830
I had already sent the elite warriors of Southern Yue

110
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,270
to infiltrate every corner of the capital.

111
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,850
Now we can be together again,

112
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,140
just like before.

113
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,940
Except...

114
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,080
back then, we were hostages.

115
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,140
Now,

116
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,700
we are the rulers.

117
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,490
Didn't you promise to stop?

118
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,790
On the northern border grasslands,

119
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,420
when you wore the mask of General Yunhui

120
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,430
and entered my camp,

121
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,680
I knew it was fate that had brought us together again.

122
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,730
Helping you enter Dengying Tower

123
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,760
and joining forces to kill Xu Hanzhi

124
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,020
was all for this moment.

125
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,120
Heaven and Earth are merciless.

126
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,680
Perhaps my survival until now

127
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,080
is fate's greatest mistake!

128
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,860
Rule the kingdom with me,

129
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,750
and you will be the queen of Northern Zhao!

130
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,360
Follow Xu Hanzhi

131
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,810
into the underworld,

132
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,150
and I'll make all of Northern Zhao your burial ground!

it's all prepared.

Remember,

138
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,720
put it in every well.

139
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,740
Don't miss any.

140
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,970
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

141
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,820
After tonight,

142
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,680
Northern Zhao's Yaozhou City

143
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,820
will be plunged into devastation.

[Southern Yue Border]

Only the one who tied the knot can untie it.

[Wanted]

149
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,290
We must hide ourselves well

150
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,450
and find the right person.

151
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,570
Finding someone among so many people will be like 
searching for a needle in a haystack.

152
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,750
I've heard that the royal family of Southern Yue has the ability to cure poison,

153
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,580
but entering Southern Yue itself is difficult,

154
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,820
and we are also outlanders,

155
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,040
the mortal enemies of Southern Yue.

156
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,980
Forcing our way in would be like trying to reach the heavens.

157
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,570
I heard that to enter Southern Yue,

158
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,640
one needs a pass document.

159
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,030
Wait for me here.

160
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,890
I'll be back shortly.

161
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,820
We're going to make a fortune today.

162
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,090
There's a five thousand tael bounty for the capture.

163
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,070
After we finish this drink,

164
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,700
let's go get him!

165
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,650
Okay.

166
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,690
Boss, I can't

167
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,600
wait anymore!

168
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,830
You two useless pieces of trash,

169
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,040
and you think you can claim the bounty?

170
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,430
Do you even know whom you're hunting on that wanted poster?

171
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,570
I don't care who they are.

172
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,260
And who are you anyway?

173
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,530
Boss,

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,810
this chick

175
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,270
is quite good-looking.

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,280
How dare you hit my brother?

178
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,760
Wait, Xue Shisan.

179
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,190
Did you kill my father?

180
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,280
Since you already know,

181
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,460
why bother asking?

182
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,180
I want to hear it from your own mouth.

183
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,650
Does it matter?

184
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,390
Of course, it matters.

185
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,430
You can tell me the reason.

186
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,680
Perhaps

187
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,900
I could forgive you.

188
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,830
From the moment your father shot

189
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,240
and killed my Jet Black Armored Cavalry

190
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,270
in the fortified city,

191
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,630
we were destined to be enemies.

192
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:46,740
Heaven was watching

193
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,670
and didn't let me die,

194
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,820
allowing me to kill your father with my own hands.

195
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,150
I don't need your forgiveness.

196
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,620
That was my father.

197
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,980
Xue Shisan.

198
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,140
Since you're so heartless towards me,

199
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,820
I don't need to consider your feelings either.

200
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,700
You owe me,

201
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,020
and you'll pay with your life!

202
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,570
Why didn't you dodge?

203
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,400
Weren't you just full of righteousness a moment ago?

204
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,120
I killed your father.

205
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,850
I owe you my life.

206
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,680
Regardless of what your father did,

207
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,340
I do owe you.

208
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,450
Shisan!

209
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,140
Shisan!

210
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,620
I didn't mean to.

211
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,990
From the moment you reported Xue Shisan

212
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,340
before my father,

213
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,470
I couldn't believe that it wasn't intentional.

214
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,220
That was my father.

215
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,990
I had no choice at that time.

216
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,030
Precisely because of this,

217
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,550
Shisan's identity was exposed,

218
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,210
and she had to be sentenced to death again.

219
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,280
And because of this,

220
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,390
Shang Kefeng found his opportunity

221
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,910
and made sure that my father and I

222
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:52,840
would be separated forever.

223
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,310
Now Northern Zhao is in imminent danger.

224
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,210
The nation is in chaos,

225
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,190
and our people are homeless!

226
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,820
We are both sons of Northern Zhao!

227
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,640
Do you still want to hold onto these grudges?

228
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,820
Southern Yue and Northern Zhao

229
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,120
will inevitably face each other in battle sooner or later!

230
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,840
I don't want to waste my breath on you

231
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,100
while our land falls apart.

232
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,890
The current Eldest Prince of Northern Zhao

233
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,270
is none other than Shang Kefeng.

234
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,790
But he clearly looks like the Eldest Prince.

235
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,060
Could it be...

236
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,470
the rumored face-changing technique of Southern Yue?

237
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,150
Wait!

238
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,170
I'm sorry.

239
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,710
Xue Shisan!

240
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,100
Don't let me down again!

241
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,180
Your Highness,

242
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,450
the entire city has been drugged.

243
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,240
Northern Zhao has fallen into chaos.

244
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,380
The people in the city are disoriented

245
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,240
[Jin Fu; New Commander-in-Chief]

246
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,420
and wandering without homes.

247
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,220
Your inheritance of the country

248
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,010
is within reach.

249
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,200
However...

250
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,840
your power base here is not yet secure.

251
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,750
If we were to eliminate everyone now,

252
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,820
I'm afraid...

253
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,770
Well,

254
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,870
help me make a decision.

255
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,560
Should I use this black piece

256
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,630
I've placed here,

257
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,280
or should I abandon it?

258
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,330
Your Highness,

259
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,940
I shouldn't have presumed to question your plans.
