[Episode 7]

3
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,750
You can't kill him!

4
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,110
Who can't be killed?

5
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,440
I had a very vivid nightmare

6
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,120
that you were killed.

7
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,610
What are you thinking about?

8
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,450
You had a very vivid nightmare.

9
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,140
I have a real nightmare

10
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,170
waiting downstairs in the lobby.

11
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:09,580
What do you mean?

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,510
I grew up with Princess Ningde.

13
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,020
She rode all the way here from her domain at the western border

14
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,090
and is now insisting on seeing me.

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,070
Ning...

16
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:16,870
de?

17
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,720
Enemies always come to you on their own.

18
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,330
Her father is the Prince of Ning, the commander

19
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,400
who ordered the massacre of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry

20
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,430
in the fortified city, right?

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,570
That's right.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,650
What do you think would have changed in someone after many years?

23
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,570
Appearance,

24
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,990
body shape,

25
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,710
and overall condition could all be different.

26
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,050
Alright.

27
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,900
Leave her to me.

28
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:42,310
What are you planning to do?

29
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,620
I'll go and meet your childhood friend on your behalf,

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,000
in the identity of the Crown Prince.

31
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,800
But you're currently a woman.

32
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,450
Pretending to be a man in front of Ningde,

33
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,570
especially pretending to be me,

34
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,940
is a bit too reckless.

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,910
I've spent half of my life pretending to be a man.

36
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,690
Deceiving your little princess, whom you haven't seen in years,

37
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,160
won't be difficult.

38
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,090
[Lan Qi'er, Princess Ningde]

39
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,440
Little girl,

40
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,970
I've almost

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,540
finished a bone.

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,580
When exactly is your master coming back?

43
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,920
Your Highness, please take your time.

44
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,220
After you finish this knuckle,

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,740
the Crown Prince will return.

46
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,340
It smells so good.

47
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,800
If I finish this dish

48
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,579
and still don't see Xu Hanzhi,

49
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,829
then this delicate little face of yours

50
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,100
will be my next course.

51
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,160
Princess Ningde.

52
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,140
Ningde,

53
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,720
after all these years,

54
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,329
you're still so immature.

55
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,630
Brother Hanzhi!

56
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,820
Brother Hanzhi?

57
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,100
Brother Hanzhi!

58
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,050
I've missed you so much!

59
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,760
Stay away from me.

60
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,960
Let me take a look at you.

61
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,030
Look,

62
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,520
have I grown taller?

63
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,430
Does Prince of Ning know that

64
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,980
you came to Northern Zhao this time?

65
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,390
I am me,

66
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,210
and he is him.

67
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,150
Why does everything have to involve my father?

68
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,040
Besides,

69
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,670
I rode hard for seven days

70
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,050
and nights just to get here.

71
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,500
This time,

72
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,690
since I've come to Yaozhou City,

73
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,290
I'll

74
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,520
go with you.

75
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,250
Otherwise,

76
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,410
I won't leave at all.

77
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,400
Xu Hanzhi is quite charming.

78
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,030
If you really want to stay in Dengying Tower,

79
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,170
it's not impossible.

80
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,420
But I have one condition:

81
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,600
You must follow my orders with everything you do.

82
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,860
Can you do that?

83
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,440
I can!

84
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,320
I swear,

85
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,410
if Brother Hanzhi

86
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,280
tells me to go left,

87
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,750
I will never go right.

88
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,140
How dare you,

89
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,800
a servant,

90
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,320
disturb my reading?

91
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,040
You...

92
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,700
So it's a stray dog from Southern Yue.

93
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,320
No wonder you're so unruly.

94
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,210
Such a fine sword

95
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,940
hanging in the room of a worthless prince like you,

96
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,800
it's simply a waste.

97
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,780
Back on the Northern Border Battlefield,

98
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,860
you clearly promised me

99
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,210
you'd help me eliminate Xu Hanzhi,

100
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,960
but you were defeated so thoroughly

101
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,140
that you left me with such a huge problem!

102
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,390
Now, you're powerless,

103
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,070
so you came here sneakily

104
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,700
to ask me for help, right?

105
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,780
Your Highness, you're quite humorous.

106
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,070
The elite soldiers of the Prince Jing's Mansion

107
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,020
and the powerful families of Northern Zhao

108
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,140
are such formidable forces.

109
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,800
After the death of the Minister,

110
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,270
you could have gotten to the bottom of it,

111
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,250
but in the end, due to your cowardice and weakness,

112
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,570
you let Xu Hanzhi go.

113
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,550
For a mere common girl,

114
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,620
he barged into your mansion, demanding an explanation,

115
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,310
and you hesitated again, too afraid to take action.

116
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,500
And so, you watched

117
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,310
Xu Hanzhi build his reputation in Northern Zhao

118
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,180
and gradually solidify his position.

119
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,280
Nonsense!

120
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,390
Fratricide

121
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,230
is a direct challenge to propriety and the established order.

122
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,890
It...

123
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,190
It will make me lose the hearts of the people.

124
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,750
Even if I have to kill Xu Hanzhi,

125
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,750
I absolutely cannot do it myself.

126
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,520
No wonder you squandered a good hand of cards.

127
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,130
If I were

eliminating Xu Hanzhi

130
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,330

If you dare lay a finger on me,

132
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,270
you'd be torn to pieces!

133

138

Brother Hanzhi,

145
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,110
as the Crown Prince, the reason you're still single

146
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,290
is that you don't understand girls.

147
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,340
Shopping

148
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,570
is all about the process of selecting things.

149
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,980
If I truly wanted to buy something,

150
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,510
with the power of the Prince of Ning's Mansion,

151
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,570
I could easily buy half the city.

152
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,070
I really don't understand

153
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,670

Accompany me to try on clothes.

156

I'm not going.

157
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,190
Men and women should keep their distance.

When we were kids, we slept in the same bed.

We've been apart for many years,

163
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,800
and we've both changed.

164
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,000
Was it worth it for you to risk

165
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,400
traveling so far to see me?

166
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,380
It was.

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,070
From the moment I was born,

173
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,540
Why?

174
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,110
The surprise was that

175
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,860
you showed me how wonderful the world

176
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,800
beyond the Western Border is.

177
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,560
The incident was that

178
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,070
you left me alone in the Western Border.

179
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,360
The same thing happened to me.

180
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,990
Perhaps I've been running away

181
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,430
because the person who could make me feel secure

182
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,240
hasn't appeared yet.

183

188
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,440
But you've never been to the ends of the earth.

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,830
How do you know you can catch up with me?

190
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,440
This time, I've brought a fine wine from the Western Regions,

191
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,430
Fatal Bliss.

192
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,330
After drinking it,

193
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,770
we'll see if I can catch up with you.

194
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,740
Let's go.

195
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,410
How is it?

196
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,230
My Fatal Bliss

197
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,300
isn't bad, right?

198
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,650
It lives up to its reputation.

199
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,350
Drink up!

200
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,350
Days like this,

201
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,080
indulging in wine and joy—

202
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,020
I've been waiting for them for five years.

203
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,660
But on the day the Jet Black Armored Cavalry returned to Northern Zhao,

204
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,720
I thought I would never

205
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,670
be able to drink with you like this again.

206
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,310
Why?

207
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,720
Were you afraid that once I become the Crown Prince,

208
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,870
I'd marry someone else?

209
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,040
I was afraid that

210
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,430
you would never speak to me again

211
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,440
because my father personally killed Zhou Chu.

212
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,070
He sacrificed ten thousand soldiers of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry,

213
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,380
so why couldn't Zhou Chu be one of them?

214
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,090
I've asked myself

215
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,700
this question countless times,

216
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,350
but I never had the courage to ask you.

217
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,230
Because in the last letter you sent me

218
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,380
before the final battle in the Northern Border,

219
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,340
every word

220
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,810
was about Zhou Chu.

221
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,960
You even wrote,

222
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,710
"I'll spend the rest of my life seeing the clouds and the moon with you,

223
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,710
and you will..."

224
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,680
"And you will always be my general."

225
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,870
Your Highness, you've already drunk more than a hundred cups of wine tonight.

226
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,370
You should rest early.

227
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,940
How dare you?

228
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,800
Who are you to interfere with how much wine

229
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,630
the Crown Prince wants to drink?

230
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,560
That's right.

231
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,310
Come on, let's drink.

232
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,670
I know what you're trying to do.

233
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,080
But Prince of Ning,

234
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,580
unlike the Minister, is not a high official in name only.

235
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,590
The prince of a different surname guarding the Western Border

236
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,730
isn't so easy to move against.

237
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,750
Is it that he's hard to move against, or is it that you don't dare to move against him?

238
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,430
Or perhaps,

239
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,950
Brother Hanzhi, you can't bring yourself to act?

240
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,660
What do I need to do

241
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,670
to prove to you that I am determined

242
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,720
to avenge the Jet Black Armored Cavalry?

243
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,020
Listen to me, follow my rhythm,

244
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,350
and stick to my plan.

245
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,020
Come!

246
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,680
This

247
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,460
is my personal guard,

248
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,520
Xue Shisan.

249
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,740
Quickly, greet Princess Ningde.

250
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,560
Greetings, Princess Ningde.

251
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,930
His name is quite funny.

252
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,760
But he's not bad-looking.

253
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,970
Would you like to have

254
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,610
a couple of bottles of wine with us?

255
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,260
That won't be enough to satisfy us.

256
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,650
Tonight,

257
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,340
we'll drink until we're too drunk to leave.

258
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,310
Drink up!

259
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,080
Drink up!

260
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,780
Come on!

261
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,630
Drink up!

262
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's get drunk and forget everything!

263
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,490
♫The world is sorrowful, and we met by chance♫

264
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,920
♫Life is short, the bird sleeps forever♫

265
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,190
Drink up!

266
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,700
Cheers!

267
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,730
♫In dreams, mountain flowers shine like jade♫

268
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,770
Let's drink until we're too drunk to leave!

269
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,710
♫I only long for the return of an old friend♫

270
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,370
Brother Hanzhi,

271
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,080
why do I see three moons in the sky?

272
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,720
♫The flying dragon blocked the clouds and sunlight♫

273
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,130
When the real is made false,

274
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,090
the false becomes real.

275
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,380
♫A startled swan chases, breaking through snow♫

276
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,800
Princess Ningde,

277
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,220
can you tell which one is the real moon?

278
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,440
♫For twenty years, I abandoned my identity to become a bandit♫

279
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,760
In such a dark night,

280
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,750
you can't even see the people around you clearly,

281
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,460
♫On Ximo River, who was left alone?♫

282
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,300
let alone the moon so far away.

283
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,070
Right?

284
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,700
Exactly.

285
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,060
Look.

286
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,850
♫Reality, piece by piece, shattered the little hope I have left♫

287
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,300
There are also moons in the water.

288
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,360
Three of them.

289
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,110
I have three in my water too.

290
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,780
♫Cold blades layer upon layer, curling up the glimpse of heaven I once saw♫

291
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,350
But don't worry.

292
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:26,930
I will

293
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,340
set a fire to the sky,

294
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,610
♫The letter has long turned yellow, leaving only two lines of tears in silence♫

295
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,970
and then we'll see everything clearly.

296
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,920
Ningde!

297
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:32,930
Let me do it!

298
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,960
[Prince of Ning's Mansion]

299
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,100
Ningde is in trouble.

300
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,480
It seems to be in the direction of Dengying Tower.

301
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,910
That's the Crown Prince's private residence.

302
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,060
Gather all the Wolfguard in the mansion

303
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,480
and follow me to Dengying Tower!

304
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,080
Yes.
