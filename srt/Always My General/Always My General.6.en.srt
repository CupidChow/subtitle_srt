00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,280
[Always My General]

2
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,100
[Episode 6]

3
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,390
Tied up for a whole night,

4
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,600
and you can still sleep so soundly.

5
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,650
I'm curious to see what you want to do.

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,460
Your Highness,

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,250
the person has been brought here.

8
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,040
Finally, you're willing to take action.

9
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,300
Decisive killings,

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,360
that's how you, Xu Hanzhi, do things.

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,820
I captured you twice before,

12
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,260
if I wanted to kill you,

13
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,450
I would have done so long ago.

14
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,830
No wonder you are the Crown Prince of Northern Zhao.

15
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,870
My life is rotten.

16
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,000
Whether I live or die,

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,930
it's all up to your words.

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,960
We've been brothers in arms for many years.

19
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,270
If you think that

20
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,430
I, Xu Hanzhi, am the kind of person

21
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,259
who would sacrifice the lives of a thousand brothers for power,

22
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,330
then just kill me now.

23
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,430
I could kill you a thousand times and still not feel enough.

24
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,509
Why aren't you fighting back?

25
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:43,750
Why don't you fight back?

26
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,430
What's happening to me here?

27
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh no,

28
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,010
Captain He.

29
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:21,710
During the battle at the fortified city,

30
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,300
a thousand arrows were shot at once.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,780
Captain He,

32
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,600
how did you survive back then?

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,540
By luck.

34
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,350
The injuries were severe,

35
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,270
but none were fatal.

36
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,800
But from the look of this wound,

37
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,670
logically speaking,

38
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,010
you should have been...

39
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,520
Logically,

40
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,720
I should indeed be dead.

41
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,060
But I met a man by the river,

42
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,640
I don't know what kind of method he used,

43
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
But by morning,

44
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,380
My wounds had completely healed.

45
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,820
A man?

46
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,960
Who was he?

47
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,770
I never got a good look at his face,

48
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,310
But the second time I saw him,

49
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,650
He told me to assassinate you.

50
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,340
Kill Xu Hanzhi.

51
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,890
Kill Xu Hanzhi.

52
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,490
Kill Xu Hanzhi.

53
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,740
What's wrong with you?

54
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,130
-Captain He.
-Did you hear that?

55
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,079
It's that man again.

56
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,150
His voice is in my head.

57
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,340
It's just the two of us here,

58
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,380
There's no one else.

59
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,140
Kill Xu Hanzhi.

60
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,810
Kill Xu Hanzhi.

61
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,360
Captain He.

62
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:23,900
Calm down!

63
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,470
But I heard it.

64
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,120
Captain He.

65
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,380
Kill Xu Hanzhi.

66
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,010
Captain He.

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,680
Captain He.

68
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,360
Go away!

69
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,850
Captain He!

70
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,360
Captain He!

71
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,690
The one who's trying to assassinate the Crown Prince

72
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,050
is General Yunhui, Zhou Chu!

73
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,910
It is you after all.

74
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,900
If it's you, that's good.

75
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,210
General.

76
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,040
They never managed to wipe out the Jet Black Armored Cavalry.

77
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,120
Could it be that

78
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,970
I was wrong about him?

79
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,120
If you don't trust me,

80
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,040
then why save me?

81
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,600
Because there are still many questions in my heart.

82
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,770
I want to know how Captain He

83
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,790
actually died.

84
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,850
And,

85
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,310
who exactly are "they"

86
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,740
in your words?

87
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,070
"They" in my words

88
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,560
refer to the aristocratic families of the capital led by the Eldest Prince.

89
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,560
They control everything in Northern Zhao,

90
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,120
even the selection of the Crown Prince.

91
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,170
At the time, the Southern Yue army was invading the borders,

92
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,700
and my father, in order to counterbalance them,

93
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,000
used the selection of the Crown Prince as a gamble,

94
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,200
and made a bet with them.

95
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,150
The one who repels the enemy will become the Crown Prince?

96
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,730
At the time, no one in the court believed in me,

97
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,160
including myself.

98
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,270
But it was you,

99
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,950
who led the Jet Black Armored Cavalry to win this war,

100
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,560
and personally placed me on the throne as Crown Prince.

101
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,890
Then, if that's the case,

102
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,540
why do they want to eliminate the Jet Black Armored Cavalry?

103
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,480
For the Eldest Prince

104
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,590
and the aristocratic families behind him,

105
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,200
a Crown Prince without a direct military force

106
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,570
is like a tiger without claws,

107
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,700
ready to be overturned at any time.

108
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,420
In the end,

109
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,180
the soldiers of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry

110
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,130
were sacrificed for your ascension to the throne.

111
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,650
I had no choice.

112
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,700
I have choices.

113
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,570
I would personally

114
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,780
bury these so-called

115
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,900
aristocratic families.

116
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,580
General,

117
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,080
let me help you.

118
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,630
For both public and private reasons,

119
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,360
I cannot let

120
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,470
these troublemakers go.

121
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,650
No matter what you do,

122
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,650
we can never go back to the past.

123
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,130
After Captain He is laid to rest,

124
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,680
we'll start again.

125
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,380
After we wipe out the aristocratic families of the capital,

126
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,060
if you still feel the hatred is hard to release,

127
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,860
I am willing to be the last person to die by your hand.

128
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,430
Your Highness, you should rise.

129
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,580
A distinguished guest is waiting outside the palace.

130
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,090
Let him wait.

131
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,450
I, Prince Jing, am the eldest son of the direct line.

132
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,230
Who else but His Majesty

133
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,020
can be called a distinguished guest in my presence?

134
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,409
I wonder if this old minister

135
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,440
is qualified enough for this.

136
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,300
The servants in my palace

137
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,090
are really getting more and more unruly,

138
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,770
to the point where they let

139
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,440
you, Prince of Ning,

140
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,850
personally come to the bedroom.

141
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,840
Your Highness can enjoy life freely,

142
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,060
but this old minister has been running around for Your Highness's matters,

143
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,780
almost breaking my legs.

144
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,270
According to the news,

145
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,910
the last remaining member of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry

146
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,940
is currently in Dengying Tower.

147
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,220
How is that possible?

148
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,470
Back then,

149
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,420
you personally supervised the defense of the fortified city.

150
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,820
How could anyone have survived?

151
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,850
Then, has Your Highness considered

152
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,169
that with just this information about harboring the rebels,

153
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,500
we could easily

154
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,450
overthrow the Crown Prince?

155
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,809
Then,

156
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,350
shall we go to Dengying Tower to take a look?

157
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,250
How is it?

158
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,380
Has the message been sent out?

159
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,510
The coffin shop has been fully prepared.

160
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,580
The message was

161
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,970
personally conveyed to the steward of Prince of Ning's residence.

162
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,220
Ensure that

163
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,370
Captain He's body is well taken care of.

164
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,650
Before it is buried,

165
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,430
nothing must go wrong.

166
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:05,720
Don't worry.

167
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,570
Your Highness.

168
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,000
Wait for me outside.

169
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,340
Isn't it stuffy

170
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,720
lying inside?

171
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,750
Before you entered,

172
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,080
the air here was especially good.

173
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,720
Hiding here for so long,

174
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,010
are you testing the coffin for Captain He?

175
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,480
I am testing it for the person who truly deserves to die.

176
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,980
Now it seems,

177
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,850
two people fit perfectly to lie down.

178
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,640
General, are you planning to

179
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:01,850
sacrifice yourself for love?

180
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,950
Captain He's matter isn't over.

181
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,100
Your life is just temporarily spared.

182
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,850
Your Highness,

183
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,450
Dengying Tower will not be open today.

184
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,150
Your Highness,

185
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,070
Prince of Ning,

186
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,910
Dengying Tower will not be open today.

187
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,590
Mind your own business.

188
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,790
The opening or closing of Dengying Tower

189
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,100
doesn't affect me.

190
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,320
Whose coffin is this?

191
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,480
Dengying Tower always does things

192
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,950
according to the orders of the Crown Prince.

193
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,150
I don't know,

194
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,120
and I don't dare to ask too much.

195
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,620
I suspect Dengying Tower

196
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,670
is hiding the rebels of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry.

197
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,200
Bring your master out.

198
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,020
Yes.

199
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,060
Didn't I tell you to handle it properly

200
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,020
when you executed the Jet Black Armored Cavalry in the city?

201
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,630
How come there are still hidden dangers?

202
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,950
His Majesty has ordered:

203
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,870
Kill everyone on the spot.

204
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,560
To prevent future troubles,

205
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,960
we also wiped out the descendants

206
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,110
of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry.

207
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,490
But there will always be orphans of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry,

208
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,730
not registered in the records, who survive.

209
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,230
Then, we must punish the nine generations,

210
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,480
to cut off any future threats.

211
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,420
This Xu Hanzhi

212
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,900
likes to bluff,

213
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,170
a mix of truth and lies.

214
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,790
Prince of Ning,

215
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,320
you're overthinking it.

216
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,650
No matter how fast you move,

217
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,390
you'll always leave a clue.

218
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,410
[Lingxiu Mountain of Northern Zhao]

219
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,680
You want to assassinate the Eldest Prince

220
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,610
and Prince of Ning at Dengying Tower?

221
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,410
It's like a mayfly trying to shake a tree.

222
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,280
Unless you're seeking death.

223
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,560
The enemy is right in front of me,

224
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,160
but I cannot take revenge.

225
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,310
I owe it to the brothers of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry.

226
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,570
I advise you, General,

227
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,280
to plan carefully before acting.

228
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,210
If you dare to thwart my plan,

229
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,770
you'll be the first to die by my hand.

230
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,240
If you kill those two of them,

231
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,770
your revenge journey will end here.

232
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,670
What about the other enemies, who have stained their hands with the blood of our brothers?

233
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,660
Should they just go unpunished?

234
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,530
I've already sent Captain He's body

235
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,050
to be escorted by Han Qi.

236
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,480
Let's first bury our brother properly,

237
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,500
and take out time to think about

238
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,550
the revenge plan.

239
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,140
Alright?

240
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:08,380
[Grave of He Bizhong, Member of Jet Black Armored Cavalry]

241
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,170
Brothers of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry,

242
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,180
I, Xu Hanzhi, swear today,

243
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,780
that on this day next year,

244
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,080
I will use the blood of our enemies

245
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,390
to honor your spirits in heaven.

246
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,980
Kill Xu Hanzhi.

247
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,640
Kill Xu Hanzhi.

248
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,100
Kill Xu Hanzhi.

249
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,640
Kill Xu Hanzhi.

250
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,420
Kill Xu Hanzhi.
