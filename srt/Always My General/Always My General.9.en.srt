[Palace of Northern Zhao]

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,880
The Prince of Ning, under the excuse of searching for his daughter,

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:20,710
brought troops into the capital,

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,570
confronting me militarily.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,820
His intentions for rebellion were clear as day.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,510
To protect myself,

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,030
I had no choice but to execute the Prince of Ning.

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,600
Please punish me, Father!

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,670
You bastard!

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,030
You've been Crown Prince for mere days,

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,080
and you dare to kill a regional prince of a different surname?

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,320
Who in Northern Zhao is left

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,760
that you dare not kill?

17
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,610
How am I supposed to explain this to all the civil

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,680
and military officials at court?

19
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,070
And how am I supposed to explain this

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,400
to the Prince of Ning's Xiqiang Wolfguards?

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,020
If we cannot appease the public anger...

22
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,810
I am willing to pay a life for a life.

23
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,210
Who exactly killed

24
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,459
the Prince of Ning?

25
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,070
Hand over a person,

26
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,830
and I

27
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,580
will spare your life.

28
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,780
I personally beheaded the Prince of Ning

29
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,980
at the merchant station in the south of the city!

30
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,350
No one else was involved!

31
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,020
Very well!

32
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,380
From this moment forward,

33
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,030
I strip you of your title as Crown Prince!

34
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,330
You rebellious son.

35
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,610
Throw him into the imperial prison!

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,310
Yes, Your Majesty!

37
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,710
Your Majesty,

38
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,550
you thought keeping the imperial seal by your pillow

39
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:39,100
would be safest,

40
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,840
but that only made it more convenient for me to act.

41
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,880
[By His Majesty's decree, the Eldest Prince has been
appointed as the Crown Prince of Northern Zhao]

42
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,430
[Northern Zhao's Treasure Mingde Jade Seal]

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,090
I have always been loyal to the state.

44
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,550
Taking such extreme measures

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,510
was compelled by the circumstances.

46
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,010
I hope Your Majesty can understand.

47
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,210
I've lived cautiously

48
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,040
in the inner court my whole life,

49
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,000
but today, I did something I wouldn't have 
dared imagine doing in three lifetimes.

50
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,280
From now on,

51
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,240
I'll follow

52
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,720
only Your Highness.

53
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,470
With the status of Crown Prince,

54
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,380
who lives and who dies

55
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,500
is now just a matter of my word.

56
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,500
Read it.

57
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,840
By

58
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,740

59
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,380
the Eldest Prince

60
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,820
has been appointed as

61
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,060
the Crown Prince of Northern Zhao!

62
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,560
From this day forth,

63
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,760
he shall serve as regent and govern the state!

64
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,760
Sir,

65
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,740
Dengying Tower is closed for business today.

66
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,210
Stop.

67
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,400
She's one of us.

68
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,320
Dengying Tower welcomes her back anytime.

69
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,090
Your Highness honors Dengying Tower with this late-night visit.

70
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,470
I wonder what I can do for you.

71
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,530
I've come to tell you

72
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,120
that Xu Hanzhi

73
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,810
has been stripped of his position

74
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,750
as Crown Prince for killing the Prince.

75
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,899
From today on,

76
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,640
he is exiled to the border.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,610
From now on,

78
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,720
the Eastern Palace is mine,

79
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,600
Dengying Tower is mine...

80
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,990
and you...

81
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,100
are also mine.

82
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,090
I don't understand.

83
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,740
We have never crossed paths before.

84
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,350
Why are you treating me like this?

85
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,280
If you're doing this to

86
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,420
take revenge on the former Crown Prince,

87
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,280
there's really no need for this.

88
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,510
You don't need to know any of this.

89
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,590
All you need to know is

90
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,740
that from today on,

91
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,660
you can only be mine.

92
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,860
Shang Kefeng?

93
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,060
What exactly are you trying to do?

94
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,660
What am I trying to do?

95
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,460
The real question is: What are you trying to do?

96
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,260
You said it yourself

97
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,690
that you'd avenge the Jet Black Armored Cavalry

98
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,020
by killing Xu Hanzhi.

99
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,940
So why are you getting so close

100
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,910
to him now?

101
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,840
There may be more to the death of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry.

102
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,260
My intuition tells me

103
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,630
he has nothing to do with this.

104
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,980
Rather than all these excuses,

105
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,560
why don't you just admit

106
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,260
that you've fallen in love with him?

107
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,470
Your Highness, please wait!

108
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,140
Go back, Han Qi.

109
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,690
Since Father wants me to leave,

110
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,390
even if it means going to the ends of the earth,

111
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,600
I have no choice but to obey him.

112
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,310
There's no such order from His Majesty!

113
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,740

His Majesty has been imprisoned by him!

115
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,920
Your Highness, leaving Yaozhou City now

116
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,070
would be surrendering the state without resistance!

117
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,510
Is this true?

118
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,160
One of my former subordinates was on duty at the palace.

119
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,270
He witnessed Zhao Lie's coup with his own eyes!

120

What are you still doing here?

189
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,210
Waiting to see me make a fool of myself?

190
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,540
Get out, all of you!

191
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,380
I take my leave, Your Highness.

192
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,640
Xu Hanzhi,

193
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,780
this isn't over.

194
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,050
I'll play with you slowly.
