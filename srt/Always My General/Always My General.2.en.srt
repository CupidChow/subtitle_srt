[Episode 2]

3
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,030
Who gave the order?

4
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,030
His Majesty issued the imperial edict.

5
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,590
The action was personally commanded by Prince of Ning.

6
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:39,650
Where are they?

7
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,240
They are all buried on the desolate mountains outside the city.

[Crown Prince's Personal Guard Han Qi]

9
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:46,810
What about the general?

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,030
The Prime Minister said,

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,200
General Yunhui's aura was too heavy.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,020
He had to be buried at sea,

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,810
They ordered his body to be thrown into the river.

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,250
My subordinates searched along the riverbank several times,

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,100
but only

16
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:56,880
found this.

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,810
The crown and robes on my body

18
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,070
have become the spirit banner

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,020
for my brothers!

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,950
Summon the imperial guards,

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,300
I must ask my father.

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,400
Why did the blood of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry...

23
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,640
-Flow?
-Your Highness...

24
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,510
-Why?
-Your Highness...

25
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,510
You must not act on impulse.

26
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,280
The inner court, the imperial relatives,

27
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,039
the civil and military officials,

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,700
all participated in the suppression of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry.

29
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,890
Do you want the tragedy of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry

30
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:30,980
to happen again?

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,150
Those villains with blood on their hands from the Jet Black Armored Cavalry,

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,190
I will make sure

33
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,680
you all go to hell!

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,800
Hurry up.

36
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,350
Lock him up.

37
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,520
You pretend to sleep?

38
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,130
Lift your head.

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
Remember this.

40
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,220
From the moment

41
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,300
I pulled you out of the river,

42
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,040
your life

43
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,300
is mine.

44
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,320
Understand?

45
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,890
Speak!

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,380
Her life is mine.

47
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,620
Take the money.

48
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,480
Don't let me see you again.

49
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,480
Get lost.

50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,230
Thank you, sir.

51
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,060
From now on,

52
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,640
you are no longer Zhou Chu.

53
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,380
I will give you a new identity.

54
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,700
You will live again.

55
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,740
You were unconscious for three whole days and nights.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,160
Finally, you woke up.

57
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,740
It's you.

58
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,329
Take a good look at this face.

59
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,720
Don't struggle in vain.

60
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,650
You are no longer

61
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,800
the General Zhou who once dominated.

62
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,110
Now you are a caged bird, ignored by all.

63
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,579
Now, you are just

65
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,250

66
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,150

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,750
Why didn't you just kill me?

69
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,530
One day,

70
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,750
when I hold power in my hands,

71
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,960
I will kill all those who have wronged me.

72
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,610
Then I will kill you. It's not too late.

73
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,190
From the battle in the North

74
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,970
to the destruction of the Jet Black Armored Cavalry,

75
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,640
the one who kept deceiving you,

00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,290

77
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,740

00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:18,760

81
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,660
I believe

82
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,430
you are even more unwilling than I am.

83
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,930
Against the heavens,

84
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,160
one can still change fate.

85
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,780
But against you and me,

86
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,170
there is no chance of survival.

87
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,270
Even if he deceived me,

88
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,720
betrayed me,

89
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,040
slandered me,

90
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,720
and hurt me,

91
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,440
what does it have to do with you?

92
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,210
He sacrificed the Jet Black Armored Cavalry,

93
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,710
fawned on the King of Northern Zhao,

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,950
with his status as a son born of a concubine,

95
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,170
he ascended to the position of Crown Prince,

96
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,290
and then invaded my vast Southern Yue territory

97
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,210
in exchange for the so-called peace.

98
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,159
Your former comrades,

99
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,440
and the people of my Southern Yue,

100
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,170
are all stepping stones for him to reach the peak of power.

101
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,300
Your hatred

102
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,390
and your experiences,

103
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,590
how can they not concern me?

104
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,940
Even so,

105
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,210
how can you and I,

106

with this short sword in your hand,

107
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,430
defeat him now?

108
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,110
The weapon you see

109
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,840
is this short sword,

110
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,860
but the weapon I see

111
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,290
is my network of spies in the Northern Zhao capital

112
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,250
and this face of yours

113
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,460
that closely resembles Zhou Chu's.

114
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,360
Family grievances are unrelated to national hatred,

115
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,480
but to execute Xu Hanzhi,

116
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,870
I can lend you a hand.

117
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,360
But if I find out that you are plotting against Northern Zhao,

118
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,390
don't blame me, Zhou Chu,

119
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,990
for turning my back on you.

120
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,020
When did this knife get into her hands?

[Prince's Private Residence, Dengying Tower]

122
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,120
I fought for Northern Zhao to conquer the world,

123
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,380
to defend the borders,

124
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,670
but in the end, I could not overcome the unpredictable hearts of men.

125
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,590
I was supposed to be a woman,

126
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,660
so let me, as a woman,

127
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,420
take back everything.

128
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,740
I received a tip-off.

129
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,300
The Crown Prince has an appointment with the Prime Minister at noon

130

to meet here at Dengying Tower.

131
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,810
Now, he is heavily guarded,

132
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,300
how can I get close to him?

133
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,370
Dengying Tower is the Crown Prince's private domain,

134
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,010
and Xu Hanzhi only brought

135
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,480
his most trusted imperial guard,

137
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,120
What's wrong with you?

138
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,150
Madam Rong, I was wrong.

139
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,570
You can't even carry a pot of wine properly.

140
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,480
Do you know

141
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,860
how much silver that pot of fine wine

142
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,870
you broke is worth?

143
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,750
It's worth more than the price of selling you.

144
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,850
Can you afford to pay for it?

145
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,790
Madam Rong.

146
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:46,590

[Madam Rong, the innkeeper at Dengying Tower]

150

I'm the new one.

151
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,950
This is a snack prepared for the Minister.

152
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,550
[Si, a servant at Dengying Tower]

153
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:52,970
I'll take it to him now.

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,360
The new ones are always more clever than you.

155
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,670
Why aren't you cleaning up?

156
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,210
Yes.

157
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,240
Follow me.

158
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,760
The Minister is in Room No. 1.

159
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,800
I...

160
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,070
You just helped me out.

161
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,070
I didn't even have time to thank you.

162
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,190
My name is Si.

163
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,560
May I ask what you're called, sis?

164
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,190
In a place full of vanity,

165
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,240
names don't matter.

166
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,410
It's just about earning a living.

167
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,140
Since you've entered Dengying Tower,

168
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,760
appearance matters a lot.

169
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,610
If you want to get close to the Minister,

170
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,210
you have to cater to his tastes.

171
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,830
It seems you're not

172
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,210
as simple as Madam Rong described.

173
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,820
The wine just now,

174
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,420
was it you who spilled it?

175
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,510
The Minister is lecherous and reckless.

176
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,580
I can't be bothered to serve him.

177
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,600
If you can take on this hard work for me,

178
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,800
I'd be more than happy.

179
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,530
You seem to have good looks,

180
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,320
but...

181
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,560
You don't look like a woman.

182
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,650
If you want to win the Minister's favor,

183
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,170
you have to learn from me.

184
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,280
First,

185
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,630
your voice needs to rise.

186
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,610

187
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,170
Mini...

188
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,250

190
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,740
Minister.

191
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,670
Yes, yes.

192
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,170
That's it.

193
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:16,840
Do it again.

194
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,380
Minister.

195
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,420
That's right, just like that.

196
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,180
Now, I'll teach you

197
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,600
how to walk.

198
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,060
Keep your balance.

199
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,940
Keep my balance.

200
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,110
Slightly shift your center of gravity back.

201
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,539
Step up.

202
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,419
Step up.

203
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,549
Just like that.

204
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,340
Twist your hips.

205
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,970
Left.

206
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:39,960
Right.

207
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,530
Maintain balance.

208
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,400
Left.

209
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,750
Right.

210
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,920
Left.

211
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,020
Right.

212
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,260
Left.

213
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,840
Right...

214
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,200
There's still much I need to learn from you,

215
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,820
but for today, that's enough.

216
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,420
Si.

217
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,170
My name is Xue Shisan.

218
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,270
Thank you.

219
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,740
Xue Shisan?

220
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,520
This should be the Minister's room.

221
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,330
The pot is still warm,

222
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,990
which means the Minister just left.

223
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,380
Minister.

224
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,840
Have another drink.

225
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,830
Drink.

226
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,470
Come on.

227
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,060
Drink.

228
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,020
I'm hot.

229
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,740
Minister.

230
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,710
I'm hot.

231
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,140
I'm hot.

232
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,110
So hot.

233
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,290
[Official Bulletin]

234
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,220
So hot!

235
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,590
So hot!

236
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,860
It's so hot!

237
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,850
I'm burning to death.

238
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,690
Minister!

239
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,710
You daring servant,

240
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,720
how dare you attempt to harm the Minister?

241
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,130
Take her down!

242
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,030
Stop.

243
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,220
Dengying Tower is my private domain.

244
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,130
When did it become your place to act recklessly?

245
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,060
You killed him?

246
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,850
This face.

247
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,730
Why did the Crown Prince take her away?

248
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,220
Didn't she kill the Minister?

249
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,190
