00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,920
Hello?

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,880
Granny, Liao,

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,630
it's me, Kerui.

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,050
It's still about the matter I told you last time.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,470
You see, my sister has lost money again.

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,230
Could you make an exception in my favor once more

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,070
and resume the cooperation with us?

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,630
It was you who wanted to come to Xijingyuan.

15
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,270
Why are you hiding here again?

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,630
I'm still not quite used to it.

17
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,270
If you're not, why force yourself?

18
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,170
I want to make up for the date we missed before.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,490
You can choose any place you like.

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,870
But I just want to come here.

21
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,450
Why?

22
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,030
Coz this is the only unfinished business left.

23
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,030
I must face Xijingyuan,

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,510
and I must face you.

25
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,920
Unfinished business?

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,150
Why are you so nice to me?

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,600
I like you.

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,590
With your status,

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,390
you could have so many girls better than me.

30
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,390
But I just like you,

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,630
ever since the first time I saw you.

32
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,470
Have you ever heard that

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,990
love at first sight is just lust at first sight?

34
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,880
It's not like that, Xiaoxiao.

35
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,200
You may not believe it when I say this,

36
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,310
but I always feel that

37
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,820
I've liked you for a very long time.

38
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,610
Although I've never really had you,

39
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,030
I'm so afraid of losing you.

40
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,540
I have an indescribable sense of familiarity with you.

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,230
I even suspected that

42
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,810
we might have known each other a long time ago.

43
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,430
What sense of familiarity? How could that be?

44
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,000
Then it must be something from our past lives.

45
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,730
Youting, you...

46
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,470
Just kidding.

47
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,390
But I promise,

48
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,190
no matter how many times I meet you,

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,830
I will still fall in love with you at first sight.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,900
It shall be the same in the next life

51
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,070
