This mess

8

is going to be a total disaster,

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,430
and no one will take it over.

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,670
He

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,600
is already in a dilemma and can't back down easily.

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,870
So, that's why you said it was private.

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,620
(Most Important Person)

14
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,450
Most Important Person...

15
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:49,670
Is that Liao Youting?

16
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:54,910
Hello?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,470
Okay,

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,620
got it.

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,580
See you later.

20
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,670
I knew it!

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,970
You wouldn't come to Huaxi even if I asked you.

22
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,680
But you've been coming here a lot in the name of work.

23
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,990
So it's all for the Most Important Person.

24
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,850
No way.

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,830
Why would I want to see him?

26
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,950
You really liked the food just now, right?

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,850
Yeah, I'm a bit full.

28
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,790
That's why I asked you to come out for a walk

29
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,630
to help with digestion.

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,310
It's the first time I've seen you so happy in front of me.

31
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,300
But isn't your time very precious?

32
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,530
Yeah, it's true.

33
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,180
But I just want to give you the best of the best.

34
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,090
Xiaoxiao,

35
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
let me ask you a question.

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,690
If someone close to you is hiding something from you,

37
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,340
and it's very serious,

38
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:58,870
what would you think?

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,310
(He's still bothered by what happened that day.)

40
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,870
(I'm such an idiot.)

41
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,470
(Why did I blurt out something like "kill me"?)

42
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,630
Sometimes hiding things isn't out of malice.

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,580
There might be some compelling reasons.

44
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,760
Since it's someone very close to you,

45
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,210
you should trust and understand him.

46
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,830
It's good that you can think like this.

47
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,150
What do you mean?

48
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,860
I think you're right.

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,600
Xiaoxiao,

50
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,110
there are often lots of unexpected things.

51
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,550
Some secrets will always remain secrets,

52
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,390
and those that can't be hidden

53
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,000
have to be faced bravely.

54
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,330
No matter what it is,

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,180
I hope

56
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,260
you are surrounded by love

57
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,750
instead of harm.

58
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,870
Love?

59
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,910
Yes.

60
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,440
You must believe

61
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,680
that you are loved.

62
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,240

Miss Yu must have known that Nick had problems.

82
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,250
Mr. Liao, I'm glad you didn't let me stop her.

83
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,270
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to see this.

Now I'm completely convinced.

85
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,150
I didn't expect her to be so calm either.

86
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,850
At first, I just let her lose money as she liked.

87
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,530
As for the current situation,

88
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,820
it's a bit hard to figure out.

89
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,880
I have some thoughts.

90
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,900
Mr. Liao,

91
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,100
guess what?

00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,790
The company that suffered the most losses,

93
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,440
that is, the acquirer of Miss Yu's shares,

94
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,350
is backed by the Mili Group,

95
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,060
whose legal representative is Chen Yihao.

96
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,340
What?

97
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,260
So, she made it.

98
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,100
Ah?

99
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,510
Kill two birds with one stone.

100
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,470
It seems we have to be much careful in the future

101
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,740
and not get on her bad side.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,580
If you want to hit someone, hit me.

103
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,470
Don't hit my daughter.

105
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,060
What else can you do besides losing money?

106
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,530
Look at who you've found to invest, a loser!

107
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,270
Money? Where's the money?

108
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,170
Stop blaming Shanshan. She's been crying all day.

112
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,270
but his phone is turned off.

113
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,150
I really can't find him.

114
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,980

118

Chen Yihao can't possibly run away.
