7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,590
Liao Youting,

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,190
you're a monster.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,270
You're a living devil!

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,150
(If I force her to stay,)

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,910
(will she push me away?)

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,750
Mr. Liao.

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,630
Send this to her.

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,470
But you like it.

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,320
Send it to her.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,360
Okay.

17
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,900
It seems

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,260
Yan Lan not only knew Yan Lan liked you

19
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,190
and thought you liked him too.

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,390
He saw you holding each other.

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,790
Of course he'd lose control.

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,230
He never asked.

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,630
This pen...

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,470
I didn't mean to do that.

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,590
But you didn't explain it.

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,110
That's how he misunderstood you.

27
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,720
No matter what,
he can't do this to me.

28
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,550
Luo,

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,870
I know Liao Youting is way out of line,

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,630
but I don't think

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,830
he's pretending to treat you well.

32
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,310
That why

33
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,560
I don't know which side is the real him.

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,310
Trust your feelings.

35
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,710
Talk to him.

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,000
Good night.

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,310
(Linda is right.)

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,230
(Maybe I've been clinging
to the tragedy)

39
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,550
(and ignored my true feelings.)

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,680
(If)

41
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,190
(Liao Youting never changed,)

42
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,430
(I wouldn't have had a chance
to argue with him,)

43
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,900
(not to mention leaving him like that.)

44
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,530
(Be Kind to the World)

45
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,710
Mrs. Liao, you finally agreed to see me.

46
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,880
I was impulsive

47
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,360
and said something bad to Yu Lou.

48
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,510
You know

49
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,950
Youting has always been my...

50
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,220
I can't accept it.

51
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,510
Kerui,

52
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,240
I know you like him,

53
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,750
but you shouldn't insult others.

54
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,580
She's the heiress of the Tuo Family.

55
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,990
Even if she wasn't,

56
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,870
you shouldn't have bullied
a poor kid.

57
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,750
You made a mistake.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,080
I know.

59
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,750
I know I was wrong.

60
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,950
Mrs. Liao, don't be angry.

61
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,430
At least I really care about Youting.

62
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,360
Well,

63
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,550
I also care about you.

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
If Youting liked you,

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,650
I'd definitely let him marry you.

66
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,910
However, Kerui,

67
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,160
he likes Luo.

68
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,430
But...

69
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,510
what if they break up?

70
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,110
How's that possible?

71
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,990
I brought Youting up.

72
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,310
I know him well.

73
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,990
He really likes Luo.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,310
It's just an assumption.

75
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,550
It also depends on their destiny.

76
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,190
I know

77
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,310
my family is not as rich as before.

78
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,630
I don't deserve him anymore.

79
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,750
It has nothing to do with it.

80
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,600
Kerui,

81
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,710
love

82
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,570
is not a one-woman show.

83
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,670
If Youting doesn't like you,

84
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,550
you won't have a happy life with him,

85
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,590
and I can't stand it.

86
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,830
Mrs. Liao, I don't care.

87
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,030
Don't worry.

88
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,560
You've stayed with me for many years.

89
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,350
I won't leave you alone.

90
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,990
Your family is having a hard time,

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,070
but I'll help you.

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,290
Yu Lou, try it.

93
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,670
I think you'll like it.

94
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,380
Professor Yan,

95
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,740
you still remember what I like?

96
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,310
You're in my heart.

97
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,110
I know everything about you.

98
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,690
Yu Lou,

99
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,590
I've fallen in love with you
for a long time,

100
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,070
but I didn't want to affect you

101
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,150
when you were on campus.

102
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,430
I was going to tell you
after you graduate.

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,030
I didn't expect

104
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,800
you to find out like this.

105
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,270
Professor Yan,

106
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,610
we're not on campus.

107
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,510
Don't call me that.

108
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,430
Just call me Yan Lan.

109
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,470
It's more friendly.

110
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,480
Friend?

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,430
Or do you want us to be
more than friends?

112
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,110
Have you made up your mind
about studying abroad?

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,330
The university canceled
your exchanged opportunity,

114
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,320
but I can help you contact
other universities.

115
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,440
Yu Lou,

116
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,480
to be honest,

117
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,830
I'm not doing this for myself.

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,710
You've been through a lot lately.

119
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,830
It's good

120
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,990
to go to a different place

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,030
and clear your mind.

122
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,350
- I...
- I want you to get back on track.

123
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,170
I want to see that simple,

124
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,020
happy,

125
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,120
and kind girl again,

126
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,120
okay?

127
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,240
Simple and happy?

128
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,910
I used to be simple

129
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,930
and happy?

130
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,280
Pro...

131
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,320
Yan Lan.

132
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,790
You've helped me a lot,

133
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,310
and I appreciate that,

134
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,270
but I don't want to go back in time.
