(Most Important Person)

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,470
Why do you want this land?

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,710
Make money.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,750
But I'm not 100 percent sure.

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,270
Don't bet with me.

12
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:49,970
Go on.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,790
71 million.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,150
Luolin Investment, 71 million.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,280
75 million.

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,150
Liao Group, 75 million.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,190
Any bids?

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,620
75 million once.

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,060
75 million twice.

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,670
75 million third.

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,800
Forget it.

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,640
Sold!

23
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,770
Liao Group has bought the land.

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,730
You gave up eventually.

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,810
Otherwise, I'd see a great show
of turning against each other.

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,890
Transfer this land to Miss Yu
from Luolin Investment.

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,160
I'll pay for it.

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,670
Sign the contract with her.

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,430
Turning against each other?
It's showing affection.

30
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,490
Hey, Luo...

31
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,720
Liao Youting,

32
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,860
what do you mean?

33
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,170
Nothing.

34
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,590
I have to get this land.

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,950
Then why did you give it to me?

36
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,550
Don't you want it?

37
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,350
I do.

38
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,230
Hey, make it clear!

39
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,160
Hey!

40
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,870
Mr. Liao, I've investigated it.

41
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,100
This land is not special at all.

42
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,840
However, Miss Yu
tried so hard to get it.

43
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,180
Based on previous experience,

44
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,950
I don't think it's simple.

45
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,020
She thinks it can make money.

46
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,030
Then why did you give it to her?

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,970
I'll give her anything she wants,

48
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,790
as long as she can accept it.

49
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,710
Stop looking.

50
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,670
You can't manipulate his mind.

51
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,760
If you miss him, just call him.

52
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,480
I...

53
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,440
I don't miss him.

54
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,110
You said he didn't respect you,

55
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,510
but he gave you dignity

56
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,720
in front of everyone.

57
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,680
You said he controlled you,

58
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,810
but he hasn't called you

59
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,760
for a long time.

60
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,270
Whatever.

61
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,510
I don't want him to call me.

62
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,270
Liar.

63
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,470
Why did you call him a monster?

64
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,110
I think he must be sad.

65
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,000
Luo,

66
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,320
don't be so stubborn.

67
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,000
It's time to make a move...

68
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,310
10086.
[*10086: Telecom Service]

69
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,830
Oh, so annoying!

70
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,680
Don't ever mention his name again.

71
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,660
(Youting still can't move on.)

72
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,300
(I even cried so hard
in front of Mrs. Liao.)

73
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,840
(Luckily, she promised to help me.)

74
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,670
(My efforts haven't been in vain.)

75
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,160
(Yu Lou,)

76
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,670
(I've got Mrs. Liao's support.)

77
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,070
(You'll never win.)

78
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,160
Miss Mi, you're here.
Mrs. Liao is in the living room.

79
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,270
Okay.

80
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,230
Mom.

81
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,950
They've been having a feud
for a few days.

82
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,880
I want to gather them together

83
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,830
and persuade them.

84
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,940
Yes.

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,190
They can't be like this forever.

86
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,910
Youting obviously cares about Luo,

87
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,550
but he wouldn't tell her.

88
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,440
Exactly.

89
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,800
It was so obvious at the auction.

90
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,710
Maybe I can invite them
to our family dinner next week.

91
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,420
It's not formal.

92
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,560
Youting will make an excuse
to reject you.

93
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,760
Why don't we hold a big event?

94
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,600
If it works,

95
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,790
we'll announce the good news

96
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,070
to everyone.

97
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,790
Invite all of them.

98
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,640
I can also

99
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,340
tell them about that thing.

100
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,560
Do you mean...?

101
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,960
Luo.

102
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,280
Auntie Liao.

103
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,050
Let me see.

104
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,590
You're as beautiful as your mother.

105
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,630
Auntie,

106
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,910
is Youting here?

107
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,710
Do you want him to be here?

108
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,980
Just a small argument.

109
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,130
Don't worry, he'll come.

110
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,610
Have you been busy?

111
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,030
- You're here.
- On the way...

112
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,700
(Mi Shanshan? She's here.)

113
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,780
(It means Mi Kerui is here too.)

114
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,950
(Before I met Mi Kerui,)

115
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,380
(I thought)

116
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,850
(Li Xiaohua twisted)

117
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,870
(Mi Kerui's word in the previous life.)

118
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,200
(However, when I met her,
I knew she meant it.)
