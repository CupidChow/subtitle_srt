7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,900
(Yu Luo)

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,400
Who allowed you to fall asleep?

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,710
(Sleep?)

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,540
(No.)

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,140
(The voice...)

12
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:46,930
(Liao Youting?)

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,360
(No.)

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,550
(Am I dreaming?)

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,230
(Haven't I already...)

16
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,100
You want to die?

17
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,530
Go to die!

18
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,200
You climbed into my bed eagerly.

19
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,830
(Liao Youting, President of the Liao Group)
You knocked on my door

20
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,300
and took off your clothes when you got in

21
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,460
while yelling that it was hot

22
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,870
and begging me to help you.

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,460
(What happened? Where am I?)

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,400
What's on your mind now?

25
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,970
Stop pretending.

26
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,960
Who sent you here?

27
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,980
Tell me what you want.

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,660
(Who sent me here?)

29
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,740
(These words and this place)

30
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,230
(are like that night three years ago.)

31
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,260
It's not right.

32
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:47,810
What...

33
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,900
What year is it?

34
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,780
What date is it today?

35
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,780
What do you mean?

36
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,300
To remember your first night with me?

37
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,120
(But this is the same as that night.)

38
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,360
(I...)

39
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,860
(Three years ago)
Look at me.

40
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,780
It's been three years.

41
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,100
What is it about me that displeases you?

42
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,320
It is unbearable to be my woman.

43
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,330
Is that so?

44
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,260
Don't you dare leave me.

45
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,660
Wait.

46
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,960
I'm going to the bathroom.

47
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,420
It's three years ago.

48
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,860
On this day three years ago...

49
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,100
Yihao,

50
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,220
I don't know why I ended up

51
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,220
(Chen Yihao, Yu Luo's Fiancé)
in his bed.

52
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,580
Luo is Yihao's fiancée.

53
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,820
Mr. Liao,

54
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,700
(Yueru, Yu Luo's Bestie)
How do you pay for what you did?

55
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,300
I can't believe Mr. Liao is such a man.

56
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,220
Even a rich guy can't force a girl.

57
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,700
Exactly.

58
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,500
Don't worry.

59
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,100
I'll be responsible for her.

60
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,660
(Adultery, exposure.)

61
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,460
(Blackmail and compensation.)

62
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,600
(So Liao Youting didn't frame me.)

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,900
(Yihao and Yueru invited the reporters.)

64
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,380
(Don't try to fool me this time.)

65
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,540
Mr. Liao.

66
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,300
- Open up.
- No.

67
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,300
I'll open the door.

68
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,670
Open up, Mr. Liao.

69
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,500
Which temptress is trying to steal my man?

70
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,350
Yueru?

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,060
Chen Yihao and I are getting married.

72
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,900
We'll make money faster by using you.

73
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,100
Oh!

74
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,860
You brought so many reporters.

75
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,020
What?

76
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,010
Did Mr. Liao offend you?

77
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,520
Mr. Liao of the Liao Group?

78
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,900
Luo, are you OK?

79
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,170
Didn't you get drunk and go to your room?

80
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,640
Yes, I did.

81
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,660
Mr. Liao took good care of me.

82
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,420
What's going on?

83
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,010
Didn't you say your fiancée was raped?

84
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,140
Exactly.

85
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,480
What's going on here?

86
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,300
Luo, are you still drunk?

87
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,660
What did Mr. Liao do to you?

88
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,700
It's OK.

89
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,860
We'll get you justice.

90
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,460
Yihao won't disdain you.

91
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,280
Disdain me?

92
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,270
We're just classmates.

93
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,220
But you look like you've been cheated on.

94
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,580
I heard Mr. Liao doesn't like women.

95
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,400
It's great news. Shoot.

96
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,240
Stop shooting.

97
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,900
If you report on Mr. Liao's private life,

98
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,320
you'll be sued.

99
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,170
Put them down.

100
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,360
How dare you break into Mr. Liao's room?

101
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,100
Hand over your cell phones and cameras.

102
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,510
Mr. Liao assaulted Luo first.

103
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,090
She is Yihao's fiancée.

104
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,400
Fiancée?

105
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,820
Marry him?

106
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,060
Am I crazy?

107
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,970
