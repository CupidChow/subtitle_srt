(Yu Luo,)

00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,240
(traveled back to the night three years ago.)

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,610
(I was drugged by my fiancé and bestie.)

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,130
(They caught me in bed with Liao Youting.)

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,760
(Then they used me to blackmail him.)

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,640
No.

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,160
You gave up your dignity

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,200
and traded yourself for money.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,810
You don't have the right to say no.

17
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,350
I...

18
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,170
I'm just borrowing...

19
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,300
Borrow?

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,240
Fine.

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,440
You'll pay me back whatever I lend you.

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,530
(I ended up dying a horrible death.)

23
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,930
(I'll never make the same mistake this time.)

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,560
(Yu Luo)
Yu Luo, 21

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,800
(Personal Resume)
born in Xiaoqinghe.

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,300
Her mother died of illness when she was 18.

27
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,200
She has no other family.

28
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,860

29
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,700
Yu Luo.

(Enjoy Learning, Make Our History)

31
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,460
(If I go abroad,)

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,120
(I'll change my fate completely)

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,860
(and I won't meet Liao Youting again.)

34
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,260
(Mi Shanshan.)

35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,260
What's up?

36
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,200
Where is Chen Yihao?

37
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,100
Why do you ask me?

38
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,400
Because I want to ask you.

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,560
He's gone, and his cell phone's off.

40
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,530
I heard you went to the Rongzi Hotel.

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,600
Where is he?

42
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,760
(Chen Yihao is missing.)

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,260
(I haven't seen Yueru either.)

44
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,900
(Didn't Liao Youting let them go?)

45
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,160
Are you mute? Answer her question.

46
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,460
I'm not his mom. I don't know where he is.

47
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,560
Did I tell you to leave?

48
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,100
Tell me, when will you break up?

49
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,130
I will...

50
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,660
Why should I tell you?

51
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,460
I know even if you don't tell me.

52
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,160
Yihao promised me

53
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,400
to break up with you.

54
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,960
I'm warning you.

55
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,400
Don't contact him again.

56
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,800
(Scum! He's cheating on three women.)

57
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,000
(In my previous life, I heard that)

58
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,400
(Mi Shanshan crippled her boyfriend.)

59
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,540
(Chen Yihao, if you want her,)

60
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,960
(I'll do you a favor.)

61
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,500
(The more I care about him,)

62
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,180
(the more she tries to steal him.)

63
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,760
A relationship is a two-person thing.

64
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,100
It's not up to him alone.

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
We've been together for three years.

66
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,380
Rest assured.

67
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,400
I will

68
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,930
never give up on him.

69
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:15,850
You...

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,400
I...

71
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,420
Mr. Liao.

72
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,010
Um.

73
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,260
I'll leave you two alone.

74
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,620
Let's go.

75
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,820
I'll leave you to your business.

76
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,120
I have no business.

77
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,540
Eat first.

78
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,280
Nervous? Guilty?

79
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,560
Actually, I had nothing to do

80
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,010
with what happened last night.

81
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,080
Really?

82
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,830
Who bragged about having nailed me?

83
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,480
Now you're denying it.

84
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,070
Mr. Liao,

85
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,760
they set me up last night.

86
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,540
Something was wrong with the wine.

87
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,000
I didn't want to fall into their trap, so...

88
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,050
So you used me.

89
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,190
No.

90
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,930
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,730
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

92
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,000
After all, we were strangers.

93
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,660
I was no stranger to you.

94
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,500
You didn't hesitate to call me Mr. Liao.

95
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,900
What's your name?

96
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,800
Yu Xiaoxiao.

97
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,060
Yu Xiaoxiao?

98
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,800
Yeah.

99
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,540
OK, Yu Xiaoxiao,

100
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,360
since you don't have any attempts,

101
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,240
let's talk about compensation.

102
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,160
There's no need.

103
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,130
I'll take responsibility for last night.

104
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,600
I won't ask you for a penny.

105
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,700
(Looks like she's not with those two.)

106
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,160
(But when I mentioned compensation,)

107
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,860
(she acted like it was killing her.)

108
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,560
Don't you want money?

109
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,730
But I do.

110
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,720
Last night you broke into my room

111
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,040
and dumped me in front of those people.

112
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,920
Shouldn't you compensate me?

113
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,790
There are so many reporters.

114
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,310
You seriously hurt my reputation.

115
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,620
If the Liao Group's image is tarnished,

116
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,800
it will directly affect...

117
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Didn't Li Shang take all their cameras?

118
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,160
Do you know Li Shang?

119
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,660
You told me yesterday.

120
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,560
Did I?

121
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,700
Fine.

122
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,600
Forget about the Group's loss.

123
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,880
But you must pay for my personal loss.

124
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,850
I'm good in every way.

125
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,390
You should be satisfied.

126
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,600
Of course,

127
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,600
I'm kind of satisfied with you.

128
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,760
So I'll give you a discount,

129
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,040
50 million.

130
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,000
50 million?

131
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,000
I have a team of top lawyers.

132
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You can't get away with this.

133
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,560
Whether you were set up or not,

134
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,060
you should be responsible for what you did.

135
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,030
If you don't have the money,

136
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,530
you can be with me...

137
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,600
If I pay you the money,

138
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,830
you won't bother me anymore, right?

139
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:11,970
Sure.

140
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,410
I'll pay you.

141
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,830
Your financial situation...

142
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,060
Don't worry about that.

143
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,360
Just give me a little more time.

144
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,020
OK.

145
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,050
There's no rush.

146
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,590
But I have one condition.

147
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,130
You must call me every week.

148
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,730
I need to make sure you didn't run away.

149
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,770
Yes.

150
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,010
If there's nothing else, I'll be off.

151
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,130
Why don't you ask about them?

152
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,530
Are they still at your place?

153
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,000
I thought they came for me,

154
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,010
but they came for you.

155
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,760
I'll do you a favor.

156
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,160
What do you want to do with them?

157
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,890
(How dare I owe you another favor?)

158
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,700
Just let them go.

159
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,540
Let them go?

160
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,180
Are you letting them off so easily?

161
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,530
I'll take care

162
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,760
of my own business.

163
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,330
What do you want to do?

164
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,020
Yu Xiaoxiao.

165
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,190
Yu Luo.
