7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,470
Do you know Luolin Investment?

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,750
Everyone knows.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,280
Luolin?

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,950
It's named after Luo.
She built the company.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,670
If Youting didn't tell me,

12
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,190
I wouldn't believe it.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,050
You'd believe anything.

14
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,150
Luo is the heiress of the Tuo Family.

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,270
Back then, they're a legend
in the financial industry.

16
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,310
You've underestimated her.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,910
However, everyone knows
we've found her.

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,550
If she doesn't accept the property,

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,950
there'll be resentments.

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,950
I'll ask Youting to protect Luo.

21
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,630
I wanted to ask her to live with us,

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,890
but Youting didn't want her to leave.

23
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,430
I just found out they moved into
Xijingyuan together.

24
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,530
These kids.

25
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,830
They're not married.

26
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,940
That's inappropriate.

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,350
They're meant to be together.

28
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,400
When Luo was born,

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,270
you wanted him to marry a Luo
when he grew up.

30
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,680
Yes.

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,510
Did you buy the clothes for this?

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,220
So what? I want it. I like it.

33
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,510
Miss Yu,

34
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,550
haven't you had enough fun?

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,590
I have.

36
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,280
I didn't know it'd be so happy
to spend money.

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,870
But you've worked hard.

38
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,270
Well, I just want them to know

39
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,190
I'm doing well.

40
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,070
Otherwise, they won't stop persuading me
to accept the money.

41
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,000
Of course you're doing well.

42
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,870
Even if you don't take the money,

43
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,670
I can still support you.

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,230
Who wants it?

45
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,270
I can make money myself.

46
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
How?

47
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,390
I made some small investments.

48
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,910
Small investments?

49
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,660
Luolin is a dark horse
in the financial circle now.

50
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,630
How did you know?

51
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,840
Tell me, how did you make it?

52
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,120
Don't tell me it's luck.

53
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,340
I...

54
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,190
I'm smart.

55
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,110
I just wanted to pay back
the 50 million yuan.

56
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,470
I had no choice

57
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,070
but to make a fortune.

58
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,280
Little liar,

59
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,950
you have so many secrets.

60
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,590
You promised you wouldn't ask.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,990
Did I?

62
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,910
Yes.

63
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,000
Guess I need to interrogate you.

64
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,720
Hey! You're cheating!

65
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,570
Stop.

66
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,820
(Professor Yan)

67
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,110
Professor Yan.

68
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,670
You're back?

69
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't go.

70
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,520
But we had an appointment.

71
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,360
Cancel it.

72
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,790
Call him.

73
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,590
I'll call.

74
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,890
Liao Youting,

75
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,850
why can't I see my teacher?

76
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,790
Can you stop being so paranoid?

77
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,520
We're together now.

78
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,510
Can I have some freedom?

79
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,310
At least let me see Yueru.

80
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,530
I said no, and that's it.

81
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,620
You're mine.

82
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,350
You can't see them.

83
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,830
You're mine.

84
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,090
Keep an eye on her.

85
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,430
Don't let her leave Xijingyuan.

86
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,180
Miss Yu.

87
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,180
(Professor Yan)

88
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,590
Hello, Yu Lou.

89
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,520
It's me.

90
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,360
Youting?

91
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,220
Yan Lan,

92
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,030
stay away from Yu Lou.

93
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,000
Why?

94
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,110
You tell me.

95
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,910
You knew I liked her,

96
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,510
but you stole her from me anyway!

97
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,990
I didn't steal her.

98
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,870
She loves me.

99
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,630
She chose me.

100
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,590
You never gave her a choice.

101
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,270
(Last Night)
Don't be scared.

102
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,220
I'm the best thing in her life.

103
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,120
YL...

104
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,320
Yan Lan?

105
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,560
(I've been through this
so many times.)

106
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,840
(I almost forgot)

107
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,350
(he used to lock me up like this.)

108
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,950
(He's a different man now.)

109
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,050
(He must be hiding
something from me.)

110
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,550
(I need to ask him.)
