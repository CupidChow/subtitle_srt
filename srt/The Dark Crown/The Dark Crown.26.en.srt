A five-percent share of Liao Group
is a huge sum of money!

8
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,630
How could she fall
before signing the contract?

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,310
Your daughter is not meant to have it.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,430
Why

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,870
didn't you stop her?

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,950
How could you let her push Mrs. Liao?

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,840
How could she know?

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,950
However, she never expected

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,220
she'd be so close to that money

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,870
but lose it eventually.

17
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,440
She really had it coming.

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,470
Kerui,

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,110
did Yu Lou really push her?

20
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,430
Of course.

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,470
Don't be so sarcastic.

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,840
I'll make Yu Lou pay for this.

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,710
(When they mentioned evidence,)

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,070
(Yu Lou was eager to find her phone.)

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,500
(Considering Mi Kerui's behaviors...)

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,040
I knew it was her phone.

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,520
Mrs. Mi,

28
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,830
I found this phone in the greenery
under the stairs.

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,190
Thanks, I owe you one.

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,750
Remember,

31
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,390
this can be a big deal.

32
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,570
Don't tell anyone about it,

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,570
understand?

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,640
Understand.

35
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,140
(Is the evidence really in this phone?)

36
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,650
Mi Shanshan, I know it's you.

37
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,730
If you don't want to be in trouble,

38
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,060
give my phone back.

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,560
Yu Lou?

40
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,510
How does she know?

41
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,220
(Payment)

42
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:09,920
Thanks.

43
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,510
Mr. Liao,

44
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,070
the report of the overseas project.

45
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,800
Mr. Liao,

46
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,220
you should take a break.

47
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,150
No need.

48
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,860
I've been in the hospital.

49
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,190
I have a lot of work.

50
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:31,990
Go back.

51
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,040
I'm okay.

52
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,150
I'm not tired,

53
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,740
but I think you want

54
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,130
someone else's company.

55
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,870
Mr. Liao, I know I shouldn't say this.

56
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,390
You've done a lot for Miss Yu.

57
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,710
You clearly care about her,

58
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,200
Why don't you talk to her?

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,630
I don't think she's avoiding you.

60
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,670
I heard

61
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,460
she also visited Mrs. Liao today.

62
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,230
I know.

63
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,360
What?

64
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,870
Then why are you avoiding her?

65
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,040
I mean...

66
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,270
Why... Why don't you...?

67
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,120
If I ask her,

68
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,350
she'll accept it,

69
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,590
but she won't understand
whether she accepts it

70
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,110
for me or for herself.

71
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,130
I can't force her to understand it.

72
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,180
She needs to

73
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,630
figure it out by herself.

74
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,910
If she wants to come back,

75
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,790
she'll do it.

the Tuo Family's property?

79
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,780
As far as I know,

80
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,710
Mrs. Liao has been keeping the property

81
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,120
and hasn't given it to Yu Lou.

82
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,270
And now Mrs. Liao

83
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,190
is unconscious.

84
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,630
We don't even know
how long she can live.

85
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,270
She can't keep it anymore.

86
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,000
But Yu Lou...

87
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,970
She's Youting's girlfriend.

88
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,590
The Liao Family won't let her

89
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,510
give up the property.

90
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,140
Tuo Nan,

91
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,710
stop being a coward.

92
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,950
You're an illegitimate child,

93
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,630
but you're also a Tuo.

94
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,470
Do you really want to lose
all the property?

95
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,710
If Yu Lou disappears from the world,

96
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,100
you'll get everything,

97
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,050
and no one will be able to change it.

98
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,460
Understand?

99
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,230
Why are you telling me this?

100
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,120
What do you want?

101
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,870
It's simple.

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,840
I'll help you,

103
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,620
but when this is over,

104
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,320
you'll marry me.

105
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,800
I want to sit on the money
of the Tuo Family

106
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,130
and watch them cry.

107
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,910
Okay.

108
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,630

This is ridiculous.

111
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,430
She made a great investment last time,

112
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,750
but it was understandable.

113
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,490
However, how could she know

114
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,990
the French couple's family history
this time?

115
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,030
Don't look at me.

116
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,270
I'm so impressed.

117
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,440
She's the best.

Watching the news?

120
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,670
Stop looking.
It's exactly 380 million yuan.

121
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,670
It's Yu Lou's money, not yours.

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,390
380 million is not a big deal.
