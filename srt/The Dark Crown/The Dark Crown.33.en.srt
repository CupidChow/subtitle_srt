=Episode 33=

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,110
Dad knew Mr. Liao was a heartless man,

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,870
and his daughter wouldn't
live a happy life,

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,510
but he only cared about
his self-interest.

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,780
Mom.

11
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,290
It's time to see things clearly.

12
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,680
Where's Youting?

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,390
Take him here now.

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,410
Okay, I got it.

15
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,960
Youting.

16
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,210
Yu Lou?

17
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,310
Yu Lou,

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,790
you're not welcomed.

19
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,040
This is my engagement party.

20
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,020
Please leave.

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,930
Even if you can't move on,

22
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,050
- we'll still...
- Don't worry.

23
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,310
I'll be quick.

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,590
Excuse me, everyone.

25
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,870
Indeed, I was close to Mr. Liao.

26
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,430
However, I'm not here
for our relationship

27
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,710
but for Mrs. Liao's accident

28
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,230
last time.

29
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,030
Rumor has it

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,040
that I pushed her.

31
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,790
I'm here to tell you the truth.

32
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,350
Mi Kerui,

33
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,490
are you crazy?

34
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,650
I'm crazy?

35
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,410
Ungrateful old woman.

36
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,030
I've served her well for over 10 years.

37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,110
However,

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,630
she betrayed me.

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,430
She wanted Youting to marry you.

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,680
What about me?

41
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,620
Am I her maid?

42
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,900
Or a joker who sings to please her?

43
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,430
You don't need to call them.

44
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,870
They're coming.

45
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,750
However, I knew

46
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,070
there was no surveillance.

47
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,590
When they come,
who will be the crazy person

48
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,180
in their eyes?

49
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,720
I didn't do it.

50
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,280
It wasn't me.

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,640
Yu Lou,

52
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,670
you're framing me!

53
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,030
It was you who set me up.

54
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,160
I didn't!

55
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,110
I knew you were upset
because you couldn't steal Youting

56
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,610
away from me.

57
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,270
I never expected you'd frame me

58
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,870
at my engagement party.

59
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,760
Why? You've gone too far!

60
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,700
Yu Lou.

61
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,160
Do you know me?

62
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,270
Isn't this

63
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,750
the famous lawyer Mr. Han?

64
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,030
So, you know me.

65
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,270
Listen, since you have the recording,

66
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,730
why didn't you show us

67
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,870
until now?

68
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,030
Besides, we've checked
all the surveillance of the hotel.

69
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,020
Where did you get the recording?

70
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,150
Therefore, you're suspected of

71
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,800
falsifying facts.

72
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,090
It is the fact.

73
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,030
I didn't falsify anything.

74
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,680
The recording is fake.

75
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,550
She must've made it
with Miss Mi's words.

76
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,120
This is too much!
How dare she bully Kerui?

77
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,210
Arrest her!

78
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,510
- Arrest her!
- Arrest her!

79
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,520
Be careful.

80
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,050
They're all close to the Mi Family.

81
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
They'll bully you.

82
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,160
But...

83
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,020
We should leave now.

84
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,390
I'll figure it out.

85
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,550
You ruined Kerui's engagement party.

86
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,110
How dare you leave?

87
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,220
What do you want?

88
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,740
Move!

89
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:23,970
Stop.

90
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,420
Move!

91
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,480
Stop.

92
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,560
No way.

93
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,180
- Mom?
- Mom?

94
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,880
Mrs. Liao...

95
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,900
Do you think I'm old and stupid?

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,550
Kerui, you broke my heart.

97
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,080
For the sake of the years,

98
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,260
I wanted to play dumb
and give you a chance.

99
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,030
However, you didn't learn a lesson.

100
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,000
How dare you try to marry Youting?

101
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,870
Do you take me for a dead person?

102
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,950
No.

103
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,040
I didn't do it.

104
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,980
Oh.

105
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,440
You have to admit your mistake.

106
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,470
Go.

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,710
The police are waiting outside.

108
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,200
It's you! It's Yu Lou!

109
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,560
All of you!

110
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,940
You set me up!

111
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,560
Go.

112
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,960
