they

Nan, they're on the rooftop alone.

00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,150
I've ruined the camera.

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,300
You must've been wondering

17
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,640
why I knew

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,710
what would happen

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,070
and did everything right on time
to make my company thrive.

20
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,430
I even knew the history of the land.

21
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,730
That's because it happened before

22
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,740
in the same world as you dreamed.

23
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,510
But you were grounded.

24
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,630
How did you know?

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,660
I watched TV.

26
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,390
You took my phone away.

Since my mother died,

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,240
I've been afraid of loneliness.

30
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,510
I was so stupid

31
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,830
that I couldn't figure out

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,830

I made up stories to fool myself.

In the end,

36
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,410
I was deceived and betrayed.
