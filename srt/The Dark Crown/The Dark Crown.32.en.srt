7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,400
I can't believe it either,

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,300
so I came here after I got the news.

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,000
What happened to you?

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,740
Why would he agree to marry Mi Kerui?

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,590
Yu Lou.

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,430
Don't be sad.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,470
Something must be wrong.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,700
Youting never liked Mi Kerui.

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,390
Even if he can't remember you,

16
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,120
he won't choose her.

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,230
Don't... Don't be sad.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,990
I'll figure it out, okay?

19
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,830
Forget about the food.

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,080
Let's go.

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,300
I'll take you home.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,040
Come on.

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,230
Youting?

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,560
Why are you...?

25
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,470
Don't touch her!

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,190
Yu Lou is uncomfortable.
Shouldn't you...?

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,310
Don't touch her!

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,830
Stop yelling!

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,190
Who did this to her?

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,430
Listen, Youting,

31
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,460
why do you want to marry Mi Kerui?

32
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,480
How can you forget Yu Lou?

33
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,330
Not your business!

34
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,360
Youting.

35
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,110
You hate me, don't you?

36
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,830
I thought you forgot me.

37
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,310
Why are you doing this?

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,510
Our relationship
has nothing to do with you.

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,320
Liao Youting.

40
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,160
I don't understand

41
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,800
why you're doing this to me.

42
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,900
Yu Lou!

43
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,980
Yu Lou!

44
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,180
Nan, I didn't get the chance.

45
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,550
Liao Youting took Yu Lou away.

46
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,310
Never mind. I have another plan.

47
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,560
(Congratulations! They're engaged!)

48
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,910
They're engaged?

49
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,590
You fooled me.

50
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,720
Then don't blame me

51
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,800
for killing

52
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,190
Liao Youting too.

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,680
Huh.

54
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,780
(Nurse Station)

55
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,000
Youting carried you to his car
after you passed out.

56
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,600
He was creaming your name
like he was crazy.

57
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,670
I've never seen him like this.

58
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,520
I thought he'd stay,

59
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,870
but

60
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,550
he left.

61
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,850
Yu Lou.

62
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,670
Youting said you needed to
stay away from him for your safety.

63
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,630
Do you know what it means?

64
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,630
For my safety?

65
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,320
Yes.

66
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,400
I asked him,

67
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
but he didn't answer.

68
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,810
Is he going to
get engaged with Mi Kerui?

69
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,560
It's on the news.

70
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,900
I don't think he'll change his mind.

71
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,910
Yan Lan.

72
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,220
Do me a favor.

73
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,460
Mr. Liao.

74
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,420
(Yan Lan, Yu Lou (Date))

75
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,670
Who let them in?

76
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,350
Your families are friends.

77
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,110
Mr. Yan can definitely get in.

78
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,870
Miss Yu...

79
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,710
Mrs. Liao didn't tell her,

80
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,110
but Mr. Yan insisted.

81
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,190
We couldn't stop him.

82
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,080
I'll pick up Grandma.

83
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,510
What are you looking at?

84
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,270
Nothing.

85
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,550
I told you not to wear black.
Why didn't you listen?

86
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,230
It's your sister's engagement party.
How can you dress like this?

87
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,430
She's even worse.

88
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,640
It's like she's having a wedding.

89
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,230
Look, Mrs. Liao

90
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,970
is also wearing a black dress.

91
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,630
Shanshan, check on your sister.

92
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,560
No! You go!

93
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,990
I... What can I do?
I'm not her real mother.

94
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,440
At least you're her sister.

95
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,640
She's going to marry Mr. Liao.
Be nice to her.

96
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,550
It'll benefit you, right?

97
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,830
Benefit?

98
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,880
Mom.

99
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,350
No wonder Mi Kerui
always says I'm stupid.

100
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,550
Like mother, like daughter.

101
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,070
- You...
- Don't argue.

102
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,040
Do you really think Mi Kerui's marriage

103
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,920
will benefit us?

104
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,350
Listen,

105
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,840
she's never treated us like family.

106
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,390
She hates

107
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,900
both of us.

108
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,390
If she gets what she wants,

109
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,030
we'll no longer be

110
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,910
a part of the Mi Family.

111
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,150
What are you talking about?

112
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,890
At least I'm your father's wife,

113
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,990
and you're his daughter.

114
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,880
Even if Mi Kerui is against us,

115
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,440
your dad will defend us, right?

116
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,870
When we were rich,

117
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,150
he cared about me.

118
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,950
However, since we lost money,

119
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,550
he's looked at me

120
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,830
with disgust.

121
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,350
As for Mi Kerui,

122
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,590
she knew Mr. Liao was a heartless man...
