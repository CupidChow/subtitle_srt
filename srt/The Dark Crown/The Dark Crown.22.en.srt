7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,310
You've helped me a lot,

8
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,790
and I appreciate that,

9
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,910
but I don't want to go back in time.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,050
I always needed others to help me

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,270
and love me,

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,990
but now I've learned to rely on myself.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,830
I've learned to love myself.

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,150
It's not for Liao Youting

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,740
but myself.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,550
I've decided not to go abroad.

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,070
I have so many things to face

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,230
and deal with.

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,480
Only in this way can I control my life.

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,310
Yu Lou, but you...

21
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,550
As you said,

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,800
we're friends.

23
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,610
Yan Lan,

24
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,510
please support me,

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,720
okay?

26
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,900
Luo.

27
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,670
I know shopping

28
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,210
can take away the pain of breaking up,

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,200
but

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,370
do we have to buy land?

31
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,490
Take away the pain?

32
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,630
Linda,

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,260
you're a well-educated
independent woman.

34
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,150
Can you stop thinking about love
all the time?

35
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,820
Please focus on our career.

36
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,960
This land

37
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,740
can help us to make a fortune.

38
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,720
Really?

39
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,070
I've never been to an auction before.

40
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,950
Neither have I.

41
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,920
What?

42
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,900
When I give you this sign,

43
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,640
you'll make a bid.

44
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,140
This land

45
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,610
is not commercially valuable.

46
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,410
No one will bid for it.

47
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,890
So, we will get it.

48
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:10,790
Understand?

49
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,760
Okay.

50
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,940
Should I

51
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,570
do this

52
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,560
or this?

53
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,590
You can stand up

54
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,970
like this.

55
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,340
Why are you here?

56
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,520
Cheap as the land is,

57
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,750
your family still can't afford it now.

58
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,060
So, I'm just wondering why you're here.

59
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,780
Do you think I have secret money?

60
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,960
What?

61
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,390
I've seen through your little trick.

62
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,390
You want to escape?

63
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,000
Mr. Liao,

64
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,870
this land has no commercial value.

65
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,210
It's not qualified for
any of our protects.

66
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,710
How much do you want to spend?

67
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,560
Whatever.

68
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,110
The land owner is an old friend.

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,980
He's in trouble,
but he can't ask for a favor,

70
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,550
so I have to use the opportunity
to give him a hand.

71
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,480
I got it.

72
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,670
We must get the land.

73
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,080
Mr. Liao?

74
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,800
Youting,

75
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,930
what a coincidence.

76
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,130
Why are you here?

77
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,180
Coincidence?

78
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,460
Can you afford this land now?

79
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,270
Oh. You want to steal him from Yu Lou

80
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,800
while they're arguing.

81
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,190
Unfortunately,
he doesn't want to talk to you.

82
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,550
Yu Lou is here too.

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,860
Did they get back together?

84
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,130
Look at you.

85
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,780
Why do you have to be here?

86
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,100
Hey.

87
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,470
Why is Liao Youting here?

88
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,780
I don't know.

89
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,670
Did you come here for him?

90
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,080
How's that possible?

91
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,260
Do they

92
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,130
also want the land?

93
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:13,790
What?

94
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,840
Liao Youting is super-rich.

95
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,800
We're no match for him.

96
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,030
Just do

97
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,270
our best.

98
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,170
The auction has begun.

99
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,830
Liao Group, 50 million yuan.

100
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,640
Bid.

101
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,750
Luolin Investment, 55 million yuan.

102
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,040
60 million.

103
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,470
Liao Group, 60 million.

104
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,550
Go on.

105
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,990
Luolin Investment, 65 million.

106
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,450
70 million.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,080
Liao Group, 70 million.

108
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,780
They're having a big fight.

109
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,250
She's competing with Mr. Liao.

110
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,150
The higher, the better.

111
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,500
She won't be able to afford it.

112
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,520
Don't go too far.

113
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,870
It's not about winning.

114
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,210
We're in debt now.

115
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,310
Don't be so vengeful.

116
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,070
This land is not valuable.

117
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,310
Please have mercy and let me have it.

118
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,140
(Most Important Person)

119
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,470
Why do you want this land?

120
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,710
Make money.

121
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,750
But I'm not 100 percent sure.

122
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,270
Don't bet with me.
