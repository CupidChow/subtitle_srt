Let's break up.

15

No way!

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,390
When I wanted to avoid him,

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,310
he tried every means to pursue me.

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,390
Now I'm in love,
and he wants to break up.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,270
No way.

20
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,280
Luo,

21
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,550
Liao Youting is still ill.

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,950
What illness?

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,840
How dare he use this as an excuse
to abandon me?

24
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,920
Liao Youting,

25
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,400
you made me suffer,

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,730
and I'll make you suffer too.

27
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,390
May I know your plan?

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,950
I'll sue him

29
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,730
for moral damages,

30
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,920
emotional damages,

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,140
all the damages he caused.

32
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,350
I'll make him broke.

33
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,530
It's great.

34
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,270
He wants to break up,
and it'd better be worth it.

35
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,640
Do you need a law...?

36
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,590
Hey, Landa.

37
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,000
Is there anything
he can't accept to lose?

38
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,110
What?

39
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,710
I want something big,

40
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,940
something he can't afford.

41
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,070
After all, he's a businessman.

42
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,710
If he can't accept the loss,

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,550
maybe he'll make up with me.

44
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,610
That's right.

45
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,430
Yes, negotiation.

46
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,350
It's okay if you don't want it.

47
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,200
Give me everything on the list,

48
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,570
and I'll stay away from you.

49
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,880
Commercial stocks,
dozens of real estate properties,

50
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,470
Xijingyuan, Nalan Resort,
Huajing Villa...

51
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,670
Mr. Liao!

52
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,690
Liao Youting,

53
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,550
I don't have the best team,

54
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,910
but you can't get away with it.

55
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,830
It's okay if you can't afford it.

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,710
You can choose...

57
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,560
Except for Xijingyuan,

58
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,910
I can give you anything.

59
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,110
I'll give you the money
equivalent to Xijingyuan's price.

60
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,200
I'll sign it.

61
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,950
What?

62
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,250
Please keep your promise

63
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,750
and stay away from me.

64
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,820
(Liao Youting)

65
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,150
Li Shang,

66
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,630
take care of the rest.

67
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,840
Don't let me see her again.

68
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,060
(Land of Etiquette)

69
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,150
She must've planned this
for a long time.

70
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,230
She counted all your
available property.

71
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,950
Why are you so angry?

72
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,430
It's Youting's property,

73
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,030
not yours.

74
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,120
Besides, Luo hasn't signed it.

75
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,080
She just

76
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,870
wanted to provoke Youting.

77
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,910
She's had a hard time.

78
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,500
I can understand why she's angry.

79
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,740
But I can't understand.

80
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,550
It's very serious.

81
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,160
Yu Lou didn't sign it,

82
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,630
but Youting did.

83
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,810
She can take it whenever she wants.

84
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,970
Youting,

85
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,770
you don't want to marry her.

86
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,350
Why did you give her the money?

87
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,690
She wanted it,

88
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,060
and I gave it to her.

89
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:53,990
That's all.

90
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,150
Youting,

91
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,520
what are you thinking?

92
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,590
Do you remember Luo now?

93
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,310
Yu Lou is a vicious woman.

94
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,320
She doesn't like

95
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,030
Youting at all.

96
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,950
She only cares about money!

97
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,790
Stop it!

98
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,190
Mom has got all the property

99
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,990
of the Tuo Family.

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,030
Luo didn't even take it back.

101
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,950
Why would she take Youting's money?

102
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,350
She's not innocent.

103
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,870
A girl from a poor family can

104
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,320
never compare to a rich heiress.

105
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,110
Kerui is much better!

106
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,990
Enough!

107
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,150
I'll give Yu Lou what I owe her.

108
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,660
Don't mention her again.

109
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,950
Besides, since you like
Mi Kerui so much,

110
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,030
I'll agree to talk about

111
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,990
the engagement with her family.

112
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,230
- What?
- What?

113
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,360
- What?
- Are you serious?

114
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,390
Mr. Liao called me this morning

115
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,000
and said Liao Youting agreed
to get engaged with you.

116
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,970
But...

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,950
How's that possible?

118
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,040
Why?

119
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,670
Liao Youting has changed a lot
since the accident.

120
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,070
He can't even recognize Yu Lou.

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,950
I'm not surprised he wants to marry you.

122
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,520
Kerui.

123
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,550
Yes?

124
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,910
Listen, you have to

125
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,080
seize the opportunity.

126
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,920
Don't mess it up.

127
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,310
I know you well.

128
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,550
Don't embarrass yourself again
like the last time in the banquet.

129
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,270
Don't worry.

130
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,420
I won't.

131
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,920
Yu Lou,

132
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,910
you haven't eaten well for many days.

133
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,120
I know it's hard to accept it.
