Professor Yan?

8
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,050
Yu Lou.

9
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:08,920
Yes?

10
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,830
Professor Yan,

11
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,400
it's so beautiful.

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,720
How are you?

13
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,550
I'm good. You?

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,990
Is it okay to be

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,590
grounded like this?

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,110
Professor Yan,

17
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,150
how do you know I live in Xijingyuan?

18
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,310
It's not hard to find out.

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,950
My family is close to

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,150
the Liao Family.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,910
Therefore, in our circle, everyone knows

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,510
you're Liao Youting's girlfriend

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,790
and the Tuo Family's heiress.

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,110
Really?

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,390
But I can't believe

26
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,750
Liao Youting would do this to you.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,840
Yu Lou,

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,910
I don't want to meddle in
your relationship,

29
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,070
but he told me to stay away.

30
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,190
I don't think it's up to him.

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,120
It's not like that.

32
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,280
It's a misunderstanding.
He's not always like this.

33
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,150
But he has no right to ground you!

34
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,690
Yu Lou.

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,180
Let's go abroad.

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,830
I've arranged
an overseas university for you.

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,270
Mr. Liao,

38
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,230
Mr. Yan's car is at your house.

39
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,950
You've always wanted to study abroad.

40
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,920
You wanna improve yourself.
Don't you remember?

41
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,620
I do, but I've been very busy.

42
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,550
- I don't have-
- Liao Youting treats you so badly.

43
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,990
You still can't move on?

44
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,960
I...

45
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,500
Do you want to give up your dream

46
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,680
and freedom

47
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,680
for him?

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,430
Yu Lou, why are you so stupid?

49
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,070
Professor Yan, what's wrong?

50
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,470
I can't leave you.

51
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,280
Liao Youting!

52
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,480
Move.

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,750
Isn't Professor Yan your friend?

54
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,950
Not anymore.

55
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,880
Listen to me.

56
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,630
He just wanted to talk about
studying abroad.

57
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,120
You got him wrong.

58
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,630
The exchange program?

59
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,800
Yes.

60
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,710
It's canceled.

61
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,760
How can you help her?

62
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,500
You only want to take her away!

63
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,230
I will take her away.

64
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,750
Liao Youting,

65
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,590
if you really love her,

66
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,870
I'll give up.

67
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,650
However, all I can see
is your selfishness.

68
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,080
Do you think I don't know

69
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,550
you bribed the president

70
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,630
and canceled the exchange opportunity
she wanted.

71
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,910
You're spying on her

72
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,630
and grounding her in Xijingyuan.

73
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,190
How can you take away

74
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,300
her freedom and life?

75
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,350
None of your business!

76
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,590
You don't deserve it!

77
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,190
It turns out

78
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,030
I never changed my fate.

79
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,170
Why?

80
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,060
Why?

81
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,670
What's wrong?

82
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,990
Let's go home.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,950
Go home?

84
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,750
So you can lock me up again?

85
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,550
I see.

86
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,470
You knew I went to Huaxi

87
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,750
and Xiaoqinghe.

88
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,530
You know where I am.

89
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,880
You even know I own Luolin Investment.

90
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,250
I can never escape from you.

91
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,450
You've been controlling me

92
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,830
the whole time.

93
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,230
No!

94
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,350
I was worried about you.
I wanted to protect you.

95
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,090
Protect me? That's why you canceled
my exchange opportunity?

96
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,470
I thought you were better.

97
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,310
I thought you changed.

98
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,070
Nothing is real!

99
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,870
I'm just still that toy
that doesn't need to be respected.

100
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,180
My tears, my smiles,

101
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,160
what I love and hate,

102
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,270
you don't care!

103
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,280
If it's not the way you want me to be,

104
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,100
you'll take everything from me

105
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,630
without telling me.

106
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,230
Liao Youting,

107
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,120
you're a monster.

108
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,390
You're a living devil!

109
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,370
Is that what you think of me?

110
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,960
Yes.

111
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,430
I want to escape from you.

112
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,230
I will pay back the money.

113
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,870
Please keep your promise.

114
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,710
Hello, Youting.

115
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,270
Take Luo home for dinner.

116
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,310
What?

117
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,710
Argument?

118
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,030
What argument?

119
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,780
Did you bully Luo?

120
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,900
