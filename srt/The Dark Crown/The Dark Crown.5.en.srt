My sister is Mr. Liao's fiancée.

You better stay away from him,

What?

00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,590
Tell your sister to keep an eye on him

93
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,990
and don't let him pester me.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,070
It's annoying.

95
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,870
Don't talk nonsense.

96
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,230
You must have seduced him,

97
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,640

- Mi Shanshan,

98
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,740
I think you are funny.

99
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,150

Whoever I'm with, your family

103
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,190
will take him away from me, right?

104
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,580
Bullshit.

105
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,660
Who do you think you are

106
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,900
to compete with us?

107
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,040
I'm warning you.

108
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,280
Don't ever mention Chen Yihao again.

109
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,620
OK.

110
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,710
I'll just pretend he is dead.

111
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,190
I won't mention him again.

112
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,850
You don't have to curse him.

113
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,350
Come back early.

114
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,040
I've got you a surprise.

115
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,850
I just spoke in anger.

116
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,010
Actually, I've given up on him.

117
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,570
Because I found

118
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,030
that he really loves you.

119
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,870
I guess his door password

120
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,840
will no longer be 0606.

121
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,030
- 0606?
- Yeah.

122
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,070
- What does it mean?
- It's today.

123
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,790
Today is a special day.

124
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,420
Don't you know the password to his door?

125
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,990
Have you never been to his place?

126
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,140
So what if I haven't?

127
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,310
Yihao is a decent man.

128
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,190
He doesn't just take girls home.

129
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,590
But I've been there.

130
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,750
He said it was cozy to date at home.

131
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,860
You can make the first move if he doesn't.

132
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,470
But when it comes to surprises,

133
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,100
you're not as good as me.

134
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,960
Who says that?

135
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,030
I'm going to surprise him tonight.

136
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,250
Alright, if you can,

137
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,030
change 0606 to your anniversary.

138
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,460
I'm going now.

139
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,060
I'll get you out of his world forever.

140

141

You look great in this.

142
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,180

143
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,060
Yes.

144
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,030
You should wear it again.

145
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,180
OK.

146
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,120

Turns out it was about yourself!

155

Shame on you to steal your friend's man.

156
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,870

162
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,720

- Listen to me!

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,730
Listen to me!

164

Yihao!

165
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,870
She did seduce me.

166
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,230
I had a few drinks today.

167
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,220
I didn't expect to see her in that.

168
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,350
Why are you doing this to me?

169
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,270
I even brought you a gift.

170
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,020
I brought you the plan you wanted most.

171
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,270
Shanshan, listen to me.

172
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,720
You know

173
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,870
I'm not a bad guy.

174
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,350
I didn't touch Yu Luo in three years.

175
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,750
I just had a few drinks today.

176
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,180
Get out of here!

177
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,080
Get out!

178
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,600
Fine, I'll get out.

179
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,270

(Nurse Station, Two days later)

181
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,320
You can leave after a rest.

185
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,100
You look pale.

186
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,170
The surgery must have hurt.

187
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,320
I'm fine.

188
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,390
Why didn't you tell me about your pregnancy?

189
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,000
Aren't we best friends?

190
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,460
I heard it was a miscarriage.

191
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,030
Where's the father?

192
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,430
Why isn't he here with you?

193
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,880
Forget it. I don't want to mention it.

194
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,480
Luo, how do you know I'm here?

195
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,030
Yihao told me.

196
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,970
I don't know where he heard it from.

197
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,560
It isn't appropriate for him to be here.

198
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,390
So I didn't bring him.

199
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,320
I think

200
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,790
you broke up with him.

201
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,640
- Why...
- That's expedient for making money.

202
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,940
You know he wants to start a business.

203
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,470
In fact, we're doing great.

204
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,700
He said he'd always love me.

205
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,030
He'll marry me when he's successful.

206
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,070
Yueru, don't worry about me.

207
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,350
We will be happy.

208
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,880
Don't worry. Eat this orange.
