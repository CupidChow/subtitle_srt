(Operating)

9
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,260
Mom, don't worry.

10
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,710
Grandma will be alright.

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,590
Hope so.

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,200
Mr. Liao,

13
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,140
Mrs. Liao is a blessed woman.

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,480
She will wake up.

15
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,830
Oh.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,480
It's late. Thank you
for being here with us.

17
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,200
The patient is fine. Don't worry.

18
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,430
Thanks.

19
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,070
It's okay now.

20
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,140
Where's my phone?

21
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,050
Miss Yu, stop looking.

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,390
I think someone else found it.

23
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,220
You need to find another way.

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,840
If someone finds it,

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,210
please let me know.

26
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,910
Okay, don't worry.

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,800
Mrs. Liao had a brain injury.

28
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,120
She's awake,

29
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,430
but she's physically
and verbally impaired.

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,660
It also affects her cognitive ability.

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,960
But

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,360
my mother didn't seem to recognize us.

33
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,850
Mr. Liao, calm down.

34
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,590
After all, she's old.

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,440
Will she recover?

36
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,300
We'll try our best.

37
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,770
She needs to be taken care of

38
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,760
and receive rehabilitative training.

39
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,840
In that case, she might recover.

40
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,270
Uncle Liao,

41
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,350
I wasn't careful enough,

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,070
or Yu Lou couldn't have done it.

43
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,770
We still don't know the truth.

44
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,990
Don't justify yourself.

45
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,110
Mrs. Liao, Kerui isn't lying.

46
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,440
Yu Lou and her were there alone.

47
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,960
Why did you let her attend it?

48
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,550
She's too old to attend a banquet.

49
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,040
Stop. No one could have foreseen this.

50
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,670
Besides, Mother wanted
to announce it in public.

51
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,400
You can't persuade her.

52
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,640
Announce?

53
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,850
Announce what?

54
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,500
Your grandma wanted to give

55
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,200
Kerui five percent
of Liao Group's shares.

56
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,850
Five percent?

57
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,750
Yes.

58
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,190
She wanted to help you.

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,550
She knew Kerui couldn't marry Youting,

60
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,520
so she wanted to compensate her.

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,320
It's a lot of money.

62
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,480
Mrs. Liao was so generous to her.

63
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,900
Mrs. Liao really cared about her.

64
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,590
Kerui, say thanks to Uncle Liao.

65
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,510
No need.

66
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,410
My grandma is still in bed

67
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,470
and in a coma.

68
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,000
She can't transfer the shares.

69
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,190
But Mrs. Liao...

70
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,150
Yes. She hired lawyers and notaries.

71
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,270
She wanted to sign it at the banquet

72
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,590
and gave Kerui a surprise.

73
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,140
Look what happened.

74
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,910
She still can't

75
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,990
talk or recognize us.

76
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,060
Youting, stay with her.

77
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,880
I'll check if her stuff was sent here.

78
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,020
Okay.

79
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,990
Grandma.

80
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,830
I'm Youting.

81
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,470
Can you hear me?

82
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,000
Look,

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,710
we're alone here,

84
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,600
just like when I was young,

85
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,030
you were the only one by my side.

86
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,400
Grandma!

87
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,800
Youting is unfilial,

88
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,110
and you're a vicious woman.

89
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,750
It's all nonsense.

90
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,660
But I've lost my phone

91
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,030
alone with the evidence.

92
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,310
It's hard to justify for Youting.

93
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,240
It's hard.

94
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,620
Don't forget you're also in trouble.

95
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,950
What trouble?

96
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,310
Just some harsh words.

97
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,430
However, it has greatly affected
Youting's reputation

98
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,870
and Liao Group's stock price.

99
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,950
It's a great loss.

100
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,590
It was so brave for him to defend you.

101
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,870
I want to visit Grandma.

102
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,160
Visit her?

103
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,160
The media are saying you're a murderer.

104
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,990
If you go, you'll be in trouble.

105
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,280
But I can't forgive myself.

106
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,720
Grandma helped me find my real parents

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,560
and deal with my family affairs.

108
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,020
I must visit her.

109
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,870
But, Luo, now it's...

110
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,870
Don't worry.

111
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,470
They can't arrest me.

112
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,150
Mi Kerui and I

113
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,670
are accusing each other.

114
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,350
They have to find evidence.

115
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,550
I'll be fine.

116
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,400
Don't worry.

117
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,390
Be careful.

118
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,750
You can call me anytime.

119
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,230
It was so close!

120
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,590
A five-percent share of Liao Group
is a huge sum of money!

121
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,350
How could she fall
before signing the contract?
