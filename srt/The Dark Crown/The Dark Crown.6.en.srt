Hello, Linda.

Luo, we agreed to be together every day.

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,710
Are you too busy dating Chen Yihao

Scum? What's going on?

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,670
You've been together for three years.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,710
It's a long story.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,320
I'll tell you later.
