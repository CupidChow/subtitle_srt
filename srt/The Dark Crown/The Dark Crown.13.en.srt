7
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,590
Go back, Xiaoxiao.

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,800
Wait a sec,

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,680
remember to put it on,

10
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,030
or I'll do it for you.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,200
All right.

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,710
Why is he so completely different from before?

13
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,470
(Xiaoxiao, what other secrets do you have?)

14
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,100
(Kill you?)

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,240
Speak.

16
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,390
Got it.

17
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,560
So, what grandma said was right.

18
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,120
Don't let others know this matter,

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,680
and most importantly,

20
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,730
don't tell Yu Luo.

21
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,450
Luo, I've met Mr. Yang.

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,800
Yeah, everything goes well.

23
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,310
It's all thanks to your taking the risk.

24
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,530
Now I'm the biggest shareholder of Nick Electronics.

25
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,230
It's just the matter of money...

26
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,140
Then forget it.

27
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,650
I'll figure it out.

28
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,910
That's all.

29
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,120
Mr. Zhang...

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,080
Mr. Zhang,

31
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,500
Mr. Zhang,

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,960
do you still remember me?

33
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,060
I'm Chen.

34
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,790
Oh, it's you.

35
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,030
Mr. Zhang, what happened last time was an accident.

36
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,710
I really made all the arrangements for you,

37
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,150
but you were staying in Room 1620,

38
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,150
while Mr. Liao was staying in Room 1260.

39
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,300
Stop talking.

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,070
You can make mistakes even in such a trifle.

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,350
I really don't know what else you can do.

42
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,830
Yes, yes, it's my fault.

43
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,980
Don't get angry.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,250
I'll make another arrangement for you.

45
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,160
So,

46
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,350
what do you want me to do?

47
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,020
I want to get some financing from you.

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,310
I have a project.

49
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,080
When it's done, I'll give you a share in proportion.

50
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,700
A good project?

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,350
Still that beauty?

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,630
No, not her.

53
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,400
Mr. Liao is watching her closely now.

54
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,030
Then what are you talking about?

55
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,120
Mr, Chen,

56
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,610
there was another beauty with me last time.

57
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,990
I've introduced her to you.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,940
Her name is Yueru. Do you still remember her?

59
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,230
Oh! I remember now.

60
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,620
But she's far from the previous one.

61
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,480
Sure,

62
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,190
but this project is stable.

63
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,350
You can get both money and beauty.

64
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,550
Lad,

65
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,840
this time,

66
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,150
you must not make any mistakes.

67
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,510
Definitely not.

68
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,530
Don't worry.

69
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,470
Yihao, where are you taking me?

70
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,630
Didn't you say you'd take me home?

71
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,480
Yeah,

72
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,800
go home.

73
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,910
We'll be there soon.

74
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,450
What? Do you think I'm drunk?

75
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,270
This is a hotel, not home.

76
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,680
Yueru,

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,660
I still have something to do.

78
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,230
Go and have a rest first.

79
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,700
I'll pick you up later.

80
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,340
- Really?
- Of course.

81
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,520
Take me home.

82
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,940
Great! Home,

83
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,640
our home.

84
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,880
- Good girl.
- Yeah.

85
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,140
Yihao, my head hurts so much.

86
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,200
I'm thirsty.

87
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,780
Who are you?

88
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,620
What are you doing?

89
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,620
You've lost your memory?

90
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,920
Just one night and you've all forgotten?

91
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,760
No!

92
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,020
Don't come over!

93
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,410
Stop it!

94
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,190
What are you crying for?

95
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,040
Listen,

96
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,350
don't hang out with that guy called

97
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,860
Chen Yihao any more.

98
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,430
He's not a nice guy.

99
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,430
Follow me

100
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,030
and I'll treat you well.

101
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,590
Behind Haoyang Investment is the Mili Group.

102
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,990
A lean camel is still bigger than a horse.

103
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,350
They can hold on.

104
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,260
Then I wish Mr. Huang all the best.

105
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,920
Miss Yu, you should take a break.

106
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,680
My office

107
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,070
is almost like yours.

108
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,750
Well, there's no office room in Luolin Investment,

109
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,950
so I just have to use yours for the moment.

110
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,160
I've also been keeping an eye on Nick Electronics.

111
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,550
It's on a great roll.

112
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,990
No wonder you invested all the Aolan stocks in Nick.

113
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,460
Are we going to make a big profit this time?

114
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,000
Nick is bound to lose money.

115
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,080
Ah?

116
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,150
Then why did you make such moves, Luo?

117
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,660
Those who bought them will be badly ripped off.

118
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,670
It was Chen Yihao who bought them.

119
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,710
So you...

120
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,070
did it on purpose?

121
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,030
Right.

122
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,090
Now he's the biggest shareholder of Nick.
