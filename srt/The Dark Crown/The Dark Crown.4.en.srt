=Episode 4=

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,710
Busy guy, did you make time to see me off?

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,960
This is...

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,950
Let me introduce her.

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,390
She's my favorite student

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,950
I always tell you about,

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,880
Yu Luo.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,200
Oh.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,480
Yu Luo?

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,800
Hello.

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,930
My name is Yu Luo,

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,930
and my nickname is Yu Xiaoxiao.

18
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,850
Nickname?

19
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,070
It's about time for you to get in.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,640
Professor Yan.

21
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,170
I suddenly remembered an urgent business.

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,040
I can't see you in.

23
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,300
I have to go.

24
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,590
I'm going to tell her after she graduates

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,170
that I like her.

26
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,040
I was going to say goodbye,

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,240
but I didn't even give him the gift.

28
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,790
How come they are friends?

29
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,130
He is everywhere.

30
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:43,710
Annoying guy.

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,010
Miss Yu went to the supermarket,

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,470
bought some flowers,

33
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,300
had some noodles, and then went home.

34
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,300
I see.

35
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,490
Humph.

36
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,130
Urgent business?

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,260
Chen Yihao,

38
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,600
you're back so late again.

39
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,560
Were you fooling around with Mi Shanshan?

40
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,110
I told you.

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,350
Put up with it a little longer.

42
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,560
When I get money from Mi Shanshan,

43
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,110
we'll have a good life.

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,730
Good life?

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,790
When you were dating Yu Luo,

46
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,830
I could only be with you secretly.

47
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,190
Now there is Mi Shanshan.

48
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,090
Will I never see the light of day?

49
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,070
Will my baby never see the light of day?

50
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,100
Haven't you aborted the baby?

51
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,710
Didn't I pay you?

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,590
You're looking for trouble.

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,870
Luo is more sensible than you.

54
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,540
(In my last life, I stayed with Liao)

55
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,440
(and ended up dying tragically.)

56
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,170
(I must find a way to pay him back)

57
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,670
(and escape my fate entwined with his.)

58
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,560
(12 days and she hasn't called me.)

59
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,240
Mr. Liao.

60
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,780
Mr. Liao.

61
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,680
What?

62
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,790
Mr. Zhang asked for your opinion.

63
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,830
Do you have to ask me everything,

64
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,730
right?

65
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,630
Everyone write a self-criticism letter!

66
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,180
Hey.

67
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,200
Aolan Studios.

68
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,080
Aolan Studios had a high

69
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,540
- stock price as I remember.
- Has become

70
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,560
the largest domestic film and TV base.

71
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,550
Since its listing,

72
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,750
its stock price has skyrocketed.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,430
Aolan's current share price is low.

74
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,630
I have an idea.

75
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,510
What's the hurry?

76
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,650
Yihao, answer me,

77
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,830
did you break up with Yu Luo for good?

78
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,760
Of course.

79
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,070
I don't feel anything for her anymore.

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,960
Now

81
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,390
I only care about you.

82
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,240
Really?

83
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,200
Really.

84
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,200
Shanshan, you're so beautiful.

85
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,870
You gave me a car

86
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,190
and support my career.

87
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,470
The only woman I want to marry

88
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,520
is you.

89
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,350
What if Yu Luo pesters you?

90
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,510
She told me she'd never give you up.

91
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,710
Don't worry.

92
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,760
Luo

93
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,790
is busy accompanying Liao Youting.

94
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,350
What did you say?

95
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,470
Yu Luo hooked up with Mr. Liao?

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,830
Mr. Liao, I just got the news.

97
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,140
Miss Yu is here at Huaxi.

98
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,000
Is Yu Luo here?

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,550
But we don't know what she's doing here.

100
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,630
They're still watching her.

101
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,030
No wonder she didn't call me.

102
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,870
She came directly to me again.

103
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,040
Is she here to see you?

104
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,270
Should I go

105
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,390
pick her up?

106
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,240
No.

107
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,150
I don't really want to see her.

108
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,750
Don't mind her.

109
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,110
How did she know I lived here?

110
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,700
One million.

111
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,020
This is not a loan.

112
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,430
I'm investing with you.

113
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,550
Miss Yu

114
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,270
doesn't seem to be here to see you.

115
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,350
She went to the 14th floor

116
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,440
to see

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,250
Linda, the new manager of Huaxi.

118
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,950
If you make money, I'll take half.

119
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,000
If you lose money, I'll bear half, too.

120
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,620
Linda,

121
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,520
don't worry.

122
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,080
If I lose money, I'll pay you my life.

123
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,740
Wow, that's too much.

124
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,870
Alright, don't get so emotional.

125
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,640
Now we're in the same city.

126
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,870
We can meet whenever we want,

127
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,930
just like when we were young.

128
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,100
(Lobby)

129
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,550
(Linda grew up with me.)

130
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,750
(She doesn't want me to lose too much.)

131
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,930
(So she asked to bear half the loss.)

132
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,460
(She's so good to me.)

133
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,200
(I must repay her double.)

134
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,470
Don't you know what you should do?

135
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,700
Why didn't you call me?

136
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,630
Why didn't you call me?

137
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,800
12 days.

138
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,270
I was busy.

139
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,270
You had time to see Yan Lan off,

140
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,710
but didn't have time to call me?

141
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,420
I'm calling now.

142
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,660
What's your number?

143
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,430
Say it.

144
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,350
What are you busy with?

145
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,110
I'm busy making money

146
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,950
to pay you back.

147
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,070
You're lying.

148
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,910
I'm not lying.

149
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,370
Really.

150
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,880
Yu Xiaoxiao.

151
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,470
Xiaoxiao is my nickname

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,480
given by my mom.

153
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,400
Not many people know about it.

154
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,150
I didn't lie to you.

155
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:41,850
Give me your phone.

156
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,910
Remember to call me.

157
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,250
At least once a week.

158
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,760
Yes.

159
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,910
You were cocky that day.

160
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,370
But why are you so scared of me now?

161
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,380
Can I go now?

162
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,750
As you wish.

163
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,340
Gift?

164
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,600
For whom?

165
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,250
I was going to say goodbye,

166
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,950
but I didn't even give him the gift.

167
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,920
(No, the gift to Professor Yan.)

168
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,040
I bought it for you.

169
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,040
