7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,510
What did I do to have such a stupid daughter?

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,570
We're almost bankrupt because of your jealousy.

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,500
Now you have the nerve to cry?

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,920
How could Shanshan know this would happen?

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,290
What's the point of hitting her?

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,870
Do you know how much we've lost this time?

13
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,640
Hit her? I'll beat her to death!

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,270
You know Shanshan is like me.

15
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,530
She's simple-minded.

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,350
How could she have expected so many things?

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,330
I really didn't know.

18
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,750
If I had known, I would never have done it.

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,870
Didn't expect that?

20
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,230
Then how did you know to compete for a man

21
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,470
and tear down her house?

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,070
How mean of you!

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,140
It was her!

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,630
She told me the address,

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,960
so I went there.

26
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,910
So what?

27
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,680
I didn't tell you to tear down her house.

28
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,450
Dad, you've never hit me before.

29
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,120
Since you made the mess, go and clean it up yourself!

30
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,490
It serves them right.

31
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,390
They bullied you in such ways.

32
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,350
Mi Shanshan has really no bottom line.

33
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,350
But I don't understand why.

34
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,120
Mi Shanshan does like to behave in this way,

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,920
but I haven't seen Chen Yihao for a long time.

36
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,430
Why did she suddenly do this?

37
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,510
Who knows what got into her?

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,220
Anyway, this time I side with Liao Youting.

39
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,190
He did a great job.

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,470
He was ruthless enough.

41
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,260
It's hard for them to get back on their feet again.

42
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,560
Yeah, it's true.

43
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,630
I thought he stopped me just for the Mi.

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,540
Yet, I didn't expect that...

45
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,960
He's afraid you would suffer losses.

46
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,010
Luo,

47
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,670
luckily, you didn't act impulsively this time.

48
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,950
With the power of the Mi,

49
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,790
you could end up in a lose-lose situation with them,

50
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,050
or maybe even worse.

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,790
This time, all Liao did is just for you,

52
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,710
regardless of interests

53
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,710
and dignity.

54
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,560
I think he really likes you.

55
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,650
I'm not that easy to bully.

56
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,750
He doesn't know that the Mihas more to pay back.

57
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,590
Well, never mind,

58
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,590
Linda,

59
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,070
I have something to discuss with you.

60
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,350
Aolan Studios is to dump its stocks.

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,400
Okay, how much?

62
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,470
All of them.

63
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,740
(Land of Etiquette.)

64
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,600
Is it true?

65
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,150
They didn't even tell me such a big thing.

66
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,750
Do they really think I'm too old?

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,810
Granny Liao, don't be angry.

68
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,800
They're worried it'll affect your health.

69
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,290
I couldn't bear to see the family become like this,

70
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,920
so I had to shamelessly come and beg you.

71
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,310
My sister did do something wrong.

72
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,270
She stood up for me quite by accident.

73
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,100
But I didn't expect Youting liked Yu Luo so much

74
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,790
that it has harmed us instead.

75
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,160
Don't cry, Kerui.

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,510
I'll take your side.

77
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,270
I'll never let Youting act recklessly.

78
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,480
Yu Luo?

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,070
What kind of woman is she?

80
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,760
Youting's indifferent to women. How could it be?

81
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,360
It's because she has a seductive face

82
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,980
and is full of tricks.

83
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,100
Hmph,

84
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,550
I'd like to see what kind of vixen she is.

85
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,530
It's her.

86
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,990
She's trying her best to move up by her good looks.

87
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,410
I've heard much gossip about her.

88
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,700
(Info: Yu Luo.)

89
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,610
Shanshan, I'm gonna answer a phone call.

90
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,320
Who's that? And you're answering it secretly.

91
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,470
It's my mom.

92
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,190
I don't want you to hear her scold me as useless.

93
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,120
Luoluo,

94
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,990
you finally called me.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,070
Are you okay?

96
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,830
Fine. And you?

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,030
Do you miss me?

98
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,110
Of course.

99
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,830
I miss you all the time.

100
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,590
When can I see you, Luo?

101
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,630
Tonight,

102
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,930
I'm free tonight.

103
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,390
And I have something to tell you.

104
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,800
Sure, see you tonight.

105
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,340
Luo, I miss you so much.

106
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,800
All right.

107
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,030
(Just waiting for you to walk into the trap.)

108
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,910
Luo, you're here.

109
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,890
Long time no see.

110
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,120
Okay.

111
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,140
Mr. Liao,

112
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,970
I just got the news

113
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,990
that Miss Yu went to have Japanese food.

114
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,800
It was Chen Yihao who brought the reporters that night.

115
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,400
Chen Yihao?

116
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,030
Luo, have some more.

117
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,550
Look at you, you've lost weight.

118
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,790
I don't have an appetite.

119
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,750
Of course,

120
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,790
you're with Mr. Liao.

121
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,270
You can have all kinds of delicious food.

122
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,150
But I still miss the time when I was with you.

123
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,070
Yihao, I came here to help you make more money

124
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,150
so that we can be together again.

125
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,060
Make money?

126
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,550
Do you know Nick Electronics?

127
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,060
I have some inside scoop.

128
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,520
They have a large amount of capital behind them,

129
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,000
and the listing process is very stable.

130
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,150
If you invest now, you definitely double your money.

131
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,350
I know.

132
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,990
How do you know?

133
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,070
By reading the news.

134
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,340
I'm observing the situation.

135
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,790
Your really have a sharp eye.

136
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,990
As expected, I didn't misjudge you, Yihao.

137
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,890
I heard Mr. Liao is interested in Nick Electronics.
