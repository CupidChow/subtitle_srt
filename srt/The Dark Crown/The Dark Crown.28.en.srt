00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,670
Liar, why didn't you call me
when you missed me?

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,070
You're a big liar. It's been 100 days.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,240
What about you?

10
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,110
Do you miss me?

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,040
No.

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,500
Then why did you come?

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,190
I wanted to know
if you were working hard.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,030
After all, you're my kept boy.

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,310
I need to be responsible.

00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,110
If your group loses too much money
due to the incident,

17
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,470
I'll make money and keep you.

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,750
Don't worry, I can handle anything

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,040
but you.

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,800
Well,

21
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,710
now that I'm your kept boy,

22
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,710
am I supposed to do something?

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,940
Like what?

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,280
What...

25
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,590
What do you want?

26
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,460
You tell me.

27
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,830
Youting, I brought...

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,040
Oh.

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,280
Well,

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm busy. Goodbye.

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,430
Why didn't you lock the door?

32
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,810
Why should I?

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,060
Who dares to come in?

34
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,080
Besides, I didn't know she was coming.

35
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,160
Don't move.

36
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,360
Get back to work.

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,180
I'll wait for you at home.

38
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,280
At home?

00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,360

52
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,670
Mom is much better.

53
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,550
She had porridge today.

54
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,870
But she still can't speak.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,870
Don't worry.

56
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,750

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,150
Listen,

58
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,750
when I sent some cakes
to Youting's office,

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,190
I saw him kissing Luo.

60
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,510
They got back together.

61
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,360
Wow.

62
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,150
Don't mention Yu Lou
in front of her, okay?

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,310
What?

64
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,950
I'm sure Luo didn't push her.

65
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,120
Think about it.

66
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,470
It's a big hotel.

67
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,420
Why is there no surveillance
at the place she fell?

68
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,550
Someone must've planned this

69
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,760
for a long time.

70
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,760
I invited Luo right before the banquet.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,520
She didn't know anything about it,

72
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,470
so it can't be her.

73
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,460
But it can't be Kerui either.

74
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,530
She cares about Mom.

75
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,850
You're always prejudiced against Kerui.

76
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,200
I... Well,

77
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,710
I don't like her,

78
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,070
but I'm not saying she did it.

79
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,220
If I had evidence, I would...

80
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,240
Wait.

81
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,050
Hello, who's this?

82
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,710
What?

83
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,400
Youting!

84
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,750
How could I fall asleep?

85
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,950
What time is it?

86
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,310
It's almost 1:00 a.m.

87
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,230
Why didn't he call?

88
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,800
What took him so long?

89
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,780
Hello?

90
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,710
Miss Yu, I'm Li Shang.

91
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,560
Li Shang?

92
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,510
Mr. Liao had an accident.
He's in the hospital.

93
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,540
(Nurse Station)

94
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,920
Youting!

95
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,510
Mr. Liao went to City Hai for a meeting.

96
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,030
He wanted to come back earlier.

97
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,990
It was dark,

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,030
and he...

99
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,750
Why are you so silly?

100
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,290
You could tell me you were busy.

101
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,150
Luo, don't worry.

102
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,800
The doctor said

103
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,460
he'd be fine.

104
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,880
He's sleeping because of the anesthetic.

105
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,030
He'll wake up tomorrow.

106
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,070
What's the point of crying?

107
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,830
Give him a break.

108
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,110
He's been upset lately

109
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,550
and busy with making up
for the group's losses.

110
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,530
It was fatigue driving, so...

111
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,250
Stop saying that.

112
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,150
Who'd have thought this would happen?

113
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,870
Youting, I'm here with you.

114
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,550
I won't argue with you anymore.

115
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,030
I won't leave you again.

116
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,470
I'll be a good girl.

117
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,270
I'm not crying.

118
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,100
Just take a break.
