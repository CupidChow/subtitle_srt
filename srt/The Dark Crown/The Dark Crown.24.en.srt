7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,070
(Before I met Mi Kerui,)

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,450
(I thought)

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,000
(Li Xiaohua twisted)

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,920
(Mi Kerui's word in the previous life.)

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,330
(However, when I met her,
I knew she meant it.)

12
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,450
(She's not only mean)

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,710
(but revengeful.)

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,020
(She must be dying to see me fail.)

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,770
(I have to be careful.)

16
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,100
(Has Youting arrived?)

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,820
Luo!

18
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,910
Grandma, you're here.

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,660
Yes, I haven't seen you since last time.

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,390
I've missed you.

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,350
Kerui, look!
I told you I shouldn't wear this.

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,550
Look, it's so inconvenient.

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,030
Yu Lou, come here.

24
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,870
Why?

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,710
Mrs. Liao is in trouble.

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,310
Come and help her.

27
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,190
Don't teach me!

28
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,170
(It's supposed to be
a normal thing to do.)

29
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,480
(Now she's making it a big deal.)

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,010
Grandma, let me help you.

31
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,030
Okay.

32
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,250
Oh!

33
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,780
Grandma!

34
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,980
Grandma!

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,650
Mi Kerui, are you crazy?

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,040
I'm crazy?

37
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,720
Ungrateful old woman.

38
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,590
I've served her well for over 10 years.

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,110
However, she betrayed me.

40
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,750
She wanted Youting to marry you.

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,110
What about me?

42
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,310
Am I her maid?

43
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,390
Or a joker who sings to please her?

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,050
You don't need to call them.

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,260
They're coming.

46
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,080
However, I knew

47
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,480
there was no surveillance.

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,900
When they come,

49
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,250
who will be the crazy person

50
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,630
in their eyes?

51
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,700
You're a monster!

52
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,590
I wanted to make it
look like an accident,

53
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,160
but you came.

54
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,980
What a surprise.

55
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,610
Oh! Help!

56
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,550
Help!

57
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,990
Yu Lou pushed Mrs. Liao downstairs!

58
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,970
Get off me!

59
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,080
Are you crazy?

60
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,710
Move! Hurry!

61
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,260
What's going on?

62
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,900
What happened to her?

63
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:08,990
It was Yu Lou!

64
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,440
She pushed Mrs. Liao downstairs!

65
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,270
I didn't!

66
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,700
It was Mi Kerui who pushed her!

67
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,640
Nonsense! Mrs. Liao has been good to me.

68
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,510
Why would I push her?

69
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,700
It was you.

70
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,790
Mrs. Liao wanted to

71
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,230
persuade her to leave Youting.

72
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,670
She got angry and pushed her.

73
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,620
She did it!

74
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,470
You...

75
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,310
You're Yu Lou.

76
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,960
Stop slandering Kerui!

77
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,140
Everyone knows she's a good girl.

78
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,910
We've just met!

79
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,790
How could you frame her?

80
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,990
How could you push Mrs. Liao?

81
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,310
You're so cruel!

82
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,960
I didn't do it!

83
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,010
There were only two people.

84
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,430
It's either you or her.

85
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,640
Where's the evidence?

86
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,020
Evidence...

87
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,190
Where are you going? Don't move!

88
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,440
Move!

89
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,540
Youting, Yu Lou
pushed your grandma downstairs.

90
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,920
Send her to the police.

91
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,850
Yu Lou wouldn't do that.

92
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,760
Youting,

93
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,390
what do you mean?

94
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,030
I said she'd never do that.

95
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,590
Huaren Hospital?

96
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,040
Okay, I'm coming.

97
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,240
Liao Youting, why do you believe me?

98
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,470
You don't have to defend me.

99
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,280
Got it.

100
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,910
If I defend you,

101
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,120
you'll hate me more, right?

102
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,510
No. That's not what I meant.

103
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,190
I never pushed Grandma,

104
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,670
and I will...

105
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,520
Don't explain it.

106
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,870
As you said,

107
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,070
you should believe and understand

108
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,740
the person you love,

109
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,510
so I won't suspect you.

110
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,050
Even if everyone thinks you did it,

111
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,500
I'll trust anything you say

112
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,190
because you're the person I love.

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,070
Liao Youting...

114
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,750
But what about you?

115
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,530
Have you ever loved me?

116
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,860
You're safe. Just go.

117
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,880
I...

118
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,510
Don't you want to escape from me?

119
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,550
You're free to go!
