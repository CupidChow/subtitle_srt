7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,980
Luo, you're close to Mr. Liao.

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,670
I wonder if they have a position...

9
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,510
Those who work for his Group are elites.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,070
He isn't interested in fresh graduates.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,260
I only need to drink tea and spend money.

12
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,640
I have nothing serious to do.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,870
That's not bad.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,310
It's great to have a man spoil you,

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,790
not to mention it's Mr. Liao.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,190
Although he spoils me

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,300
and gives me everything I want,

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,710
I'm still thinking of Yihao.

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,430
After all, he is my first love.

20
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,990
We have a three-year relationship.

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,080
Don't you think so?

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,840
Alas.

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,350
I had a lot to talk with Yihao.

24
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,790
But I don't understand Liao Youting.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,120
He talks about mergers and acquisitions

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,130
of Nick Electronics everyday.

27
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,590
So annoying.

28
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,890
Nick Electronics?

29
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:21,950
Yeah.

30
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,140
That tech company in the limelight?

31
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,390
Is he entering the tech industry?

32
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,830
I don't think so.

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,730
He has people work on the data.

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,790
They talk about guaranteed profit.

35
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,670
I think he just wants to make money.

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,020
Guaranteed profit?

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,400
Yes, technology is the trend.

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,630
Mr. Liao is far-sighted.

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,230
Nick Electronics.

40
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,510
A project that is appreciated by Mr. Liao

41
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,310
must be promising.

42
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,300
Who cares? I only need his money.

43
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,840
The coffee is terrible.

44
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,070
I have to see Youting tonight. Bye.

45
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,080
Bah.

46
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,280
What a parvenu.

47
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,990
Terrible coffee?

48
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,230
You couldn't even afford your tuition.

49
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,320
Hey!

50
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,710
She didn't pay the bill.

51
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,800
Yueru,

52
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,310
did Yu Luo really tell you that?

53
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,950
Sure.

54
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,240
She said she heard it from Mr. Liao.

55
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,340
Guaranteed profit.

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,420
But it's a business secret.

57
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,350
Why would Liao Youting tell her?

58
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,550
Why wouldn't he?

59
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,230
Mr. Liao spoils Yu Luo.

60
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,110
You didn't see what a parvenu she is.

61
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,190
Yihao,

62
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,090
are you jealous?

63
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,680
Why would I be jealous?

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,830
Don't I have you?

65
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,150
Seriously?

66
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,710
Then why are you with Mi Shanshan?

67
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,470
You make me unable to go home.

68
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,510
I have to crash in this shitty hotel.

69
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,800
Yueru,

70
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,190
shall I

71
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,270
do some research about Nick Electronics?

72
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,660
If what Yu Luo said is true,

73
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,070
we'll be rich.

74
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,350
I no longer have to please Mi Shanshan.

75
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,610
I'll only be with you,

76
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,730
ok?

77
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,350
Really?

78
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,550
Then you can only love me.

79
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,710
Yeah.

80
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,460
I'm going to take a shower.

81
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,550
Luo, are you fine?

82
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,200
Can we meet recently?

83
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,160
No. I miss you, but I can't make time.

84
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,370
What are you busy with?

85
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,700
Liao Youting let me stay by his side,

86
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,410
not letting me go for a second. Annoying.

87
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,300
Luo, put up with it a little longer.

88
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,140
Remember, I love you.

89
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,240
Not go for a second.

90
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,150
Looks like what she said is true.

91
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,790
Yueru must have told him.

92
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,350
Chan Yihao, you're welcome.

93
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,900
(Nick Electronics)

94
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,840
Dad, please say yes.

95
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,750
Yihao is really talented.

96
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,510
But that's a lot of money.

97
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,850
Besides, Chen Yihao...

98
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,390
I told you it's a guaranteed profit.

99
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,740
Yihao will give me all the profit.

100
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,510
We agreed to be together for a lifetime.

101
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,750
You've only been dating for a few days.

102
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,090
Guaranteed profit?

103
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,070
There's no such good deal.

104
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,870
Why not?

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,390
We got the information from Mr. Liao.

106
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,780
He won't make a mistake.

107
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,230
How could such a guy know Youting?

108
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,180
You...

109
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,430
He doesn't know him.

110
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,300
But someone knows him.

111
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,930
I heard Yu Luo has been with Mr. Liao,

112
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,530
24 hours a day.

113
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,900
You're jealous of me.

114
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,110
My Yihao

115
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,230
is handsome and talented.

116
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,300
And he sincerely loves me.

117
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,590
But Mr. Liao doesn't care about you.

118
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,440
That's right.

119
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,910
You can't get him after so many years.

120
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,240
No wonder you're jealous of Shanshan.

121
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,040
- You...
- Enough.

122
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,860
You're giving me a headache.

123
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,910
Kerui,

124
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,110
get back to your work.

125
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,770
