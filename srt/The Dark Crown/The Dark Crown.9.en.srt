Chen Yihao may worry if she gets hurt.

10

You should let her fear you to the bone.

Fear me to the bone?

Xiaoqinghe?

You're dressed very formally today.

Wow! You look so gorgeous!

Am I?

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,350
I didn't dress up on purpose.

33

No way,

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,940
look at your waist,

35

your legs.

36

Have you gone out?

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,390
Yeah, I'm on the way.

42
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,350
See you soon.

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,670
(The battery is low.)
It's out of power.

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,270
I'll charge it later.

45
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,670
Who is that?

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,840
Hello?

47
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,870
Sorry! The subscriber is power off.

48
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,560
Mr. Liao,

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,230
still no news about Miss Yu.

50
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,670
Didn't I tell you to watch her?

51
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,430
Yes, I've handled the involved people.

52
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,790
However, we got a piece of news.

53
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,230
Miss Yu's old house

54
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,470
was suddenly demolished today.

55
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,510
What?

56
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,900
We're still finding out the situation.

57
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,840
Do you think she's rushed back?

58
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,830
Yu Luo, I'm Aunt Wang, your neighbor.

59
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,070
Come back quickly.

60
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,070
Your house was destroyed this afternoon.

61
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,430
Are your mom's ashes and relics in there?

62
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,150
Driver, go to Xiaoqinghe.

63
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,950
But aren't you going to Liuli Restaurant?

64
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,440
Go to Xiaoqinghe.

65
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,720
Mom...

66
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,310
Sis,

67
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,070
Yu Luo's house has been ruined by me.

68
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,230
It's also raining heavily.

69
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,960
She's stunned and still moving things here.

70
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,070
It's so satisfying to see that.

71
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,710
So pitiful.

72
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,280
I thought since you liked Xijingyuan,

73
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,570
you wouldn't need the house any more.

74
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,190
Something even more pitiful is coming up.

75
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,950
I didn't expect it,

76
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,190
getting Mi Shanshan to demolish the house

77
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,910
can bring out such an interesting secret.

78
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,580
(Yu Luo: Dad, unknown; Mom, Ye Lan.)

79
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,040
Xiaoxiao,

80
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,620
it's me.

81
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,240
Why are you here?

82
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,670
Youting,

83
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,580
help me.

84
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,320
What do you want me to do?

85
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,330
Help me...

86
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,140
to find my mom.

87
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,820
The rain is too heavy.
Go back first.

88
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,690
Let's go home.

89
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,650

90
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,310

91
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,160
Okay, sir.

92
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,470
Change her clothes

93
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,320
and give her a bath.

94
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,240
