7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,840
Yueru,

8
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,590
how come Yueru is here?

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,380
Yueru, why are you here?

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,540
Are you here for me?

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,640
I didn't expect that

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,620
only you care about me at this moment.

13
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,190
Yueru, the Mi family is chasing me for the debt,

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,360
and there's also Mr. Zhang.

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,870
They forced me with knives.

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,820
I'm desperate, Yueru.

17
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,670
Yihao,

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,630
do you still love me?

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,120
Of course! I do!

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,040
Please, don't leave me, okay?

21
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:02,890
Fine.

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,940
As long as you love me,

23
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,430
I will never leave you.

24
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,780
Yihao,

25
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,030
you know what?

26
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,420
I've never been after a good life with you.

27
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,640
I really love you.

28
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,460
I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.

29
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,830
But at that time, I didn't dare to get close to you.

30
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,510
I had to take Yu Luo as an excuse to get close to you.

31
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,690
Only in this way

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,270
would you pay more attention to me.

33
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,430
Yu Luo,

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,240
I should never have let her meet you.

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,920
It's the thing I regret the most.

36
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,310
Without her, you wouldn't have become like this.

37
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,890
But, have you realized that?

38
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,420
I'm the only one who truly loves you.

39
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,120
Yu Luo will harm you,

40
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,510
Mi Shanshan will harm you,

41
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,470
but I, Yueru, won't!

42
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,710
Yueru,

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,550
I know you are the best to me,

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,750
but I borrowed a lot of money.

45
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,770
Please help me, okay?

46
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,320
Okay.

47
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,600
Don't be afraid.

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,760
I'll help you.

49
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,200
Go and sleep with Mr. Zhang.

50
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,190
Didn't he give you a lot of money?

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,020
He will surely give you more if you do that.

52
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,960
Yueru,

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,570
please!

54
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,790
Fine.

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,600
I'll help you.

56
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,760
Yihao,

57
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,060
I really love you.

58
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,120
I love you!

59
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,520
(Wang Yueru was arrested for intentional homicide)

60
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,780
(and received legal punishment.)

61
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,310
Wang Yueru killed Chen Yihao.

62
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,120
I didn't expect it would end like this.

63
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,010
My plan

64
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,830
was to make Chen Yihao go bankrupt.

65
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,680
He's greedy,

66
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,870
and this was his punishment.

67
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,030
But Yueru...

68
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,980
How could she get caught in his grip?

69
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,110
After all, she had been pregnant with his child.

70
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,830
How could he do such a thing?

71
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,020
For money,

72
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,330
he really dared to do anything.

73
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,920
So, for ending up like this,

74
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,280
he can only blame himself.

75
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,130
I'm the one who caused all this.

76
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,710
Not at all, they brought it upon themselves.

77
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,310
Luo,

78
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,740
actually, I'm so scared.

79
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,990
When I think of how you used to trust Chen Yihao,

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,950
I'm so afraid that you would be in Yueru's position.

81
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,880
Thank God, you haven't been hurt.

82
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,460
Don't blame yourself any more.

83
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,670
(But how could I really escape?)

84
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,430
Luo,

85
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,080
everything has passed.

86
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,590
Up so early again?

87
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,720
Well,

88
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,030
with your boyfriend in such a big trouble,

89
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,580
how could you sleep?

90
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,490
With one less brother- in- law to support me,

91
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,920
I might also lose sleep, right?

92
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,670
Mi Kerui,

93
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,360
does his death make you so happy?

94
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,090
Whether he dies or not is none of my business.

95
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,870
I'm just sorry that our money

96
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,430
has been emptied by you two jerks.

97
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,710
Us two?

98
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,150
You must have said the same thing to dad,

99
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,230
trying to make him drive me out of the house,

100
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,110
trying to make him completely disown me.

101
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,070
Who can you blame for what you've done?

102
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,400
Oh,

103
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,590
remember to take your mom with you when you leave,

104
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,910
so that she won't take the scolding for you.

105
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,100
In your dreams!

106
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,520
If anyone has to leave, it shall be you.

107
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,770
Mi Kerui,

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,520
don't count your chickens before they hatch.

109
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,150
If Mr. Liao doesn't want you,

110
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,630
you are nothing in this family!

111
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,480
Mi Shanshan,

112
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,000
I will surely let you know

113
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,340
that the family can't do without me!

114
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,120
