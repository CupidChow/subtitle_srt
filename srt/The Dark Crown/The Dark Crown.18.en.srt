(DNA Test Report)

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,030
You knew it, right?

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,810
Girl, don't blame him.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,390
I asked him to steal your hair
for the DNA test.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,990
I just wanted to figure it out.

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,510
I thought they demolished

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,790
the house in Xiaoqinghe
without authorization

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,350
and wanted to resort to law,

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,590
but I couldn't find any wrongdoing.

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,160
Xiaoxiao.

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,630
Your mother raised you,

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,750
but she couldn't get your custody,

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,870
so you were registered
to her relative's household.

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,780
Legally speaking,

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,670
you can't inherit this house.

23
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,030
I thought she gave my custody
to my uncle

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,190
for my education.

25
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,950
I think she loved you so much

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,990
that she couldn't tell you.

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,280
Me too.

28
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,670
Yes.

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,510
We all love you.

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,470
Your real mother

31
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,400
was my best friend.

32
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,510
It's God's plan for us to find you,

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,510
so we'll take care of you
for your mother.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,910
I wanted to tell you at the right time,

35
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,950
but Kerui...

36
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,590
Girl, I'm sorry for your suffering.

37
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,520
How's that possible?

38
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,470
Isn't she an illegitimate child?

39
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,640
How can she be
the heiress of the Tuo Family?

40
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,670
How's that possible?

41
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,750
(Why? After the rebirth,)

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,870
(everything went well.)

43
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,190
(I've got money)

44
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,910
(and taken the revenge,)

45
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,870
(and even Liao Youting has changed.)

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,790
(Why did I lose my mother again)

47
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,320
(like this?)

48
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,620
(What did I do wrong?)

49
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,750
I knew you'd blame me,

50
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,470
but I didn't know how to tell you.

51
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,030
When I saw you like that in Xiaoqinghe,

52
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,550
I realized

53
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,550
you loved each other so much.

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,470
My mother really loved me.

55
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,410
She brought me up alone.

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,550
She worked multiple jobs

57
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,150
only to let me live a happy life
like other kids.

58
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,110
I don't understand.

59
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,830
I'm not her daughter,

60
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,110
but why did she treat me so well?

61
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,350
Blood ties aren't everything.

62
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,340
I've seen so many people

63
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,110
drift apart and even

64
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,390
fight against their family

65
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,760
for self-interest.

66
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,080
Compared to their broken family ties,

67
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,790
your life is much happier.

68
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,350
I am happy.

69
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,870
I had my happiest moments

70
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,030
with my mother.

71
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,790
Then why are you crying?

72
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,920
She named you Xiaoxiao.
[*Xiao: Laugh and Smile]

73
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,830
Don't let her down.

74
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,640
Xiaoxiao,

75
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,430
whether she's your real mother or not,

76
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,150
she'll always be with you.

77
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,750
No one can steal her from you.

78
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,790
I'll always love her.

79
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,790
I'll always love you.

80
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,470
Xiaoxiao,

81
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,110
with me

82
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,790
and the Liao Family,

83
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,270
you'll be happier than anyone.

84
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,000
The Liao Family?

85
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,950
Am I the only one left in my family?

86
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,270
Of course not.

87
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,030
You have many remote relatives.

88
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,390
However...

89
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,620
Xiaoxiao,

90
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,350
do you want to see them?

91
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,950
I don't think I can be family

92
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,150
with strangers.

93
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,950
It's okay.

94
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,390
However, my grandma

95
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,110
asked me to tell you something.

96
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,230
She's kept all the property

97
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,990
your family left.

98
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,830
Now that she's found you,

99
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,750
she wants to give it to you
immediately.

100
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,030
Property?

101
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,400
Yes.

Mom, I can understand.

found out her identity.

but they're complete strangers.

109
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,310
I don't think she can accept

110
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,230
such a big fortune
without a good reason.

00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,910

If she took the money happily
and accepted her family,

114
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,990
it wouldn't be a good thing.

She had a really hard time.

118
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,550

how much it is.
