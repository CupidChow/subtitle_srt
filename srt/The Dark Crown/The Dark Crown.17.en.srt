7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,580
- Xiaoxiao.
- Yes?

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,990
Don't worry.

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,470
I'll always be there.

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,230
Mom. I still think it's too early

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,750
to meet her today.

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,470
We'll meet her sooner or later.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,710
Besides, Youting is her boyfriend now.

14
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,410
How long can we keep the secret?

15
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,140
Youting, why are there so many people?

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,830
They hold parties every weekend

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,230
to reinforce interfamily ties.

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,600
I know them. Don't be nervous.

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,510
How can I not be nervous?

20
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,790
Let's go.

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,630
Mr. Liao, your grandma
is waiting for you.

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,070
I'll go first.

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,770
- She'll be there in a minute.
- Okay.

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,950
Show her around.

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,480
Xiaoxiao,

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,750
wait in the tea house.

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,150
Okay.

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,080
Okay.

29
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,030
Miss Yu, this way, please.

30
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,180
Why are you here?

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,030
Who are you?

32
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,470
Stop pretending.

33
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,790
22nd floor of Huaxi.

34
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,260
We met before.

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,230
Who allowed you to come here?

36
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,280
Oh.

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,590
I remember now.

38
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,750
I met you before.

39
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,420
Hello, I'm Yu Lou. What's your name?

40
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,990
You don't know her?

41
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,590
She's Mi Kerui,
the second eldest daughter of Mr. Mi.

42
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,420
(It's her.)

43
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,470
(She's the Miss Mi)

44
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,550
(who asked Li Xiaohua
to tell the truth.)

45
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,300
(So, does she also want me to...?)

46
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,950
Who invited you?

47
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,760
I think I've heard it before.

48
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,190
Then I'll answer your two questions.

49
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,410
Liao Youting brought me here.

50
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,940
It's not up to him here.

51
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,830
The elders of the Liao Family
don't want to see you.

52
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,810
Oh?

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,070
But he told me his grandma
wanted to see me.

54
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,230
What?

55
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,680
Mrs. Liao cares about Mi Kerui
the most, doesn't she?

56
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,590
Yes. She also asked Mr. Liao
to marry Kerui, right?

57
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,870
Nonsense.

58
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,150
Why would Mrs. Liao want to see you?

59
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,180
Get out.

60
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,590
Don't think you can get into
the Liao Family by seducing men.

61
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,230
I'm Liao Youting's girlfriend.

62
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,840
It's necessary to meet his family.

63
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,490
As for seducing men,

64
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,830
we've just met.

65
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,890
How did you get that conclusion?

66
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,990
As a poor girl, what else can you do?

67
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,590
You're so pathetic.

68
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,890
Born into a poor family,

69
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,720
you can only make a living
by seducing men.

70
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,830
You're so shameless.

71
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,830
What?

72
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,590
I can't believe she's a poor girl.

73
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,470
I thought she was an heiress.

74
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,030
She doesn't deserve Mr. Liao.

75
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,590
You can slander me,

76
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,940
but you can't insult my family.

77
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,030
My mother died young,

78
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,710
but she loved me

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,670
and give me the best life and education
she could offer.

80
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,990
Unlike you, I'll never be this mean.

81
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,190
You're so ignorant.

82
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,260
I can't believe you think
you got the best things.

83
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,390
I suppose the education you received

84
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,930
must be as bad as
the house in Xiaoqinghe.

85
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
It makes sense.

86
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,360
If your mother hadn't adopted you,

87
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,270
it could've been worse.

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,510
What did you say?

89
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,110
You don't know?

90
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,470
Think about it.

91
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,740
Why could they sell the house
without your permission?

92
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,130
Because you had no right to decide.

93
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,230
You were adopted.

94
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,830
What do you mean?

95
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,310
You can investigate it
to see if I'm telling the truth.

96
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,800
Go.

97
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,400
Figure out if you were adopted.

98
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,740
Don't embarrass yourself here.

99
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,000
No.

100
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,750
No way.

101
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,980
Impossible.

102
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,560
Impossible.

103
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,760
I...

104
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,950
I'm her real daughter.

105
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,640
Xiaoxiao, what happened?

106
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,530
They look alike.

107
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,110
You look exactly like her.

108
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,680
Come on.

109
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,300
Let me look at you.

110
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,650
Yes, she's the girl
the Tuo Family lost back then.

111
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,070
The Tuo Family?

112
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,640
Our families are old friends.

113
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,620
Your mother was my favorite goddaughter.

114
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,260
However, a fire nearly killed
all your family.

115
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,150
Your parents died,

116
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,260
but your body was never found.

117
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,750
We were praying you'd be saved

118
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,190
and still alive.

119
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,800
You just turned one year old.

120
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,770
We didn't know how to find you.

121
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,430
One day, I saw your picture,

122
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,500
and I recognized you.

123
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,870
Girl,

124
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,460
you look exactly like your mother.

125
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,230
She's your mother.

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,510
She's holding you
when you're one year old.
