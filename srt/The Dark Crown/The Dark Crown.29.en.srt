00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,470
(Accident?)

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,670
(He's in the hospital.)

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,830
(They've been separated for so long.)

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,770
(If I visit him,
things might be different.)

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,790
Luo. Luo?

12
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,510
You've been here all night.
Take a break.

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,390
It's okay. I'm not tired.

14
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,980
Why don't you eat something?

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,390
Otherwise, you'll fall ill
when he wakes up.

16
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:06,870
I'll wash my face.

17
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,710
I can't let him see me like this.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,560
Go.

19
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,030
Why is Yu Lou here?

20
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,230
Did they get back together?

21
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,520
Youting.

22
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,860
Youting!

23
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,310
Luo, Youting is awake!

24
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,990
- Youting!
- He's awake!

25
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,080
Youting!

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,080
Youting! Youting!

27
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,630
I'll tell the doctor.

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,990
Li Shang, Youting woke up.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,030
Check on him.

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,720
Auntie...

31
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,550
You're finally awake. Can you hear me?

32
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,360
Youting!

33
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,110
Who are you?

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,840
Me?

35
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,630
I'm Xiaoxiao.

36
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,950
I'm your Xiaoxiao.

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,270
I don't know you.

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,520
You...

39
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,390
You don't know me?

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,190
Mr. Liao, do you know me?

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,910
- Li Shang.
- Yes.

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,350
Take her out.

43
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,390
I don't want to see her.

44
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,240
What?

45
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,990
Take her out.

46
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,630
The doctor said

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,630
it might be the aftermath
of the car accident,

48
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,710
which caused a false memory.

49
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,470
False memory?

50
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,590
But he remembers you and Li Shang.

51
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,570
Why doesn't he remember me?

52
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,760
Luo,

53
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,620
he's ill now.

54
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,060
He'll get better.

55
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,150
Youting likes you so much.

56
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,910
He won't forget you.

57
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,550
Don't worry. If anything happens,
I'll tell you.

58
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,630
Is he still ignoring you?

59
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,630
Not just that.

60
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,420
I haven't seen him
since he left the hospital.

61
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,510
He's been avoiding me

62
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,300
and ignoring my calls.

63
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,390
When I think about
the way he asked me to leave,

64
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,550
I feel like he hates me.

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,310
No way. Don't overthink it.

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,230
He's just sick.

67
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,590
When his memory is back...

68
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,740
Memory?

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,910
I thought

70
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,110
he just lost the memory
of a certain period of time

71
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,830
where I happened to meet him.

72
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,110
However, he remembers everything
about his work and life

73
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,910
except for me.

74
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,650
It means you're

75
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,230
very special in his heart.

76
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,150
No one else can replace you.

77
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,990
Should I be sad or happy about it?

78
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,590
Luo...

79
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,180
I have so many questions.

80
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,070
But he wouldn't see me.
He's been avoiding me.

81
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,110
I have an idea.

82
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,310
Maybe you can see him.

83
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,070
What?

84
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,870
Good news.

85
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,830
Liao Youting had a car accident
and lost his memory.

86
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,120
No one can protect Yu Lou now.
It's a good opportunity.

87
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,140
Do I need to repeat what you should do?

88
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,290
Is that so?

89
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,990
I will do it

90
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,510
when I want to.

91
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,950
However,

92
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,990
I need to remind you

93
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,240
that I'm your fiance

94
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,550
instead of your soldier.

95
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,240
Don't command me.

96
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,870
Be gentle

97
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,270
to me.

98
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,110
Why are you saying this now?

99
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,190
If you want to marry me,

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,310
you'll have to get things done.

101
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,950
I'm leaving.

102
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,200
See you next time.

103
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,470
Liao Youting is on
the 22nd floor of Huaxi.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,070
Here's the room card.

105
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,640
It's inappropriate.

106
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,030
It'll affect your job.

107
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,350
Well, you're more important than my job.
