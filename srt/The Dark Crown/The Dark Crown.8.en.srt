7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,270
I'm losing my place in this family.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,750
Mi Shanshan, you cunning fox.

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,910
When I marry into the Liao Family,

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,670
I'll see if you're still so smug.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,030
Li Xiaohua, what are you doing here?

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,550
Miss, I was kicked out of Xijingyuan.

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,520
What did you say?

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,230
I coaxed Grandma Liao

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,840
into letting you work for Youting.

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,130
Did you get kicked out so easily?

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,070
Miss, I didn't do anything wrong.

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,980
Mr. Liao brought back a woman called Yu Luo.

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,190
I don't know why,

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,270
but she kicked me out when she saw me.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,280
Who did you say?

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,170
Yu Luo.

23
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,270
Yu Luo.

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,420
(Nick Electronics)

25
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,300
(Most Important Person)

26
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,070
Hello, Youting.

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,880
Xiaoxiao.

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,500
What's up? Did you miss me?

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,120
You...

30
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:35,990
Are you OK?

31
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,260
I'm busy, but taking your call is important.

32
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,920
What about you?

33
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,310
Oh.

34
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,110
Didn't I tell you to start with a date?

35
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,690
What would you like to eat on Saturday?

36
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,230
What to eat?

37
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,320
Um.

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,780
I'm not picky. It's your call.

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,720
Just send me the address.

40
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,760
OK, see you on Saturday.

41
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,060
Yeah.

42
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,330
What happened?

43
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,320
Have I impressed her?

44
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,960
Mr. Liao's tag is "Most Important Person."

45
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,200
I didn't expect that.

46
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,510
He is usually cold to women.

47
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,550
He must be close to you.

48
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,260
He chose the tag himself.

49
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,430
I didn't change it.

50
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,690
OK.

51
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,080
I won't hide anything.

52
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,490
Rest assured, Miss Yu.

53
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,170
You call the shots at Nick Electronics.

54
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,100
It's a mess anyway.

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,540
With the Liao Group joining us,

56
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,310
we can play bigger.

57
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,910
You said it's a mess.

58
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,510
How could the Liao Group join in?

59
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,670
Mr. Huang, you should be clear.

60
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,540
It's me, Yu Luo, on the surface,

61
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,670
not the Liao Group.

62
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,950
It's the same. Got it.

63
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,260
(Investment Plan of Aolan Studios)

64
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,440
Yu Luo has invested in Aolan Studios.

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,140
Where did she get the money?

66
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,270
It may have something to do with Linda.

67
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,900
Miss Yu bought the shares in her name too.

68
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,310
Her initial capital wasn't much,

69
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,160
one million.

70
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,840
But she bought them at the lowest price.

71
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,290
She has earned several times as much.

72
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,560
And the share price is still surging.

73
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,590
How did she know?

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,570
Only a professional can make the judgment.

75
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,710
Maybe she was just lucky.

76
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,190
She's interested in Nick Electronics, too.

77
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,230
She just met Mr. Huang.

78
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,300
Mr. Liao,

79
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,810
should we warn her?

80
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,830
Or she'll lose all the money she earned.

81
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:27,990
Just now?

82
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,150
Looks like she's using me again.

83
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,030
Oh?

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,880
No need.

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,120
Let her do whatever she wants.

86
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,310
With my support, she can afford the loss.

87
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,270
Yes.

88
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,630
I'll get back to work.

89
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,480
Yeah.

90
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,870
It's good if she loses a little.

91
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,670
If you make too much money,

92
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,270
you may run away from me.

93
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,590
Dad agreed to invest for me.

94
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,840
He'll transfer the money tomorrow.

95
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,230
In such a hurry?

96
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,030
Of course.

97
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,930
Yihao did the research.

98
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,270
Nick Electronics is very profitable.

99
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,030
We can buy their equity at a low price.

100
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,110
People are competing to buy it.

101
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,910
Mr. Liao also wants it, right?

102
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,030
Kerui, we've thought about it.

103
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,230
Mr. Liao

104
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,430
is rich. We won't save it for him.

105
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,830
If you can't get him,

106
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,960
Yihao will always help you out.

107
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,710
Don't worry about me.

108
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,750
Youting will be mine sooner or later.

109
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,440
But Shanshan,

110
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,670
I think something is wrong with this.

111
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,020
What's wrong?

112
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,100
You said Yu Luo heard it from Youting.

113
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,310
So she told Chen Yihao about this.

114
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,110
Why are they still in touch?

115
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,400
That's right.

116
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,870
How could I have forgot about this?

117
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,710
Yu Luo hasn't given up on Yihao.

118
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,940
Probably.

119
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,470
Or she wouldn't have told him.

120
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,630
Does she want Chen Yihao to get rich

121
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,710
and dump you?

122
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,790
In her dreams!

123
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,030
I'm going to call Yihao.

124
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,000
Wait.

125
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,390
Yu Luo is cunning.

126
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,310
How can you compete with her?

127
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,590
Although we don't have the same mom,

128
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,600
we are still sisters.

129
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,310
I won't let her scheme against you.

130
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,080
Kerui, what should I do?

131
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,110
Don't just focus on Chen Yihao.

132
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,440
Our family is not to be messed with, either.

133
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,790
Show Yu Luo what you're capable of.
