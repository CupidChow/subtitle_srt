=Episode 12=

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,230
I heard Liao is interested in Nick Electronics,

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,310
so I started researching it.

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,110
But he didn't make a move.

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,630
Luo, do you know why?

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,030
He did buy it,

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,040
but in my name.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,880
You?

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,550
Yeah, he bought it just to make me happy

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,750
and even set up a company for me to hold the shares.

16
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,430
It's called Luolin Investment.

17
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,640
If you don't believe it, go and check.

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,990
Luolin Investment?

19
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,060
It's a major shareholder of Nick Electronics!

20
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,750
Luo, you're getting rich!

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,840
Rich?

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,030
It seems that the company is mine,

23
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,940
but I have to be under Liao's financial supervision.

24
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,310
How can I cash out my shares after all?

25
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,150
Once he doesn't like me anymore, I'll have nothing.

26
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,940
Then why don't you transfer your shares to me?

27
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,360
To you?

28
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,320
Yeah, I bought too little

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,270
as Liao hadn't made any moves.

30
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,270
I didn't dare to take action, but it's different now.

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,470
Like you said, the shares in Luolin are likely to disappear.

32
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,910
It shall be okay if you give them to me.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,820
I can just sit and wait for the value to increase.

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,800
Well,

35
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,000
but it's not up to me.

36
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,080
Besides, the acquisition will cost lots of money.

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,400
The Mili Group can still give you the money?

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,670
Money...

39
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,660
It's okay. I'll figure it out.

40
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,250
Anyway, just help to make the connection for me.

41
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,790
The bigger the share, the better.

42
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:47,850
Got it?

43
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,150
Luo, you're so nice to me.

44
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,110
Of course, Yihao.

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,530
Stop it, Yi Hao!

46
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,540
Go away!

47
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:15,910
Let me go!

48
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,990
Don't do this,

49
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,080
Liao Youting,

50
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,260
take me home.

51
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,760
Explain that.

52
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,000
Explain what?

53
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,830
What the hell is your relationship with him?

54
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,110
Nothing.

55
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,240
Yu Luo!

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,710
Leave me alone.

57
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,910
I can solve my own problem.

58
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:49,970
You?

59
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,220
Is this how you solve your problem?

60
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,310
Let him get the waiter to lock you in there

61
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,310
and put yourself in danger again?

62
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,750
Bastard!

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,170
I'll tear him to...

64
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,590
Liao Youting, calm down!

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,170
He's a bastard.

66
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,230
He's not worth getting your hands dirty at all.

67
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,590
I don't want to have this kind of memory between us.

68
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,030
Since you know all of that,

69
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,510
why did you still see him?

70
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,640
I...

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,890
You want to get revenge on him.

72
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,630
Yes.

73
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,390
I know your relationship with the Mi family.

74
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,750
If you still hate them...

75
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,990
It's not just that!

76
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,430
I hate them,

77
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,300
very much.

78
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,710
Only by getting revenge myself

79
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,750
can I let out such anger.

80
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,480
Them?

81
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,990
What exactly did they do to you?

82
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,840
They tried to kill me.

83
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,590
Be gentle, Shanshan,

84
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,150
easy.

85
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,620
You deserve it coz you drank by yourself and met a drunk.

86
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,670
Why I went drinking was for business

87
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,390
and trying to make more money.

88
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,670
Otherwise,

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,470
how can I support you in the future?

90
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,280
If you don't, I'll strangle you.

91
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,360
Sure.

92
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,660
Chen Yihao,

93
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,250
you have to manage this,

94
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,950
or I'll get fully trampled by my sister.

95
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,950
After what happened last time,

96
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,610
now I have no status at all in my family.

97
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,020
Fine, I'll make it.

98
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:30,870
Shanshan,

99
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,150
lend me some more money.

100
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,740
Don't glare at me.

101
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,580
It's for business.

102
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,430
The business deal I made yesterday

103
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,550
can get large amounts of Nick Electronics' shares.

104
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,990
You know, the more we get, the more we earn.

105
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,270
So, support me a little more, please.

106
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,910
Are you kidding?

107
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,640
Don't you know the situation of my family now?

108
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,280
Oh, I almost forgot to tell you

109
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,240
that you can never lose the money my father gave you.

110
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,880
Otherwise, without me,

111
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,870
my father will finish you off.

112
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,560
All right, all right,

113
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,030
as you wish.

114
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,660
Don't get mad.

115
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,120
You're so annoying.

116
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,710
I...

117
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,890
It's okay if you don't want to talk. Just forget it.

118
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,330
If you're not willing to do that,

119
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,790
I won't force you.

120
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,270
Thanks for today.
