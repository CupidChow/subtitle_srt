Stop dreaming.

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,190
Mr. Liao hates you,

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,470
and Mrs. Liao is in a coma.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,270
What are you expecting?

Besides,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,830
how can you compare to Yu Lou?

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,510
She's pretty,

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,190
slim,

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,510

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,640

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,910
I'm starting to admire her.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,410
Don't humiliate yourself.

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,310
Mi Shanshan, whose side are you on?

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,440
You're my family,

21
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,790
but you're defending her!

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,190
Whose side?

23
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,110
Mi Kerui, remember,

24
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,740
from the day you wanted to kick us out,

25
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,470
we're not family anymore.

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,070
Besides, I'll be clear.

27
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,570
Even if I believe you,

28
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,110
you'll still be kicked out

29
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,890
of our house!

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,590
This isn't over!

31
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,260
Hey, Luo,

32
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,800
how did you know the Frech couple

33
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,430
would buy the land?

34
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,220
I had a dream.

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,390
Do you believe it?

36
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,150
Well, you're fooling me again.

37
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,230
I don't want to know.

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,020
Anyway, I'll always support you.

39
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,370
I can't wait to get the money.

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,440
Linda,

41
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,490
you mortgaged your house and car

42
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,860
to raise a million yuan for you.

43
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,230
You deserve this.

44
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,610
Hey, miss, wait.

45
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,250
Do you work here?

46
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,740
I'm here for Mr. Liao.

47
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,890
Mr. Liao?

48
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,220
Mr. Liao has no appointment today.

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,410
You should register over there.

50
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,110
In two months?

51
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,230
Is he that busy?

52
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,150
Of course, Mr. Liao is always busy.

53
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,690
Many people want to see him.

54
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,030
I've seen many girls like you.

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,920
What's wrong with you?

56
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,910
Don't think Mr. Liao will see you

57
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,150
just because you're pretty.

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,630
He'll definitely see me

59
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,150
because I'm his girlfriend.

60
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,510
Girlfriend?

61
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,870
Every girl says.

62
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,750
Last time, a pregnant girl even said

63
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,310
it was Mr. Liao's child.

64
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,550
Liao Youting...

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,390
He can't even control himself
for three months.

66
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,310
Mr. Liao never sleeps around.

67
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,430
Miss,

68
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,000
if nothing else, please leave.

69
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,590

70
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,960

71
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,870

72
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,850
How dare you break in?

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,960
Mr. Liao.

74
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,410
Mr. Liao,

75
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,160
she claimed to be your girlfriend

76
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,160
and wanted to break in.

77
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,630
You're my girlfriend?

78
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,090

79
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,440
Why are you here?

80
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,150
Pay my debt.

81
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,240
50 million yuan.

82
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,390
However, it's not compensation.

83
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,070
As you said,

84
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,390
if I can be your girlfriend,

85
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,140
