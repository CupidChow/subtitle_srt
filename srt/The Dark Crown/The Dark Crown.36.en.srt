7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,420
Why did you leave me?

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,400
You said

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,750
we'd stay together forever in this life
and in another lifetime.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,430
It'd only been a few days.

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,310
How could you forget it?

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,190
Why?

13
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,470
Yu Lou,

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,080
please let me forget you.

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,430
I can't be with you.

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,750
What did I do?

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,550
When we were in Xijingyuan...

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,990
Don't mention Xijingyuan!

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,980
Why?

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,560
Because...

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,150
You'll die.

22
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,210
Do you mean

23
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,100
I'll die in Xijingyuan?

24
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,690
Xiaoxiao,

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,610
I don't want you to die.

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,920
When I was in a coma,

27
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,270
I had a long dream,

28
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,630
and we were together for three years.

29
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,300
The story started the same way.

30
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,550
However, everything changed

31
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,550
after that day.

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,680
Why can't you let me go?

33
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,370
What am I supposed to do?

34
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,030
Stop lying to yourself!

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,870
No way!

36
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,960
Yihao and Yueru would never hurt me!

37
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,950
They're my closest friends.

38
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,360
They've stayed with me
since my mother died.

39
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,480
It's your fault!

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,540
Stop talking nonsense.

41
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,540
Don't think I'll believe your lies.

42
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,630
Fine!

43
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,110
It doesn't matter,

44
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,750
but from now on,

45
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,830
you have to stay in Xijingyuan.

46
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,990
You can never get out!

47
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,820
What?

48
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,970
Yu Lou,

49
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,800
I will protect you.

50
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,180
You wouldn't believe me,

51
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,930
but I was so worried.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,950
I was afraid they'd ruin you again,

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,430
so I had to lock you up.

54
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,310
I didn't care if you hated me
at that time,

55
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,640
but I was afraid you'd hate me for life.

56
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,190
I promised you I'd let them visit you.

57
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,460
However, that's

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,160
the stupidest thing I've ever done.

59
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,720
I never expected
you'd kill yourself for him.

60
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:57,890
Youting...

61
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,940
I didn't do it.

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,680
What?

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,670
I said

64
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,080
I didn't kill myself.

65
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,560
Yueru pushed me downstairs.

66
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,260
Here's the good news.

67
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,350
Good news?

68
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,270
Yihao and I are getting married.

69
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,150
I

70
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,290
will marry Chen Yihao.

71
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,700
Impossible!

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,860
You...

73
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,700
How can you...?

74
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,660
Why not?

75
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,950
After all, you've got Mr. Liao.

76
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,030
Yueru, you knew

77
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,810
I stayed with Liao Youting

78
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,750
only because of Yihao!

79
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,070
If he hadn't asked me for money

80
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,330
to save his company...

81
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,250
Save the company?

82
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,710
Are you an idiot?

83
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,960
Yihao's small company
went broke a long time ago.

84
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,910
What's the point of keeping it?

85
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,740
What else is more profitable

86
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,430
than using you to make money?

87
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,820
Don't worry.

88
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,070
We will be happy.

89
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,140
You've been using me?

90
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,550
Three years ago...

91
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,050
Of course, we made you drunk.

92
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,820
The wine?

93
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,200
Yes, so what?

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,040
Luo, I'll be honest with you.

95
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,040
Back then,

96
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,760
we were going to sell you
to the old nasty man Mr. Zhang.

97
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,590
If we hadn't got the room wrong,

98
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,180
you wouldn't have

99
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,190
slept with Mr. Liao.

100
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,680
You were so lucky.

101
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,590
Mr. Liao is every woman's dream,

102
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,070
and he's generous to you.

103
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,780
You should be grateful.

104
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,570
Grateful?

105
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,510
Should I thank my fiance and my bestie

106
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,670
for sending me to Mr. Liao's bed?

107
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,470
Should I be grateful to have lived
without dignity for three years?

108
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,070
Should I be grateful to be locked here
and suffer?

109
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,320
Then go to hell!

110
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,190
Anyway, we've got everything.

111
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,720
You're useless now.

112
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,160
If you want to die,

113
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,630
then do it.

114
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,970
Go to hell!

115
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,960
Stop!

116
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,820
Stop!

117
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,990
Stop!

118
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,910
What's all the fuss about?

119
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,790
Sister Hua, Luo...

120
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,540
I didn't know she was still in love
with my husband.

121
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,660
She saw the wedding invitation
and jumped!

122
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,500
It's not my fault!

123
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,060
I'm so glad she's dead.

124
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,310
She doesn't deserve to live here.

125
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,110
My boss will be glad to know.
