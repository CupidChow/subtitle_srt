1
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:35,541
NEAR THE END OF WORLD WAR II

2
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:41,125
A MOUNTAIN RANGE IN THUNGSONG DISTRICT,
NAKHON SI THAMMARAT

3
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:57,625
Don't worry.

4
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,125
It's just a fallen tree.

5
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:20,791
Dui,

6
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,208
hit it.

7
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,916
It's The Thai Thieves Gang!

8
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,750
Pretty badass, huh?

9
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,708
That's gotta hurt.

10
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,166
Damn, that felt good.

11
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,666
Jong, look out!

12
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:20,916
Catch them!

13
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,458
Fire! Surround them!

14
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,208
Yada, duck!

15
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:50,416
Seize their supplies
and hand it all out to the folks.

16
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,125
And take these weapons back to our base.

17
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,041
Gang, back to base!

18
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,958
GOLD RUSH GANG

19
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:11,083
KO-WAH THUNGSONG BASE

20
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,291
Ko, is my crab omelet ready yet?

21
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,833
Crab, my ass!
You'll eat what you're given.

22
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,958
How about my balls omelet?

23
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,333
Yeah, I'll take one.

24
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,958
Yada, get this to those idiots.

25
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,083
-Thanks.
-Here.

26
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,416
What am I, their cook?

27
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,916
Jong, try this. It's tasty.

28
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,666
-Is it?
-Yeah.

29
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,250
Here comes your turmeric fried fish.

30
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,666
What kind of fish is this?

31
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,958
It's tender flesh like this.

32
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,291
The chicken's burning.

33
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,208
Quit playing that. Hello?

34
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:25,458
Ignore me then.

35
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,583
Mont, you fucking jackass!

36
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,958
Stop playing with the dynamite!
You'll kill us all!

37
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,541
No need to rush. It's all yours.

38
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,916
You survived knives and bullets.
You can't die from choking on a fish bone.

39
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,166
Fish bones won't finish him off,

40
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,666
but women will.

41
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,708
Says who? More like I'll finish them off.

42
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,625
Sure, being so cute.

43
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:54,791
Hey, Dum.

44
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,041
Try not to succumb to your wound, man.

45
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,708
What wound, Mont?

46
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,875
I didn't get shot.

47
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,750
Your wound right here.

48
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:05,750
Mont.

49
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,750
-Go away!
-He's built, but he can't flirt.

50
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,291
-Mont!
-Dumbass.

51
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,666
A professional pain in the ass.

52
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:29,333
Dum, all those tattoos
are making me dizzy.

53
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,041
It's my business. Leave me alone, Ko.

54
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,125
Wiggling your nipples, huh?

55
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,833
That's basic.

56
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,583
How about this, Dum?

57
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,541
Check it out.

58
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,625
It's wiggling too.

59
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,125
Enough, my boy. Calm down. Sleep.

60
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,250
-Let me see too.
-No, Jong.

61
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,416
You don't deserve a peek at my dick.

62
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:55,583
-Damn it.
-Damn. What the fuck, Mont? You scared me.

63
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,375
We have something fun to do.

64
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,750
What is this?
What does the Japanese writing mean?

65
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:07,583
It's a plan to transport goods by train
from Thailand to Malaya,

66
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,125
ending in Singapore.

67
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,416
Plus a security plan
for the supply train convoy

68
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,583
in six months, Ko.

69
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,041
What is this red mark?

70
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,166
It says,

71
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,541
"This train will carry important cargo."

72
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,708
HAT YAI, SONGKHLA

73
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,791
Yikes! The Japanese will transport weed?

74
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:29,708
No!

75
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,208
Then what is it?

76
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,375
No idea.

77
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,291
Seriously?

78
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,333
What a waste of time then.

79
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,000
Important cargo?

80
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,083
What could it be?

81
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,875
POLICE MAJOR GENERAL LUANG ARUNPIWAT

82
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,625
Luang Arunpiwat.

83
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,541
This is our best chance
to finish off the Japanese.

84
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,291
Whatever they're transporting,

85
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,916
we must find out the exact day and time
when the train will pass Khaochumthong.

86
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,125
I heard

87
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:13,333
some Japanese troops
are retreating from Burma

88
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,416
after failing to hold off the British.

89
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,833
The Japanese are losing the war.

90
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,416
I think they're pulling all troops
back to HQ in Singapore.

91
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,416
If it's just a withdrawal,

92
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,708
why the tight security?

93
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:31,958
It might be a prominent figure
or some valuable treasure onboard.

94
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,458
The point is

95
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:39,708
we're gonna teach them
not to trample on other people's land.

96
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
Cool speech.

97
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,583
All right, listen.

98
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:51,083
We'll go undercover
into the town of Nakhon to gather intel.

99
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,250
Several of these documents
were signed by Luang Arunpiwat,

100
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,666
the new police commander.

101
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,833
He must surely know about this.

102
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,416
THE THIRD ARMY HQ
POST OFFICE, NAKHON SI THAMMARAT

103
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,708
We have examined the map of the country.

104
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:22,791
We can see that our coastal territory
has increased by at least 1,500 miles.

105
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,291
There's also a large population
living along the coast.

106
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,375
This is the first reason.

107
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:32,000
The second reason is that
the sea is our precious treasure.

108
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,250
The third reason is that

109
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,458
the lower sea is often the route
enemies choose to invade the country,

110
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:42,750
as they view it as
a convenient means of transportation,

111
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,791
and ships are suitable vehicles
for such an operation.

112
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,833
With these three reasons…

113
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,458
They wouldn't be this wealthy
without colluding with the Japanese.

114
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,583
I hate corrupt cops.

115
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,458
I think of your dad whenever I see them.

116
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,083
You know that
your dad and I were best friends, right?

117
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,125
You've told me countless times.

118
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,375
And that he was shot dead by the police?

119
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,083
You've told me countless times.

120
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,458
-There's one thing…
-You've told me countless times.

121
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,583
Let me speak.

122
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,166
Just before he died,
he dedicated his last words to you.

123
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,250
-His last words to me?
-Yeah.

124
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,375
Before he died?

125
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,291
Yeah.

126
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,625
Stay with me, Mann.

127
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,208
Mann.

128
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,291
Mann, you can't die.

129
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,583
Ko-Wah, I won't make it.

130
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,000
Before I go,

131
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,166
can you promise me one thing?

132
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,625
I promise.

133
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,416
Go rescue my son.

134
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,333
They took him
to be sold at the Malaya border.

135
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,708
I promise.

136
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,333
One more thing…

137
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,375
I promise.

138
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,291
I haven't said it yet.

139
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,625
Jackass.

140
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,250
Will you pass on my final words to my son?

141
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,083
What are the words? Tell me!

142
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,500
Say them! What are the words?

143
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,416
Say them!

144
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,458
Urghhh.

145
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,666
Louder, Mann. Louder!

146
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,958
Urghhh!

147
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:05,000
Mann!

148
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,166
Urghhh.

149
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,666
Urghhh.

150
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,583
That's it?

151
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,583
Yeah, that's it.

152
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,250
What does it mean, Ko?

153
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,375
God knows.

154
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,041
To this day, I still can't figure out

155
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,458
what he meant by "Urghhh."

156
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,083
Urghhh.

157
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,250
What could it mean?

158
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,666
But we do have tea.

159
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,041
Here it is.

160
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,958
It's from Japan.

161
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,958
Its aroma will fill your entire house.

162
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,791
It's good. Trust me.

163
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,666
How can I help you?

164
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,291
Well,

165
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,625
was this bike imported from Malaya?

166
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,583
Yes, it's from Malaya.

167
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,500
All your products are beautiful.

168
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,916
There's even more inside.

169
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,375
Even more beautiful?

170
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,291
Please come in.

171
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,208
Impressive.

172
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,375
Even during wartime,
you're still able to find stuff to sell.

173
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,083
Feel free to look around.

174
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,916
Put it here.

175
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,375
Hurry back.

176
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,750
The Major wants you
to move stuff for the Japanese.

177
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,416
All right.

178
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,958
I'll take this.

179
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,666
For your wife?

180
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:30,791
Well, I love it. It's savory and tasty.

181
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,666
Hey, Mont, let's go. The coast is clear.

182
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,291
-Stick to Plan A.
-What's Plan B?

183
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,791
There's no Plan B, dickhead.

184
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,250
-Just asking.
-Stupid question, jackass.

185
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,500
What? Why did they dump the sacks here?

186
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,458
If it's broken, the master will kill you.

187
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,791
These lackies never do what I ask.
I'm gonna fire them all.

188
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,083
Hey, Mont.

189
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,041
-What is it?
-We're screwed.

190
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,500
Please, Colonel Maeda.

191
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,083
-Hide.
-Why?

192
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,541
Shut up. Just follow me, jackass.

193
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,291
Where to?

194
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,083
Thank you.

195
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,833
Where are you from?
I've never seen you before.

196
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,458
I'm from Lansaka.

197
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,833
I run a wholesale business there.

198
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:30,958
I have some Japanese and Malayan goods
that I'd like to show you,

199
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,583
in case you're interested.

200
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,500
Miss…

201
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,416
Chompen.

202
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm Chompen.

203
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,291
Beautiful name.

204
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,625
It rhymes with mine.

205
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,791
What's your name?

206
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,625
Jong. My name is Jong.

207
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,208
How does it rhyme with mine?

208
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,666
We'd like to express our gratitude to you

209
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,791
for providing labor
to assist us in building the railway.

210
00:20:56,166 --> 00:21:00,541
We've taken care
of your mining concession.

211
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,875
It's all good.

212
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,000
Thank you so much, Colonel Maeda.

213
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:04,958
But

214
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,791
we also need to inform you
of another important matter

215
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,791
concerning our supply transport.

216
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,458
Last week,

217
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,625
we were robbed again.

218
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:21,541
What?

219
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,541
In the past month,

220
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:28,500
our convoy has been robbed three times.

221
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,583
We lost a great deal
of our weapons and provisions.

222
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,000
The Thai Thieves Gang.

223
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,833
But

224
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:43,083
we heard that
they weren't just ordinary Thai thieves.

225
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,958
It was the gang

226
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,458
led by Ko-Wah Thungsong,

227
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,833
the infamous bandit
of Nakhon Si Thammarat.

228
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:53,791
Ko-Wah?

229
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,250
What's wrong, Mont? What's wrong?

230
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,166
I'm thinking of my dad.

231
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,458
Right now? Are you serious? You shithead.

232
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,541
I'm thinking of his last words.

233
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:09,750
So,

234
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:16,416
General Nakamura
will oversee this matter himself.

235
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,125
-Quiet down. Hush.
-What does it mean?

236
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,375
Who's out there?

237
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Go take a look. What are you waiting for?

238
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,041
Yes, sir!

239
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,875
No one, sir.

240
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,291
I guess I was just hearing things.

241
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:48,208
All right, I'll take my leave now.

242
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:50,416
Yes, sir. I'll see you out.

243
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,375
That was close, dickhead!

244
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:31,333
I just wanted to know what "urghhh" meant.

245
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,000
Here it is, sir.

246
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:59,458
-For your daughter's hand.
-Okay. All right.

247
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:04,416
Local Chief, we've got a situation.
Chomchan is running away with Ko-Wah.

248
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,291
Ko-Wah, how dare you steal
my daughter from my house?

249
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,333
Motherfucker.

250
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,916
Don't. You'll hit Chomchan.

251
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,375
Don't shoot. You'll only hit her.

252
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,791
I said don't shoot. You'll hit Chomchan.

253
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:20,541
Ko-Wah, I'll hunt you down with vengeance
until the day you die.

254
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,416
Ko-Wah!

255
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,833
Where are you going?

256
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,458
Shoot! Go on!

257
00:24:56,958 --> 00:24:59,000
Shoot like the vile thief you are!

258
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,916
I'm not a thief, Lieutenant Rung.

259
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,250
I make an honest living,
yet you trample all over me.

260
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,083
Fine. You want me to be a thief?

261
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,666
Then I'll become one for you, jackass.

262
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,375
Honey, you gotta look at this.

263
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:29,041
Look.

264
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,541
WANTED BANDIT: KO-WAH THUNGSONG

265
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,666
This poster's up all over the market.

266
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,333
Dickhead. It doesn't even look like me.

267
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,166
Honey, quit your bandit life.
I'm begging you.

268
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,541
Looks like the cops are serious this time.

269
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:43,541
Will everything really get better
if I stop being an outlaw?

270
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:49,875
Will corrupt government officials
and crooked merchants stop too?

271
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:55,250
Doors have locks,
but the people of Nakhon have Glocks!

272
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,666
If they force me to stand down,

273
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:00,166
I'll blow their brains out!

274
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:04,000
But I'm worried about you.
I don't want anything to happen to you.

275
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,416
Chomchan,

276
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:07,375
I promise

277
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,666
that I will look after you forever.

278
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,125
How far along now?

279
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:15,291
Three or four months.

280
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:17,416
Time flies.

281
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:20,625
Honey, what should we name our child?

282
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,083
My name's Ko-Wah.

283
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,125
Chomchan.

284
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,416
Ko-Wah and Chomchan.

285
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:28,791
If it's a boy, we'll name him Kochom.

286
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:35,833
If it's a girl, then name her… Chanwa.

287
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,583
What kind of name is that? Chanwa?

288
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,166
No, that name is out.

289
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:44,000
I'll leave it to you.
I'm not good at this.

290
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:48,541
Tell you what,
if it's a boy, we'll name him…

291
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,541
-Choeichan.
-Choeichan?

292
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,583
If it's a girl, we'll name her…

293
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:56,541
Chompen.

294
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,416
-How does that sound?
-Chompen?

295
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,333
That's a really beautiful name.
Like an angel's name.

296
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:21,500
Dad, it's me.

297
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,458
So, will you be able to help me?

298
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,041
Please.

299
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:28,000
He's never even killed anyone.

300
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:29,625
BOUNTY: 500 BAHT, DEAD OR ALIVE

301
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:33,125
I can help you.
Lieutenant Rung said he'd find a way.

302
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:35,291
Why would Lieutenant Rung help me?

303
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:40,000
I broke his heart and left him stranded
in the middle of his own wedding.

304
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:43,500
I think he still holds a grudge
against me and Ko-Wah.

305
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:45,791
Chomchan, listen to me.

306
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,375
Lieutenant Rung still loves you.

307
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:54,000
He'll do anything to make you happy.

308
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:55,541
This isn't about me.

309
00:27:56,583 --> 00:28:00,041
I'm worried about Ko-Wah.
I'm afraid he could be in danger.

310
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:04,125
So if I agree, what's next?

311
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:06,250
You don't have to do anything.

312
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:11,666
Just take Ko-Wah
to Khaochumthong Junction train station

313
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,333
this coming Sunday.

314
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:18,166
But you must not let him know
or else he'll never agree to going.

315
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:22,708
And Lieutenant Rung
will take it from there.

316
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:47,833
Chomchan, why did you bring me here?

317
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,041
Honey, trust me, all right?

318
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:03,791
Come here, Chomchan.

319
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,333
Ko-Wah.

320
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:09,500
Chomchan.

321
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:10,833
Ko-Wah, I'm sorry.

322
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,208
Chomchan!

323
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:17,583
Let me go.

324
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,208
Ko-Wah, I'm sorry.

325
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,916
Chomchan!

326
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:41,625
Chomchan!

327
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:51,041
You want a photo like this?

328
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,375
I have a camera. I can shoot one for you.

329
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:58,750
But right now,
we need to run or we're dead.

330
00:29:58,833 --> 00:29:59,750
Come on!

331
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,583
Help me!

332
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:12,708
Anyone, help me!

333
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,250
The brakes are out!

334
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:15,916
Holy crap. Ko, come on!

335
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,208
Stop!

336
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:21,458
Here I come!

337
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:24,583
I'm here, miss. Calm down.

338
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:26,208
Calm down.

339
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,625
Listen to me.
First, step on the brakes. Do it.

340
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,625
I'm doing it now,

341
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,416
but the car won't stop.

342
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,791
Dang, no wonder it's not stopping.

343
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:40,000
You're stepping on the gas pedal,
not the brake pedal.

344
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:44,250
All looks and no brains. Goddammit.

345
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,708
Don't scold me. I don't know what to do.

346
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:49,458
-I said step on the brakes!
-I already did!

347
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,750
Your driving is dangerous.

348
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:06,250
It's your first day driving, right?

349
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,125
Yes, it is.

350
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:13,083
I got all confused
between the brake and the gas pedal.

351
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,625
-Are you all right?
-Who?

352
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:25,166
-What are you?
-Your damn dad.

353
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:29,750
Thank you, both of you,
for saving my life.

354
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:32,791
Please come inside.

355
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,000
This is my house.

356
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,250
Please come in.

357
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:38,166
Let's go.

358
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:40,791
Just go with the flow.

359
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,125
Easy, Mont. Jackass.

360
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:50,583
Miss, someone called
and said your brakes failed.

361
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:53,166
Are you all right? Are you hurt anywhere?

362
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:56,833
I'm fine, Khiew. I'm safe now.

363
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:00,333
Luckily, these two uncles saved me.

364
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:02,791
Oh, what are your names?

365
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:03,875
I'm Chompen.

366
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,416
I'm… Chuang.

367
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:10,291
You can call me bro.

368
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:13,833
But you can call this old man uncle.

369
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:16,458
His name is… Uncle Cham.

370
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:21,083
So, where are you from?
I've never seen you around here.

371
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:22,583
We're from Hat Yai.

372
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:27,125
We sold fried chicken there.
Business was bad, so we came here to work.

373
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:29,333
So many bandits in Hat Yai.

374
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:32,291
They are very dangerous.
We can't trust anyone.

375
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:36,333
Oh, Khiew, please take the stuff
from the car into the house.

376
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:37,250
Okay, miss.

377
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,166
Are you all right? What happened?

378
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,708
Dad, I won't drive again.

379
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:47,291
Never again. It's too scary.

380
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:52,000
Thank god they saved me.
I could've been in serious trouble.

381
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:22,375
Thank you so much for saving my daughter.

382
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,041
You're welcome. We help those in trouble.

383
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:26,791
Here, take this.

384
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:29,708
What's wrong?

385
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:30,666
Look.

386
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:35,833
Two doves are mating.

387
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:40,125
Can you drive?

388
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:41,875
Yes, he can.

389
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:46,125
Dad, please hire him as my chauffeur.
I'm not going to drive ever again.

390
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:49,125
They are currently looking for a job.

391
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:52,250
Hire Chuang too
because our gardener just quit, didn't he?

392
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:54,458
Please, Dad.

393
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:57,708
Let's ask them first
if they want to work for us.

394
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:02,083
-No--
-No problem at all.

395
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:05,166
We're pleased to serve you, Master.

396
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:35,041
Master, something serious is going down.

397
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:36,291
What's happening?

398
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,125
Bloodbath, sir.

399
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,375
Great.

400
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:49,250
Keep on fighting.
Fight to the death so I'll get richer.

401
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:04,541
Thank you.

402
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:08,375
Mr. Jong, you're here so early today.

403
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:12,041
But my heart
has been waiting for you since last night.

404
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,333
Please take it into the back room.

405
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:20,583
Take it inside. Go.

406
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:25,041
Dressed up like a movie star?
What a jackass.

407
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:33,458
This is your order, Miss Chompen.
I also have another thing to show you.

408
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,166
Wonderful.

409
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:39,375
I've been looking for this. Thank you.

410
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:40,541
My pleasure.

411
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:47,083
What?

412
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:50,000
Oh, Uncle Cham.

413
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:52,083
I forgot the other crate at home.

414
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,166
-Can you fetch it for me?
-Go.

415
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,291
Why is she being forgetful now?

416
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,833
Go. I'll stay.

417
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:00,750
Uncle Cham.

418
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:01,708
Yes, miss.

419
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:04,666
Anyway, it's lunchtime. Are you hungry?

420
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,375
Hungry? Then eat my feet.

421
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,541
What's gotten into him?

422
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:13,500
Probably high on kratom tea.

423
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:17,500
-Master, please have mercy on us.
-Please.

424
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,083
-Please.
-Enough.

425
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,708
Don't you see the accrued interest?

426
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:25,500
Get me the money.
Only then you can get your deed back.

427
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,500
But where can I get that much money?

428
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:31,291
The interest has really piled up.

429
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:34,166
-Please.
-You sure were quick to ask for a loan.

430
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:37,541
But now look at you,
begging for your deed back.

431
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:38,916
Damn it.

432
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:44,416
-Master.
-What now?

433
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,708
Sakor is about to get in the ring.

434
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:47,625
Sakor, my boy.

435
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:54,625
Sakor, my boy.

436
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:59,083
Sakor, my boy!

437
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,416
That's my Sakor!

438
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,208
Sakor, my boy!

439
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:17,875
This is so good.

440
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:22,875
How did you hear about this place?
I live here and didn't even know about it.

441
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,666
Because I'm both cute and smart.

442
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:29,583
So, where do you stay? Or do you commute
between here and Lansaka?

443
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:32,791
I usually head back if I finish early.

444
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:36,500
Were you born in Lansaka
or does your family live there?

445
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,750
I was born in Lansaka.

446
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:42,500
And if by "family" you mean "wife,"

447
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:45,000
I don't have one yet.

448
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:50,000
My parents were also from Lansaka,
but they died long ago.

449
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:51,916
Sorry to hear that.

450
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,166
Are you sorry that I don't have a wife?

451
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,166
Mr. Jong!

452
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,375
Actually,

453
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:03,166
I was an orphan.

454
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,125
After I lost my parents,

455
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,083
a child-kidnapping gang

456
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,833
came and took me,
along with three other orphans,

457
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:20,291
to be sold at the Malaya border.

458
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:24,583
But fortunately,

459
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:28,208
a big-hearted man

460
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,583
came and saved us just in time.

461
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:44,791
He raised us as his own children.

462
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:49,625
Time to eat. Stop playing.

463
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:50,875
Want some fish?

464
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:54,125
Jong, you're the big brother.
Take care of your sis and bros.

465
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,500
-Sure, Ko.
-Dig in. Share with one another.

466
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:58,250
Mont, why did you smack Dum's head?

467
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,500
Am I raising monkeys?

468
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:02,791
You eat from the same pot,
so don't fight each other.

469
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:05,166
-The omelet looks really good.
-Eat it.

470
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:15,458
We're all born human,

471
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,416
so never abuse the weak

472
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:21,625
or let anyone abuse or mistreat you.

473
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:22,666
Great.

474
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,333
Pull it up.

475
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:28,500
Your fists are not just for games.

476
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:33,500
Your feet are not for stepping
on chicken shit.

477
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:35,750
You have to fight.

478
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:37,708
If you don't,

479
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:40,750
you're dead.

480
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,416
Each of you needs an alias.

481
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,791
Jong Lansaka.

482
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,083
Yada Nopphitam.

483
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:49,791
Dum Sichon.

484
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:51,333
Mont Ronphibun--

485
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:52,541
Where is he?

486
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,083
Mont!

487
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,708
Dickhead!

488
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:01,708
-Jackass.
-He's like a real father to us.

489
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:03,208
Blind, I'm blind now.

490
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:05,875
-He taught us how to fight…
-I'm blind now.

491
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:08,166
So no one could bully us again.

492
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,666
Will I grow up to be as beautiful as you,
Aunt Chomchan?

493
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:15,208
Of course. You'll be very beautiful.

494
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:19,666
I'm sure all the young lads in the South
will fall in love with you.

495
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,041
I don't want any other man.

496
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:25,000
I want only Jong to like me.

497
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:26,583
Oh, really?

498
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:31,291
You're sleepy now. Sleep then.

499
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:32,541
Sleep, all of you.

500
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,958
I'll sing you a lullaby.

501
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:40,375
Hush now, little one, it's time to sleep

502
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:41,625
And the auntie…

503
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:45,125
-Just rest
-…took care of us like a real mother.

504
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:48,916
Spirits of the house

505
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:54,750
Do not tease or haunt this child

506
00:40:55,291 --> 00:41:00,375
Guardian spirit of mine
Do not frighten her

507
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:05,416
Lull this sweet girl to sleep

508
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:10,083
Sleep now

509
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:14,958
Let her rest
Rock her gently into slumber

510
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:18,000
So, we love both of them so much.

511
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,458
That's great.

512
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:24,166
So, who's the kind couple?

513
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,791
You'll meet them someday.

514
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,916
I hope I'll get the chance to.

515
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And I hope that
I'll get to meet your father too.

516
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:39,208
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
who my father is

517
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:42,000
because everyone wants to get to know him,

518
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,666
including you now.

519
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:51,166
You're right, I do also want to meet him

520
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:55,208
so I can ask his permission
to date his daughter.

521
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,958
Do you think he'll give me his blessing?

522
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:03,083
Well,

523
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,000
I guess he will.

524
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:13,625
But next month,
I have to go to Malaya with my mother,

525
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:15,666
probably for several days.

526
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:19,666
Well then…

527
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:26,291
keep this ring

528
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:28,375
so you'll think of me.

529
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:51,791
Then…

530
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:55,208
keep this necklace

531
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:57,625
so you'll think of me.

532
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:09,000
I promise

533
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:12,666
I won't take it off.

534
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:36,833
-What's wrong, Yada?
-Start the car.

535
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:39,666
-But Jong--
-Start the goddamn car.

536
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:05,791
Hey. Here's your shirt, Jong.

537
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:08,166
-I washed it for you.
-Thanks.

538
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:14,166
Who gave you this?

539
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:16,333
Oh, it's nothing.

540
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:17,541
Let me see.

541
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:18,666
Hey.

542
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:19,875
-It's a girl's--
-Hey!

543
00:44:21,416 --> 00:44:22,875
I said it's nothing.

544
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:27,583
I'm going downtown.

545
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:41,708
Jong, hold on.

546
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:44,166
I need to talk to you man to man.

547
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:47,958
Go ahead, Dum.

548
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:51,083
You know I don't see Yada
as just a sister, right?

549
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:53,333
Yeah, I can tell.

550
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:58,000
And you know
that she's deeply in love with you, right?

551
00:44:58,083 --> 00:45:00,041
I want you to be honest with her.

552
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:03,666
I hear you,

553
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,958
but I think she knows
I only think of her as a sister.

554
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:09,958
Jong,

555
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,500
I just want you to tell her straight
that it's never gonna happen.

556
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:17,875
And if I did say that,
would she suddenly fall for you?

557
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:18,833
Listen to me.

558
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:21,458
This has nothing to do with me.

559
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:25,250
If she doesn't love you,
then that's your problem.

560
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:29,125
Jong!

561
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:33,208
Jong!

562
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:45,000
When's the next time?

563
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:48,625
Maybe a few months from now.

564
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:52,416
General Nakamura is coming here
from Tanowsri next week.

565
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,291
Could be an important matter.

566
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,166
General Nakamura?

567
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:14,458
How can you stand by
and watch our military vehicles

568
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:20,375
get plundered over and over again
by such nasty thieves?

569
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:26,541
How can you let those lousy thieves

570
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:31,625
rob our army convoys over and over?

571
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:35,125
I was told

572
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,875
you were the best cop in the South
for fighting organized crime,

573
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:46,458
but that seems more like the sort of tale
used to trick children and villagers.

574
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,916
I was told you were an elite crime-buster.

575
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:57,833
That's probably just a tale
to fool kids and villagers.

576
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:04,208
If anything goes wrong again,

577
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:07,875
your concession deal
with the Japanese army

578
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:10,458
may never proceed.

579
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,541
And your confession--

580
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:15,916
Concession.

581
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,041
Your concession deal
with the Japanese army may never proceed.

582
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:22,500
I already know that. He said it in Thai.

583
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,333
Sir,

584
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:26,875
my apologies.

585
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:28,791
I will hunt them down

586
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,833
and let you execute them
with your own hands.

587
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,625
This country has a lot of good things.

588
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:58,083
Unfortunately, there are
as many mosquitoes as bandits.

589
00:47:58,583 --> 00:48:00,416
And let me tell you,

590
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:05,166
I hate bandits
even more than I hate mosquitoes.

591
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:09,750
You could always use repellent, sir.

592
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:23,000
If you fail to take care of this,

593
00:48:24,541 --> 00:48:30,083
I will behead those bandits
with my own hands.

594
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:06,958
Her name is Chompen,

595
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,958
the only daughter of Luang Arunpiwat, sir.

596
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:18,333
Let's go.

597
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:29,458
Is it heavy?

598
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:30,458
Heavy as hell.

599
00:49:30,541 --> 00:49:32,083
No, I mean not at all.

600
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:37,541
Oh, Uncle Cham and Chuang,
you can put them in the dining room.

601
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:39,833
-Yes, miss.
-I'll sort them out later.

602
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:40,750
Thank you.

603
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:42,291
No problem.

604
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:44,250
Move further in.

605
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:51,041
What is it?

606
00:49:52,666 --> 00:49:53,583
What's inside?

607
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:56,875
Deal with the folks at Pak Phanang
and drive down the mortgage value.

608
00:49:57,625 --> 00:49:58,708
The land's too good.

609
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:01,541
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

610
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:12,416
Holy crap.
This clown's face is always so filthy.

611
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:41,958
BANGFIRE BRAND
SONG: HAT PHA DAENG

612
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:45,875
SUNG BY: PRAPON SAMUTJAMORN

613
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:14,833
Mont, you bastard.

614
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:43,791
Are you all right? Not feeling well?

615
00:51:57,333 --> 00:52:00,000
That's a photo of my mom
when she was young.

616
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,166
Wasn't she pretty?

617
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,583
She still is.

618
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:08,250
Right now she's in Malaya for business.
She'll be back next week.

619
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:12,458
You'll both meet her soon.

620
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:22,958
Luang Arunpiwat,
once known as Lieutenant Rung,

621
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:26,125
was the man
who threw me in jail 20 years ago

622
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,541
and took Chomchan from me.

623
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:34,416
Good thing he didn't recognize you, Ko.

624
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,041
How could he?

625
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:38,375
Back then, Ko had a full head of hair.

626
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:40,458
Now he's got a shiny bald head.

627
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:42,041
Not a single strand.

628
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:45,500
So Aunt Chomchan
is the madame of the house, right?

629
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:46,666
Exactly.

630
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,791
And they have a daughter called Chompen.

631
00:52:58,333 --> 00:53:00,708
Lieutenant Rung, you disgraced me.

632
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:02,875
I'll show you

633
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:07,750
that doors have locks,
but the people of Nakhon have Glocks!

634
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:10,333
If you force me to stand down--

635
00:53:10,416 --> 00:53:11,916
Then I'll find a seat!

636
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,250
Shut up, you jackass.

637
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:24,083
Ko,

638
00:53:24,916 --> 00:53:27,041
I've been meaning to ask you something.

639
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:31,416
What now? This isn't a good time for that.

640
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,125
Can't you see Ko is sad?

641
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:37,375
It's about my father's last words
before he passed away.

642
00:53:38,291 --> 00:53:39,250
What did he say?

643
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,166
"Urghhh."

644
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,833
"Urghhh"?

645
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:45,666
What the hell?

646
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,833
Exactly, I want to know
what "urghhh" means, too.

647
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:51,083
Hey, shithead, get out of here.

648
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:53,125
Go.

649
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:56,375
Dum, are you kicking me out?

650
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:57,625
Yeah, go!

651
00:53:58,416 --> 00:53:59,250
Damn.

652
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,333
What a cranky bastard.

653
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:07,750
It's been almost 20 years
since you broke out of prison

654
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:10,458
and tried to find Aunt Chomchan.

655
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:12,083
And now you have.

656
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,416
DAMN IT

657
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:36,083
Jong?

658
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:45,166
Go. Come on, move.

659
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,666
Come on, move.

660
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,375
Let's help them.

661
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:50,166
Come on, let's go.

662
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,416
Move now.

663
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,333
Come on, move. Come on.

664
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:57,041
Come on, get going.

665
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:58,291
Come on, move.

666
00:54:58,375 --> 00:55:00,208
Move now.

667
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,041
How did you do that, Mont?

668
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:16,375
-Ah, awesome.
-You're the best.

669
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:22,625
-Let's go.
-Come on, hurry up.

670
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:24,333
Don't let him get away. Catch him.

671
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:27,166
After you guys helped me break free,

672
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:29,750
I never saw Chomchan again.

673
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:33,708
I thought she was dead.

674
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,875
But now,

675
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,375
if I ever meet her again,

676
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:42,708
I'll ask her if I was already dead to her.

677
00:55:43,666 --> 00:55:45,208
What are you gonna do?

678
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:48,291
Urghhh.

679
00:55:48,375 --> 00:55:49,791
What does it mean?

680
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:52,375
Why didn't he say anything else? Damn it!

681
00:55:52,458 --> 00:55:54,083
I shouldn't have told him.

682
00:55:55,416 --> 00:55:57,083
Yeah, he won't shut up now.

683
00:55:57,958 --> 00:56:00,291
Urghhh! What the hell does it mean?

684
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:30,000
Mom!

685
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:42,833
Dad, Mom's back.

686
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:47,416
Aunt Chomchan
is still just as gorgeous, right?

687
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:52,166
Mom.

688
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:54,958
-Did you miss me?
-Of course.

689
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:58,291
I missed you so much, you know?

690
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:00,250
Why was this trip so long?

691
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:05,125
I had to stay longer
to solve some shipment issues.

692
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:07,916
Thank you so much for handling it for me.

693
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,125
It's fine. No big deal.

694
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:13,583
Go get some rest, Mom.
I'll put your bag away for you.

695
00:57:13,666 --> 00:57:15,416
-All right. Thanks, dear.
-Sure.

696
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,333
Go rest and freshen up.

697
00:57:17,416 --> 00:57:20,333
Tonight, we'll finally
get to have dinner all together.

698
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:21,500
Let's go.

699
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:45,500
Oh, shit!

700
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:49,833
TO MISS CHOMPEN

701
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
We, Cham and Chuang, had to resign.

702
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:02,041
We need to return to Hat Yai immediately.

703
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:06,708
We truly apologize for not being able
to tell you this in person.

704
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:09,458
However, I have one last request.

705
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:13,375
Please give this axe to your mother.

706
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:16,333
When she sees it, she'll understand.

707
00:58:52,916 --> 00:58:55,666
Mom, are you all right?

708
00:58:56,583 --> 00:58:57,500
Are you sick?

709
00:58:58,166 --> 00:59:00,958
-Let me take you to the doctor.
-No. I'm not sick.

710
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:02,500
I'm totally fine, dear.

711
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:03,958
No, you're not.

712
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:07,375
Mom, you were dancing
exactly like someone I know.

713
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:09,750
Like who?

714
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:13,250
The person who asked me
to give you this axe.

715
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:17,125
He said you'd understand when you saw it.

716
00:59:20,666 --> 00:59:22,500
Who gave you this axe?

717
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:23,916
Where is he now?

718
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,041
Where is he?

719
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:29,166
Uncle Cham, my chauffeur.
But he quit already.

720
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:32,375
Anyways, he mentioned you in this letter.

721
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,250
C.C.

722
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:47,041
I've engraved my initials on this axe.

723
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,291
Whenever you use it,

724
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,791
you'll be reminded
that I'm always with you.

725
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:58,208
I'll keep this axe forever in my heart.

726
01:00:09,416 --> 01:00:10,250
Mom.

727
01:00:11,791 --> 01:00:12,833
Are you okay?

728
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:16,875
Mom.

729
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:44,416
Ko, what were my dad's last words
before he passed?

730
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:47,708
I've told you multiple times.

731
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:50,833
Your dad's last word was, "Urghhh."

732
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:52,166
Just one word.

733
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:55,291
-What does it mean?
-I don't know.

734
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:59,708
How about you die
so you can ask him yourself, jackass?

735
01:01:00,208 --> 01:01:01,291
I'm stressing out.

736
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:07,833
"Urghhh." What does it mean, Dum?

737
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,416
It means shut up, dimwit.

738
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,375
Okay, fine. I'll shut up.

739
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:14,333
Damn it.

740
01:01:20,458 --> 01:01:22,166
Do you really like Chompen?

741
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:24,666
It'll never happen.

742
01:01:25,583 --> 01:01:26,666
Believe me.

743
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,375
A two-bit thief and a noble lady?

744
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:33,500
You're probably just her toy.

745
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:38,541
True.

746
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:40,833
You're a bandit, Jong.

747
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:44,125
No woman will take you seriously.

748
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,583
Break up with her. Believe me.

749
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,833
Where are you going?

750
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,166
Spit it out.

751
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:55,000
Not man enough to tell us?

752
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:57,250
Enough. You're drunk. Go to bed.

753
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:59,458
-So annoying.
-Yada.

754
01:02:02,916 --> 01:02:05,416
Jong, why do you have to be so harsh?

755
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:28,625
Damn it.

756
01:02:29,916 --> 01:02:32,083
All men are stupid, aren't they?

757
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,458
Ko-Wah,

758
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:35,958
Jong.

759
01:02:38,166 --> 01:02:40,958
No, it's not only men that are stupid.

760
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:46,791
A woman like you

761
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:50,958
is just as stupid as Jong and Ko-Wah.

762
01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:53,791
Yada,

763
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:59,166
Jong never loved you.

764
01:03:00,708 --> 01:03:03,250
He only thinks of you as a sister.

765
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:08,083
But I've always loved you, Yada.

766
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:13,625
But you play dumb,
pretending you don't know.

767
01:03:18,666 --> 01:03:19,625
Damn it!

768
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:23,708
Love makes us all stupid!

769
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:31,166
Dum,

770
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:34,250
you're clearly wasted.

771
01:03:34,333 --> 01:03:35,208
Go to bed

772
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:38,458
and stop babbling nonsense.

773
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:41,333
I'm wasted too.

774
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:42,875
I'm going to bed.

775
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:50,916
Hey, Yada.

776
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,125
Yada.

777
01:04:05,458 --> 01:04:06,500
Dum!

778
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:11,875
What the hell are you doing?

779
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:15,250
Don't think I'm that easy.

780
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:20,833
Even if you were the last man on Earth,
I'd rather die.

781
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:22,916
Yada…

782
01:04:26,541 --> 01:04:28,625
is that what you really think?

783
01:04:28,708 --> 01:04:30,083
Yeah.

784
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:37,916
Since being nice doesn't work on you,

785
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:42,291
then I'll be a bad guy.

786
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:43,875
Dum!

787
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:45,958
What the hell are you doing? No!

788
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:48,333
You bastard! Get off me!

789
01:04:48,416 --> 01:04:51,000
-Stop it, bastard!
-Dum!

790
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:52,833
Son of a bitch!

791
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:54,916
What the hell?

792
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,333
I told you
to love each other like siblings.

793
01:04:57,958 --> 01:04:59,791
Remember? What's gotten into you?!

794
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:01,208
Have I ever told you

795
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:03,916
what I think of Yada?

796
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:08,416
All you've ever said
is that we're bothers and sisters.

797
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,500
But did you ever care

798
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:13,625
how I really felt about Yada?

799
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:17,000
If that's what's in your filthy mind,
get the hell out!

800
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,125
Don't show your face ever again!

801
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:23,041
-Is that what you want?!
-Yeah!

802
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:25,041
Damn it!

803
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:47,208
General Nakamura wants you and your family

804
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:51,875
to join us on the train to Malaya.

805
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:55,791
Consider it a family vacation.

806
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:01,583
We're good, sir.
We can follow along on our own.

807
01:06:03,541 --> 01:06:05,500
We don't wish to bother you, sir.

808
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:11,291
Please show some respect
for General Nakamura.

809
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:16,791
One more thing.

810
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:22,958
I'd like to have a word with Miss Chompen

811
01:06:23,916 --> 01:06:25,333
in private.

812
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:27,541
May I?

813
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:30,791
I don't--

814
01:06:38,083 --> 01:06:40,666
I don't mind, sir.

815
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:48,625
I brought this embroidered fabric
from Japan.

816
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:54,041
It's a gift from me to you.

817
01:06:54,666 --> 01:06:56,458
I'm afraid I cannot accept it.

818
01:06:58,333 --> 01:06:59,583
Please do.

819
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:02,625
A bitterful thing like this

820
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:06,375
should belong to
a bitterful woman like you.

821
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:09,958
I'd rather not.

822
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:11,916
Thank you.

823
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:14,708
I don't want to be bitter already.

824
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:27,666
No one has ever said no to me before.

825
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:30,750
You might want to think twice

826
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:34,125
before turning down
my gesture of goodwill.

827
01:07:36,208 --> 01:07:39,583
For your parents' sake, too.

828
01:07:56,041 --> 01:07:58,291
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

829
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:04,333
Colonel,

830
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:10,958
when will the important cargo arrive here?

831
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:12,708
And is it

832
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:18,541
the gold shipment from Burma?

833
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:23,458
The first train will arrive here

834
01:08:24,041 --> 01:08:25,916
on the 8th of the 8th month.

835
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:28,500
Our duty

836
01:08:29,458 --> 01:08:31,250
will be to keep this train intact

837
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:36,333
until it reaches its destination.

838
01:08:36,416 --> 01:08:37,708
Let's do this.

839
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:39,625
Well,

840
01:08:40,958 --> 01:08:44,083
will we get a cut?

841
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:46,458
You're a such a badass.

842
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,916
All the gold we seize,

843
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:55,000
of course, will belong to the emperor.

844
01:08:56,458 --> 01:08:57,333
But you know,

845
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:02,166
if four or five bars of gold
were to go missing,

846
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:06,916
no one would ever notice.

847
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:12,916
Colonel, you're being too loud.

848
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,750
What if someone overhears?

849
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:19,500
Thai people don't understand our language.

850
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:21,333
-You're right.
-You damn fool!

851
01:09:27,416 --> 01:09:28,416
All right.

852
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,833
-Here we go.
-Okay.

853
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:35,125
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

854
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:36,500
-Tanaka.
-Yes, sir?

855
01:09:36,583 --> 01:09:38,250
-Shall we sing?
-Of course!

856
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,375
Choo-choo

857
01:09:41,458 --> 01:09:44,000
The train goes chugga-chugga
Going forward

858
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:46,583
Choo-choo

859
01:09:46,666 --> 01:09:51,291
Towards the wilderness
Expands in front of us

860
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:55,625
No matter how far victory is

861
01:09:55,708 --> 01:10:00,833
Banzai!

862
01:10:00,916 --> 01:10:06,166
May every brave soldier advance safely

863
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:10,375
Imperial Japanese Army

864
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,541
The invincible Imperial Japanese Army…

865
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:14,583
Get in the car.

866
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:16,916
-Please.
-Watch your step, sir.

867
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,750
All right.

868
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:22,541
That's it.

869
01:10:31,625 --> 01:10:33,333
Thank you very much.

870
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:37,375
Oops, I'm doomed.

871
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:41,125
Nothing. I said, "I have a sinus."

872
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:42,875
See ya.

873
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,708
It was a success.

874
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:01,708
Those idiots fell right into our trap.

875
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:05,291
MINORITY GROUP TERRITORIES
ON THE THAILAND-BURMA BORDER

876
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:06,875
What do you want?

877
01:11:07,458 --> 01:11:09,125
I want a bang-bang.

878
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:13,125
We don't have that kind of thing here.

879
01:11:13,208 --> 01:11:15,250
This is not a whorehouse.

880
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:18,750
Kuronsan, you dunce.

881
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:21,000
I'm a regular. Don't you recognize me?

882
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:22,708
Damn you!

883
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:27,291
How could I? I have a lot of customers.

884
01:11:28,208 --> 01:11:29,208
What do you want?

885
01:11:29,291 --> 01:11:30,416
M-16s.

886
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,458
We have that.

887
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:32,791
-Machine guns.
-Yes.

888
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:33,875
-Cannons.
-Yes.

889
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:35,083
-Bazookas.
-Yes.

890
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:36,833
-Anti-aircraft missiles.
-Yes.

891
01:11:36,916 --> 01:11:38,500
-Cap guns.
-No, we don't.

892
01:11:38,583 --> 01:11:40,541
-Water pistols.
-No, you idiot!

893
01:11:41,291 --> 01:11:44,375
You think this is
some kind of grocery store, Mont?

894
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:48,041
What gun do you want?

895
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:49,625
-Dynamite.
-What the fuck?

896
01:11:50,666 --> 01:11:52,291
We were talking guns.

897
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:53,833
Do you have dynamite?

898
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,416
How many shafts?

899
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,166
You call them shafts?

900
01:12:01,041 --> 01:12:03,041
I'll take all you have.

901
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:07,625
What are you going to do with that many?

902
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:11,041
Blow up the Japanese.

903
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:25,625
Way to go!

904
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,958
I'll let you have it all for free.

905
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:32,250
Blast the hell out of those motherfuckers.

906
01:12:58,833 --> 01:12:59,708
Miss Chompen.

907
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:04,208
I have bad news.

908
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:05,416
Tomorrow,

909
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:09,791
I have to take the train to Malaya
with the Japanese.

910
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:11,791
Really?

911
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:15,833
If we manage to take the gold from them,
we'll give it to those in need.

912
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,875
Let's go over the plan.

913
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:21,416
We aim for the middle freight car

914
01:13:22,166 --> 01:13:24,791
that will be carrying the gold to Malaya.

915
01:13:31,208 --> 01:13:32,333
Where is Dum?

916
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,916
No idea, Ko.

917
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,375
Since you kicked him out,

918
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:39,291
I haven't heard from him.

919
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:41,541
If he's not back by tonight,

920
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:43,708
we'll do it without him.

921
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:46,000
Yada, can you do it alone?

922
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:47,041
Sure, Ko.

923
01:13:48,666 --> 01:13:49,708
Ko.

924
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:52,458
We have a problem.

925
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:57,708
Tomorrow, Luang Arun and his family
will go to Malaya on that Japanese train.

926
01:13:57,791 --> 01:14:00,333
Holy shit, that's not part of the plan.

927
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:01,791
Chompen just told me today.

928
01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:07,041
We need a change of plan

929
01:14:08,666 --> 01:14:10,416
or Chompen and Chomchan won't be safe.

930
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,625
Abandon the plan?

931
01:14:12,666 --> 01:14:13,500
No,

932
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:16,041
just a few tweaks.

933
01:14:16,125 --> 01:14:18,125
What about Luang Arun and his family?

934
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:20,583
Leave Luang Arun to me.

935
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:22,583
I'll settle the score.

936
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:25,916
He snatched the love of my life away.

937
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:28,291
I'll show him that…

938
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,750
doors have locks,
but the people of Nakhon have Glocks!

939
01:14:35,833 --> 01:14:37,666
If you force me to stand down--

940
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:39,125
Then I'll find a place to--

941
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:41,541
You clown.

942
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:43,625
Go sit somewhere else!

943
01:14:44,166 --> 01:14:46,541
-Jackass.
-He got me again.

944
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:55,208
Tomorrow, the 20-year feud

945
01:14:56,583 --> 01:15:01,208
between me and Luang Arun
will be settled at Khaochumthong Junction!

946
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,583
Dui, hit it.

947
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,625
Here's our plan.

948
01:17:30,166 --> 01:17:31,916
Once the train reaches the valley,

949
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I'll sneak aboard, take out the guards,

950
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,625
and then pose as one of them.

951
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:58,541
Hey,

952
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:02,208
button your top button.

953
01:18:03,541 --> 01:18:08,000
If General Nakamura caught sight of this,
he'd have your head chopped off.

954
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:16,416
I've never seen you before.

955
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,541
And you don't look like a soldier.

956
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:26,083
You look old as hell.

957
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:31,791
Hey,

958
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:35,750
is this a real mustache?

959
01:18:40,125 --> 01:18:40,958
What?

960
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:43,583
Is this…

961
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:59,083
Jong, you leap on board
as the train passes through the valley.

962
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:02,333
After that, find your way
to the car carrying the gold.

963
01:19:57,625 --> 01:20:01,083
Mont, wait on top of the hill
before Ron Phibun station.

964
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,125
Get the dynamite ready.

965
01:20:03,208 --> 01:20:05,875
Hold off until we rescue
Chomchan and Chompen.

966
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,625
Wait for my signal.

967
01:20:07,708 --> 01:20:12,125
When you see the flare,
blow them to smithereens.

968
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:33,541
Yada, when you see the train,
lead our men to flank it.

969
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:37,666
Try to stall them
until Jong and I reach the gold carriage.

970
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:43,041
Charge!

971
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:07,833
They're here!

972
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:29,750
Ko?

973
01:22:35,625 --> 01:22:37,500
Ko, are you all right?

974
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:45,125
Don't just stand there. Help me.

975
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,166
We're screwed, Ko. The gold isn't in here.

976
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,083
It's a trap.

977
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:24,833
Fire!

978
01:23:40,458 --> 01:23:42,375
Kill them all! Full throttle!

979
01:23:52,458 --> 01:23:58,083
Fire!

980
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:37,666
Dum!

981
01:24:40,083 --> 01:24:42,083
Traitor!

982
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:44,291
Yada?

983
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:55,750
Yada!

984
01:25:00,541 --> 01:25:01,958
Yada!

985
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:05,416
Yada!

986
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:14,041
Yada!

987
01:25:22,041 --> 01:25:22,916
NO TRESPASSING

988
01:25:37,416 --> 01:25:38,250
Jong?

989
01:25:41,125 --> 01:25:42,041
Ko-Wah?

990
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:47,541
What, Mom?
That's Uncle Cham, our ex-chauffeur.

991
01:25:53,666 --> 01:25:55,958
So it is you, Ko-Wah.

992
01:25:56,833 --> 01:25:58,916
DIE FOR MY COUNTRY

993
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,666
You filthy rats.

994
01:26:02,083 --> 01:26:07,041
You took the bait
and walked right into my trap.

995
01:26:07,708 --> 01:26:10,583
I know all your secrets, Ko-Wah.

996
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:13,541
Today, I'll let you witness

997
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:17,541
the death of your ex-wife.

998
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:19,291
No!

999
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,500
Go to hell, Ko-Wah!

1000
01:26:59,833 --> 01:27:02,000
My turn!

1001
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:07,375
Jong, help Chompen and Chomchan. Go.

1002
01:27:07,458 --> 01:27:08,708
I'll take care of him.

1003
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:13,208
Jong, how did you get here?

1004
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:17,208
Jong? Is it really you?

1005
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:19,250
Yes. It's me, Aunt Chomchan.

1006
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:38,958
Jong, you have to stop the train
before Ko-Wah gets hurt.

1007
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:40,458
Go on, please hurry.

1008
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:45,875
Mom, how do you know Jong?

1009
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:55,208
You still can't get over him
after all these years?

1010
01:27:55,291 --> 01:27:58,083
Dad, Mom, what is this all about?

1011
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:02,208
And you've been lying to me
all these years, haven't you?

1012
01:28:02,291 --> 01:28:03,416
Yada, hang on.

1013
01:28:04,416 --> 01:28:05,333
Hang in there.

1014
01:28:10,833 --> 01:28:11,833
Take cover, Yada.

1015
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:20,083
You can keep going, right?

1016
01:28:33,083 --> 01:28:36,291
Yada, you go ahead.
I'll clear a path for you.

1017
01:28:36,375 --> 01:28:38,041
-What about you?
-Don't worry!

1018
01:28:39,166 --> 01:28:40,666
Go! Now!

1019
01:28:41,458 --> 01:28:43,333
Come on! Move! Go!

1020
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:58,583
Yada! Watch out!

1021
01:29:00,208 --> 01:29:01,041
Yada!

1022
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:04,875
Dum!

1023
01:29:06,083 --> 01:29:07,750
Dum!

1024
01:29:09,041 --> 01:29:11,166
Dum.

1025
01:29:12,333 --> 01:29:13,708
Dum, stay with me.

1026
01:29:14,875 --> 01:29:15,833
I'm glad

1027
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:19,666
that you still care about me.

1028
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:25,916
At least,

1029
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,250
I'm not the last man on Earth.

1030
01:29:32,375 --> 01:29:33,458
Dum!

1031
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:36,041
Yada…

1032
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:38,875
Run…

1033
01:29:42,333 --> 01:29:43,291
Run away.

1034
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,333
Dum!

1035
01:29:50,583 --> 01:29:52,708
Dum!

1036
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:55,458
You're finished.

1037
01:30:58,541 --> 01:30:59,375
Go to hell!

1038
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:10,333
You fucking bastard!

1039
01:31:12,916 --> 01:31:14,333
Motherfucker!

1040
01:31:17,166 --> 01:31:18,875
You're done for!

1041
01:31:22,708 --> 01:31:24,958
Shit, end of the line. Holy fuck.

1042
01:32:23,666 --> 01:32:24,625
My balls!

1043
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:33,125
Tun…

1044
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:37,375
-Trying to trick me again, are you?
-Tun…

1045
01:32:46,541 --> 01:32:51,125
Tun…

1046
01:32:51,208 --> 01:32:52,125
Tunnel.

1047
01:32:58,125 --> 01:33:00,416
You son of a--

1048
01:33:05,583 --> 01:33:08,541
Mont, look over there.
The train is approaching.

1049
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:10,000
Should we move in?

1050
01:33:11,916 --> 01:33:12,833
Not yet.

1051
01:33:13,416 --> 01:33:15,916
Just wait for the signal from Ko-Wah.

1052
01:33:45,625 --> 01:33:46,833
To hell with you!

1053
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:56,416
It's over for you!

1054
01:34:20,083 --> 01:34:22,416
Eat this, asshole!

1055
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:35,625
That's the signal.

1056
01:34:35,708 --> 01:34:36,875
Okay, go for it!

1057
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:38,708
Let's blow them up!

1058
01:34:51,208 --> 01:34:52,875
Mont!

1059
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:56,083
It's not time yet.
That's not the signal, bonehead!

1060
01:34:58,958 --> 01:35:01,125
Mont! You fucking jackass!

1061
01:35:01,833 --> 01:35:02,750
I'm dead!

1062
01:35:02,833 --> 01:35:04,291
Listen to me, you dumbass!

1063
01:35:04,958 --> 01:35:05,958
Listen, man!

1064
01:35:07,708 --> 01:35:08,541
Mont!

1065
01:35:08,625 --> 01:35:10,500
You fucking jackass!

1066
01:35:10,583 --> 01:35:12,708
I'll just die on top of this train then.

1067
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:14,416
I'm fucking dead. Goddamn you!

1068
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:25,375
Wow, this is so fun.

1069
01:35:28,916 --> 01:35:32,166
This is so fun. And I'm totally stoned!

1070
01:35:32,958 --> 01:35:36,750
Ya-hoo, today we're screwed!

1071
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:57,125
Chomchan!

1072
01:35:58,333 --> 01:35:59,416
Ko-Wah.

1073
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:03,958
Mom.

1074
01:36:08,625 --> 01:36:10,250
Ko-Wah, stop right there!

1075
01:36:10,333 --> 01:36:11,208
Don't.

1076
01:36:11,291 --> 01:36:12,708
Chomchan, move!

1077
01:36:12,791 --> 01:36:14,750
If you want to shoot, shoot me.

1078
01:36:14,833 --> 01:36:16,208
Go on!

1079
01:36:22,625 --> 01:36:23,541
Chomchan!

1080
01:36:26,666 --> 01:36:27,708
Mom!

1081
01:36:27,791 --> 01:36:30,583
-Let's go, Chomchan.
-Uncle Cham, don't hurt her!

1082
01:36:32,833 --> 01:36:34,875
Ko-Wah, where do you think you're going?

1083
01:36:39,208 --> 01:36:40,791
Dad, wait for me.

1084
01:36:44,125 --> 01:36:45,708
Ko-Wah, where are you going?

1085
01:36:46,875 --> 01:36:47,708
Chomchan.

1086
01:36:49,875 --> 01:36:51,791
Dad, wait for me!

1087
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:52,708
Dad!

1088
01:37:02,666 --> 01:37:03,875
Ko-Wah!

1089
01:37:05,125 --> 01:37:06,125
Ko-Wah!

1090
01:37:06,916 --> 01:37:08,000
Motherfucker!

1091
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:12,041
Ko-Wah, stop running!

1092
01:37:12,125 --> 01:37:15,458
Dad! Wait for me!

1093
01:37:45,458 --> 01:37:46,541
Damn you!

1094
01:37:57,708 --> 01:37:58,958
Yada!

1095
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:16,791
Damn it.

1096
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,083
Yada!

1097
01:38:23,791 --> 01:38:24,916
Yada.

1098
01:38:29,333 --> 01:38:30,375
Stay with me.

1099
01:38:32,083 --> 01:38:32,958
Jong…

1100
01:38:36,041 --> 01:38:37,083
I love you.

1101
01:38:40,583 --> 01:38:41,625
I'm happy

1102
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,625
that I finally got to tell you this.

1103
01:38:46,458 --> 01:38:47,500
I'm here now.

1104
01:38:49,541 --> 01:38:50,458
Hang in there.

1105
01:38:55,375 --> 01:38:56,375
Even though

1106
01:38:58,083 --> 01:38:59,708
you only love me as a sister,

1107
01:39:00,833 --> 01:39:02,500
it's enough to fill my heart.

1108
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:04,083
Yada.

1109
01:39:05,375 --> 01:39:06,208
Yada.

1110
01:39:07,125 --> 01:39:08,958
No, Yada.

1111
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:13,750
No.

1112
01:39:16,416 --> 01:39:19,333
Will I grow up to be as beautiful as you,
Aunt Chomchan?

1113
01:39:20,125 --> 01:39:22,833
Of course. You'll be very beautiful.

1114
01:39:22,916 --> 01:39:26,833
I'm sure all the young lads in the South
will fall in love with you.

1115
01:39:27,875 --> 01:39:29,708
I don't want any other man.

1116
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:32,666
I want only Jong to like me.

1117
01:39:42,833 --> 01:39:47,041
No!

1118
01:39:55,083 --> 01:39:55,916
Ko-Wah!

1119
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:58,750
Stop running!

1120
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:04,458
Ko-Wah!

1121
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:06,375
Ko-Wah!

1122
01:40:10,541 --> 01:40:13,166
You hide here.
I'll lure him the other way.

1123
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:14,333
Wait.

1124
01:40:15,458 --> 01:40:16,875
Please don't leave me again.

1125
01:40:20,291 --> 01:40:22,125
I'll never leave you, Chomchan.

1126
01:40:23,458 --> 01:40:26,333
The two of us will be together forever.

1127
01:40:31,208 --> 01:40:35,916
Ko-Wah!

1128
01:40:36,458 --> 01:40:37,541
Stop right there!

1129
01:40:46,291 --> 01:40:47,458
Ko-Wah,

1130
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:50,791
it's time we settled this, man to man.

1131
01:40:52,125 --> 01:40:54,333
You're not a coward, are you?

1132
01:40:55,208 --> 01:40:56,041
Rung,

1133
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:58,958
you stole my wife.

1134
01:40:59,041 --> 01:41:00,000
That was easy.

1135
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:01,625
Just ask Chomchan.

1136
01:41:02,666 --> 01:41:05,208
She chose to become my wife.

1137
01:41:06,958 --> 01:41:08,333
But you lied to me!

1138
01:41:08,416 --> 01:41:10,666
You told me he was dead.

1139
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:15,083
That's why I agreed to marry you.
How could you do this to me?

1140
01:41:15,166 --> 01:41:16,333
Because I love you!

1141
01:41:17,291 --> 01:41:18,416
I love you so much!

1142
01:41:20,708 --> 01:41:23,083
This bastard stole you from our wedding.

1143
01:41:25,708 --> 01:41:27,541
So I plotted to put him in jail.

1144
01:41:28,125 --> 01:41:30,625
But he somehow managed to escape.

1145
01:41:31,875 --> 01:41:35,583
Then let's settle this once and for all.

1146
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:41,958
With pleasure.

1147
01:43:08,583 --> 01:43:09,791
Dad!

1148
01:43:14,125 --> 01:43:16,916
Uncle Cham, why did you shoot my father?

1149
01:43:17,625 --> 01:43:18,708
No!

1150
01:43:38,875 --> 01:43:45,875
Ko-Wah!

1151
01:44:06,791 --> 01:44:08,375
Ko-Wah!

1152
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:17,291
No!

1153
01:44:26,125 --> 01:44:27,083
Chomchan!

1154
01:44:27,708 --> 01:44:28,875
Mom!

1155
01:44:38,208 --> 01:44:43,541
Mom!

1156
01:44:43,625 --> 01:44:45,208
Are you all right?

1157
01:44:46,291 --> 01:44:47,125
Chompen.

1158
01:44:47,916 --> 01:44:49,416
-Are you hurt?
-Chompen…

1159
01:44:51,875 --> 01:44:53,458
Ko-Wah…

1160
01:44:55,166 --> 01:44:57,958
is your real father.

1161
01:44:59,083 --> 01:45:02,208
Mom, what are you saying?

1162
01:45:02,958 --> 01:45:04,791
I don't understand.

1163
01:45:05,458 --> 01:45:06,666
Chomchan.

1164
01:45:07,375 --> 01:45:08,208
Luang Arun…

1165
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:14,333
may all the grievances we've suffered

1166
01:45:15,041 --> 01:45:17,166
end right here.

1167
01:45:19,083 --> 01:45:22,958
You've kept Ko-Wah and me apart
our whole lives.

1168
01:45:25,916 --> 01:45:26,750
Dad…

1169
01:45:28,958 --> 01:45:30,583
this isn't true, is it?

1170
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:34,291
Tell me it's not true.

1171
01:45:34,875 --> 01:45:36,416
Chompen…

1172
01:45:41,791 --> 01:45:44,458
Chompen, my child…

1173
01:45:49,083 --> 01:45:51,208
I…

1174
01:45:51,291 --> 01:45:52,500
I love you,

1175
01:45:53,708 --> 01:45:56,083
and I'm proud

1176
01:45:57,041 --> 01:45:58,833
of you.

1177
01:46:00,583 --> 01:46:01,666
So proud.

1178
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,750
I love you too, Mom.

1179
01:46:20,458 --> 01:46:22,666
Chomchan.

1180
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:23,583
Mom!

1181
01:46:23,666 --> 01:46:26,875
-Don't leave me!
-Chomchan! No!

1182
01:46:27,708 --> 01:46:29,500
Mom, don't leave me!

1183
01:46:30,666 --> 01:46:32,208
Mom!

1184
01:46:33,333 --> 01:46:34,583
Chomchan.

1185
01:46:34,666 --> 01:46:35,875
Mom.

1186
01:46:35,958 --> 01:46:38,208
Wait for me.

1187
01:46:38,958 --> 01:46:42,250
I'll be right behind you.

1188
01:46:46,416 --> 01:46:47,250
Ko.

1189
01:46:49,166 --> 01:46:52,291
Ko.

1190
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:54,500
Aunt Chomchan.

1191
01:46:56,333 --> 01:46:57,250
Jong.

1192
01:46:58,666 --> 01:46:59,875
Mom.

1193
01:46:59,958 --> 01:47:01,166
-Jong…
-Ko.

1194
01:47:09,458 --> 01:47:10,416
I will, Ko.

1195
01:47:12,708 --> 01:47:13,708
I promise…

1196
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,416
I'll take good care of Chompen.

1197
01:47:30,333 --> 01:47:31,208
Ko-Wah,

1198
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:34,125
can you forgive me?

1199
01:47:51,541 --> 01:47:57,250
Ko.

1200
01:47:57,958 --> 01:47:59,375
-Mom!
-Ko!

1201
01:48:00,583 --> 01:48:02,458
-Ko!
-Come back to me, Mom.

1202
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:14,541
Chomchan!

1203
01:48:24,208 --> 01:48:25,041
Mom.

1204
01:48:58,750 --> 01:49:05,750
Hush now, little one, it's time to sleep

1205
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:14,541
Just rest

1206
01:49:14,625 --> 01:49:19,416
Spirits of the house

1207
01:49:20,416 --> 01:49:27,333
Do not tease or haunt this child

1208
01:49:28,333 --> 01:49:35,291
Guardian spirit of mine
Do not frighten her

1209
01:49:36,333 --> 01:49:42,500
Lull this sweet girl to sleep

1210
01:49:43,625 --> 01:49:48,916
Sleep now

1211
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:57,125
Let her rest
Rock her gently into slumber

1212
01:50:22,333 --> 01:50:27,250
A FEW YEARS LATER

1213
01:50:43,541 --> 01:50:45,541
Time to eat. Stop playing.

1214
01:50:45,625 --> 01:50:47,166
You eat from the same pot.

1215
01:50:47,250 --> 01:50:48,958
Stop playing with your food.

1216
01:50:49,041 --> 01:50:51,708
Dig in. Share with one another.

1217
01:50:51,791 --> 01:50:55,000
Jong, you're the big brother.
Take care of your sis and bros.

1218
01:50:55,083 --> 01:50:57,666
Mont, why did you smack Dum's head?

1219
01:50:57,750 --> 01:50:59,041
Am I raising monkeys?

1220
01:50:59,833 --> 01:51:01,750
You eat from the same pot, so don't fight.

1221
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:23,541
CHOMCHAN - KO-WAH

1222
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:30,291
Mont beat us to it.

1223
01:51:51,583 --> 01:51:53,208
CHOMCHAN - KO-WAH

1224
01:51:55,083 --> 01:51:55,958
Dad…

1225
01:51:58,916 --> 01:52:00,625
I never knew…

1226
01:52:03,041 --> 01:52:05,291
that you were my real father.

1227
01:52:07,041 --> 01:52:10,541
But during that time we spent together,

1228
01:52:12,333 --> 01:52:13,708
I could sense

1229
01:52:15,125 --> 01:52:16,333
the love…

1230
01:52:18,625 --> 01:52:20,000
and care…

1231
01:52:22,958 --> 01:52:25,333
that you always had for me.

1232
01:52:30,583 --> 01:52:31,500
Dad…

1233
01:52:41,708 --> 01:52:42,958
I'm sorry.

1234
01:52:47,458 --> 01:52:49,041
You can't blame yourself

1235
01:52:50,208 --> 01:52:51,625
for what you didn't know.

1236
01:53:06,208 --> 01:53:08,000
Dad, what is this?

1237
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:17,750
Chomduen, that axe
belonged to your grandparents.

1238
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:19,833
You know what?

1239
01:53:19,916 --> 01:53:22,625
They fell in love with each other
because of that axe.

1240
01:53:22,708 --> 01:53:25,958
Can I take it home with me?

1241
01:53:26,041 --> 01:53:27,541
No, you can't.

1242
01:53:28,291 --> 01:53:29,833
It doesn't belong to us.

1243
01:53:30,625 --> 01:53:33,791
You wouldn't want to be a thief,
would you?

1244
01:53:39,791 --> 01:53:41,166
Give it to me.

1245
01:53:43,625 --> 01:53:46,000
Well, let me see your hands.

1246
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,083
Did you have fun?

1247
01:53:53,291 --> 01:53:55,125
All right, let's go home.

1248
01:53:55,708 --> 01:53:57,458
Let's go. Come on.

1249
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:05,958
Look. Beautiful, isn't it?

1250
01:54:07,291 --> 01:54:10,125
Please don't leave me again.

1251
01:54:10,625 --> 01:54:13,125
I'll never leave you, Chomchan.

1252
01:54:13,791 --> 01:54:16,583
The two of us will be together forever.

1253
01:54:43,750 --> 01:54:45,208
Jackass motherfucker.

1254
01:54:46,333 --> 01:54:47,583
Stop slacking off.

1255
01:54:51,083 --> 01:54:52,083
Plow the field.

1256
01:54:56,166 --> 01:54:58,875
Wow, you have the nerve to look at me.

1257
01:54:58,958 --> 01:55:00,625
Don't look at me like that.

1258
01:55:00,708 --> 01:55:02,500
Luang Arun, you dickhead.

1259
01:55:02,583 --> 01:55:05,291
You trampled
on other people all your life.

1260
01:55:05,375 --> 01:55:07,666
Well, I can be
an even bigger dickhead than you.

1261
01:55:10,750 --> 01:55:12,208
Not plowing, huh?

1262
01:55:12,291 --> 01:55:13,333
Fine.

1263
01:55:13,416 --> 01:55:16,291
If you don't want to plow,
I'll show you what happens.

1264
01:55:20,791 --> 01:55:22,708
Urghhh!

1265
01:55:25,833 --> 01:55:27,208
What did you just say?

1266
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,125
Say that again.

1267
01:55:30,458 --> 01:55:34,875
Urghhh!

1268
01:55:38,208 --> 01:55:40,666
It all makes sense now.

1269
01:55:41,666 --> 01:55:43,083
You sound just like my dad.

1270

Before he died, he was trying
to tell Ko that his balls were hurting.

01:55:47,875 --> 01:55:51,291
Urghhh!

1272
01:55:51,375 --> 01:55:53,250
