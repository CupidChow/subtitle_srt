This series is a work of fiction.
It is not related to any real persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,560
Do you even realize you were drugged with a diuretic, Thun?

3
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,120
They still haven’t found who did it.

4
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,560
I knew you were going to say sorry.

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,800
You didn’t do anything wrong, Keen.

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,840
These fuckers are screwing over the public!

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,600
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,960
It's ok.

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,320
I really needed to pee, so I stopped by to relieve myself.

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,000
And ended up stumbling across a corpse.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,680
I think Muay’s death and your father’s

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,720
was commited by the same person.

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,680
And based on the evidence I have right now...

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,200
But you’re still my son!

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,920
Pakorn is the killer.

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,240
Let me be a father for once.

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
Why would you even try now?

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,720
You’re ten years too late.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,960
You fucking suck!

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,840
But still… you’re my son!

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,160
About what I said.

22
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,440
If you ever change your mind, just let me know.

23
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,480
Betrayal

24
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,480
Oh! Mr.Phuwish, when did you get here?

25
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Oh..

26
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,520
Petch, hello.

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,920
Hello.

28
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,160
I came to visit Thun.

29
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,240
Ah.

30
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Hello, Coach.

31
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,000
Hello.

32
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,000
I really have to thank you, Mr.Phuwish,

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,600
for being so kind and stepping in for Thun.

34
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,120
Ah.

35
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,720
If you hadn’t helped,

36
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,200
I honestly wouldn’t know how I was going to pay for Thun’s medical bills.

37
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,960
Oh, it’s nothing, Coach Petch.

38
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,800
We’re not strangers.

39
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,640
Once we start helping, we’ve got to see it through.
Yes.

40
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,720
Look at him.

41
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,240
I can finally breathe a little.

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,760
Yeah.

43
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,280
He’s not seriously hurt or anything.

44
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,840
Thanks again, Mr.Phuwish.

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,160
Happy to help, Thun.

46
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,080
Actually, I was going to find you, Coach Petch.

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,080
I’ve got something important I want to talk to you about.

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,160
It’s about the Petchsak Academy.

49
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,200
I’ll come visit the gym this evening.

50
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,560
I want to see how everyone’s doing.

51
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,560
You’re more than welcome.

52
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,560
Alright, I’ll see you there then.

53
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,760
I’ll be going now.

54
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,280
Okay.

55
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,240
Come on, I’ll walk you out.

56
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,040
Oh, thank you.
Take care.

57
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,360
See you soon.
See you.

58
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,480
Goodbye.

59
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,480
Thanks again, Coach Petch.

61
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,640
Hey, Mai, come help carry some stuff.

62
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,560
Sure, Uncle Petch.

63
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,840
Hello.

64
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,080
It’s so hot.

65
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,680
How are you feeling, bro? Tired from the long drive?

66
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,440
Just a bit.

67
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,440
Have you eaten yet?

68
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:00,920
Huh?

69
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,160
Have you eaten yet?

70
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,840
Not yet. Got anything to eat?

71
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,680
I prepared something. Bought it and waited for you all to get back.

72
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,080
Really?

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,520
I'm tired, let’s head inside.

74
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,880
What happened here?

75
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,800
Why such a mess?

76
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,880
Again?

77
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,120
Let’s check first to see if anything’s missing.

78
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,040
Uncle Petch! Everyone! It’s bad!

79
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,720
Something’s happened! Someone broke into the gym!

80
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,000
Hurry, Uncle Petch!

81
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,280
Where is the thief, Mai?

82
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,640
I didn’t see anyone, Uncle.

83
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,560
Shit.

84
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,040
Why the hell is your room this trashed?

85
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,960
We don’t know.

86
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,880
It was like this when we got here.

87
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Where’s Ait?

88
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,840
Check if anything’s missing.

89
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,640
Nothing’s gone.

90
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,000
Let’s double-check just to be sure.

91
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,000
Shit… Ait..

92
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,080
Nothing’s missing from my stuff.

93
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,680
Same with me.

94
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,320
Then what the hell was the person searching for in your room?

95
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,160
Coach, Ait’s gone.

96
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,600
He packed up and took all his stuff.

97
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,680
Could it have been Ait?

98
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,000
Ait?

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,800
But why would he do something like that?

100
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,600
And nothing was even stolen.

101
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,000
I don’t think it was Ait.

102
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
He’s not that kind of person.

103
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,160
I don’t want to think it was Ait either.

104
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,920
But the room’s a wreck,

105
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,840
and now he’s gone again, what am I supposed to think?

106
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,080
Maybe it was something urgent and he left quickly without telling anyone

107
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,400
His sister’s still sick, remember?

108
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,600
But why are you defending Ait so much?

109
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,680
Let’s go.

110
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,200
Hey, what the hell?

111
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,800
Hey!
Stop!

112
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,200
What are you guys doing?!

113
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,640
Hey, grab him!

114
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,320
Shit!

115
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,840
Thun!

116
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Stop!

117
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Mai!

118
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
If you don’t want to die,

119
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
stay fucking still!

120
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,800
You heard him, stay still. Bring him here!

121
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,880
You! Come here!

122
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,400
Bro!

123
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,120
Please leave him alone.

124
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,400
Come here.

125
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,960
He told you to stay still.

126
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,840
Stop it!

127
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,880
Hey!

128
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,120
I said stay still!
Hey, stop!

129
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Stay still!

130
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,240
Please! Please don’t hurt my son!

131
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,400
I’m begging you!

132
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,280
If you don’t want anything to happen to him, then pay back Sia Thep.

133
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,040
That’s all.

134
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,760
I don’t have the money right now.

135
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,920
Just give me a bit more time.

136
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,600
You want more time? Ha!

137
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,080
You want time?

138
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,760
Fine.

139
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,520
You want time?!

140
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,800
No, please!

141
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,360
Mawin!

142
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,920
You want time?!

143
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,200
Stop!

144
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,800
You want time?!

145
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,880
That’s enough.

146
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,640
Please stop.

147
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Give us more time.

148
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,760
I’ll go fight and I’ll pay it all back.

149
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,080
I don’t care how you do it, but I need Sia Thep’s money!

150
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,480
Now! Right now.

151
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,240
Or else..

152
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,800
How do I open this?!

153
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,560
No!

154
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,760
Don’t!

155
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,040
Give me my money!

156
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,560
No..

157
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,840
Where’s my money?!

158
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,280
Let him go!

159
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,920
Don’t, he’s got a gun.

160
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,480
Let me go!

161
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,000
Hey!

162
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Thun!

163
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,720
Stay still!

164
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,160
What’s going on here?!

165
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,600
Why are you doing this?!

166
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,520
MP Phuwish.

167
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,760
Yes.

168
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,480
They owe my boss money, sir.

169
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,520
But they kept stalling,

170
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,000
so we had to do this.

171
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,120
This country has laws.

172
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,000
Who’s your boss, anyway?

173
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
How dare you act like you’re above the law?

174
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,440
Our boss is Sia Thep.

175
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,520
You must’ve heard of him.

176
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,760
Ah.

177
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,880
I thought so, I figured Sia Thep wasn’t a good person.

178
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,240
I’d like to have a word with your boss.

179
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,920
What are you planning to do?

180
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:52,960
I said I’d like to talk to Sia Thep.

181
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:20,000
Boss, MP Phuwish wants to speak with you.

182
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Understood.

183
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,800
(Sia Thep)
Hello, MP Phuwish. What’s this about?

184
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,800
How much does Petchsak owe you?

185
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,080
(Sia Thep)
(This has nothing to do with you, Mr.MP.)

186
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,400
(Sia Thep)
(They borrowed money from me, they’ve got to pay me back.)

187
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,320
I’ll pay the debt for them.

188
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,360
Now can you tell me how much they owe you?

189
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,600
(Sia Thep)
(One million baht.)

190
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
One million baht.

191
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:44,320
Phuwish Hatthaniyom, one million baht.

192
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,360
Here’s a cashier’s check for one million.

193
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,120
I’ll leave it with your minions.

194
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,680
Once you’ve got the money..

195
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,200
Then get the fuck out.

196
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
Yes, sir.

197
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,680
And the rest of you, remember this..

198
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,320
I won’t let you pull this string on anyone else again.

199
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,680
I will wipe out all the courrupting force in the boxing industry!

200
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,720
Off you go.

201
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,120
Mawin!

202
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,440
Are you okay?
Mawin!

203
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,920
Mawin!

204
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,040
Can you stand?

205
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,080
Does it hurt?

206
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,840
Let’s get you patched up first.

207
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,880
I’m really sorry, sir.

208
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
You had to step in because of us.

209
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,840
I already told you, you don’t have to call me that.

210
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,320
This is all my fault.

211
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,560
I didn’t take good care of my kids.

212
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
Got fooled out of our money.

213
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,800
And when we tried to host an event to pay it back, that fell apart too.

214
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,520
Now you’ve had to step in and pay the debt for us…

215
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,320
I don’t even know how I’ll pay you back.

216
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,360
Thank you so much.

217
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,440
Uncle Petch, don’t blame yourself.

218
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,800
It’s my fault the event didn’t work out.

219
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
It’s okay.

220
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,960
Nobody’s to blame here.

221
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,520
It’s all my fault.

222
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,280
I have to say sorry to you, sir.

223
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,040
Sorry.

224
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,600
I’m sorry.

225
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,440
So sorry.

226
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:14,040
And thank you for everything.

227
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,360
Honestly…

228
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,200
I actually came here today because I wanted to ask for something.

229
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,520
But after seeing what you’ve all just been through…

230
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
I didn’t want to trouble you.

231
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,160
It’s fine. Please, tell us.

232
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,200
Let us return the favor.

233
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
It’s about...

234
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
the Hero Fight event.

235
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,800
As you all know,

236
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,280
it was a dramatic loss.

237
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,800
And I know that wasn’t anyone’s fault.

238
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,280
But I had to cover the damage fee...

239
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,800
Lost credibility with the insurers, the sponsors, the other gyms.

240
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,760
So I’ll be real with you…

241
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,560
I’m struggling too.

242
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,760
I’m sorry.

243
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
I’m really sorry.

244
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,840
You shouldn’t have gone through any of this.

245
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,200
We’re in the same boat now, aren’t we?

246
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
So…

247
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,080
I want to be part of Petchsak Academy.

248
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:20,440
Sorry? What do you mean by that?

249
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,680
No need to apologize, coach Petch.

250
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,880
I...

251
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,000
Let me be blunt.

252
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,800
I want to buy Petchsak Academy from you.

253
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,600
And in return,

254
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:44,760
I'll consider that we’re all even now.

255
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
Excuse me?

256
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,880
You don’t have to give me an answer right away.

257
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,120
Think it over.

258
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,760
Why do you want to buy this place?

259
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,080
We’re still small.

260
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,320
We haven’t accomplished anything big yet.

261
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,240
Don’t sell yourself short, Keen.

262
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,720
Petchsak Academy may not be huge.

263
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,440
But organizing a fight this well is already impressive.

264
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,240
You should all be proud.

265
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,000
You’ve all done amazing.

266
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,600
You just need an opportunity.

267
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,840
And I’m here to give it to you.

268
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,680
Thank you so much for your kindness, Phuwish.

269
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Really, thank you.

270
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,240
So that means…

271
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,760
You’ve made a decision?

272
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,360
Um…

273
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,560
We’d like to talk it over first.

274
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,880
Of course.

275
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,240
What do we do, Dad?

276
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
I don’t know.

277
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,600
Part of me wants to sell, just to be done with all this.

278
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,280
But part of me… I’d hate to see it belong to someone else.

279
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,080
At least Phuwish seems like a good guy.

280
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,560
If he cleared the debt with Sia Thep,

281
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,720
Maybe the worst is already behind us.

282
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
I think selling is a good idea.

283
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,840
It’s the only way out for us.

284
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,560
We can start fresh.

285
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Thun, what do you think?

286
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Coach Petch..

287
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,320
P. White Tiger Gym has an offer too.

288
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,760
Thun, how are you feeling?

289
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,160
You doing okay?

290
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,240
What do you want from me?

291
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,800
I came because I was worried.

292
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,680
That’s why I came to see you.

293
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,680
You came because you care or because you want to see the damage you’ve done?

294
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,000
What the hell are you talking about?

295
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,200
I don't know..

296
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,800
This whole time, you’ve just been trying to get in my way.

297
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,120
Trying to buy Typhoon and poach him from our gym.

298
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:42,000
Rigging the match against me. And now this, this was you too, wasn’t it?

299
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,680
You think I drugged you?

300
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,160
Hmph, don’t talk when you don’t know anything.

301
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,000
So tell me what you do know.

302
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
I…

303
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,680
I can’t tell you right now.

304
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
Again?

305
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,440
So why are you even here?

306
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,680
Just to rub it in?

307
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,360
You should leave, I don’t want to see you anymore.

308
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,120
I just want you to know.

309
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,320
I would never hurt you.

310
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,920
I came here today to make you an offer.

311
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,600
I’ll pay off Petchsak Academy’s debts.

312
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:42,480
Everything, from Sia Thep and the money you borrowed from MP Phuwish for the event.

313
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,960
Why would you suddenly want to help us?

314
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,000
I really can’t explain it right now.

315
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:58,320
But this is the only way I can keep you and everyone safe.

316
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,560
Please, just let me do something right as a father.

317
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,040
Why would you even try now? You’re ten years too late.

318
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,360
You fucking suck.

319
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,240
But you’re still my son.

320
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
What should we do?

321
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
To be honest.

322
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,560
I feel guilty toward MP Phuwish.

323
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,920
He’s done so much for us already.

324
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,520
I don’t know, Dad.

325
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,000
Whatever I choose, I keep messing up.

326
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I don’t know what to do anymore.

327
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,120
Keen.

328
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,920
What do you think?

329
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,480
This is important, why are you just telling us now?

330
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
I’m sorry.

331
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,600
Everything’s been a mess, I didn’t get the chance.

332
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,160
We need to talk.

333
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
Keen.

334
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:13,240
Pakorn, your father, might be messing with your head.

335
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,000
What do you mean by that?

336
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,560
Don’t forget, Pakorn’s the one who rigged the match when you fought Typhoon.

337
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,040
That’s what got Mawin into debt in the first place.

338
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,240
And you were drugged and our whole event falls apart.

339
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,040
Now he shows up to take us over?

340
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,800
You've been like this since the hospital.

341
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:43,720
You’re mad because I didn’t tell you about my dad, right?

342
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
Well, should I?

343
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,200
Am I a stranger to you?

344
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,760
I thought we were in this together.

345
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,040
So why didn’t you tell me something that important?

346
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,200
But I tried to understand.

347
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,320
I figured maybe you had your reason not to tell me.

348
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
But I can’t, Thun.

349
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:44,000
The reason I didn’t tell you… is because I don’t see him as my dad.

350
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,280
Keen, remember what I told you that day?

351
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:58,520
Pakorn is my father who abandoned me and my mother ten years ago.

352
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:10,480
I think someone like that doesn’t deserved a place in my life

353
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
or in our life.

354
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,240
That’s why I didn’t say anything.

355
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
I’m sorry, Keen.

356
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
Can you forgive me?

357
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:47,040
From now on if you ever want to know anything, just ask.

358
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,760
I’ll tell you everything.

359
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
Thun, listen carefully.

360
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,840
Pakorn… he’s the one who killed my dad.

361
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,920
The way Muay died, it was just like my dad.

362
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,760
But at the crime scene, there were no signs of dogs.

363
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,840
It was like the body had been dumped there.

364
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,120
And there was a circular pin left at the scene..

365
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
Pakorn’s pin.

366
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:15,000
Today when he came to see you in the hospital, he wasn’t wearing it.

367
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:34,200
Which means the one at the crime scene was his?

368
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,880
I’m telling you the truth, Thun.

369
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,280
If you won’t help me…

370
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,280
I get it.

371
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,200
He’s your father.

372
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:31,840
I know you’re confused and under a lot of stress right now.

373
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,560
So do I.

374
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,640
If he really is what you say he is

375
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
then he has to be held accountable.

376
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,840
And I’ll help you do that.

377
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
No matter who’s on the other side.

378
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
Thank you, Thun.

379
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,600
I know who drugged you.

380
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,720
Whoa!

381
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,640
Nice! Ait, you’re amazing!

382
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,960
Thank you.

383
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,000
Thank you, Coach.

384
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,120
Ait, someone’s calling.

385
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,880
They said it’s urgent, better pick up.

386
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,160
Yes, sir.

387
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,760
(Are you ready to follow the plan, Ait?)

388
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,960
There’s no other way, is there?

389
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,400
(Your beloved sister’s still recovering, isn’t she?)

390
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,840
(Don’t forget what I’ve done for you.)

391
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
But Sia…

392
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,840
(Let’s see what you’ve got to eat today.)

393
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,320
(Ooh! Shrimp porridge!)

394
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,360
(Eat up, okay?)

395
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,400
(If you finish it all, I've got a surprise for you, alright?)

396
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,080
(Okay!)

397
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,240
(Here, blow on it first.)

398
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,320
(Blow, blow, okay?)

399
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,800
Hey! Ait!

400
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,160
I saw your fight just now.

401
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,160
You were incredible.

402
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,320
You were the underdog at first,

403
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,040
but you pushed through and turned it around.

404
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,280
I seriously respect that.

405
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,480
That’s why you’re Petchsak’s

406
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,520
For real.

407
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
Thank you.

408
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,760
Do you need to take a break and grab something to eat or do something else first?

409
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,760
I’ll watch this for you.

410
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Uh, thanks.

411
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,520
Just hold it for a bit.

412
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,960
I’ll go to the restroom and be right back.

413
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,560
Sure.

414
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,280
That’s everything that happened.

415
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,080
How could you do this?
Bung, calm down!

416
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,960
Bung, don’t!

417
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,520
Bung, don’t!
Mai, let go!

418
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,240
You betrayed us.

419
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,920
You ruined the match.

420
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,360
You drugged Thun, he nearly died!

421
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,080
How do you expect me to stay calm?
Bung, calm down!

422
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,200
Bung!

423
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,520
Enough!

424
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,200
This is a hospital, not the gym.

425
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,080
Who the hell is Sia Thep?

426
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,040
And how could he do this to us?

427
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
Ait.

428
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,960
Do you know who Sia Thep really is?

429
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,880
I don’t.

430
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I’ve never met him.

431
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:48,360
Every time he contacted me, he used a voice changer.

432
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,120
He even managed to get a heart for your sister that fast.

433
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,640
He must have some really powerful connections.

434
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,960
No wonder the cops are scared of him.

435
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,920
Ait, can you at least tell me

436
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,720
what does he want?

437
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,760
He only said he wanted to destroy Mr.Phuwish.

438
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,320
We were never the target.

439
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,320
We were just tools.

440
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,240
What do you mean?

441
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:38,440
He told me to tell Keen to borrow money from Phuwish for the event.

442
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:44,880
Then he told me to drug Thun so the whole thing would collapse.

443
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,360
So Phuwish would lose both his money and reputation.

444
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,440
That was all part of Sia Thep’s plan.

445
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,520
And you helped him?

446
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,920
Even after everything he’s done for us?

447
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,280
How could you?

448
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,680
He had to, Bung.

449
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,520
If it were you, would you let your sister die?

450
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,120
That’s enough.

451
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,120
You don’t need to protect me.

452
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,000
This is all my fault.

453
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,520
I’m sorry, Coach.

454
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,520
I betrayed you.

455
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,280
I caused you all this trouble.

456
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,440
I’m really sorry.

457
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,520
I’m sorry, Thun.

458
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,960
I almost killed you.

459
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,000
Keen, I’m sorry.

460
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,480
I ruined your entire event.

461
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,560
I’m really sorry.

462
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,240
I’m really sorry.

463
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,200
It’s all my fault.

464
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,040
I’m sorry.

465
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,080
I’m sorry…

466
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,440
I’m so sorry.

467
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,520
Get up.

468
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,720
I’m not mad at you.

469
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,160
I’m not some amazing coach or anything.

470
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,720
I couldn’t even find money or work for you guys.

471
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,920
If you had joined another gym, you might’ve had an easier life.

472
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,760
I know you.

473
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,200
You’re not that kind of person.

474
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:43,120
If you want to come back to our gym, come with me.

475
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,680
I’m not mad at you.

476
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:26,680
But next time, if anything happens, just tell me. Don’t go on your own.

477
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,680
Let’s start over.

478
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,680
Thank you everyone, for giving me another chance.

479
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,720
Thank you.

480
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,520
I’m really sorry.

481
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,400
I’m sorry.

483
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,000
You’re in this mess because of me.

484
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,080
You were about to pay off the debt,

485
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,000
and I ruined it.

486
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,560
I ruined everything.

487
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,960
If you hadn’t done what you did, your sister might not have survived, right?

488
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,360
How could I blame you?

489
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:32,040
I was the one who got greedy and got into gambling debt in the first place.

490
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,240
But now it’s all over, Ait.

491
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,480
Mr. Phuwish took care of everything for us.

492
00:46:54,120 --> 00:47:00,760
From now on, let’s start over together.

493
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,200
Thanks.

494
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,080
About the boxing match…

495
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,720
What are you thanking me for?

496
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,560
For what you said on stage.

497
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,440
For saying you love me.

498
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:43,760
Thank you for cheering me on and helping me win.

499
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:53,040
And I’m sorry I didn’t say anything back then.

500
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,440
I love you too.

501
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:18,000
But do I really deserve your love?

502
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,120
I’ll take care of the rest, Coach Petch.

503
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,400
No need to worry.

504
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,000
Thank you so much.

505
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,640
And about Sia Thep, don’t worry.

506
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,640
From now on, I’ll protect everyone myself.

507
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,000
Ah.

508
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,920
Here, take this.

509
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,240
Oh, thanks.

510
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,600
"The Ring Rage"

511
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,840
Hmm.

512
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,080
When’s the match?

513
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,920
Tomorrow.

514
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,160
Tomorrow?

515
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,840
Yes.

516
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:14,640
Oh.

517
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,920
And I want all the fighters from Petchsak Academy to join.

518
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,000
Alright.

519
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,160
Please get everyone ready.

520
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:28,000
I’ll send a car to pick you up early tomorrow.

521
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,360
Isn’t that a bit last-minute?

522
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,360
Hmph. Opportunities don’t come every day, Keen.

523
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,320
We have to be ready when it comes.

524
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,120
That’s just how it is.

525
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,800
Right.

526
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,400
Thank you so much.

527
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,400
It’s an honor to have Mr. Phuwish looking after our gym.

528
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,080
Happy to help, Coach Petch.

529
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,320
Oh, your pen.

530
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,080
Thanks.

531
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:23,320
Whoa? Klao, why are you here?

532
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,320
Hey, Keen.

533
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:30,680
I heard Uncle Petch transferred ownership of Petchsak to MP Phuwish.

534
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,240
Is it true?

535
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,560
Word travels fast, huh?

536
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,680
Bung told me everything.

537
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:42,280
From what I’ve seen, Mr. Phuwish seems alright.

538
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,320
Really?

539
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,200
Didn’t say he was gonna change anything.

540
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,160
He’s even finding us gigs.

541
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,240
We’ve got a match tomorrow.

542
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,880
What match?

543
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,800
Something called "The Ring Rage" or whatever.

544
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,360
Never heard of it.

545
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,000
"The Ring Rage"?

546
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,560
Have you ever heard of it?

547
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,920
Not sure, let me look it up real quick.

548
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,040
What was it called again?

549
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,240
The Ring Rage

550
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,920
The Ring Rage?

551
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,400
This one?

552
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,160
Is it this one?

553
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,240
What kind of event is that?

554
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,680
Even the sports news reporter doesn't know?

555
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,200
Maybe it’s a new event.

556
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,080
Yeah, no…

557
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,560
I’ve never reported on anything like this before.

558
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,280
But I’ll go tomorrow.

559
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,120
Mhm.

560
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:46,440
Actually, I have something important to tell you.

561
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,480
What is it, Klao?

562
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:55,720
About Pakorn. You said he’s Thun’s dad, right?

563
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,120
Did I just make you guys fight or something?

564
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:01,560
It almost broke us up.

565
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,760
But we’re good now.

566
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,080
That’s good to hear.

567
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:16,560
If it’s proven that Pakorn really killed Keen’s father…

568
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,800
I don't...

569
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,400
I don’t even know how I’m supposed to feel.

570
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,920
Actually, I have a small update about that.

571
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,560
What is it?

572
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,280
You see this pin?

573
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,200
The one I was suspicious about and thought it might be Pakorn’s?

574
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,600
The one found near where Muay’s body was discovered?

575
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:48,840
Well… I thought Pakorn killed Muay, right?

576
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:53,480
But actually, the pin might have belonged to Muay herself.

577
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,000
I’m sorry for jumping to conclusions back then.

578
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:06,880
And this pin, it looks like it belongs to some secret organization or something.

579
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,880
Look, all these big names are wearing it.

580
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,680
I think something’s fishy.

581
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,520
Why is this whole thing so complicated, Klao?

582
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:28,640
When are we ever going to find out the truth about my dad?

583
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,080
Hey.

584
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,680
Where are you going?

585
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,160
I’ve got something to talk about with Pakorn.

586
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,080
No way.

587
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,880
I said no.

588
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,800
Move.

589
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,960
I have something important to discuss with him.

590
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:32,640
Fighters from other gyms are strictly forbidden. Mr. Pakorn’s orders.

591
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,280
Otherwise, the training secrets might get leaked.

592
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,760
Then go tell him Thun is here to see him.

593
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,600
Hey.

594
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,680
Let Thun go.

595
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,920
Get back to training.

596
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,200
Why are you here?

597
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:09,040
I have something to ask you, but…

598
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,680
If you won’t say it here, then I don’t say anything at all.

599
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:24,920
I don’t have all day, you know.

600
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,760
Did you really kill Keen’s father?

601
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,040
Heh? You came all the way here just to ask me that?

602
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:50,200
Fine, I’ll answer you.

603
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,480
But on one condition.

604
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,120
Hey, get me some gloves.

605
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,920
Why? Scared?

606
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,400
Didn’t expect you to be such a coward.

607
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,000
You think you can just walk in and ask something like that

608
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,440
and I’ll just answer easily?

609
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,720
Alright, fine.

610
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,440
Let’s do this.
Come on, then.

611
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,120
Punch!
Kick!

612
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,360
Careful boss!

613
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,680
Hey, get him outta here.

614
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,720
Everyone, let’s go.

615
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,000
You’re insane.

616
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,760
Hahaha!

617
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,520
Hey, me first!

618
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,520
Too late.
Bung, oh man!

619
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,640
Acting like a clown.

620
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,600
Can you do it?

621
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,920
Alright.
Let’s go.

622
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,920
Thank you.

623
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,520
(THUN: Don’t wait for me. See you at the venue)

624
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,280
Hey, is everyone ready? The van’s about to leave.

625
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,400
We should get going.

626
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,080
Huh?

627
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,920
You’re not waiting for Thun?

628
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,480
He said to meet him at the venue.

629
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,440
Okay.

630
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,960
We can go then.

631
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,320
Sorry I’m late.

632
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,600
I got caught up dealing with some new product stuff.

633
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,640
Mhm.
Wanna see it?

634
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,240
Looks rough.

635
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,800
My apologies.

636
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,760
Very good.

637
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,200
Yes, Sia Thep.

638
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,120
Haha!

639
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:54,320
Please welcome to the boxing ring, Petchsak fighters!

640
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,640
Typhoon!

641
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,440
So, why did you bring us here?

642
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,040
Petchsak Academy is now mine.

643
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,720
You guys are just like my employees.

644
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,440
Thun!

645
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,440
This Friday, I’m sending you to fight under the name

646
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,520
Heaven Arena.
