1
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:28,040
This series is a work of fiction.
It is not related to any real persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,760
I told you, this time wouldn’t be like before.

3
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,920
Shit, my money's gone, damn it!

4
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
Weren’t you betting at Mr. Thep’s table?

5
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,280
No need to stress, Mr. Thep’s easygoing.

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,080
Anyway, thank you darling

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,240
for paying it all off.

8
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,920
From now on, you’re debt-free.

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,680
Do you still want to stay at the Academy?

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,240
So…

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,400
do you want a boxer as your boyfriend?

12
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Are you okay?

13
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,320
Okay.

14
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,080
Let’s keep packing.

15
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,280
I almost forgot.

16
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Just a sec.

17
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,800
Feeling refreshed?

18
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Thanks.

19
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,680
Hero VS Hero

20
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,760
I’ve packed everything on this side.

21
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,360
Where else do you want me to pack?

22
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
What book is that, Keen?

23
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,880
It’s a crossword puzzle book.

24
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,200
My dad liked me to play with this to sharpen my mind.

25
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
(What’s dad even doing?)

26
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,920
(An English entrance exam?)

27
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,600
Whoa.

28
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,920
Mom, you're pretty smart too, huh?

29
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,080
Of course!

30
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,960
Oh hey, Dad’s here right on time.
What are you guys up to?

31
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,520
Solving the crossword puzzle I made?

32
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,120
Let me see how it’s going.

33
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,840
Dad, this puzzle is too hard.

34
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,360
Why?

35
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,320
I'm just a kid, I can’t solve it.

36
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,600
There’s no riddle that can’t be solved.

37
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,520
Sometimes, the answer is easier than we think,

38
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,680
If we open our hears.

39
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
Let me see.

40
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,640
Both heroes and villains know its weight,

41
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,280
Giving up for others seals their fate.

42
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,480
Sacrifice!

43
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,840
Whoa, impressive.

44
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,600
Well, you’ve been to my house before.

45
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,040
I’m not dumb, you know.

46
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,640
Hey!

47
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
You’re so smug.

48
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,880
Alright, alright, I’ll stop talking.

49
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,880
Let’s just keep packing.

50
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,680
Keen.

51
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,720
Let’s go.

52
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,960
Hey, should we change how we call each other?

53
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,160
You want to change it?

54
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,360
Well, we’ve changed our relationship status…

55
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
We should change how we address each other too.

56
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,160
Calling each other "you" forever feels weird.

57
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,920
So what should we call each other then?

58
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,000
Me and my bro?

59
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What do you think?

60
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Are you serious?

61
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
How about Pookie and Bubba?

62
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
That’s too sweet.

63
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
Darling?

64
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,840
Ugh, there’s no use for all those words.

65
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,080
Okay, how about we just use our names?

66
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Thun.

67
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Keen?

68
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Yes.

69
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,400
Thun.

70
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Let’s take a photo.

71
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,600
Smile.

72
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,200
One, two, three.

73
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
One, two, three.

74
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,280
Hey,

75
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
seriously?, Thun.

76
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,000
One more, one more.

77
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
One, two, three.

78
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,520
Let’s go.

79
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
Wait.

80
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,360
I don’t want to get out yet.

81
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,120
I’m going to miss this quiet time with just us.

82
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,440
Aren’t you going to unload your stuff?

83
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,440
Come on, we’ve got this peaceful moment together right now.

84
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
You’re going to let it pass?

85
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Once we start...

86
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
There’s no turning back.

87
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,920
Aaaaah!

88
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,560
What’s up, Mawin?

89
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,520
Didn’t you say you’d pay back Sia Thep with your boxing money?

90
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,560
Huh? Trying to run from me?

91
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Where’s my fucking money?

92
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

93
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,720
Recording us?

94
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,200
Huh?!

95
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,360
Hey, stay back.

96
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,440
Why, old man?

97
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,520
Out of respect for your age.

98
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,280
Didn’t you say Sia Thep was kind?

99
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,720
You said I didn’t have to pay right away?

100
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
I’ll talk to Sia Thep myself.

101
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,040
You guys are just his lackeys.

102
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
Hey!
Don’t!

103
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,720
Shut up!
Hey!

104
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Don’t butt in!

105
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,560
You son of a!

106
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,080
Hey!

107
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,840
You want to stick your nose in?!

108
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,200
Hey! What are you guys doing?!

109
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,800
Hey!

110
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
No role in this? Then stay out!

111
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,640
I don’t know what my son did,

112
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,600
But can we have a bit more time?

113
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,920
I’m not running.

114
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,000
We’ll pay it back.

115
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,720
Like your son said, Sia Thep’s kind.

116
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,040
He gave you a week.

117
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,480
Find 500,000 baht and pay Sia Thep back.

118
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,720
What? Just one week?

119
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
Can we have a month?

120
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,920
I’ll pay you back.

121
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,040
Ugh... what do you think, Dang?

122
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,080
Sure.

123
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,840
Fine, a month.

124
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,520
But I want a million back in interest.

125
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,080
What? A million?!

126
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,720
Hey!

127
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,520
Come on! That’s way too much!

128
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,640
Might as well kill me now!

129
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,840
You said it yourself, asshole.

130
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,960
Enough already!

131
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,480
I can fulfill that death wish if you want!

132
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,840
Okay, okay.

133
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,720
We’ll find a way to pay it back.

134
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,760
Just don’t hurt the kids.

135
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,080
Dad.

136
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
If you don’t pay in a month!

137
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,520
You know what’ll happen.

138
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,160
Let’s go, Dang.

139
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,560
Are you insane?!

140
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,760
You gambled away hundreds of thousands?!

141
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,520
Back when it was just small bets, I never said anything.

142
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,680
But how could you lose 400-500K like that?!

143
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,360
I thought I’d use my trading profits to pay it back, Dad.

144
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,280
But who would’ve thought Thun would lose?

145
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:03,760
I mean, who would've thought they'd cheat like that?!

146
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,040
Uncle Petch, looks like almost all the students are canceling our courses.

147
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,760
They’re asking for refunds too.

148
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,720
We’ll halt the courses for now.

149
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,680
We’ll reopen when things improve.

150
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,040
And the course fees?

151
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,920
We’ll have to refund the remaining amount.

152
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,400
Call the students and tell them to come collect their refunds.

153
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,040
Got it.

154
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,920
(Petchsak Academy)

155
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,120
Dad.

156
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,360
You made that promise with them.

157
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,280
Do you have a way to get the money?

158
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,160
Are you crazy?

159
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,600
You caused this mess, you fix it yourself.

160
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,080
What I said was just to protect my students.

161
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,120
But if I can’t get the money...

162
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,960
Sia Thep will kill me for sure.

163
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,600
What about the gym’s savings?

164
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,960
Can’t we use that first?

165
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
You still have that pickup truck, don’t you?

166
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,680
Sell it and use the money to pay off the debt.

167
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,280
But the truck’s necessary, Dad.

168
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,800
Thun has a car.

169
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,000
Borrow his for now.

170
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,720
But that’s my car!

171
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,600
Hey!

172
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,200
You decide.

173
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,760
Figure out how to pay the debt.

174
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,320
Grow up already.

175
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,720
Dad.

176
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,880
Shit!

177
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,440
What the hell is this?

178
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,920
Who did you transfer the money to?

179
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,000
Didn’t you say that money belonged to all of us?

180
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,520
What did you do with it?

181
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
You have secrets from us now?!

182
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,320
Huh?!

183
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,200
What are you even talking about?

184
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
And who told you to snoop through my phone?!

185
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,360
Then who did you send the money to?!

186
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,960
Answer me, Dad!

187
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,480
Do you have secrets from us?!

188
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,200
Answer me, Dad!

189
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,120
Dad!

190
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,880
Because of the way you are!

191
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
I’m an officer from the DSI.

192
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,520
Your son is involved in serious money laundering.

193
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,960
I’ve traced the related transactions.

194
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,200
I’m required to proceed with legal action.

195
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:57,000
If you and your son really didn’t do anything wrong, then just transfer the money to ONCB to have it checked for transparency.

196
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,200
Yeah, yeah… that’s just how my son is.

197
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
He didn’t mean to.

198
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,920
Let me handle this.

199
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,160
He’s still my son, too.

200
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,320
Here’s what we’ll do:

201
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,880
I’ll take responsibility and manage everything this time.

202
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,480
Just transfer the money into the account, and I’ll take care of the paperwork.

203
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,560
Alright, alright.

204
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,680
Hang on a second.

205
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,880
By the time I realized I’d been scammed, the money was already gone.

206
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,360
Are you crazy? You told me to sell my car because of this?

207
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,360
That means all our money is gone.

208
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,600
This is exactly why I…

209
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,200
Money laundering!

210
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Money laundering!

211
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,320
You never believed me, did you?

212
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,120
That I could actually make money from trading.

213
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,440
That’s why you believed those fucking bastards instead!

214
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,760
That I was laundering money!

215
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,400
What’s wrong with you, Dad?

216
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,120
How could you be so stupid to fall for a damn call center scam?

217
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,640
If it wasn’t for you,

218
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,520
we’d be paying back Sia Thep in no time.

219
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,720
Yeah, I’m an idiot.

220
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,240
An idiot just because it’s you.

221
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,480
Hey, calm down.

222
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,840
Uncle Petch believed them because he was worried about you.

223
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,200
You're an outsider! Fuck off!

224
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,240
Yeah!

225
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,720
Right. I’m an outsider.

226
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,040
What the fuck is wrong with you?

227
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,440
Why did you say such things like that to him?

228
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,440
What do you even know?

229
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,720
People have died because of scams like this.

230
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,280
or does it have to be his turn before you realize?

231
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Uncle Petch.

232
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,160
Are you okay, Keen?

233
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
It’s the irony, huh?

234
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,120
These scam calls just keep coming after me like a nightmare.

235
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:48,480
Back then, my mom got scammed and nearly lost everything.

236
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
She was so stressed

237
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,160
that she had a stroke.

238
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,240
My dad had to sell the house just to try to save her.

239
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,680
But in the end…

240
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
we couldn’t save her.

241
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,120
I get where Mawin is coming from.

242
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,800
As a child who’s been fooled by their parents.

243
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,520
But I’m also with Uncle Petch.

244
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,720
When it’s about someone you love,

245
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,080
we are all just idiots.

246
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,160
Having to go through this all over again

247
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,520
makes me feel like I can't control myself.

248
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,520
Ait.

249
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,920
I get how you feel.

250
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,040
But you're not carrying this alone.

251
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,800
Uncle Petch wanted to help.

252
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
Keen wanted to help.

253
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,920
And if there’s anything I can do, I want to help too.

254
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,840
But you can’t take all this on by yourself.

255
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,200
Still, after everything I said,

256
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
who’d still want to help me?

257
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,880
If you know you messed up, then go fix it.

258
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,160
You already know what you need to do, don’t you?

259
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
Right here?!

260
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,680
What are you doing?

261
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,080
Looking for a list of promoters.

262
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,760
Gonna ask them to get our fighters in the ring.

263
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,960
This one’s better, try calling the numbers in here.

264
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,080
Tell them I sent you.

265
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,960
How are you gonna get there? Want a ride?

266
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,320
Nah, I’ll have Thun take me.

267
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,880
I’ll go with you.

268
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,120
Come on, at least I’ve got more experience.

269
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,640
Better than sending you and Thun off on your own.

270
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,920
And… I’m sorry

271
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,040
for calling you an outsider the other day.

272
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,080
Honestly, it’s good you’re still butting in.

273
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,440
Man… getting Thun Tiger Taming Canon into a match like this…

274
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,200
Who’d dare match up with him?

275
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,280
Huh?

276
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,800
Even last time, despite the shady booking,

277
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,240
he still tore Typhoon apart.

278
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,920
No way.

279
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,400
If your guys really want to fight,

280
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,040
I’ll need a 30% cut as a commission.

281
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,680
I’ll find you a match right away.

282
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,040
That’s straight-up exploitation!

283
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,480
It’s interesting, but I’ll pass for now.

284
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,880
Unless you can find a sponsor.

285
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,680
They’re back!

286
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,600
Right?

287
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,760
Keen, Thun, come eat!

288
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,440
That look says it all.

289
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,720
No luck, huh?

290
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,600
Come eat first, guys.

291
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,960
Oh, don’t make that face.

292
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,920
Eat up so you’ve got strength.

293
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,600
Come on, Keen, sit here.

294
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,880
You too, Thun.

295
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,280
Pass me a plate, please.

296
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,640
How did it go with the promoters, bro?

297
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,320
I’m okay with fighting in smaller events, honestly.

298
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,040
Even if they lowball me.

299
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,600
At least we’ll get some cash coming in.

300
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,680
Man, if I had the money,

301
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,040
I’d just organize a fight night myself.

302
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,680
And I’d put all our fighters

303
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,680
in the ring.

304
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,680
Wouldn’t that be awesome?

305
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,000
You’re dreaming.

306
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,920
Wait, actually…

307
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,520
Why don’t we just organize it ourselves?

308
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,600
Are you crazy? Organizing a boxing event isn’t easy.

309
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,080
First of all, you need money.

310
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,920
And right now, the gym’s already in debt.

311
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,920
Right, Thun?

312
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,880
Yeah.

313
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,080
Bung’s right. To host a fight, you need connections.

314
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,640
And you’ll need at least 5–6 million baht.

315
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,640
Do you have that kind of cash?

316
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,840
I’ve got 200 baht, bro.

317
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,280
See? No one’s got the money.

318
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,600
Or are you gonna take out more loans

319
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,080
and sink the gym deeper into debt?

320
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Exactly. And even if we do it, there’s no guarantee it’ll make a profit.

321
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,280
If we lose money, that’d be even worse.

322
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,840
At first, I thought it sounded like a solid idea.

323
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,080
But after hearing all this,

324
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,080
it makes sense.

325
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,080
Come on, eat. Let’s just eat.

326
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,600
No more talk.

327
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,920
This one’s good, try this.

328
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,240
I like this one.

329
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,720
I saved it just for today.

330
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,400
Now you feel bad, huh?

331
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,640
I was saving that.

332
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,120
Hey, what’s wrong with you today?

333
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,640
You’re not eating?

334
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,160
I bought this just for you, bro.

335
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,320
I was worried you might have trouble chewing it.

336
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,480
Hurry or the food will be gone, bro.

337
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,480
Thun.

338
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,920
Why is everyone so against me?

339
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,400
Even though I'm just trying to fix things.

340
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,000
Because what you're trying to do is really difficult.

341
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,800
It’s something everyone in the industry knows.

342
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,720
So we’re just going to let it stay this way?

343
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,800
No one’s going to try to fix it?

344
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,520
Well, it is the truth.

345
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,720
But Thun, you're known on social media.

346
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,120
Your voice matters and can help fix this.

347
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,320
Keen

348
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
Where are you going?

349
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,200
I’m hungry.

350
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,480
Going to get something to eat.

351
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,960
I’ll come with you.

352
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,360
Don’t follow me.

353
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,160
Hey, what are you doing sitting here alone?

354
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,520
Wanna have a drink with me?

355
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,360
I’m fine, I just want to be alone.

356
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,360
Come on, don’t be like that.

357
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,360
Don’t play hard to get.

358
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,240
Let go.

359
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,200
Come on now.

360
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:28,920
Come, come.

361
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,440
Let go!

362
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,720
Ow!

363
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,280
What the hell’s your problem?

364
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,960
You punched me?

365
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,560
You little!

366
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,600
I think you’ve had too much to drink.

367
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,800
Who the hell asked you to butt in?

368
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,120
Ow!

369
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,320
You should go back to your friends.

370
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,520
Let’s not make this a bigger deal.

371
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,480
You.

372
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,000
I’ll remember this, you hear me?

373
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,480
Thank you so much.

374
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,640
Yeah.

375
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,440
One whiskey on the rocks, please.

376
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,800
Sure.

377
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
My name’s Yut.

378
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,520
Okay.

379
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,920
Why are you sitting here doing crosswords alone?

380
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,920
Mind if I take a look?

381
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:05,720
I just wanted somewhere to sit and do a crossword peacefully, that’s all.

382
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,120
You were pretty cool back there.

383
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,880
Are you a fighter or something?

384
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,120
I used to be a Muay Thai boxer.

385
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,280
I can tell when someone’s trained.

386
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,720
Can we not talk about Muay Thai for a bit?

387
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,720
I’m honestly sick of it.

388
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:48,160
Then what should we talk about?

389
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,960
Anything that’s not Muay Thai.

390
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,040
Alright… do you have a boyfriend?

391
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,320
A boyfriend?

392
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,720
He does.

393
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,880
Keen, let’s go.

394
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,840
Keen, huh?

395
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,520
Keen, let’s talk outside.

396
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,320
Let’s go clear things up first.

397
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
What are you doing, Keen?

398
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,560
That’s enough, Keen.

399
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,680
Is this what you want?

400
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,080
Didn’t you say you were hungry?

401
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,760
I am eating.

402
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,040
Nice weather, huh?

403
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,320
How do you know this place, Ait?

404
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,040
After work, I usually come eat around here.

405
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,880
Scouting for date spots or what?

406
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,720
Does your wound still hurt?

407
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,760
A little,

408
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,760
but it’s okay.

409
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:10,000
And about the debt, what are you going to do?

410
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,760
You know, Ait…

411
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,440
I know I messed up and need to find a way to pay it off.

412
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,080
But this pickup truck…

413
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,600
It’s my pride and joy.

414
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:01,480
Still, it’s money you earned yourself.

415
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,280
If you used it to fix the problem you caused,

416
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,120
I think it’d be way cooler.

417
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,880
You’re probably the only one who cares about me like this, Ait.

418
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,600
Ow!

419
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,080
Sorry.

420
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,440
I didn’t mean to.

421
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,440
It’s okay.

422
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,160
Right here?

423
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,480
You don’t like it?

424
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,400
I do.

425
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,040
Hold on a sec.

426
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,840
I really have to take this call.

427
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,720
I’ll be right back.

428
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,440
I’m sorry I ran off to the bar.

429
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,280
It’s okay.

430
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:34,600
I probably made you feel uncomfortable, didn’t I?

431
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,520
I really want to help the gym.

432
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,800
But I know no one listens to me.

433
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:56,160
You, though—people believe you when you speak.

434
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,080
Why won’t you speak up for me?

435
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:14,680
I’m sorry, Keen, for making you feel that way.

436
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:42,400
From now on, I’ll trust and support you.

437
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,320
Thanks, Thun.

438
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,560
Feeling better now?

439
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,920
Then…

440
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,920
How about we go for round three?

441
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,520
So, what’s our plan?

442
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,400
I still believe we should go with organizing our own tournament.

443
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,640
I know it’s hard, but it’s our only shot at saving the gym.

444
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:08,640
I’ll need everyone’s cooperation.

445
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,880
You’re still going on about that?

446
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,200
We already talked about this.

447
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,280
But I agree with Keen.

448
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,920
We’ve got to try something.

449
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,920
It’s better than doing nothing.

450
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,800
If you need anything, just let me know.

451
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,800
I’ve got your back.

452
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,920
I just want everyone to look for possibilities, not just problems.

453
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,880
If we can really make the tournament happen,

454
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:47,440
it could be a great chance

455
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,800
to restore the gym’s reputation.

456
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,440
But where are we gonna get the money?

457
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,680
It’s going to be a lot of money.

458
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,840
Maybe we can go find some sponsors to support part of it first.

459
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,200
Keen

460
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,680
Keen, do you know MP Phuwish?

461
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,520
MP Phuwish?

462
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,120
The name sounds familiar,

463
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,200
but I can’t quite place it.

464
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:29,480
He’s a politician known for promoting Muay Thai.

465
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,760
Maybe you could reach out and ask him to support us.

466
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,960
But what if we still can’t raise the money?

467
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,440
What are we going to do then?

468
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,440
Won’t it all be a waste of time?

469
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,600
I think we need a backup plan.

470
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,400
It’s alright.

471
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,080
I still have some valuable amulets.

472
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,280
I’ll go sell them.

473
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,240
Those alone won’t be enough to cover everything.

474
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,160
I’ll sell my truck too.

475
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,840
Once everything’s settled, I can buy a new one when I have the money.

476
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,680
Let’s not jump too far ahead, everyone.

477
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,240
I’ll hurry back and put together a proposal for MP Phuwish.

478
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,440
As for selling our stuff, let’s take a breath before making that call.

479
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,680
Sure.

480
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,120
The answer we’re looking for might be easier than we think…

481
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,400
If we just open our heart.

482
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:11,240
The answer we’re looking for might be easier than we think if we open our heart.

483
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,200
(Ait, come here.)

484
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,440
Ait.
Where are you going, Mai?

485
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,520
Come play with us.

486
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,600
Let’s shoot a video.

487
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,840
Have you seen superhero fights before?

488
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,360
Huh?

489
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,720
Like superheroes fighting each other.

490
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,360
You can be the hero and fight me.

491
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,360
How do we fight?

492
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:49,040
Earth, water, wind, fire.

493
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:49,840
Uhh…

494
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,440
Hey, Ait, take it seriously!

495
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,560
Do I have to get hurt for real?

496
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,400
Just pretend you’re a superhero.

497
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,680
Be whoever you want.

498
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:01,360
I’ll use earth, water, wind, and fire.

499
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,040
Ow! Like this?

500
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,560
(Hot, hot!)

501
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,120
(Come on, come at me!)
How’s it going, Keen?

502
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,640
(Not yet!)

503
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,480
(Not yet?)
Just a sec.

504
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,400
Oh right, the sword too!

505
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,120
Let’s go!

506
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,560
(Hey!)

507
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,280
I’ve got an idea.

508
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:22,800
(Is he dead yet?)

509
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,280
(Not yet!)

510
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,440
(Come again, bro!)

511
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,800
(Yeah, yeah!)

512
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:47,960
(Thai’s Prestige Party)

513
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,520
Who are you here to see?

514
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,360
I’m here to see MP Phuwish.

515
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,880
Do you have an appointment?

516
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:11,440
I tried to, but he seems to always be busy.

517
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,880
Can I please have just ten minutes with him?

518
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,880
If you don’t have a confirmed appointment, I can’t let you in.

519
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,800
He’s extremely busy right now.

520
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,000
Who is it?

521
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,840
Hello, sir.

522
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,480
These two would like to see you.

523
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,880
Sure.

524
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,720
Oh, Tiger Taming Cannon himself.

525
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,960
So that is our gym’s current situation.

526
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,600
Sounds like you’re really struggling.

527
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,080
What do you want me to help with?

528
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:10,280
Sir, I’d like to ask for your financial support to hold a fight event for our gym.

529
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,880
Please don’t use honorifics.

530
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,720
We're the same.

531
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,000
Just call me Mr.

532
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,280
Alright, Mr.Phuwish.

533
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,840
Like I said,

534
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,720
Petchsak Academy is a long-standing and respected gym.

535
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:34,280
I believe if we host this event, it’ll really bring some energy back to Muay Thai.

536
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,920
You’re planning to be a promoter yourself?

537
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:43,200
There are fewer than ten in the whole country.

538
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,280
Even if Thun’s backing you,

539
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,160
it won’t be easy.

540
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,600
If this were a regular match,

541
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,520
I wouldn’t bother being the promoter.

542
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:00,200
But the event I’m proposing isn’t traditional.

543
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:05,120
I’m turning it into sports entertainment to attract a new audience.

544
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:19,160
The concept is Hero vs Villain as the main theme.

545
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:23,320
Please take a look at the details in the proposal.

546
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,360
Interesting.

547
00:59:54,120 --> 01:00:02,360
I’ll agree to sponsor you.

548
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,840
Out of respect for your effort.

549
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,840
But...

550
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:20,800
I want one specific fighter to return to the ring.

551
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:33,480
If you can bring him back to fight,

552
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:39,320
I’ll fully support your event.

553
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,720
Are you serious?

554
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,440
You’re really going to come see him here,?

555
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,720
Of course.

556
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,760
We’re already here in front of the foundation.

557
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,240
We have to do this for the gym.

558
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,200
We agreed, didn’t we?

559
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,280
Yeah.

560
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,440
I’m…

561
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,040
I’m really sorry.

562
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:08,440
I’ve quit fighting.

563
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,120
I promised myself

564
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:15,920
I wouldn’t use my strength to hurt anyone again.

565
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,800
But I really want you to come back and fight, Yut.

566
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,280
Right now, I just want to dedicate

567
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,840
my life to the foundation.

568
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,360
I want to help the kids.

569
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,000
But if you fight,

570
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,080
You’ll get financial support from MP Phuwish.

571
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:42,240
That money could help a lot of kids.

572
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,760
I think it’s a win-win for both of us.

573
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,200
I misjudged you, Keen.

574
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:56,160
At first, I thought you were just cute but turns out you’re smart too.

575
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,720
Well, now it’s starting to sound interesting.

576
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:01,040
The kids would be happy to get that support.

577
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,720
Yes.

578
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:25,000
In your eyes, I must be the hero, right Keen?

579
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,800
But in that case… who’s going to be my villain?

580
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,160
Tiger Taming Cannon?

581
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,920
Sounds like a great villain for me.

582
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,600
I’m really looking forward to it.

583
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,720
Uh.. How about we tweak the title a bit?

584
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:09,280
Instead of Hero vs Villain, let’s make it Hero vs Hero.

585
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,200
That way, no one has to be the villain,

586
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,440
And both of us can feel comfortable.

587
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,520
Sure.

588
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,000
But before I agree,

589
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,280
There’s somewhere I’d like to take you first.

590
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,720
Come! Let's go home!

591
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:36,720
Wait a second.

592
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,440
You don’t have to do it anymore.

593
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,520
Hey.

594
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,440
Sit down.

595
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,800
Let's go back.

596
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,000
So where do you want me to go, Yut?

597
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:04,120
Yay!

598
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,400
Do you all want to draw? Is everyone ready to draw today?

599
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,560
Ready!

600
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,440
You’ve got to be louder than that if you’re ready.

601
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,320
Ready!

602
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:14,400
Very good! Let’s go, let’s draw.

603
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,720
I’ll open the paint for you.

604
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,280
This one here.

605
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,880
Whose is this?

606
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,920
Whoever grabs it first gets it.

607
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,360
Alright, keep drawing, I’ll be back.

608
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,680
Santa will come down on Christmas Day.

609
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,080
How are you doing, Keen?

610
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,120
Oh?
Having fun?

611
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:45,560
Lots of fun, the kids are all super sweet.

612
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,560
I usually come here every week.

613
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,760
To visit the kids, since they get lonely.

614
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,360
I try to come and do activities with them.

615
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,920
That’s great.

616
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,120
The kids are very sweet.

617
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,440
If you like them, I’m happy.

618
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,360
Keaw, is Yut nice?

619
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,200
Is he nice?

620
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,440
He’s kind of nice.

621
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,000
Oops.

622
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,080
No ice cream for you then.

623
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,480
He’s nice!

624
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,960
See, you said it fast now.

625
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,640
Was it fun playing with P’Keen?

626
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,360
Yes! I want him to come again.

627
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,960
Oh! You want Keen to come again?

628
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,960
Then we’ll have to ask him.

629
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:12,960
Keen, would you like to come back again?

630
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,240
Only if Yut invites me.

631
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,720
Then I'll come.

632
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,640
Wow, you even know how to draw shadows now.

633
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,560
Hey.

634
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:30,480
Is my drawing pretty?

635
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,720
Hey!

636
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,760
Um... it’s pretty.

637
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,000
Can you pay more attention to our group?

638
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,160
Look at the others.

639
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,520
Color it in, just drawing like that won’t look nice.

640
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,200
Has everyone finished their dream house drawing?

641
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,200
Finished!

642
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:49,920
Show us, let’s see!

643
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,400
Show it to us.

644
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,600
Show it to me.
Quick, quick!

645
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:55,000
Wow, that’s a huge house. There’s a car too?

646
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,320
There’s a bicycle as well!

647
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,760
Whoa, that one’s in the middle of the mountains.

648
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,440
Everyone, give yourselves a round of applause!

649
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,240
Well done!

650
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:07,280
Everyone, did you know I have a special surprise for you today?

651
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,400
Sound good?

652
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,480
Whoa!

653
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,400
Excited?

654
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,600
Excited!

655
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,360
Today’s surprise is…

656
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,600
Someone will sing a song for all of us.

657
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,520
Hoo!

658
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,800
That someone is… Keen!

659
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:23,400
Yay!

660
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,720
Do you all want to hear Keen sing?

661
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:25,760
Do you?

662
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,880
Yes!

663
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,360
Cheer for him!

664
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:39,040
Keen!

665
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,680
Will I survive this…
Please help me out.

666
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,000
The kids really want to see you.

667
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,320
Alright.

668
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,800
Okay, everyone clap!

669
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,240
Let’s clap!

670
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,560
Well done!

671
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:18,360
♫ Every time I see you, you’re still the same one ♫

672
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:24,400
♫ Always messing with my heart, making it a mess every day ♫

673
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:30,320
♫ Can I be the one to stay ♫

674
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:39,600
♫ With you every day and night, with only me, is that okay ♫

675
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,680
♫ Let every night be filled with me in your dreams ♫

676
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:47,720
♫ The only one I see in mine is you ♫

677
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:52,880
♫ Come say hi, let’s see each other every day ♫

678
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:59,080
♫ Wouldn’t it be nice? What do you say? Will be a good night ♫

679
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,040
How was it?

680
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,640
It's was so good.

681
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,880
Was that cute, everyone? Was it good?

682
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,800
Was it okay?
So cute!

683
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,160
Keen, are you and Yut dating?

684
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:16,280
No way, Keen doesn’t even have a boyfriend!

685
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:19,160
But you two are way too cute.

686
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,840
You must be dating.

687
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,600
If Keen’s going to date someone, it should be Thun!

688
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,920
Thun has a much better personality.

689
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:33,160
But Keen and Yut look like a couple.

690
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,800
Uh…

691
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,440
Do we really look like a couple?

692
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,320
You do.

693
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,160
You don’t!

694
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,080
You do.

695
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,080
You don’t!

696
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:40,560
You do.

697
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,400
You don’t!

698
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,680
I said you do.

699
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,000
I said we don’t!

700
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,200
To clear it up, Yut and I aren’t dating.

701
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,800
See? Told you!

702
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,400
That is my boyfriend.

703
01:09:54,360 --> 01:10:00,120
Oh!

704
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:24,480
So you’ve agreed to fight now?

705
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,280
Yes.

706
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,520
I’m going to fight.

707
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,400
I’ve got a purpose now.

708
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,400
Hmm.

709
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,920
Excellent.

710
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,440
Great then.

711
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,080
Don’t worry about the money.

712
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,320
I’ll take care of it.

713
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,920
Thank you.

714
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,360
This amulet looks pretty good.

715
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:34,840
Yeah.

716
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,200
But…

717
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,280
Alright, as a friend

718
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,040
I can’t go over 500,000 baht.

719
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,920
If it’s more than that, I can’t do it.

720
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,560
Only 500,000, sir?

721
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:45,920
Yeah.

722
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,280
That’s my max.

723
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,600
The car’s in good condition, though.

724
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:59,320
How about 480,000?

725
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,640
480,000?

726
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:05,560
Yeah, that’s about the market price.

727
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:09,160
Please, 480,000—just help me out.

728
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,200
Sell it to me since I came all the way here.

729
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,600
Everyone!

730
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,560
Uncle Petch!

731
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,560
Uncle Petch!

732
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,800
P’Keen just called! He got a sponsor!

733
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,080
What? For real?

734
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,400
Yes, Uncle Petch.

735
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,080
In that case, forget it.

736
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,280
I won’t sell it just yet.

737
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,360
Maybe next time.

738
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:43,760
Come on, let me have the amulet back.

739
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,760
600,000 then.

740
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,400
Never mind.

741
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,680
P’Mawin, P’Keen just called!

742
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,440
He got a sponsor!

743
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:55,760
Then it’s okay, maybe next time.

744
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,840
I won’t sell today.

745
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,280
You can go now.

746
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,880
You sure? No changing your mind?

747
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:00,520
It’s fine.

748
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,920
I’m not selling.

749
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,120
Go ahead.

750
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,120
Go on.

751
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,840
Bye-bye!

752
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,520
Yes!

753
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,280
My beloved baby!

754
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,960
My dearest one..

755
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,800
Back at the hospital.

756
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,800
If I hadn’t been there,

757
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,920
What would you have done?

758
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,800
Are you jealous?

759
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,360
Thun, are you jealous of Keen?

760
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,160
What are you even doing?

761
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,760
I'm not Keen!

762
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:39,560
If you're jealous, then just tell me

763
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:44,840
what do you want me to do so you'll stop being mad?

764
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:50,160
What do you want?

765
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:08,760
I want to do it like that night.

766
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:18,400
If we do it like that night, will you stop being mad?

767
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:33,360
Then tonight, see you.

768
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:03,320
Hold on, bro. I really have to take this call.

769
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,040
(Tell that Keen guy to go ask MP Phuwish for money.)

770
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:19,000
(He’ll definitely give it.)

771
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,080
Why does it have to be MP Phuwish, boss?

772
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:26,720
(MP Phuwish, I'm going to make him sink.)

773
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,720
Alright.

774
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:31,760
I’ll be watching.

775
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,960
Keen, you're amazing.

776
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:32,800
I didn’t expect this to really happen.

777
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,720
From now on, I won’t be fighting for myself or for Keen anymore.

778
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,080
Thun will be doing it for us.

779
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,880
I will always be by your side.

780
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,360
Let’s head to your room.

781
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,040
Isn’t Mai in the room?

782
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,480
Then let’s go to the office.

783
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,400
What should we do, Keen?

784
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:48,800
A thousand seats, and less than two weeks—can we sell them all?

785
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,960
My fans are mostly younger. They don’t even know who I am.

786
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,240
Honestly, we should be able to sell more than this.

787
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,240
Let’s do it. If the buzz picks up,

788
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,840
we could sell a lot more tickets.
