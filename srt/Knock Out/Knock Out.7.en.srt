00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:28,080
This series is a work of fiction.
It is not related to any real persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,360
A thousand seats with less than two weeks to go...

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,800
Do you think it’ll sell out?

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,480
Honestly, we should’ve sold way more tickets by now.

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,360
Do it, so we can sell more tickets.

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,320
Oh!

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,200
What’s wrong with you?

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,840
What are you even doing?

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,400
Why can’t you control your emotions?

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,120
Maybe it’s not just about the ticket sales anymore?

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,920
Curious, aren’t you?

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,440
And here they are! The lineup of fighters for this upcoming Hero Fight!

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,600
We’re finally getting to host the event!

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,040
Yay!

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,560
I will always be your real match.

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
Can you watch camera B for me?

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,600
We’ll be letting the audience into the arena in five minutes.

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,800
Oh, okay.

19
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,840
Also, can you play track one?

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,680
We’ll bring the logo up right after.

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,040
Test! One, two.

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,800
One, two, three, four.

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,600
One, two.

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,800
One, two, three.

25
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,240
One, two.

26
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,200
I’m gonna go use the restroom real quick.

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,800
Oh, sure.

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,360
Let’s go.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, Thun?

30
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
I never thought this day would come.

31
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,600
Me and boxing always seemed so far apart.

32
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,240
But look at me now.

33
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,840
Yeah.

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,520
And now you even have a boxer for a boyfriend.

35
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,440
You’ve done such a great job, Keen.

36
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,800
Getting this many people to show up.

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,000
They’re all here to see you fight, Thun.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,480
Are you nervous at all?

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Nah, I’m good.

40
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,480
Well...

41
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,760
Um...

42
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,240
You should head to the prep room, Thun.

43
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,160
You’ve gotta get ready to fight.

44
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,680
Yeah.

45
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,160
Okay.

46
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,760
I’m sorry for interrupting.

47
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
I didn’t realize someone was in here.

48
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,320
Most of the rooms here are soundproof.

49
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,160
I’ll excuse myself now.

50
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,160
Okay.

51
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Evidence

52
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,080
Greetings!

53
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,320
Woo!

54
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,560

Woo!

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,200
Good!

64
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,080
Block!

65
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,920
Come on, jabs.

66
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,680
Ait!

67
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,400
Ait, get up.
Are you ok?

68
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,520
Get up.

69
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
Bung, get up.

70
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,080
Quick, Bung.

71
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,800
Bung! Go hard!

72
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,000
Are you ok?

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,760
Calm down, Ait.

74
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,120
Quickly, get the chair up.

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Sit down.

76
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,440
Ait, are you ok?

77
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,720
Bung, get up.

78
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,000
Just a bit more.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Ait? Can you hear me?

80
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,600
I'm cheering you on.

81
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,080
Get up.

82
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,640
Round Two, mentors out.

83
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,520
Hey, fight on!
Come on, fight!

84
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,680
Hang in there, Ait. Stay strong.

85
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,440
Ait…

86
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
I love you, Ait.

87
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Let’s go, Bung!

88
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,560
Bung, you got this!

89
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,840
Come on!

90
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,400
Hurry, mentors out.

91
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,880
Fighters in!

92
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,600
Go, Ait!

93
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,360
Fight, fight!

94
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,080
Let’s go!

95
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,800
Fight!

96
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,320
Punch him!

97
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,800
Yeah, like that!

98
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Push in!

99
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,440
Yeah!!

100
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,360
Great job, Bung!

101
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,280
Well done, Ait!

102
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,040
Your fighters are all amazing.

103
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,080
Thank you.

104
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,560
Camera B, get a shot of the red corner, please.

105
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,160
Okay.

106
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Tighten up on camera B.

107
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,800
Okay, switch that feed, please.

108
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,880
Sure.

109
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,720
Uh, can I borrow the schedule for a second?

110
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,920
Oh, of course.

111
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,600
Come on.

112
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,840
Yep, right here.

113
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,160
Woo, let’s go!

114
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,880
This camera, please?

115
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,560
This too.

116
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,280
One more shot, please.

117
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,480
Nice, push in a bit.

118
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,240
Good, good.

119
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,800
Smile for the camera!

120
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,400
Don’t just smile for Keen, okay?

121
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
Quick!

122
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,040
This way!

123
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,440
Yes.

124
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,600
Blue corner, blue corner!
Red corner!

125
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,120
Ait!
Red!

126
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:14,680
Red!

127
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:20,560
Blue!

128
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,880
Yeah!

129
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,160
Well done!

130
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
So proud of you!

131
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,200
Congratulations, Ait! You did great.

132
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,320
Thank you.

133
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,400
Thank you, Coach.

134
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,440
Ait, someone’s calling you.

135
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,760
They said it’s urgent.

136
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,200
You better pick up now!

137
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,280
What?!

138
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,280
Ait?!

139
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Who was that?

140
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,800
Hey!

141
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,560
Why are you here?

142
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,240
Skipped work?

143
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,920
I got suspended from the station,

144
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,760
so I’ve got a little time off.

145
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,800
What trouble did you get into this time?

146
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,440
The case about that loan shark Muay

147
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,480
who got mauled to death by a big dog.

148
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,000
Mauled by a dog?

149
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah.

150
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,600
Doesn’t it seem kinda weird?

151
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,360
Get ready you’re up in five minutes.

152
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,120
You can take him, no need to be scared or rattled.

153
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,000
Stay calm when you fight, okay?

154
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yes, Coach.

155
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,080
In the first round, just feel him out. Don’t rush it.

156
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,000
Ready?

157
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,960
Let’s go.

158
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,680
And now, ladies and gentlemen, introducing first

159
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,960
Fighting in the red corner

160
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,840
He is a rescue hero and a fierce fighter.

161
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,080
Let’s give it up for…

162
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,760
Lord of the Martial World

163
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,920
Woooo!

164
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,720
And he is opponent fighting in the blue corner.

165
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,840
He is a handsome hero and a fan favorite known as..

166
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:07,080
The Heartless Left Hook!

167
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,680
Representing Petchsak Academy—

168
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:16,520
Please welcome… THUN, TIGER TAMING CANON!

169
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
Woooo!

170
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,560
Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to Hero Fight!

171
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,520
We’re here for the final match of the night,

172
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,400
a historic bout between Thun, the Tiger Taming Canon,

173
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
and Lord of the Martial World

174
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,800
Here we are for the round number one of action.

175
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,400
Thun, the Tiger Taming Canon!

176
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,640
Woooo!

177
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,880
Taking on the strongest,

178
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,080
Lord of the Martial World

179
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,280
Round One!

180
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Let’s go, Thun! Go!

181
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,080
I remember Thun’s last match vividly.

182
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,400
His form was top-notch.

183
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,920
Don’t forget your guard!

184
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,720
Charge in, Thun!

185
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,520
Go, Thun!

186
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,600
Come on, throw the right!

187
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,480
Keep your guard up!

188
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,120
Use your legs too!

189
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,720
Use your legs!

190
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,640
Why does Thun look off?

191
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,360
Why is he fighting like that?

192
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,600
I have no idea.

193
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,960
What's wrong with him?

194
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,080
Right?

195
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,040
Keep your guard up!

196
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,040
That’s it, son, good!
Hit him! Hit him!

197
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Don’t drop your guard!

198
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,840
Yut’s punches are seriously heavy.

199
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,160
Looks like the Cannon might not make it through this.

200
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,000
With that kind of form, Thun can still hold his own.

201
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,280
Hey! Thun!

202
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,200
Thun!!

203
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,600
Thun, get up!

204
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,320
Thun!

205
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,680
Can you hear me?

206
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Thun, get up!!

207
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,640
Get up, Thun! Hurry!

208
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,280
Thun!

209
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,840
Come on!

210
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,000
Fight!

211
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,280
Thun!!

212
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
Thun!

213
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,080
Call the medic now, please.

214
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,600
Yes, sir.

215
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,960
Thun!

216
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,040
Thun, are you okay?!

217
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,280
Thun!
Thun, get up!

218
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,560
Can you hear me?!

219
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,760
Thun! Get up!
What’s wrong with him?

220
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,960
Thun!

221
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,880
One… two… three…

222
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,120
Four… five… six…

223
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,280
Thun!!

224
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,240
Seven…
Thun!!

225
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,760
Thun!

226
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,280
Eight!

227
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
Medic!!

228
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,200
What the hell happened?

229
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,560
Damn it. How did he get knocked out like that?

230
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,200
Thun!

231
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Thun!

232
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,840
Thun!

233
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,320
Thun!

234
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,400
Can you hear me?

235
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,920
Hurry, medics!

236
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,160
Watch his head!

237
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Thun.
Focus, stay with us!

238
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,200
Watch his head!

239
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,840
Get him out.
You’re okay.

240
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,680
Thun!

241
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,200
What happened?

242
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Hey, was he drugged or something?

243
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,520
Probably.
Sounds like it.

244
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,960
What the hell…

245
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,560
Who organized this event?!
He was drugged, right?!

246
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,560
Come out and take responsibility!

247
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,680
Fucking hell.

248
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
Just moments ago,

249
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,480
a well-known boxer known as Tiger Taming Cannon

250
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,000
or Thun Sukkasem,

251
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,360
collapsed in the ring only minutes into the match.

252
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,560
There’s speculation that he may have been drugged with a diuretic.

253
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,360
We will keep updating you as the situation develops.

254
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,680
What kind of damn event is this? A boxer got drugged!
Who’s taking responsibility for this?!

255
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,880
Who even organized this thing?!

256
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,200
Shut it down.

257
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,880
Shut it all down!

258
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,920
With things like this, it’s doomed to fail.

259
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Phuwish.

260
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,760
Keen, how are things?

261
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Thun’s safe now.

262
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,920
But I really have to apologize for the negligence.

263
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,320
Though I assure you, my team checked every single bottle of water.

264
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,840
Alright, I'm having the police are looking into it now.

265
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
I truly am sorry.

266
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,000
Hello.

267
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,920
Hey there.

268
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Don’t beat yourself up over it, Keen.

269
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,120
Don’t beat yourself up over it, Keen.

270
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,240
I haven’t seen something like this in over ten years.

271
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,840
Good thing Thun’s in such good shape.

272
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
That’s why he’s not seriously hurt.

273
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,240
Still it really was my fault.

274
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,160
If I hadn’t slipped up, Thun wouldn’t have..

275
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,680
Don’t overthink it.

276
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,480
You did your best.

277
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Then I’ll stay and look after Thun tonight.

278
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,280
Good, but don’t forget to rest yourself, alright?

279
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
We can’t have you falling too.

280
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,160
Yes, sir.

281
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,840
I’ll be heading off then.

282
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
Take care, Coach.

283
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,760
Thun!

284
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,400
Ow!

285
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,000
Sorry, did that hurt?

286
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,280
Where does it hurt?

287
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
Does it hurt a lot?

288
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,640
Are you messing with me?

289
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,800
Do you know how worried I've been?

290
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,000
Aww, I’m sorry…

291
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I’m all better now.

292
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,600
You like teasing, huh?

293
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,200
So…

294
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
How’s work going?

295
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,040
Worry about yourself first.

296
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,400
Do you even realize you were drugged with a diuretic, Thun?

297
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,880
They still haven’t found who did it.

298
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,440
I’m sorr-

299
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,120
I knew you were going to say that.

300
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,400
You didn’t do anything wrong, Keen.

301
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,640
What happened to your hand?

302
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
Paper cut.

303
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,680
Does it hurt?

304
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,080
It doesn’t anymore.

305
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,080
(Petchsak Academy Gym)

306
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,640
Many believe the boxer being drugged this time

307
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,040
was part of a scheme to discredit MP Phuwish, orchestrated by the top promoter,

308
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,520
Pakorn, who's likely unhappy with recent Muay Thai reform policies.

309
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,760
This act may have sealed the coffin

310
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,560
for the rising new promoter from Petchsak Academy.

311
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,920
“For what I’ve said on the ring”

312
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,440
“If that’s made you uncomfortable”

313
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,760
“I’m really sorry.”

314
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
I love you, Ait.

315
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,560
“Where are you?”

316
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,720
What happened was something no one wanted.

317
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,080
Our Tiger Taming Cannon is now recovering,

318
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,640
and there’s nothing to worry about.

319
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,640
So… let us ask you this

320
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,080
how do you feel about the event being a bit of a flop?

321
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,960
Well, no one’s happy about it.

322
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,520
And no one wanted it to go this way.

323
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,760
But I believe people make mistakes.

324
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,480
That said, I want to commend promoter Keen.

325
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,880
He really modernized this event

326
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,440
and helped it reach a broader audience.

327
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,960
Will we get to see Yut fight again?

328
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,000
As for the damages,

329
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,320
we’re working hard to fix everything.

330
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,040
Don’t believe them!

331
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,680
We’ve refunded some of the audience...

332
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,360
These bastards are cheating us!
Hey!

333
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,960
Let me go, damn it!

334
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,000
These fuckers are screwing over the people!

335
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,960
Let go of me!

336
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,160
I said LET GO!
Why are they doing this?!

337
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,360
Let me go!

338
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,280
Hey, let go!

339
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,120
Let go!

340
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,760
Do you believe him?

341
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,800
You really trust him, huh?!

342
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,680
He is corrupted!

343
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,960
LET GO!

344
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,400
LET ME GO!

345
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,000
Let him go.

346
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,760
He’s a victim.

347
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,680
Let him go.

348
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,800
I must apologize to you.

349
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,200
I’m truly sorry for the mismanagement of this event.

350
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,960
And I promise you that

351
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,360
next time, it won’t be like this.

352
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,720
I’m sorry.

353
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,440
Please let him go.

354
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,840
It’s okay.

355
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,560
You can actually eat by yourself, no?

356
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,720
I know.

357
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
But I want you to feed me.

358
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,360
Okay.

359
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,360
You want me to feed you?

360
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,360
Keen!

361
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,360
You want me to feed you~

362
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,640
Keen…

363
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Is there anything you want to say?

364
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,200
They totally scammed everyone!
We’ve refunded some of the audience...

365
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,480
Hey!

366
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,160
Let go!

367
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,040
These fuckers are screwing over the people!

368
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,240
Let go!

369
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,880
I said let go!
Why are they doing this?!

370
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,480
Let him go.

371
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,000
He’s a victim.

372
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,440
I truly apologize.

373
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,160
And I promise you,

374
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,080
it won’t happen again.

375
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Excuse me,

376
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,640
I need to check the patient’s blood pressure.

377
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,320
Alright.

378
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,160
Thun, I’ll let you eat by yourself now.

379
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,840
What?

380
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,480
I’m gonna take a shower and buy you some snacks.

381
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,480
Okay.

382
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,840
Alright, be back soon.

383
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,600
Follow me, it’s a bit messy down the way.

384
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,240
Right here, this is where it happened.

385
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,520
I really needed to pee,

386
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,960
so I stopped by to relieve myself.

387
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,280
And ended up stumbling across a corpse.

388
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,640
Still gives me chills just talking about it.

389
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,080
It's still vivid in my mind.

390
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:35,840
June 21, 2025, 10:05 AM.

391
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,040
This is the crime scene where Muay's body was found.

392
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,800
She was mauled to death by a large dog,

393
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,080
was found near Saeree Rak Market.

394
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,480
The crime scene is clean,

395
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,000
no indication of dog footprints or any signs of a dog had been here,

396
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,400
like feces or fur.

397
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:09,120
All is found were bloodstains and tire tracks near the body.

398
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,520
To be honest

399
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,760
it’s hard to believe a dog around here could kill someone.

400
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Oh? Back already, Keen?

401
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,640
Uncle, may I borrow a broom?

402
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,720
What are you doing here?

403
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
Oh, Keen?

404
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,200
Oh?

405
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,880
Well, we meet again.

406
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,440
Hello.

407
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,800
Hi.

408
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
I’m sorry.

409
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,960
Sorry for what?

410
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,400
For causing you trouble.

411
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,800
Oh, no worries at all, Keen.

412
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,240
It was nothing.

413
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,680
So, how’s Thun doing?

414
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,600
He’s getting better.

415
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,480
The doctor said he can be discharged once the IV fluids are done.

416
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,760
That’s good to hear.

417
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,400
Here, take this.

418
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:33,960
Let me.

419
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,040
I'll go myself.

420
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,280
Are you sure?

421
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,080
It’s fine.

422
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,080
Alright.

423
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,040
(Victory always comes with wounds.)

424
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
(Everything...)

425
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,240
Please.

426
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,640
Go ahead.

427
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,080
Hello?

428
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,440
I think Muay’s death and your father’s

429
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,640
might’ve been a murde-

430
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,040
Hello?

431
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,320
What did you just say?

432
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,440
I’ve got bad signal.

433
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,560
Hello?

434
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,840
Hello?

435
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,800
Hey?

436
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,920
What did you say?

437
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,680
Keen...

438
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,120
Hello?

439
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,760
Sorry...

440
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,200
Hello??

441
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,960
I can’t hear..

442
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,000
Hello?

443
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,200
Can you hear me?

444
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,280
Yeah, I just got out of the elevator.

445
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,760
Hello? Can you hear me?

446
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,120
I hear you now.

447
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,640
So, I came to check out the scene where Muay’s body was found.

448
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,360
And honestly, this case is starting

449
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,200
to feel a lot like your father’s.

450
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,720
What do you mean?

451
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:48,200
I think Muay and your father

452
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,960
were killed by the same person.

453
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,760
(And based on the evidence I have right now...)

454
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,320
About the score tampering...

455
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,040
It was you this time too, wasn’t it?

456
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,480
You think I drugged you?

457
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,920
(I think that...)
You don’t know anything.

458
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,200
But you’re still my son!

459
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,680
Pakorn is the murderer.

460
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,400
What happened here?

461
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
Why is this room trashed like this?

462
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,960
Ait’s gone.

463
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,960
Did Ait do this?

464
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,320
If you don’t want to die, stay put!!

465
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,560
You don’t have to answer right away.

466
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,120
Talk it over first.

467
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,720
I know who drugged Thun.

468
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,360
Have you seen this pin before?

469
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,000
Looks like it belongs to some secret organization.
