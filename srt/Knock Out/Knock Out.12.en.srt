21
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,920

I love you too.

49
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,560
You’ve got this.

50
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
No glove touching.

51
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,560
Everyone understand? Go!
Understood.

52
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,880
Understood.

53
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,360
Woo!

54
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,400
Typhoon!

55
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Good luck, I'm rooting for you.

56
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,680
Come on, fighters.

57
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,600
This is round one. Go all out.

58
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,640
Round one, ready?

59
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
Fight!

60
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,440
Keep your guard up!

61
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,640
Go, go!

62
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,280
Fight!

63
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Go Thun!

64
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Break!

65
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,320
Ready? Fight!

66
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,280
Your punches have gotten heavier, Typhoon.

67
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,320
Back then, if I landed that punch, you would’ve hit the floor.

68
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,840
Let me tell you something.

69
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,440
I didn't take any drugs today.

70
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,720
I wanted to fight you fair and square, settle it all today.

71
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,560
I know, that's what I also want.

72
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,840
After I lost to you that day, I went back and trained harder than ever.

73
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,320
I told you, I have to be number one.

74
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,760
And I’m sorry.

75
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,240
I never really understood you back then.

76
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,160
But now… I get you.

77
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,240
Let’s go, Thun!
Punch him!

78
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,040
You got this!

79
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,080
Thun!

80
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,680
Thun!

81
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,080
Hey! Thun, get up!

82
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,600
Thun, get up!
Thun! Get up!

83
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,400
Get up!
Get up!

84
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,800
Thun!

85
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,560
Get up!
Thun! Get up!

86
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,880
Shit, Thun!

87
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,680
Thun, get up!

88
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,720
Get up!

89
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,640
Kid, don’t give in! Stand up and fight!

90
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,080
Hurry, go!
Get up!

91
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,680
Hurry, go!

92
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,360
Thun, stay focused!

93
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,320
Thun!

94
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,000
Get up, son.

95
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Get up!

96
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
Keep on fighting, Thun!

97
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,520
I'm glad Keen brought you to fight me today.

98
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,800
I have to thank Keen too.

99
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,880
Because I have something I want to tell you.

100
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,440
Let's be friends again, Typhoon.

101
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,120
Yeah bro, I've been waiting for you. Come on, Thun.

102
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,920
Thun! Get up!

103
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,160
Thun! Get up!

104
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,240
Keep on fighting, Thun!

105
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,600
You got this!

106
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,560
Quickly, Thun!

107
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,760
Thun, get up!

108
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,160
Typhoon!
Get up!

109
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,080
Thun, get up!
Typhoon!

110
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
Uh...

111
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,520
Thun, you can do it.
Calm down and focus.

112
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,840
You're doing great Thun!

113
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,520
So good!

114
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,760
Get up!

115
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Blue corner!

116
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,000
Red corner!

117
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Fight!

118
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,840
Good!
That's it, Thun!

119
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,840
Uh...

120
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Go!

121
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,280
Yay!

122
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,840
Woo!

123
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,520
Get up!

124
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Ready! Fight!

125
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Stop!

126
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,760
If you're ready, round five! Fight!

127
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,120
Get up!

128
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,320
Fight!

129
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Uh...
Come on!

130
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Thun, you're doing great!

131
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,480
Fight!

132
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,280
Secure Coach Petch and get him out of here now.

133
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,200
Thun, get up!

134
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Get up!

135
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,920
That's great!

136
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,960
If you're ready, fight!

137
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,720
Stop! Go to your corners!

138
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:07,360
Typhon!
Cannon!

139
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,000
Cannon!

140
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,720
Typhon!
Cannon!

141
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,120
Typhon!

142
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,120
Typhon!
Cannon!

143
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:42,600
Yay!
Woo!

144
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,240
That's it! That's my boy.

145
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,440
Hey! Hey!  Chief!

146
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,560
Cannon!

147
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,320
Yay!

148
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,760
Yay!

149
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Thun!

150
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,680
We've won!

151
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
We've finally won!

152
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,640
You were so good!

153
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,040
So good!

154
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,520
Thun, Phuwish's gone.

155
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
Let's go.

156
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,600
Gather all our men and block all the exits.

157
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,720
Capture everyone from Petchsak Academy, especially Keen.

158
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,920
You got it?

159
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,080
Yes, sir.

160
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,760
You don’t have to look for us, Mr.Phuwish.

161
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
We've come to find you.

162
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,240
Wow, you've got guts.

163
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,200
You're so brave to insult me. Haha

164
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,800
You're brave and stupid too!

165
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,400
Such a waste.

166
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,040
Thun.

167
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,600
Keen.

168
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,120
Why would you throw away the opportunities I've given you?

169
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,720
Opportunities?

170
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,320
Yes.
The opportunity to be your slave?

171
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,200
No way.

172
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,800
Who'd want to be your toy?

173
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
In that case...

174
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,320
Let's do it this way!

175
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,920
How?

176
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,600
How? Huh?

177
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,440
Aren’t you afraid people will hear the gunshots?

178
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,120
Didn’t I tell you this room is soundproof?

179
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
You still have a chance.

180
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,880
Change your mind.

181
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,880
Change your mind.

182
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,080
Be mine, come on.

183
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Come.

184
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,400
Otherwise, you’ll die just like your father.

185
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,240
Toy, fight him!

186
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
Damn it!

187
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,040
Uh..

188
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,720
Come on.

189
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,880
Make this fun.

190
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,000
At first, I thought your dad came to be some kind of hero.

191
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,480
Turns out, he just came to avenge your mom after we tricked her into giving us her money,

192
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,000
she was so stressed her brain vessel burst.

193
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,120
All that effort was for nothing.

194
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,120
What the fuck are you doing?

195
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,480
I’m going to return the money to everyone.

196
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,040
You’ve got a lot of nerve doing this.

197
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,520
Do you know what happens to people who betray Sia Thep?

198
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
Huh?!

199
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
You know, right?

200
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,760
Come here.

201
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,040
He died for nothing.

202
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,280
Bastard!
Keen!

203
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,000
Don't come any closer!

204
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,280
Don't!

205
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,640
Don’t you lay a finger on Keen!

206
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,640
Step back!

207
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,720
I gave you a chance, why would you betray me?!

208
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,640
This is your final chance.

209
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,360
Think carefully.

210
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,040
Give me the code.

211
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,240
Give me the code!

212
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,040
Don’t you dare.

213
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,200
You’re just like your father.

214
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,840
When I tortured him to death, he still refused to give me the code.

215
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,880
Oh? How about this, Keen?

216
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,640
I’ll shoot Thun, the person you love so much.

217
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,320
Let’s see if you’ll give me the code then.

218
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,080
Let's get closer, Keen.

219
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,720
A bit more…

220
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,880
Right?

221
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,000
Agh! Hahaha!

222
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,120
What the fuck is wrong with you! Huh!?

223
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,040
Wow… It’s kind of funny, isn’t it? A smart and powerful man like you

224
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,280
getting tricked so easily by a rookie in the boxing scene.

225
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,120
Why don’t you say hello to the folks in the arena, MP Phuwish?

226
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,440
That’s Phuwish’s voice!
What’s going on?

227
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,320
Oops, or should I say Sia Thep?

228
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
Hey! What is this?

229
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:53,560
I’m Sergeant Kanchit Rojanametheephong.

230
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,040
That voice sounds really familiar…

231
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:02,160
And this footage contains evidence of MP Phuwish’s crimes,

232
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,560
confirming that MP Phuwish and Sia Thep,

233
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:12,440
the crime lord in the boxing world, are the same person.

234
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,440
Whoa…

235
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:24,960
Toy! You were a mole?! Went from punching guts to turning cocoon, huh?

236
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,320
Keep doing it!

237
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,200
Harder!

238
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,880
Crank it up! You idiot!

239
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
Ow!

240
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,640
All you had to do was fake a voice or face of someone familiar

241
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,040
or pretend to be some kind of official.

242
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,960
Just remember, the only goal is to wrap the job up fast.

243
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,080
Humans, when they’re under pressure,

244
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,880
they lose their minds and before they know it, the money

245
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,080
is already in our hands.

246
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,080
So let’s go. Everyone ready? Operation begins.

247
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
This is Dynamitol.

248
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,400
Whoa…

249
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,960
It’s a new drug formula, Boss.

250
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,880
Right now, no current anti-doping methods can detect this substance.

251
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,840
Ahh.

252
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,560
But if you use too much, it’ll damage the body in the long run.

253
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,360
That’s fine. I don’t care about that.

254
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,200
All I care about is making the fight entertaining.

255
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,520
I hope this footage leads to your prosecution,

256
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,920
and justice for all of Phuwish’s victims.

257
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,840
If that happens, I can die in peace.

258
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,960
Hey!

259
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,440
Don’t come any closer!

260
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,360
Stop! You can’t film this!
What?

261
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,960
What are you doing with my phone?!

262
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,080
Wait! Are you one of them?!

263
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,600
Hey!

264
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,320
Whoop his ass!

265
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,360
It’s chaos now.

266
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,080
Keep recording, keep filming!

267
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,720
Where’s that room?

268
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,240
Over there! Come on, let’s go check it out.

269
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,120
Take care of yourself, okay?
I’m right here.

270
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,000
Okay, okay.

271
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,680
Everyone, it’s total chaos now!

272
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Get up!

273
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,120
Don’t come closer or I’ll shoot your guts out!

274
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,120
Keen!

275
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,720
That’s enough now.
MP Phuwish.

276
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,560
Don’t take pictures!

277
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,960
Get out!

278
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
Don’t film!

279
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,320
Don’t film me!

280
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,720
Film everything!

281
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,880
Damn it! Get out!
Aaaah!

282
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,800
I told you not to film!

283
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,440
Stop!

284
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,000
Drop it!

285
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,320
Back off!

286
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,680
Keen...

287
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,840
I’m sorry I wasn’t there by your side like I promised.

288
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,440
But I want you to know...

289
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,920
I’ll always be with you, Keen.

290
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,880
Keen.

291
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You did so well.

292
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,080
I’m proud of you, son.

293
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
Keen...

294
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,400
It’s over now.

295
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,520
It’s okay.

296
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,760
Dad, I've done it.

297
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,480
Go.

298
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,680
Move.

299
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,440
Yut!

300
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
Hey!

301
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
Coach Petch, are you okay?

302
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,160
I’m fine.

303
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,520
What the hell did you doing to Uncle Petch?!

304
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,280
That’s all you’ve got, huh?

305
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,080
You weakling.

306
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,880
Get up.

307
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,960
Coach, be careful!

308
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,240
I’m the master of all martial arts!

309
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,280
Who the hell are you?

310
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,000
You’ll find out soon enough.
You can’t do anything to me.

311
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,240
You’re just a master.

312
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,560
I’m the Jade Executioner.

313
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,400
Come on, let’s get out of here!
Yeah, let’s go!

314
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Damn it!

315
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
Argh!!

316
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,600
Looking for something, Mr. Phuwish?

317
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,560
Pakorn.

318
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,320
You traitor, I’m going to kill you!

319
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,800
You’re not speaking very politely today, sir.

320
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,760
Jonathan.

321
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,520
Jonathan!

322
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,280
Jonathan!

323
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,080
Why are you guys here?

324
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,920
Why?

325
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,680
What?

326
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,680
Why?

327
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,640
Hey! I’ll kill all of you!

328
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,080
Hey! What?

329
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Let go of me!

330
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,320
Pakorn! Let me go or you're all dead!

331
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,440
You wanna die, huh?

332
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,880
Ow!

333
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,240
Let me go!

334
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,200
You’re all dead once I get out of here!

335
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,800
Pakorn, help me!

336
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,520
Hungry, are we?

337
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,280
Now it’s your turn to be the bitch.

338
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,960
Your dad’s a bitch!

339
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,720
Tough guy, huh?

340
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,280
Eat.

341
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,080
What the hell did you give me?

342
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,960
Help... me...

343
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,120
If that’s all, I’ll take my leave now.

344
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
All done?

345
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,960
Yeah, all done.

346
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,440
What did the police say?

347
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:12,080
They asked how we got involved with Sia Thep.

348
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:19,200
Thun told them about the fight ring in the warehouse.

349
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,080
You should’ve seen the officer’s face when he heard it.

350
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,960
If I hadn’t seen it myself, I wouldn’t have believed it.

351
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,800
So sketchy.

352
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Secret society.

353
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Underground fight club.

354
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,560
I’ve only ever seen stuff like that in movies.

355
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,240
And then when the guy came at me, I punched him right in the face.

356
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,640
He was like “Sorry! I give up!”

357
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,880
“I’ve got a family to feed!” But I didn’t let him go.

358
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,880
I was like, left, right, left, right!

359
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:08,760
You once told me I was all you had left, right?

360
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,680
But I want you to know, Keen, that now...

361
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:34,600
everyone in the Petchsak camp is your family too.

362
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:44,480
You're like a grandson to me now.

363
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,960
And the Petchsak boxing camp is your home too.

364
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,440
Thank you, Uncle Petch.

365
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,440
Thank you, officer.

366
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,560
Thanks so much.

367
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,360
You know if you exaggerate too much, you could be charged with false testimony, right?

368
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,680
That’s prison time.

369
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,520
I wasn’t lying!

370
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,360
Sure, sure.
Big talker.

371
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,000
Thank you, everyone.

372
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,880
Really, thank you.

373
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,360
You’re hogging the hugs!

374
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,160
Let me in too!

375
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,520
That’s it.

376
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,840
It’s all over.

377
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,280
You did great.

378
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,240
In trending news online right now...

379
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:18,000
A video of Auntie Bua receiving a mysterious bag of money left in front of her house.

380
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,680
Back when I got scammed by a call center gang,

381
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,040
I just wanted to die.

382
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,520
But now, I don’t want to die anymore. I got my money back!

383
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,960
And how do you know it was yours, auntie?

384
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,800
Inside the bag, there was a note saying it was the money the scammers had taken

385
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,680
and someone went and got it back for me!

386
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,120
Bless you, that person!

387
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,960
In our next story, today marks the one-year anniversary of the discovery of the body of MP Phuwish,

388
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,600
or the infamous Sia Thep,

389
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,960
found dead in an abandoned factory.

390
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,560
Yut, the ex-boxer and Boss Thep’s right-hand man,

391
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,760
was sentenced to life in prison for assault, unlawful confinement, conspiracy to murder,

392
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,640
as well as charges of fraud and money laundering.

393
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:13,720
the director of Ekarin Hospital, was arrested for involvement in producing a new illegal stimulant

394
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:21,120
called Dynamitol, Police have seized and destroyed all known samples.

395
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:26,800
The crackdown on Boss Thep’s organization also led to the dismantling of major scam and call center syndicates,

396
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,680
involving billions of baht in circulation.

397
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,560
Pakorn, former boxing promoter and fighter, was also sentenced for conspiracy.

398
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,960
Sia Thep had evaded justice for so long due to protection from high-ranking police,

399
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,600
who helped cover up murders and fraud cases.

400
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:52,000
The police chief has now announced the formation of a new committee to investigate further.

401
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,640
Hello?

402
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,240
Hi.

403
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:20,000
Listen, I’ve got a very special offer that you might be interested in.

404
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,080
Hmm. You’re working hard.

405
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,920
Well, I want our boxing camp to go global.

406
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,520
Oh, Keen...

407
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,280
Hmm?

408
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,360
I got a call from Japan just now.

409
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:27,880
The IBF in Japan wants to invite mr to be a boxing coach there.

410
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,000
They’ll cover all my expenses.

411
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
food, housing, and even pocket money.

412
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Whoa...

413
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,600
But...

414
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,440
It’s a long-term contract.

415
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,720
Two years.

416
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,800
International Boxing Federation in Japan, right?

417
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,960
Sounds interesting.

418
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,760
What do you think, Thun?

419
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:30,920
I don’t know yet, I haven’t really thought about it yet.

420
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,800
I think that..

421
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,360
It's a great opportunity.

422
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,520
How are you guys doing, Keen? Thun?

423
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,640
Hello.

424
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,000
I heard from Klao you were released today,

425
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,840
didn’t expect you to come find us so soon.

426
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,600
They reduced my sentence because I gave useful testimony and helped expose Phuwish.

427
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:41,960
But I still have to wear this EM ankle monitor.

428
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,720
Must be tough, huh?

429
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,480
Not as tough as what you two went through.

430
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,040
I owe both of you an apology.

431
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,600
You don’t need to apologize to us, Dad.

432
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,000
We understand now.

433
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,480
Right, Thun?

434
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Yeah.

435
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,320
It’s okay, Keen.

436
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,520
I understand both of you.

437
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:52,720
You two stood up to Sia Thep’s power so bravely.

438
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,160
You’ve already gone far beyond an old man like me.

439
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,880
I know you’re still angry at me, Thun.

440
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,600
But...

441
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:21,600
I hope what I did in the end

442
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:31,960
might help you forgive me someday.

443
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,800
Dad.

444
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,600
I’m sorry for ever calling you a coward.

445
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,400
Thank you...

446
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,320
Dad.

447
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,520
Come visit your mom at home sometime, okay?

448
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,880
Hey Win, can I ask you something?

449
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,120
You don’t do your trading stuff anymore?

450
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,560
I quit, Dad. It wasn’t as easy to make money as I thought.

451
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,640
More people lose than win.

452
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,880
And the charts just keep swinging up and down.

453
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,240
I can’t stare at them all day.

454
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,440
Hmm.

455
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,640
I’ve been in a boxing camp since I was a kid.

456
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,080
I’d rather come back and help run the gym.

457
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,520
Good, come help your old man at the camp.

458
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,240
Hello Ait.

459
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,720
Hi, Kaew.

460
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,000
Hello, Uncle Petch.

461
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,360
Hi.
Hello, Mawin.

462
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,000
Hello.

463
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,360
Study hard, Kaew.

464
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,880
Once your tutoring’s done, I’ll take you out to eat.

465
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,800
Let’s go hang out at Thun and Keen’s place, okay?

466
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,880
Sounds great!

467
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,480
Good.

468
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,720
How’s it going, Typhoon? Done training?

469
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,480
All done.

470
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,520
You ready for tomorrow’s fight?

471
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,320
Ready. 100% fit.

472
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,600
Good.

473
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:33,960
A fighter like Typhoon Roaring Thunder won’t let the Petchsak Camp down, right Coach Petch?

474
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,720
And you, Mai, ready for your first match tomorrow?

475
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,040
Don’t worry, Coach.

476
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,920
Typhoon trained me hard, no holding back!

477
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,000
Ow ow ow!

478
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,560
So fired up!
Hyper as always!

479
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:56,040
Hey, Mawin, the scale’s busted again.

480
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,680
Again?!

481
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,600
Alright, Ait and I will handle it.

482
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,120
You go back to training.

483
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:04,640
Come on, go.

484
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,440
Back to training.
15 rounds, let’s go!

485
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,000
Whoa, Typhoon!

486
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,440
(Petchsak Boxing Camp)

487
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,240
Hey.

488
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,240
You’re still not done? You’ve been working on that forever.

489
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,400
Yeah, I think it’s really busted this time.

490
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,480
Geez, if it breaks this often, just buy a new one!

491
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,000
Yeah... I thought about that.

492
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,480
But I think I’ll keep this one.

493
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,520
Why, though?

494
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,600
It’s totally wrecked. Just toss it.

495
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,320
I can’t bring myself to throw it away.

496
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:55,120
Even though it’s broken, it’s proof that I once lost my way

497
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:59,920
and found my way back by fixing this very machine.

498
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,080
Wait, are we still talking about the scale?

499
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,960
I'm talking about scale.

500
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:23,120
As for the person, he’s been repaired too.

501
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:27,240
Don’t get all sappy on me.

502
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,480
Go finish training.

503
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,480
Yeah yeah, I got it.

504
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:58,200
Dad, I've used the money in the wallet to do what you had intended to do all along.

505
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,960
I've returned the money to everyone who had been scammed.

506
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:12,960
Thanks to the evidence you gathered, we were able to track down every victim.

507
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,600
As for their addresses, someone helped us.

508
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,840
All done, right?

509
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:31,280
Thank you so much, Uncle Nop, for handling all of that.

510
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,480
Let me do this to make up for what I didn’t do.

511
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,840
Back then, I couldn’t help your dad.

512
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,880
I’ve regretted that ever since.

513
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,000
It’s okay, I understand.

514
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,200
You must’ve been under pressure from higher-ups too.

515
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,760
Even so, I still have the responsibility to do this.

516
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:04,440
Besides, tracking people down isn’t that hard.

517
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,200
Really, I should thank you, Keen, for giving me this chance

518
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,720
to make it up to Kanchit.

519
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:20,920
I believe if your dad could see you now,

520
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,080
he’d be really proud of you.

521
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,680
I’ll be going now.

522
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,160
Alright.

523
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,640
Mom, Dad. You don’t have to worry anymore.

524
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:13,240
From now on, no one else will suffer from Sia Thep’s gang the way our family did.

525
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,160
You don’t have to worry about Keen anymore either.

526
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:32,120
From now on, I’ll always be by Keen’s side. I’ll take care of him for you.

527
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:44,680
One, two, three, change positions!

528
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,000
Mai, take a nice photo of my sister, alright?

529
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,560
I’ll make her look her absolute best, bro!

530
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,320
How did you take this, huh? Why do I look so fat?

531
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,480
Fat?

532
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,000
What are you smiling about, all by yourself?

533
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:13,400
I’m just proud, I finally bought this house back.

534
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,640
Come on, let's join everyone else.

535
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,800
Let’s go.

536
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,800
Ait, are you done yet? I’m starving!

537
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,800
Just a sec!

538
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,640
Ugh, can’t wait anymore.

539
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,000
Klao, give me the super spicy sauce!

540
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,560
You got it!

541
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,200
Whoa, that's too spicy!

542
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,360
Change pose, change pose!

543
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:14,080
Alright, this one’s done! Fresh off the grill!
Whoa, looks mouthwatering.

544
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,000
Here it comes!

545
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,040
Dipping sauce is ready!

546
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,480
Let’s see…
Looks delicious.

547
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,880
Such a spicy-looking color.

548
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,280
Of course!
No doubt.

549
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,320
Whoa, whoa.

550
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,760
So we can dig in now, right?
Yep, let’s eat, go on!

551
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,120
Grab whatever you want!
Me first, me first!

552
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,320
Go ahead!
Shrimp, shrimp!

553
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,040
Hey!

554
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,040
We’re not gonna get to eat if you keep that up!

555
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,000
Mai, be careful, man!

556
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,080
If the shrimp falls, it’d be such a waste! It's expensive!

557
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,400
Sorry, sorry!
Mmm.

558
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,400
Alright, eat up!
Thanks!

559
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,800
What would you like to eat, Kaew?

560
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,080
You know, I’ve never peeled shrimp for anyone before.

561
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,040
The sauce is really good.

562
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,360
Right?

563
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,000
It’s a little sour though.

564
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,320
Hey, I wanna eat too!

565
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,040
Hmph.

566
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,480
You’re making me crave it now.
Might be too sweet, though?

567
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,520
Here, here.

568
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,240
So good!

569
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,520
Hey, this one fell!

570
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,040
Everyone, let’s take a group photo!

571
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,360
Come on, come on!

572
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,720
Tilt your heads in.

573
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,720
One, two, three!

574
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,720
Ugh, I’m tired.

575
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,000
Those guys came to eat and didn’t help clean anything up.

576
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:27,800
Come on, at least we get some alone time now.

577
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,960
Even washing dishes counts, right?

578
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:48,000
Thun, the plate’s gonna break!

579
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,680
You scared the plate might break, or something else might break?

580
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:42,520
You're the one who should be afraid.

581
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,560
So, did anything break last night?

582
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,080
Ugh, you perv!

583
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,800
The plate! What are you even thinking?!

584
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,880
Ohhh, right... the plate. Got it.

585
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:29,320
Hey, I brought something for you to try, Keen.

586
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,040
What is it?

587
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:41,720
Something I came up with myself.

588
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,960
It'll be easy.

589
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,960
Let go!

590
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:28,760
I made mistakes too, I knew you were only doing all that because of the debt.

591
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:39,120
Do you still want to stay at the gym?

592
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,680
Do you want me to stay?

593
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:48,720
Yes. Stay with me, Keen.

594
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,920
Yay! All sold out!

595
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,160
Sold out!

596
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:08,040
If you don’t know how to stop thinking about it,

597
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:15,080
just think about me. That’s enough.

598
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:27,480
Wow, how did you do it?

599
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:21,960
So, have you decided yet about going to Japan to teach boxing?

600
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:31,840
I’ve actually already made up my mind.

601
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,920
Yeah?

602
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,480
So finish it.

603
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,360
Do you know yet?

604
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,800
Yeah.
