2
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,720
From now on, I’ll trust and support you.

3
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,520
Thank you, Thun.

4
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,240
Keen, do you know MP Phuwish?

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,840
He’s a politician known for promoting Muay Thai.

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,160
Oh, Tiger Taming Cannon himself.

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,800
But I want one specific fighter to return to the ring.

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,640
If you can bring him back to fight,

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,800
I’ll fully support your event.

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,000
So you’ve agreed to fight now?

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,920
Yes.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,520
I’ve got a purpose now.

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,200
Excellent.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,920
Don’t worry about the money.

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,640
I’ll take care of it

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,560
(MP Phuwish, I'm going to make him sink.)

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,240
Alright.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,240
I’ll be watching.

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,960
Come on everyone!

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,880
Cheers!

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,080
Yeah!

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,520
Woo!

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,640
Woah? Was it that refreshing?

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,760
I've been tired for so long.

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,520
Keen, you are really talented.

26
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,600
I didn't think this event would really happen.

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,400
I really want to thank you.

28
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,080
It's ok.

29
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,040
It's true.

30
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,600
I never imagined

31
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,800
that we would ever get to fight in such a big event.

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,080
Right?

33
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,440
Keen is so talented!

34
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,120
Right, Bung?

35
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,480
Yeah, I know.

36
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,960
Just stuff your face with that junk food.

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,600
Hey Thun, go with Keen to help him negotiate with the boxers, alright?

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,440
Since this is our first time organizing an event,

39
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,080
I’m worried people might not trust us.

40
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,280
And don’t forget to bring some gifts or something with you.

41
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,160
Got it, Coach.

42
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
Mmm-hmm.

43
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,080
Come on, let’s do a bottoms-up!

44
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,000
Alright, cheers!
Whoa, bottoms-up?

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,600
Cheers, cheers!
Come on!

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,040
Bottoms-up!

47
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,240
Let’s go!
Bottoms-up, bottoms-up!

48
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,000
Bung, finish your drink!

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,560
Don’t try to fake it, I saw you.

50
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,640
We're out of beer, want to go buy more?

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,040
I’ll go! I’ll go!

52
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,000
Isn’t anyone as hyped as I am?

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,960
Am I the only one excited?

54
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,000
For Us

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
What's wrong?

56
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
I don’t know.

57
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,680
Suddenly I just feel scared.

58
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,320
A fresh graduate organizing a boxing event…

59
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,600
I’ve never even watched a full boxing match on TV before.

60
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,520
There’s nothing to worry,, Keen.

61
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,640
We will make it through, like we used to.

62
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,200
It’ll get better soon.

63
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,560
Is that for me?

64
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,760
Yeah.

65
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Let me put it on for you.

66
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,960
Turn around.

67
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,720
Do you like it?

68
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
Thank you, Thun.

69
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,440
Could you put it on for me?

70
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,280
Turn around.

71
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Thank you.

72
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,200
Alright, you guys should head out now.

73
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,080
Otherwise you’ll be back late.

74
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,160
Call me if anything comes up.

75
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,080
Will do.

76
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,040
Hey, Thun, drive safe, okay?

77
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,560
Safety first.

78
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,280
Got it, Coach.

79
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,440
Okay.

80
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,360
We’re heading off.

81
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,880
Bye.
Take care.

82
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,960
Here you go.

83
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,000
Thanks so much.

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,160
Thank you.

85
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,200
Anytime.

86
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,840
Yeah.

87
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,320
Now that we have Phuwish’s backing, it’s much easier to talk to the promoters.

88
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,200
It’s all thanks to you.

89
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,040
We managed to book all the boxers in one day!

90
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,760
(Come on, let's continue)

91
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,840
Kick!

92
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,360
Come on!

93
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
Kick!

94
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,840
Elbow!

95
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,480
Good!

96
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Left, right.
Let’s go.

97
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,560
Kick!

98
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Elbow!

99
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,640
Good.

100
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,520
When you were a kid, did Uncle Petch train you like this too, right?

101
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,520
Coach Petch wasn’t my first coach.

102
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,240
It was my dad.

103
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,320
Back then, we were really close.

104
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,520
He’s the one who introduced me to boxing.

105
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,080
He was always my idol.

106
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,120
But then one day,

107
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,440
he told me to quit boxing

108
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,640
and left me and my mother.

109
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,960
He never came back.

110
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,200
But I’m glad…

111
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,000
I still get to see you in the ring.

112
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You never once gave up on boxing.

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,640
That’s how you got this far.

114
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,760
And it’s also thanks to you, Keen.

115
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,400
When I was lost and on the verge of quitting,

116
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,280
you made me realize

117
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,920
who I was doing this for.

118
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,480
Thank you for always believing in me.

119
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
Thank you too, Keen.

120
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:37,280
From now on, I won’t be fighting for myself or for you,

121
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,000
but for us.

122
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,360
I will always be by your side.

123
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
Stop it, Mai!

124
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,000
I’m just excited, Bung!

125
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,280
Well, it’s giving me a headache

126
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,240
Just waiting for them to come back.

127
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,960
Hey! Thun and Keen are back, everyone!

128
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,560
They’re here, they’re here!

129
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
This way!

130
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
How’d it go, Keen?

131
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,160
I locked in all the boxers, Uncle.

132
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,400
Whoa!
No way!

133
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,440
Really?!

134
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,880
Nice!! You’re awesome, boss!

135
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,480
Oops, sorry!

136
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,200
From now on, we should be calling him

137
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,560
Promoter Keen!

138
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,400
Not yet!

139
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,360
You did great, bro.

140
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,320
Once the event comes together for real,

141
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,240
then you can start calling him that, Mai.

142
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,120
Yeah, you’re too quick with the titles.

143
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,080
Huh?

144
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,960
Wow, now you’re siding with Bung?

145
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,000
You’re just jealous that Keen got work for our gym, right?

146
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,440
Aren’t you? Right, Keen?

147
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,640
Hey Mai, help me wash the dishes.

148
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,120
Come on, go!

149
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,640
Now??

150
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,520
Yes, now!

151
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,000
Huh?
Come on, or we’ll be up all night!

152
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,320
Ugh, seriously?

153
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,200
You did amazing, Keen.

154
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,840
Thanks.

155
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,400
You too.

156
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,120
You’re both amazing.

157
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
Keen’s really impressive, huh?

158
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,600
I mean, I’m the son of a boxing gym owner,

159
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,840
but I still suck at boxing.

160
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,640
Hey.

161
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,000
Don’t say that.

162
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,640
Everyone’s got their own kind of talent.

163
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,080
So what do you think I’m good at, Ait?

164
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Well, you’re good at...

165
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,680
Hey!

166
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,200
What are you two still training for at this hour?

167
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,200
Go to bed already.

168
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,960
If you’re not gonna sleep, go help Keen with his planning.

169
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,520
Are you okay?

170
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,440
I’m fine.

171
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,640
Sorry about that.

172
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Does it really hurt?

173
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,440
I’m really sorry.

174
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,040
It didn’t hurt.

175
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,000
You don’t have to apologize.

176
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,480
Honestly, I didn’t know what to do either.

177
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,800
Finally done.

178
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,560
I’ll try weighing on it now...

179
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,680
Hey!

180
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,840
It works now!

181
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,800
See? You’re the best at this kind of stuff.

182
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,280
I'm good at fixing the scale?

183
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,680
You’re also good at crypto trading,

184
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,520
and taking care of everyone in the gym.

185
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,680
You’ve always done a great job at that.

186
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,160
Actually… there’s something else you’re good at too.

187
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,640
Let’s continue this in the room.

188
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,440
Wait?

189
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,200
Isn’t Mai in the room?

190
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,280
Then let’s go to the office.

191
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
Relax.

192
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,440
This, this is what you’re best at.

193
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,720
Give me a more intense look.

194
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
More confident, yeah.

195
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,640
Got it.

196
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,120
Awesome.

197
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,720
Can I see this photo real quick?

198
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,440
Perfect, this one’s great.

199
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,360
Two more, please.

200
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,160
A bit fiercer.

201
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,000
Yes, good.

202
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,880
Let me see that one.

203
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,040
Next up is Bung!

204
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,240
You got this!

205
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,680
Let’s get a stunning shot.

206
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,640
Bung, can you twist your body a bit?

207
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,160
That’s beautiful.

208
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,800
Is that good?

209
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,480
Perfect.

210
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,560
Nice job.

211
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Next is Ait.

212
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
(Bung, was your shot okay?)

213
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,360
(Yeah, I think so.)

214
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,920
Let’s go!
(Especially the knee-lift pose.)

215
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,920
Yeah.

216
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,040
Whoa, Bung!

217
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,560
What?

218
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,720
Look at your photo.

219
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,320
You look gorgeous.

220
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,240
That pose!

221
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,280
That pose! Look at that!

222
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,840
Seems weird, you're complimenting me and laughing right after.

223
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,120
Are you being sarcastic?

224
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,840
Check out your pose here!

225
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,600
Am I cool or what?

226
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,800
This air-con’s freezing, man.

227
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,720
Aren’t you cold?

228
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,960
Not at all, I’m sweating like crazy.

229
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,240
Seriously though, it’s freezing in here.

230
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,600
No blankets either.

231
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,240
We’ll take turns wearing jackets or something.

232
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,480
Okay.

233
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,680
Well, now that Klao’s here, it’s probably not cold anymore.

234
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,960
Huh?

235
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,600
Definitely warmer now.

236
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,720
So what were you guys doing earlier?

237
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,840
Let me see.

238
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,600
Here, Bung’s photos.

239
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,560
Whoa, you’re really photogenic!

240
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,360
Told you, you look amazing.

241
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,280
Thank you.

242
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,800
See you at the event!

243
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,400
I going to go cover the story.

244
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,440
I’ll be right by the ring cheering you on.

245
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,960
Whoa.

246
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,160
That means Bung’s gonna win in the first round, huh?

247
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,480
Because someone she likes will be there cheering.

248
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,280
Mai!

249
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,200
I mean…

250
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,280
Um… I’ve been a fan of Klao for a long time.

251
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,680
Whoa, really?

252
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,200
I’ve been following your news page for a while.

253
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,000
Thank you so much, Bung!

254
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,240
If you enjoy anything I post, don’t forget to like and share.

255
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,760
Of course!

256
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,960
Follow me.

257
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,040
Sure.
I'll follow you back.

258
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,120
I’ll go check on Keen.

259
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,920
See you on event day.

260
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,440
This is the first time

261
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,920
I’ve seen you so quiet, Bung.

262
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Well… but I still hit hard, okay?

263
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,240
Wanna try?
Nope, please don’t.

264
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,560
Come here!
Ah! Nooo~

265
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,560
So, how’s it going?

266
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,400
We're shooting Ait now.

267
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,600
Ait looks a bit tense, huh?

268
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Yeah.

269
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,680
He still doesn’t look very confident.

270
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,200
Ait, can we get a fiercer look?

271
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,600
Really confident, okay?

272
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,720
Let’s try again.

273
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,600
Do you want me to talk to him?

274
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,440
Yeah.

275
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,080
Why?

276
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,520
Ait.

277
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Take a deep breath.

278
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,240
How about this?

279
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,480
If you do well, I’ll give you a reward.

280
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
Deal?

281
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Keep going, Keen.

282
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Let’s roll, Ait.

283
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,320
Awesome!

284
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,120
What did you say to him just now?

285
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,640
Nothing much.

286
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,160
You're awesome.

287
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,600
I better not find out…
Elbow strike! Elbow strike!

288
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,040
Uh..

289
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
Uhh…

290
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,840
Nice.

291
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm trying to figure out when they got so close?

292
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
That's great.

293
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Elbow, elbow.

294
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,560
I have no clue.
How about this?

295
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
That's great.

296
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,200
You got it, Ait.

297
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,680
You did really great.

298
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,120
Well done.

299
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,520
Awesome.

300
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,000
The photo looks so cool.

301
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,480
How are you feeling?

302
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Thanks, bro.

303
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,400
Come on, go take a break.

304
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
I’ll take you.

305
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Next up is you.

306
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,280
Mmm.

307
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,920
You got this.

308
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,400
I can smell love in the air.

309
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,080
So cool.

310
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,760
Why are you smiling?

311
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,560
The photo’s amazing.

312
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,240
Oh, okay.

313
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,640
Just looking at the pictures.
The whole shoot turned out amazing.

314
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,360
Yeah.

315
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,160
Incredible.

316
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,200
Great job, Thun.

317
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,240
Hello, Keen.

318
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,960
Oh, hello.

319
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,160
How’s it going?

320
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,680
Good.

321
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,880
We’re still shooting right now.

322
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,080
Aren’t you getting your photo taken too?

323
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,160
Alright, Yut, let’s get a photo of you two together.

324
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,800
Oh, sure.

325
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,320
Okay then.

326
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,040
We meet again, Thun.

327
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,720
Photo time.

328
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,400
Are they fighting...

329
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,440
because you're the prize?

330
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,280
If that’s the case, no need to compete anymore.

331
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,880
Huh?

332
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,960
Because I've already picked the winner.

333
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,400
Figures.

334
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,440
You're on fire.

335
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,200
Can’t be helped.

336
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,240
I’m gonna puke.

337
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,480
Both of you, guard up and face the camera.

338
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,760
Give me a fiercer expression, please.

339
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,280
Are they acting or actually mad at each other?

340
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,280
I'll go brief them.

341
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,360
Hurry up,

342
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,920
they’re about to throw punches.

343
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,520
One moment, please.

344
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,120
Now turn to face each other.

345
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,160
Put your guard up like you're about to fight.

346
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,200
Angrier faces, please.

347
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,240
A little more rage in your face, Thun.

348
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,280
So how do I look, Keen?

349
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,080
Do you like it?

350
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,120
You look alright.

351
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,480
Looks great.

352
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,160
Now face each other again.

353
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,440
Pose like you're about to fight.

354
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,120
Okay.
Give me your angriest looks.

355
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,960
Let’s keep shooting.

356
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,080
Sure.
Alright, let’s go for it.

357
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
Nice.

358
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
That's awesome.

359
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,680
Ooh, this photo’s amazing.

360
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,120
Looks great.

361
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,000
And here are the fighters of this Hero Fight event!

362
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,120
Let’s give them all a round of applause!

363
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,080
Woo!

364
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,320
Thun!

365
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,000
If there’s someone you love or support, cheer them on!

366
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,640
Don’t worry.

367
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,360
You’ve done really well.

368
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Thank you, Mr.Phuwish.

369
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,200
And now, here are the match-ups for Hero Fight!

370
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,640
In the first match,

371
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,560
Cottonflower the Destroyer will fight the Sweet-faced Executioner.

372
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,400
Second match: Golden-legged Tiger versus Stone-shattering Fist.

373
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,880
Ait! Ait!

374
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,280
And the third match!

375
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,480
Lord of the Martial World versus the Tiger-Taming Cannon!

376
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,360
Let’s give a big round of applause to all six of them!

377
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:08,680
Woo!
Go Cannon! Go!

378
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,360
And for this Hero Fight event, we also have official merchandise on sale:

379
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,400
T-shirts, tote bags, water bottles, fans, and souvenirs.

380
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,720
Do you think it’ll really sell?
(For those of you here and at home,)

381
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,120
It will, Keen's thought it through.
(If you're interested, you can order from our official site.)

382
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,240
Now, can we please invite all six fighters to the front for a group photo?

383
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,880
Can I get a round of applause?!

384
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,680
Wooo!

385
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,040
Alright, let’s start with the first pose.

386
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,560
Each pair, please face each other and get into your guard stance.

387
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,120
Media friends, feel free to start taking pictures.

388
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,560
If you have a favorite pair, you’re welcome to cheer for them.

389
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,160
Alright, if everyone's got their shots, let’s move on to the second pose.

390
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,120
All six fighters, please turn and pose for the fans!

391
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,000
Woohoo!

392
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,080
And here they are! The six fighters of this Hero Fight match!

393
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,200
Let’s give them another big round of applause!

394
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,160
(Comments: “Thun, the handsome boxer hero”)

395
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,480
(“That’s that hero boxer guy!”)

396
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,760
(Yut, the retired boxer turned rescue volunteer, returns to the ring)

397
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,880
(“Whoa! The Warlord is back!”)

398
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,080
(“He’s not only a great fighter but also super handsome!”)

399
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
(“Hero vs. Hero, OMG!”)

400
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,360
(“This is the first time I’m excited to watch a boxing match.”)

401
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,640
(“Hot rescue guy, tell everyone!”)

402
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,920
(“Go Thun! You got this!”)

403
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,480
(“Yut is seriously cool.”)

404
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
(Ticket sales: 127/1000)

405
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,480
Everyone, it's been ten minutes.

406
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,320
Let’s check the numbers.

407
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,120
(Ticket sales: 157/1000)

408
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,880
What do we do, Keen?

409
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,760
A thousand seats and less than two weeks to go...

410
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,360
Can we really sell them all?

411
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,720
Engagement’s good, but realistically… yikes.

412
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,000
It’s the brutal truth, man.

413
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,920
You didn’t time this at all.

414
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:50,200
My generation doesn’t even know what this sport entertainment thing is.

415
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,720
But the engagement from both the event and Thun is really strong.

416
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,600
Honestly, we should’ve sold more tickets by now.

417
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,840
Don’t stress, Keen.

418
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,400
Boxing fans might just buy at the door.

419
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,120
Are you guys forgetting something?

420
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,760
I’m a content creator, remember?

421
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,480
Got loads of followers?

422
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,640
Let me handle it, I’ll make three pieces of content.

423
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,600
Free of charge.

424
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,040
Go ahead Mr. Influencer!

425
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,960
I’ll go post some posters around, maybe more people will notice.

426
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,960
Also, Bung, we’re almost out of posters.

427
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,760
Go print more and hand them out at the market.

428
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,480
Make your rider service useful for once.

429
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,320
Wait, where’s Ait?

430
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,640
He’s at the hospital with his sister.

431
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,000
She’s having surgery today.

432
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,640
Don't make up excuses.

433
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,640
I’m not making excuses, I’m just finding someone to go with.

434
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,240
Is this it?

435
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,920
I’m out.

436
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,520
That’s a hardware wallet, not a flash drive.

437
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,360
A what now?

438
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,800
What’s a hardware wallet?

439
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,000
Told you a hundred times.

440
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,040
It’s for storing crypto, genius.

441
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,200
Give it to me.

442
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Come on, how much money could it possibly hold?

443
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,360
Let’s just say it’s got some!

444
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,400
Alright, alright! Break it up!

445
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,000
Everyone scatter.

446
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,440
Where’s the file?

447
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,560
I’ll send it over.

448
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,360
Okay, cool.

449
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,080
I’m out, see you.

450
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,400
See you.

451
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,880
Mr.Phuwish is calling.

452
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,080
Hello, Mr. Phuwish.

453
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:54,480
Can you meet me at my office now?

454
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,280
We’ve been working on the promotion pla..

455
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,200
Hello, Mr. Phuwish.

456
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,440
Hello.

457
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:33,440
This is Noey, producer and owner of Sports Gossip show.

458
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,600
I'm here with great news, we want to film a promo segment for tomorrow’s match.

459
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,000
Go right ahead.

460
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,160
So, you're saying we get to promote on their show?

461
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,960
Uh-huh.

462
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,800
Oh, but I might need a small favor from you, Keen.

463
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,000
Can you come up with a little gimmick for it?

464
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,840
Just a simple chat might be too boring.

465
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,120
You’re free to go all out.

466
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,480
Got it, I’ll take care of it.

467
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,560
Great.

468
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,520
I know it’s a bit last-minute,

469
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,480
But I believe you can handle it, Keen.

470
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,640
Oh, and please take care of Yut for me.

471
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,720
Sure.

472
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,120
Mhm.

473
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
You’ll figure it out.

474
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,720
Keen.

475
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,000
Are you super stressed?

476
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,400
Who uses their real voice for this kind of thing?

477
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,760
You gotta switch to your second voice!

478
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
Come on, try it.

479
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Keen~

480
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
Keen~ Don’t stress, okay?~

481
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,520
Thun and I ~

482
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,520
will punch all your problems away!~

483
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,600
Hey.

484
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,720
Don’t worry.

485
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,200
You’ll come up with something.

486
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,200
I haven't drank it today.

487
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,000
Can Thun have a sip?~

488
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
Please~?

489
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,640
Here you go.

490
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,640
Please hold this.

491
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,360
Thun!

492
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,120
I've figured out what we’re gonna do for the show!

493
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,920
Hello everyone!

494
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,240
Let me take you behind the scenes and show you what the fighters’ dressing room looks like.

495
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,000
Let’s see how everyone’s getting ready.

496
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,480
Whoa~ Looks like Keen is busy right now,

497
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,360
so let’s skip him for now.

498
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,840
Who's behind the curtain, everyone?

499
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,320
Let me pull it open for you!

500
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,720
Peekaboo! Oops!

501
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
No one saw anything, okay?
Get lost, Mai!

502
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,600
No one saw!

503
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,720
They’re getting dressed!

504
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,240
Whoa, can I take this back to wear at the gym, Bung?

505
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,600
What, are you jealous of me or something?

506
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,560
Nah.

507
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,920
It’s just that a guy like me looks good in anything.

508
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,960
Ugh, so annoying.

509
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,240
Alright, let’s keep moving.

510
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,280
Than, say hi to your fans real quick!

511
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,400
Whoa, Than looks insanely handsome today.

512
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,480
That’s why he’s my number-one idol, everyone.

513
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,080
You’re hyping me up this much and I’ve only got twenty baht on me.

514
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,720
Doesn’t matter how much, I’ll take it all.

515
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,720
Times are tough, after all.

516
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,000
Anyway, that’s a quick peek at the dressing room.

517
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,800
I’m gonna end the live here, folks.

518
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,320
Signing off for now!

519
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,080
I’ve never dressed like this before.

520
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:51,760
If it wasn’t for this shoot, I probably never would’ve worn something like this.

521
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,760
Well then, wear it again tonight.

522
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,120
But just the bunny ears.

523
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,680
Sure thing.

524
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,160
Hey!

525
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,200
Keep your voice down, people might hear us.

526
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,560
Let go.

527
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,560
Let go!

528
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,240
You know what, better take it off.

529
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,600
Because you look best in this outfit, Ait.

530
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,040
Take care of it, yeah?

531
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,560
Of course.

532
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,280
Bro...

533
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,800
What?

534
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,600
Hi everyone!

535
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,240
I noticed you guys have been working since super early this morning,

536
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,880
so you probably haven’t had anything to eat yet.

537
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,040
I’m all dressed now, so I stopped by and got some donuts for everyone.

538
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,680
Ooh!

539
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,080
Please help yourselves!

540
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,560
Handsome and kind too, wow!

541
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,920
This one’s for you too.
Thank you so much, Yut.

542
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,040
From a famous shop too!

543
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,280
Perfect timing! I was just getting hungry, you totally read my mind.

544
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,640
Oh, Than!

545
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,840
Didn’t think I’d see you again until the event itself.

546
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,320
Keen, I’m feeling kind of thirsty.

547
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,320
If it’s not too much trouble…

548
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,920
Oh, of course! One sec.

549
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,320
Thanks!

550
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,160
Here you go.

551
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,640
Hey!

552
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,480
Oops!

553
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,800
I'm really sorry.

554
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,320
I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to spill it.

555
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,440
It’s okay.

556
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,320
I'm really sorry.
It’s alright,it's just a small splash.

557
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,280
No big deal.

558
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,440
Keen, can you go help test the equipment?

559
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,320
Sure, no problem.

560
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,160
Sorry again!

561
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,720
It’s fine, really.

562
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,160
Mai, let’s go.

563
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,480
The host sits here, right?

564
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,160
Yeah, that’s right.

565
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,240
Okay, got it.

566
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,080
And...

567
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,040
And the guests…

568
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,200
Got it. One, two, three, four, five.

569
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
And this area in the back…?

570
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,880
That’s all set up already, right?

571
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,400
Great, let me know if there’s anything else I can help with.

572
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,040
Will do.

573
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Mai!

574
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,200
It looks so awesome.

575
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,240
Try it!

576
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,120
Can I really hit it, Keen?

577
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,000
Go for it, full power.

578
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,600
Alright, film me!

579
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,800
Got it.

580
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,040
Alright, here we go.

581
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,240
Whoa.

582
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,600
Woah.

583
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,320
Wow.

584
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,600
I’ve got a knack for this, huh?

585
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,800
That's really good.

586
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,240
You’re strong, Mai.

587
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,800
Of course!

588
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,840
I’ve trained a bit too, you know.

589
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,880
Everything’s ready now.

590
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,720
You can get started.

591
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,720
Thanks so much!

592
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,400
Right this way.

593
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,600
Mai.

594
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,680
Let's have our fighters sit inside first.

595
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,720
Got it.

596
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,400
Come on.

597
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,680
Whoa, look at that!

598
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,880
Hello everyone,

599
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,040
Welcome to another episode of Sports Gossip! I'm your host, Noey.

600
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,720
Today we’re joined by the fighters from Hero Fight,

601
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,760
as well as the event promoter, Keen! Let’s give them a big round of applause.

602
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,640
Before we get started, let’s have Keen,

603
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,240
the promoter of this event,

604
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,000
tell us a bit about the concept and how this event came to be.

605
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,840
Hero Fight is an event hosted by the Petchsak Gym.

606
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,840
The event's Theme is hero versus hero

607
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,880
which was inspired by Thun and Yut's story.

608
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,280
Which is the leading match for this event.

609
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,680
Wow! The main fighters are this cool and handsome?

610
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,720
That's so interesting!

611
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,240
Today, our show is teaming up with Keen to come up with some fun activities

612
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,360
to showcase the fighter spirit in each boxer, right?

613
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,320
That’s right! It’s like a warm-up before the big event.

614
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,120
Ah, a warm-up!

615
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,920
And this might be the warm-up machine, right, Keen?

616
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,640
Exactly!

617
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,800
Hey, this looks fun and exciting to play.

618
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,880
Let’s not waste any more time.

619
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,800
Team, please go ahead

620
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,520
and set up the machine.

621
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,800
Shall we all move over there together?

622
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,000
Let’s see who scores the highest!

623
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,760
Here we go, Keen!

624
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,440
Let’s test the fighter power of each boxer, shall we?

625
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,160
Let’s do it.

626
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,360
Starting now!

627
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,720
Whoa, and that’s just the first one!

628
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,640
Give them a round of applause!

629
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,640
Alright, next person, come on up.

630
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,160
Small but mighty! Come on!

631
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,280
Whoa!
Wow!

632
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,560
Everyone’s putting up big numbers!

633
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,160
Bung!

634
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,920
You got this, Bung!

635
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,600
Great form and a beautiful face too!

636
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,320
Beautiful face and beautiful form, that’s what you get with this camp!
And the score is high too. Amazing!

637
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,720
Give her a round of applause!
Great job!

638
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,920
Next up is Ait.

639
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,640
Ait.

640
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,400
Please step up, Ait.

641
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,840
Sure.

642
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,160
Oh no, Ait’s score is kinda low…

643
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,360
He's warming up.

644
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,440
He’s just warming up, warming up! No worries.

645
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,400
It’s all good, it’s just a warm-up. Don’t stress.

646
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,000
Alright, give it up for Ait, everyone!

647
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,920
Now we’ve arrived at our main fighter!

648
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,520
Thun, please come up.

649
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,840
Go Thun!

650
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,960
Okay, if you’re ready, let’s begin.

651
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,120
Whew! Thun!

652
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,880
Amazing numbers!

653
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,040
Truly fitting for the main event.

654
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:22,960
Exactly.

655
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,320
Powerful punches!

656
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,640
Highest score so far!

657
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,560
Might’ve broken the machine!

658
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,440
Next is Yut, also one of our headliners.

659
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,480
If you’re ready, go for it!

660
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,280
We heard you’ve been away from the ring for a while, right?

661
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,840
Exactly.
Let’s see how you do… let’s see…

662
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,320
Whoa, Yut!

663
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,320
Give it up for Yut, everyone!

664
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,480
His punches are insanely powerful!

665
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,840
Even stronger than Thun’s!

666
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,680
Are you sure you’ve really been retired from boxing?

667
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,960
People say you’ve been out of the game for a long time,

668
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,520
so how are your numbers still this high, Yut?

669
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,600
Well, I actually still exercise every day.

670
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,360
Hey, let me see—wait, no I can’t!

671
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,400
Thun!

672
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,880
You can’t underestimate him now.

673
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,160
Your opponent is seriously strong, he works out every day!

674
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,760
Right?

675
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,720
Alright, how about we take a short break.

676
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,200
We’ll be back in just a bit for the final segment.

677
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,960
This is our last part, so we’ll have one rep

678
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,960
say some closing words about this Hero Fight showdown.

679
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,440
Sure.

680
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,960
I’d like to ask everyone to support the show.

681
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,800
Even though this is Keen’s first time as a promoter,

682
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,720
he’s really giving it his all—everyone is.

683
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,360
Please cheer everyone on,

684
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,640
including me too.

685
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,360
There’s definitely some chemistry going on here.

686
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,080
Yut and Keen—aww, so cute together!

687
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,400
Ahh, stop, I’m blushing!

688
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:58,200
Come on, play it up! If the ship gains traction, maybe we’ll sell more tickets!

689
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,080
Well?

690
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:19,440
Yut and Keen!

691
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,280
Whoa, they even made a heart sign!

692
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,520
They made a heart! So cute, I’m dying!

693
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,480
Thun!
Hey! Thun!

694
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,360
What’s your deal?
Thun!

695
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,520
Thun!
Say something!

696
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,720
Wait, what?

697
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,440
Hey!

698
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,120
What’s wrong with you?

699
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,400
Thun?
Thun?!

700
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,640
Hey! Hey!
Thun!

701
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,680
Hey! Hey! Uh…
Thun!

702
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,760
Oh shit…

703
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,560
And that was the show we prepared!

704
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,560
If you really want to see these two fight for real…

705
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,680
Don’t forget to buy tickets and come to the event!

706
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,960
Ah, a surprise?

707
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,640
Yup!

708
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,000
It’s a surprise!

709
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,840
Give them a round of applause!

710
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,840
Let’s all go see the real thing at the event!

711
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,280
And that’s it for today. Goodbye, everyone!

712
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,320
Goodbye.

713
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,560
Whoa, turns out it was all staged?

714
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,280
Right?

715
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,320
Right, boss?

716
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,880
Uh… okay then. Surprise.

717
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,720
You planned this.
It’s okay.

718
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,440
You planned this.
Yes, yes.

719
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,080
It’s okay.

720
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,400
I think their relationship might be real.

721
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,560
Yeah, looks very real.
Thank you.

722
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,000
Thun, why can’t you control your emotions?

723
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,560
He harassed you! You want me to just let it go?

724
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,520
It’s not like I'm not mad.

725
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,120
But who would’ve thought he’d do that?

726
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,600
This is a live show—what if we can’t sell the tickets?

727
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,560
You really had to go as far as becoming a fake couple with him?

728
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,800
Maybe it’s not just about selling tickets anymore?

729
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,680
You really want to know, huh?

730
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,200
Ait, are you ok?

731
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,200
I’m not okay at all.

732
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,400
I got a lower score than Mai whose not even fighting.

733
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,720
What am I supposed to do?

734
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,360
What if I lose to him…

735
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,200
It’s okay, Ait.

736
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,520
Don’t say another word.

737
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I get it.

738
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,040
But winning or losing, that’s decided in the ring, Ait.

739
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,960
Thanks, boss.

740
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,800
You’ve got this, Ait.

741
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,000
Aaaah!

742
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,600
This match is a war for love?!

743
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,520
I wanna go watch!

744
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,760
You mean Hero Fight?

745
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,280
Hmm… more like a battle for her heart.

746
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,800
And when Yut and Keen,

747
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,120
they made a heart shape together~

748
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,320
Then Thun just ran in and grabbed Yut’s collar!

749
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,640
But honestly, don’t they have great chemistry?

750
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,360
Yut, the former fighter?

751
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,080
He’s now a rescue worker.

752
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:53,880
And Yut and Keen used to volunteer at a children’s hospital together.

753
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,240
Remember that time

754
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,080
when he helped Keen who was getting beaten up?

755
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,280
The whole feed was obsessed with the hero-fighter storyline.

756
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,640
After that, his gym even posted boxing tutorials.

757
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,520
It broke the internet!

758
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,880
So spicy.

759
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,960
Let’s just think for fun~

760
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,080
Who do you think is Keen’s real match?

761
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,440
What do you guys think?

762
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,480
Don’t forget to comment!

763
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,840
And hit that heart button too!

764
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,160
(Tickets Sold Out)

765
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,840
Yay!

766
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,120
We did it!

767
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,600
All sold out!

768
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,240
You did it, Keen.

769
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,160
You really did it.

770
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,640
Well well, look at you two making it official.

771
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,000
You’ guys are officially dating, huh Thun?

772
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,920
It’s not like I’m hiding.

773
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,320
Psh, I never hid it.

774
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,200
Never once.

775
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,800
I’ve never kept it secret.

776
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,920
Thanks so much, Keen, for giving us this match.

777
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,720
Huh? What did you say, Bung?

778
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,320
Say it louder!

779
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,800
You deaf or what, Mai?

780
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,680
Need me to clean your ears out?
Don’t!

781
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,480
Help!
Clean your ears sometimes!

782
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,160
I should be thanking you too, Keen.

783
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,800
You finally made it happen.

784
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,600
Now we get to put on the event!

785
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,720
Yes!

786
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,520
I’m really happy you joined our gym, Keen.

787
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,320
You’ve helped me and Win so much.

788
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,360
Thank you so much, Keen.

789
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:40,920
If it weren’t for everyone, I couldn’t have done it either.

790
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,880
You’re amazing, Keen!

791
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,760
Come here! Let me give you a hug!

792
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,360
Easy there, Mai, you brute.
Mai, seriously.

793
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,360
Wow, you’re so good, bro.

794
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,000
Total top contender.

795
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,200
Hope you keep up that strength.

796
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,920
Oh, I’ve got it, don’t worry.

797
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,640
Can’t wait to see. Can’t wait to see!

798
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,440
I’m so happy.

799
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,160
About what?

800
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,200
Today’s the first day I truly feel like part of the gym.

801
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,040
What are you talking about?

802
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:52,040
You’ve been part of our gym for a long time.

803
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,400
Feels like I got my family back.

804
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,920
Your family never went anywhere.

805
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,480
I will always be your real match.

806
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,160
You mean it?

807
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,320
Hello.
I never thought this day would come.

808
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,520
Keen and boxing...

809
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,960
they're worlds apart!

810
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,280
But hey, here we are!

811
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,400
Alright.

812
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,040
Let’s go!

813
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,360
Keen, you did an amazing job getting this many people to come.

814
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,120
Give the camera a smile too.

815
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,560
Don’t just smile at Keen.

816
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,040
Look over at this camera, please.

817
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,040
Now for the final match of the night, a historic bout between…

818
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,520
The Tiger-Taming Cannon and the Master of Martial Arts!

819
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,880
The Tiger-Taming Cannon and the Master of Martial Arts!
Woo!

820
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,680
Round one.

821
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,560
You’ve totally got this—don’t be scared, don’t be shaken by any of it.

822
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,040
Stay calm when you throw a punch.

823
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,240
You know that, right?

824
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,200
Yes, Coach.
