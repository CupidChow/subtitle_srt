00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,920
Let me go.

3
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,200
Let me go!

4
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,320
Let me go.

5
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,240
You’ve got some nerves.

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,400
(Uncle Petch)

7
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,040
(Keen, where are you?)

8
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,000
(I’ve sent Thun after you.
Have you met him yet?)

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,040
I think...

10
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,280
I found him.

11
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
Just you wait!

12
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,440
Let’s go.

13
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,240
Are you okay?

14
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,560
Okay.

Next person.

18
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,640
Kirin Rojanamethipong.

19
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,680
It's me.

20
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,400
Recently graduated…

21
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,960
No experience.

22
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,640
You all came to apply to my company today…

23
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,400
Do you know what our company does?

24
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,680
The company imports electronic parts.

25
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,680
And also relates to crypto coins,
providing coin trading services.

26
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
And most importantly,

27
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,320
this is the first company
that produced Thai coins.

28
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,160
Incorrect.

29
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,760
DH Corp.

30
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,320
does not have its own coins,

31
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,520
but rather chooses
to invest in other coins.

32
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,840
Additionally, it provides
a full-service crypto wallet.

33
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,800
DH Wallet T-2

34
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,400
is the latest model of hardware

35
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,920
that needs to be encrypted
with 24 English words,

36
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,160
making it so even
a supercomputer can't decipher it.

37
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,640
Therefore, it is the safest.

38
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,480
Alright.

39
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,080
Thank you very much for coming today.

40
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,320
If anyone passes to the second round,

41
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,840
we will notify you via email.

42
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,320
- Okay.
- Okay.

43
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,880
Recently graduated, so talented.

44
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,160
What a show-off.

45
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,400
Since I lack experience,

46
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,240
I've got to prepared everything.

47
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,520
It's you.

48
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,000
Don't overthink it.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,760
He was joking.

50
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,200
(Are you Kirin?)

51
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,920
Yes.

52
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,200
Would you like to see
your father's face one last time

53
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,280
before he is placed in the coffin?

54
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,040
He was attacked by a large dog.

55
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,320
It might not be a pleasant sight.

56
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,360
You can close it now.

57
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,920
It's alright, Keen.

58
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,480
He rested in peace now.

59
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,000
Keen, that's alright.

62
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,400
The account number is on the bill here.

Got it.

Are you alright?

72
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,960
Sure?

Your dad's friend?

78
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,680
He is a boxing coach who trained
the Tiger Taming Canon, you know.

85
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,840

I'm here to collect your father's debt.

What debt?

125
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,880
What debt?

126
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,960
The debt your father borrowed from us
and then defaulted on.

127
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,600
What debt?

128
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,600
Don't be coy...

129
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,880
and try to run away, huh?

130
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,680
Where’s the proofs?

131
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,520
Nonsense.

After the funeral ends,

133
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,360
let's take Keen home.

134
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,480
Where did he go?

135
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,000
Come here.

136
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,960
Let me go.

137
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,080
Let me go!

138
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,040
Search him!

139
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,880
Let me go.

140
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,160
I said, let me go!

141
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,800
Let me go.

142
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,560
Come here.

143
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,440
Let me go.

144
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,320
Give my money back!

145
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,200
Let me go.

146
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,920
Can you believe this?

147
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,680
Money from Petchsak Camp.

148
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,560
What a tiny little help
from your dad’s friend.

149
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,680
Give it back.

150
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,320
You scare me?

151
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,600
Give me back.

152
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,800
Let me go.

153
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,160
Do you want it back?

154
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,240
Come and get it.

155
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,520
Give my money back.

156
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,400
Give my money back.

157
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,480
- What the heck!
- Give my money back.

158
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,960
No way.

159
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,320
Hey, what's up with Thun?

160
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,720
I don't think he's coming, dad.

161
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,080
Don't do it.

162
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,240
Don't.

163
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,800
Don’t you think I can fight you?

164
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,200
What are you gonna do?

165
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
Leave me alone.

166
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,840
What do you think you’re gonna do, brat?

167
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,680
Thun is a weird man.

168
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,080
Will he be here or not?

169
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,400
Will he fight or not?

170
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,360
I have no idea what he's thinking.

171
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,120
You already know.

172
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,120
Since that incident, he refused to do anything.

173
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,200
Just leave him alone, dad.

174
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,840
Asking for trouble?

175
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,120
Let me go.

176
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,680
We can end this easily if you pay.

177
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,600
Why?

178
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,400
Do you want this so bad? huh?

179
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,840
If you want it, take it.

180
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,120
Come get it.

184
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,720

Just you wait!

189
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,680
Go.

190
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,280
I think...

191
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,320
I found him.

192
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,560
Are you okay?

193
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,720
Okay.

194
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,480
Dad, there they are.

195
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,480
Thun, Keen.

196
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,080
Keen, Thun.

197
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,520
What happened?

198
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,320
Probably got jumped?

199
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,800
Two days ago, I heard news that
robbers were around here.

200
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,760
Which way did they go?

201
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,280
I'll give them the works by myself.

202
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,360
You go grab Boong and Ait.

203
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,040
Which way did they go, Keen?

204
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,200
Thun?

205
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,120
The thugs said they came
to collect my dad's debt.

206
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,920
I don't know if it's true.

207
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,000
Besides the wounds on the face,

208
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,960
are there any other wounds
or internal injuries?

209
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,720
Here's the thing.

210
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,320
I'll make a referral letter for you to get
a medical check-up at the hospital,

211
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,560
and after you finish the check-up,

212
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,040
you bring the medical certificate
back to the police station.

213
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,680
About the loan shark,

214
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,280
if there are evidences or witnesses,

215
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,560
come back and talk to me again.

216
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,240
It's settled then.

217
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,440
You.

218
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
Hey, you.

219
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,560
Okay.

220
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,520
Does it hurt?

221
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,160
Your name is Thun, right?

222
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,480
My...

223
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,400
My name is Keen.

224
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,480
Thank you.

225
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,960
Well, let me.

226
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,960
Thank you.

227
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,400
Be careful.

228
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,880
What will you do next?

229
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,240
Should we head back
to the boxing camp first?

230
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,720
(Petchsak Boxing Camp)

231
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,920
Soy milk for you.

232
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,160
Thank you.

233
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,640
Keen,

234
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,200
you can stay here as long as you want.

235
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,120
I don't mind.

236
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,840
I think that staying at the flat
won't be safe.

237
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,080
Uncle Petch,

238
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,280
if my dad is really in debt,

239
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,720
what kind of debt could it be?

240
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,040
Or is it the debt from when
your mom was sick.

241
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,200
But my dad sold the house
for that debt a long time ago.

242
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,840
He might be afraid you'd worry,

243
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,640
so he didn't want to tell you the truth.

244
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,720
But...

245
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Never mind.

246
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,280
Keen,

247
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
for tonight,

248
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,440
you sleep over in Thun's room.

249
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
Why does it have to be me?

250
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,320
You've been sleeping alone
for a long time, haven't you?

251
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,360
I can sleep anywhere, Uncle Petch.

252
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,200
Come on, just go sleep with Thun.

253
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,200
You can sleep here tonight.

254
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,840
Wait.

255
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,920
I'm sorry for bothering you.

256
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,280
Once I get a job,

257
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
I’ll be on my own.

258
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,440
Keen.

259
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,160
Come pray your mother.

260
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,960
Yes, just a moment, Dad.

261
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,320
Come light the incense.

262
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,880
Yes.

263
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,040
I've finished, Dad.

264
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,720
Thank you.

265
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,760
I'll be home late tonight, Keen.

266
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,560
For the food left on the table,

267
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,120
you can have it warmed up
in the microwave, Keen.

268
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,520
Please pack some to eat
at the station, too, Dad.

269
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,000
I can't finish it all alone.

270
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,680
If you can't finish it,
you can save it for two days.

271
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,560
I'm going to work a part-time job today.

272
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,440
Are you tired?

273
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,880
If you're tired,

274
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,400
you can quit the job.

275
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,640
Just Keen alone,

276
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,840
I can take care of you.

277
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,480
Dad,

278
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,680
it's okay, I'm fine.

279
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,720
I want to lighten your burden.

280
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,800
Remember this,

281
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,600
I will always be by your side.

282
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,640
Just focus on your duties, Keen.

283
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,040
I will wait to see your success, Keen.

284
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,320
Sure, Dad.

285
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,280
Just wait and see.

286
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,800
If she were here, it'd be better.

287
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,120
Let's go to work.

288
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:40,320
(The applicant passed the first round of interview and
has an appointment for the second interview with DH Corp at 10:30 AM.)

289
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,600
(Petchsak Boxing Camp)

290
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,600
Speak of the devil.

291
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,480
I'm here.

292
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,520
You took long enough.

293
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,080
Come, come.

294
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,520
Here comes the food.

295
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,840
Keen,

296
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,200
come eat together.

297
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,760
Okay.

298
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,480
Come, come.

299
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,880
His name is Keen.

300
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,600
He's the son of Sergeant Chit, my friend.

301
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,000
He will stay with us during this period.

302
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,840
Have a seat.

303
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,920
Hello.

304
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm Ait, a boxer here.

305
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,200
And this is Boong.

306
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,040
Let's eat.

307
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,720
And what about the other boxers?

308
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,640
It's just us.

309
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,880
The other boxers have moved
to another camp following Typhoon.

310
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,160
Hey.

311
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,880
Where did you sleep last night?

312
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,200
Thun is always like this?

313
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,720
Why do you want to know?

314
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,080
Just ignore him.

315
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,480
Don't think too much about it.

316
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,520
Thun is really just like this.

317
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,360
Let's eat.

318
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,000
You can dig in.

319
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,080
Get in the car, kid.

320
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,960
You've got the wrong person.

321
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,200
Where are you going?

322
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,040
Let me go.

323
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Hello, Kanchit's son.

324
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,720
We finally meet.

325
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:09,760
What are you saying?

326
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,440
You can pay off the debt now,
and everything will be over.

327
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,840
Bullshit!

328
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,800
I don't even know who the fuck you are.

329
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,240
Why should I believe you guys?

330
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,800
Let me go.

331
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:33,040
(Please, my son is about
to graduate. I really need the money.)

332
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,520
(That house means a lot
to Keen and me.)

333
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,120
Do you believe now
that your dad owes me?

334
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,360
You can't do this to me.
I’ll call the cops.

335
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
Are you really going to
call the cops?

336
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,520
You know what?

337
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,760
Everyone at the station
owes me money.

338
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,880
Do you think the cop will help you?

339
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,720
This is just an appetizer.

340
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,200
He's looking at my face.

341
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,560
What are you gonna do?

342
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,200
I'll do this.

343
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,160
Come.

344
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,200
Come here.

345
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,280
Come here.

346
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,200
Mark my words.

347
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,960
You got this,

348
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,640
because you owe Ms. Muay.

349
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,960
What are you gonna do?

350
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,280
Let me go.

351
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,440
Let me go.

352
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,080
What are you doing?

353
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,560
Let me go.

354
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,360
Let me go.

355
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,320
Stop.

356
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,000
I said stop. Let me go.

357
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,000
Let me go.

358
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,280
So, you’re gonna pay up?

359
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,920
Where the hell I’m going to find the money?

360
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,680
Petchsak.

361
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,480
It's Petchsak.

362
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,640
The boxing camp.

363
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,480
They've got a lot of money
from The Cannon, right?

364
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
You should

365
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,560
get money from that boxing camp
and pay me back.

366
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,680
Otherwise,

367
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,480
you’ll get this over and over again.

368
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,560
You tough?

369
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,960
He's looking at my face again.

370
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,240
Try to consider it.

371
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,040
Aww, you're looking at my face.

372
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:08,920
Get out.

373
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,960
Find the way back by yourself, kid.

but I have got an accident.

378
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,840
Could I still make it now?

379
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,840
(Oh dear! Why don't you
call us tomorrow?)

380
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,200
( We already got someone,
maybe next time.)

381
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,600
(Uncle Petch)

382
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,920
( Keen, it's late now. Are you alright?
Why haven't you come back?)

383
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,400
Hey.

384
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,720
Do you want to go to the hospital?

385
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,120
Let's go back.

386
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:14,920
Go.

387
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,920
Thun.

388
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,560
Can you stay by my side for now?

389
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,120
Hang in there.

390
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,120
Done.

391
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,240
Was it those guys again?

392
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,200
Yes.

393
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,840
Their boss's name is Ms. Muay.

394
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,960
Darn it.

395
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,800
What made him choose

396
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,040
to borrow money from Ms. Muay?

397
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,320
Chit was like this.

398
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,720
He wouldn’t slip a word
when he got into trouble.

399
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,400
Thun,

400
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,640
from now on, please take care of Keen.

401
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,640
Just pity him.

402
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,120
Look at him now.

403
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,080
Thank you for dressing my wound.

404
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,320
It's nothing.

405
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,960
Uncle Petch,

406
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,480
do you have any work for me?

407
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,040
In the camp?

408
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,080
Yes.

409
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,480
What can you do?

410
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,920
What are you doing?

411
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,400
I come to sleep with you.

412
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,720
Go sleep properly.

413
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,600
If anything happens to you,

414
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,000
Coach will blame me.

415
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,760
Then why don't you go to sleep
in the room properly?

416
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,000
Okay.

417
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,840
Then I’ll sleep in my room.

418
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,280
Uncle Petch told us
to sleep together, didn't he?

419
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,200
Sleep by yourself.

420
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,400
I don’t want to sleep with anyone.

421
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,520
Hey.

422
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,840
What's wrong with you?

423
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,920
What's with you?

424
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,680
Do you have feelings for me?

425
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,920
Is that why you don't dare
to sleep together?

426
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,520
Listen.

427
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,840
I want to sleep alone.

428
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,760
But you have to take care
of me, don't you?

429
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,240
Do I have to take care in your bed too?

430
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,640
If it's too troublesome,

431
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,800
then I'll go back to sleep at the flat.

432
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,520
If you dare, go ahead.

433
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:38,800
Fine.

434
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:57,960
Whatever.

435
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,160
If you want to sleep here, then sleep.

436
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,920
Go sleep on the bed.

437
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,000
I'll sleep on the floor.

438
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:13,760
No.

439
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,640
I'll sleep on the floor.

440
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:48,760
(Boxing News: Thun raises the boxing belt.
News: Thun wins many competitions.)

441
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:59,040
(Boxing News: Tiger Taming Cannon, the undefeated boxer,
is so strong that no one wants to fight him.)

442
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,280
Hey, you.

443
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:06,840
Did you doze off?

444
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,320
I know you're awake.

445
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,000
What is it?

446
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,720
No boxing matches lately?

447
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,720
No.

448
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,080
Why?

449
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,040
Don't you want to fight?

450
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,480
I do.

451
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,200
So,

452
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,000
do you want to fight anyone in particular?

453
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,840
Anyone will do.

454
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,640
If I can find some matches
for you, will you fight?

455
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,320
Stop questioning and sleep.

456
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,600
Okay.

457
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,200
Good night.

458
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:49,400
(Typhoon, former number 2 boxer of the Petchsak Boxing Camp,
won the Muay Thai Championship for the new P. White Tiger Camp)

459
00:51:49,400 --> 00:52:02,080
(P. White Tiger Camp
welcoming Typhoon Roaring Sky)

460
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,520
(Typhoon Roaring Sky, former friend of Tiger Taming Cannon, won the championship
again.)

461
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,520
Are you feeling better?

462
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,200
(Since moving to P. White Tiger Camp, it seems his life has only been on the rise.)

463
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:36,640
(I think if the two fight, it's definitely
going to be intense. I really want to see it.)

464
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,120
True.

465
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,280
Cash cow.

466
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,040
Why?

467
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,160
Why are you checking out?

468
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,400
What are you looking for?

469
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,760
I saw that he used to be
in the Petchsak Boxing Camp.

470
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,080
Alright.

471
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,480
Can you tell me why he left?

472
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,480
Please tell me. I want to know.

473
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,800
Why? What happened?

474
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,320
I won't tell you.

475
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,920
Bro, tell me.

476
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,520
Win,

477
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,440
why are you sitting
and playing games here?

478
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,800
I asked you to get the scale
to be fixed. Is it fixed yet?

479
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,280
Oh, Dad.

480
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,080
I'm not playing games? I'm trading.

481
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,200
Don't go yet.

482
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,480
Tell me first.

483
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,680
Nice, sweep well.

484
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,320
Keep it strong.

485
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,320
You sure like giving orders.

486
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,120
Whose car is that?

487
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,080
Are they here to see coach?

488
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,920
Hey, I know her.

489
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,880
Where is Keen?

490
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,000
The man who's

491
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,160
tall, fair-skinned, and looks

492
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,840
cute.

493
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,400
Over there?

494
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,280
Thank you.

495
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,480
You know,

496
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,920
it's Klao, who's a reporter.

497
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,800
I'm following her page.

498
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,520
She's cute.

499
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,480
Come here.

500
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,480
Keen,

501
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,480
you suddenly called and told me that
you faced a debt-collecting gang.

502
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,600
And what is this?

503
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,880
You ran and hid here at a boxing camp.

504
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,760
Uh-oh, what a mess.

505
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,400
I'm sorry, Sis.

506
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,800
It's somewhat urgent.

507
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,040
I need your help with something.

508
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,000
I know you are experienced in sports industry.

509
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,000
What is it?

510
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,680
Do you know this person?

511
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,000
It's Pakorn,

512
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,760
a boxing camp promoter

513
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,920
and also the owner
of the P. White Tiger Boxing Camp.

514
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,240
Why?

515
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,560
Can you take me to him?

516
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,560
I'd like to ask for his help.

517
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,000
Are you crazy?

518
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,760
What do you want him to help with?

519
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,200
No, no.

520
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,480
Why would he help you?

521
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,880
The boxer fee or the purse
in this camp isn't very high.

522
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,960
Only Thun purse is THB 200,000,
excluding prize money.

523
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,800
And

524
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,880
how much is the usual prize money?

525
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,320
It depends on each match.

526
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,280
In the latest match, he won
and got THB 300,000.

527
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,480
Split half and half with the camp.

528
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:37,720
Why?

529
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,720
Are you trying to find matches for Thun?

530
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,400
What if I can do it?

531
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,080
Can I get a piece in percentage?

532
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:50,800
How much?

533
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,080
30.

534
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,120
Too much.

535
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,880
It's more than half of what the camp gets.

536
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,000
I think 10.

537
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,920
That's just right.

538
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,440
So, if the first match I get is for Thun,

539
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,120
can I get 20?

540
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,440
If you don't just talk the talk,

541
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,440
I'll give you the 20 as you asked for.

542
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,000
Deal.

543
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,480
I got it.

544
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,760
I didn’t think it will be this coincidence.

545
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,120
because I'm about to have
an interview with him.

546
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,120
- You can secretly tag along.
- Can I?

547
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,720
But, don't tell anyone
that I told you about this.

548
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,920
Thank you, Sis.

549
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,200
What are you gonna do?

550
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,240
I just want to get out from this shitty life.

551
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,440
This means the success
of the P. White Tiger Camp

552
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,360
didn't gain easily at all, right?

553
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,440
Nothing comes easy.

554
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,680
I'm a boxer.

555
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,640
Victory comes with scars.

556
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,200
Everything comes with a price we must pay.

557
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,320
Keen,

558
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,880
I'd better go back. I don't want
to mess with Pakorn.

559
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,680
Would you like to promote
any boxing program lately?

560
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,800
The Roaring Tiger Fight will have
a special program this Friday.

561
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,800
The main event boxer
will fight against Typhoon

562
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,200
from my own boxing camp.

563
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,280
Currently, I'm looking
for a fair-match fighter.

564
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,240
I guarantee it will be fun.

565
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,440
This is very exciting.

566
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,880
Anyway, I want to sincerely
thank you, Mr. Pakorn,

567
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,600
for the honor of having you on our show.

568
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,920
See you next time.

569
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,800
That's all for today. Goodbye.

570
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,720
Cut.

571
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,320
Thank you very much.

572
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,520
Um, Mr. Pakorn.

573
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,520
Are you in a hurry? Because

574
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,520
I would like to have
a moment of your time.

575
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,960
Someone wants to talk to you.

576
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,240
Come now.

577
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,440
Hurry up.

578
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,840
This is

579
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,240
Keen, my junior.

580
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,080
Hello.

581
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,800
I'm Keen from the Petchsak Boxing Camp.

582
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,080
Please schedule our appointment later.
I'm in a hurry today.

583
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,280
Hello.

584
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,640
Win.

585
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,840
How are you, Win?

586
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,440
Is your dad doing well?

587
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:44,480
Yes.

588
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,360
Could you please listen to what he says?

589
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,120
Well,

590
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,960
I have a boxer that I think
you might be interested in.

591
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,560
If we are to discuss this,
let's schedule it for another day, Win.

592
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,400
I would like to let Tiger Taming Cannon

593
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,440
have a battle with Typhoon Roaring Sky.

594
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,800
Well,

595
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,320
if we present a story that

596
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,440
Thun and Typhoon were best friends
in the same camp before,

597
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,520
and they both had a quarrel,

598
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,160
falling out, then having to
get back in the same ring,

599
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,000
I think people would want to watch it.

600
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:39,800
It's like

601
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,480
best friend turned enemy.

602
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,240
That's true.

603
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,160
That's a good idea.

604
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,160
The ratings will definitely go up.

605
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,200
Best friend turned enemy?

606
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,280
So, your dad agreed, right, Win?

607
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:02,840
Yes.

608
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,880
Alright, I agree.

609
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,200
Then, I'll add a hundred thousand
to Thun's purse.

610
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,480
But you can't change your mind.

611
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,400
Okay?

612
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,520
Yes.

613
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,480
Good.

614
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,440
Did you ask Thun?

615
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,120
- Don't tell me...
- I'll handle it.

616
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,240
What's up?

617
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,440
I need to talk to you.

618
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,080
- Wait until you're done.
- Hold on.

619
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,960
Can you help me in the shower?

620
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,080
It stings if the wound gets wet.

621
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,280
You can still use your hand.

622
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:04,640
I know.

623
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,040
But I want you your hand.

624
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,680
How's training going?

625
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,760
Just normal training.

626
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,000
And

627
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,720
if it's a pre-fight training,

628
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,880
is it like a regular training?

629
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,400
Well,

630
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,520
regular training,

631
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,040
but with a bit of weight control.

632
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,000
Why are you asking about training?

633
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,440
I found a match for you.

634
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,360
When?

635
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:07,920
Next month.

636
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,200
With whom?

637
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,440
I came to collect your father's debt.

638
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,320
Petchsak.

639
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:22,840
Didn't that boxing camp make
a lot of money from The Cannon?

640
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,920
So, if the first match I get is for Thun,

641
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,680
can I get 20?

642
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,240
Deal.

643
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,640
Best friend turned enemy?

644
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,240
Then, I'll add a hundred thousand
to Thun's purse.

645
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,840
Did you ask Thun?

646
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,560
- Don't tell me...
- I'll handle it.

647
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,080
With Typhoon.

648
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,280
In this camp, you're the one
with the highest earnings.

649
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,360
I'm doing this for the camp,
and also for you.

650
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,600
If it's him,

651
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:45,720
I won't fight.

652
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:47,320
Why...?

653
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,640
Do you really not want to fight me that much...?

654
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,520
How long are you gonna look down on me?

655
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,280
You’ve never changed,

656
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,760
Listen to me first, alright?

657
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,840
If you agree to fight...

658
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:58,840
Just stop talking.

659
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,480
I'm gonna fight with Typhoon.

660
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,920
Tonight's Battle of Roaring Tigers

661
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:09,120
must be exciting and crazy.
