This series is a work of fiction.
It is not related to any real persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,195
Don't let them get away.

3
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,098
Find their scent.

4
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,400
Coach!

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:33,900
Coach Petch!
Dad!

6
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,401
Run!

7
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,769
Take care of yourself.

8
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,038
I'll take care of it.

9
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,575
Everyone looks terrible.

10
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:43,877
Give me the code.

11
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:48,581
Otherwise, he’ll end up just like your father, Kanachit.

12
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:51,117
Keen? Do you have the code?

13
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,118
No.

14
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:53,053
What?
Mawin!

15
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,587
Then why the hell did you agree to give it to him?

16
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:58,091
I know where we need to go.

17
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,347
Thun!

18
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,756
Thun!

19
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,445
Bung!

20
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,847
Mai!

21
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,415
Mawin!

22
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,117
Ait!

23
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,996
Keen, watch out!

24
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,661
Thun!

25
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,097
Thun!

26
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,799
Thun, calm down.

27
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,303
Thun!

28
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,740
Thun!

29
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,979
No!

30
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,814
Thun!

31
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,635
Are you ok?

32
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,874
You can tell me.

33
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,451
It's nothing.

34
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,854
I just had a bad dream.

35
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:23,403
Trap

36
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:56,929
Was I right not to tell everyone?

37
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,232
Everyone’s already risked so much because of me.

38
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,735
This whole thing started because of my family.

39
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,305
Uncle Petch got captured because of me.

40
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,874
I don’t want anyone else to get hurt because of me again.

41
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,243
It’s about us, not just you.

42
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,718
I have to take responsibility too.

43
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,924
Let’s go save Uncle Petch together, just the two of us.

44
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,537
Keen…

45
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:15,608
Are you sure about going there?

46
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,146
Yeah.

47
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,621
And…

48
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,190
Does anything still hurt?

49
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,869
Thanks, Thun.

50
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:54,113
Honestly, I’m still not sure.

51
00:06:56,115 --> 00:07:03,156
I just feel like if it were my dad, he would’ve hidden the code there.

52
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:06,352
Are you sure this is the place, Keen?

53
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,089
Mom…

54
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:49,395
I’m sorry I haven’t come to see you for so long.

55
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,900
Don’t worry about me.

56
00:08:56,135 --> 00:09:02,475
Right now, I’m trying to get justice for you and Dad.

57
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,150
Please help me.

58
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:18,357
Help me find what I’m looking for…

59
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:22,228
So no one else becomes a victim of Sia Thep like our family did.

60
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,058
This really is the place.

61
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,807
Keen.

62
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:13,613
Keen, that’s enough.

63
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,547
Thun…

64
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,248
No, Keen.

65
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,838
There’s nothing here.

66
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,508
There's nothing.

67
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,843
There has to be something.

68
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,112
Keen, that’s enough.

69
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,180
Dad must’ve left something with Mom.

70
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,201
Keen.

71
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,403
Keen, look.

72
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:30,056
What’s are you drawing, son?

73
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:34,427
This is Dad, this is Mom, this is me, and this is our house.

74
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,962
Wow! What’s that in front of the house? So colorful.

75
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,564
Flowers!

76
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:41,767
When I grow up, I’ll plant red flowers in front of the house.

77
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,303
So the front of our house will always be full of pretty flowers!

78
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,772
Hmm, that’s nice. I like it.

79
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,407
I think you should draw birds too.

80
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,309
Draw some more birds.
There should be flying birds.

81
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,045
Green ones.

82
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:35,287
Everything… it all points back to your old house.

83
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,561
I think we should go there.

84
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,797
I’m just worried Sia Thep’s men will be waiting.

85
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,569
I think it’s better if I go alone.

86
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:55,741
Once I know it’s safe, I’ll tell you to follow.

87
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,979
Do you even hear what you’re saying, Thun?

88
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,450
I’m sorry.

89
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,453
I’m just so worried about you, I lost sight of everything else.

90
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,532
I understand, Thun.

91
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,134
But we talked about this already, didn’t we?

92
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,208
Wherever we go, we go together.

93
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,217
I’m worried about you too.

94
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:45,057
Right now, you’re all I have left.

95
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,097
You’re here, Pakorn?

96
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:29,268
Did you get Keen and Thun?

97
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,905
Apologies, sir.

98
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,574
Our people are still out searching,

99
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:39,745
but we haven’t found them.

100
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,585
Jonathan must be hungry.

101
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,421
Could you feed him?

102
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,587
Pour it in the bowl, please.

103
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,180
Pakorn, I’ve been thinking…

104
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,984
Keen and Thun’s escape..

105
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:57,489
It smells like there was betrayal, don’t you think?

106
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,527
Who do you suspect, sir?

107
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:02,995
I’m not sure.

108
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:09,268
But everyone around me has reason to betray me.

109
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,605
Especially you.

110
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,377
Pakorn.

111
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,983
I really don’t want it to be you.

112
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,623
But I’m the one who delivered Thun to you.

113
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,495
Exactly, that’s what’s strange.

114
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:43,068
Over a decade ago, you did everything

115
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,938
to keep Thun from becoming my fighter.

116
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:49,475
You even went so far as to find that boy Yut to replace him.

117
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,180
So why the change of heart now?

118
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:03,288
After years working for you,

119
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:10,129
I’ve come to understand one thing. When you want something, you get it.

120
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,131
Good answer.

121
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,038
Then I’ll give you a chance to prove yourself.

122
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,873
And if you fail,

123
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,842
you know what will happen.

124
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:34,553
I’ll follow your orders, no matter what.

125
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,923
About the Heaven Arena event.

126
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:43,562
I want you to oversee it from the ground up.

127
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,299
But now, I’ve got one more mission for you.

128
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:52,471
I’m not sure if Keen is playing any tricks.

129
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:56,208
I want you to prepare a backup plan.

130
00:17:56,208 --> 00:18:02,014
Catch Thun and Keen and get me the code.

131
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,319
Understood.

132
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,122
Very good.

133
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,962
But… who’s Typhoon’s opponent?

134
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:35,481
(Bank Property – No Trespassing)
(Violators will be prosecuted under criminal law. If you see anything suspicious, please notify the bank 24/7.)

135
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,917
(Property for Sale)

136
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,343
Are you serious, Keen?

137
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,110
Yeah.

138
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,787
Let’s go.

139
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,765
Let’s go look.

140
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,665
Did you find anything, Keen?

141
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,868
Nothing.

142
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,023
Thun, do you think we’re even looking in the right place?

143
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,025
We have to be.

144
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,328
Trust yourself, Keen.

145
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,964
But we’ve been looking for so long

146
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:43,435
and still haven’t found anything that looks like a 24-word English code.

147
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:48,206
If it were that easy, anyone could’ve found it.

148
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:54,446
Your dad must’ve believed only you could uncover it.

149
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:29,047
The answer we’re looking for might be simpler than we think.

150
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,049
If we open our hearts.

151
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,221
Sometimes the answer is easier than we think.

152
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,396
There’s no riddle that can’t be solved.

153
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:48,533
Sometimes the answer is easier than we think..

154
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,302
If we open our hearts.

155
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,938
If we open our hearts.

156
00:22:58,744 --> 00:22:59,811
Yeah.

157
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,581
But… how do we open our hearts?

158
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,498
Heart…

159
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:27,572
“Keen, don’t draw there.

160
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,142
Come draw at the table instead.”

161
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,511
“Sorry.”

162
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:36,848
“Look what you’ve done, my sofa’s all dirty now!”

163
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,452
Thun, get up.

164
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,787
Come on.

165
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:42,954
Hurry.

166
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,597
Heart…

167
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,668
Open heart.

168
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,407
Open.

169
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,658
To Keen

170
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:12,444
Wait… is this…

171
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,841
Please…

172
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,811
remember…

173
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,248
Dad…

174
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,085
Mom…

175
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,454
truly…

176
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,391
love…

177
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,928
Keen…

178
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:10,168
Could this be…

179
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:17,969
“I hope you’re okay. I’m sorry…

180
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:28,380
I believe this is the only way I can fix the mistake I made.

181
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:38,156
I hope you can smile again

182
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,628
and live a happy life.

183
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:54,839
Always remember that your mom and I love you very much, Keen.

184
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,376
We’re proud of you.”

185
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,347
Whoa!

186
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,349
The code really was here!

187
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,652
Haha!

188
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:46,991
Hand over the code, and nobody gets hurt.

189
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:54,532
You want a bullet in your mouth or something?

190
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,588
Keen, watch out!

191
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,823
Keen! Watch out!

192
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,165
Hey! Shit!

193
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,840
Enough!

194
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,276
Give me the code.

195
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:14,279
Or he dies. Now!

196
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:25,190
Try me, if you touch my friend,

197
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,192
I’ll burn this code right now.

198
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:33,097
This code is worth a lot to your boss, right?

199
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:38,303
Think about what Sia Thep would do

200
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,505
to a lackey who screws up and loses it.

201
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,106
Put the gun down.

202
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,275
Why the hell should I trust you?

203
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,846
I could just kill him and take the code from you after.

204
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,347
Don’t!

205
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,951
Fine, if you think you’re faster than me, then try it.

206
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,224
Argh! Damn it!

207
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,375
Hey!

208
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,034
Hey, are you okay?

209
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,036
No…

210
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,846
You alright?

211
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,848
I’m okay.

212
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:09,994
Let me patch that up for you.

213
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,597
Wow..

214
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,437
Hold on.

215
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,343
Does it hurt really badly?

216
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,444
Yeah.

217
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,111
It hurts?

218
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,046
Yeah.

219
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:36,587
But it’s fine, at least my head finally came in handy for something.

220
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:37,789
So your head’s finally useful, huh?

221
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,356
Exactly.

222
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:39,891
Very funny.

223
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,193
Geez, I was just worried about you.

224
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,861
Still not letting up, huh?

225
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:44,729
What now?

226
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,765
That’s enough.

227
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:49,767
I was worried about you!

228
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,670
Thank you.

229
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,541
No problem.

230
00:32:56,541 --> 00:33:00,678
Besides helping you guys, I did it to help my dad, too.

231
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,794
Hello, Pakorn.

232
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,899
I have something important to tell you.

233
00:33:54,899 --> 00:34:00,605
About Heaven Arena, the place where Keen will exchange the code for Coach Petch.

234
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,607
Why?

235
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:07,078
Run away, it's a trap.

236
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,618
A trap?

237
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,753
What do you mean?

238
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,890
Whether you have the code or not.

239
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,793
Sia Thep will never let you two go.

240
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,695
He’s already ordered his men to capture you.

241
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,697
But there’ll be tons of people at the event.

242
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:29,567
Haven’t you seen what Sia Thep is capable of?

243
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,470
Is there anything he wouldn’t do?

244
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,909
But we’re going to save my dad.

245
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,745
If you go, everyone will end up dead.

246
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,214
Are you saying we should just let my dad die alone?

247
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:44,348
Bro…

248
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,986
Coward!

249
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:34,765
Um…

250
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:38,669
Thun, as your father…

251
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,205
Stop calling yourself my father!

252
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,817
What are you waiting for?

253
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,353
Gonna stall another ten years?

254
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:07,165
I’m sorry I was never a good father.

255
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,386
I want to hear it from you.

256
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,388
Why did you leave me?

257
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:40,464
Ten years ago, when you were still a kid,

258
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:46,103
Phuwish came to see you box and was impressed with your skills.

259
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:49,473
He wanted you as a fighter in his private ring.

260
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:54,545
But I made a deal, I told him I’d follow all his orders

261
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,216
if he let you go.

262
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,586
I didn’t want you ending up like the boxers in his camp.

263
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:06,557
So you protected me… by breaking the law?

264
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,025
Yes.

265
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:12,563
I did everything I could to protect our family.

266
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,600
Then you really are a coward, just like I thought.

267
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,903
I risked my life to protect you,

268
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,972
and you call me a coward?

269
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:25,943
What you should have done was stand up to Sia Thep.

270
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,854
Please.

271
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:40,291
You don’t have to forgive me yet,

272
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:44,895
but tell me what I have to do for you to believe in me.

273
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,131
Don’t go to that match.

274
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:52,637
I have to, I need to save Coach Petch.

275
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:53,904
But Thun, it's...

276
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:58,709
If you’re really willing to do anything to protect me,

277
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:02,246
then help me take Sia Thep down.

278
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:12,523
Prove to me you’re not a coward.

279
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:02,907
Come on.

280
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,810
I’ve prepared everything, sir.

281
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,914
This way, please.

282
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,575
Sia Thep’s men are everywhere.

283
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,751
It’s just like Pakorn said.

284
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,152
They’re all over the place.

285
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:56,927
The main match is probably about to start.

286
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:58,929
Ok, let's wait.

287
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,767
Get ready, guys.

288
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,700
Hey, Poppy.

289
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:43,607
Thun “Tiger-Taming Cannon,” what are you doing here?

290
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,283
I’m sorry, Poppy.

291
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,020
Sorry for what?

292
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,827
Hey, don’t!

293
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,562
Let me go!

294
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:05,162
I'm going on the ring soon!

295
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,163
Let me go!

296
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,832
Let me go, damn it!

297
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,268
Ow!

298
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:12,336
Let go!

299
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,672
Why are you tying me up?!

300
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:15,272
Let me go!

301
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,640
Calm down, Poppy. Just be quiet.

302
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,742
Let me out, I’m supposed to fight!

303
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:19,643
Let me go!

304
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,644
I’m sorry, Poppy.

305
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,645
Let me go!

306
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,379
I’m really sorry.

307
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:23,447
Hurry.

308
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:28,052
Let me go, quick!

309
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:36,026
It’s almost time for the main event. I wonder where's Keen and Thun?

310
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:58,776
Good evening once again, ladies and gentlemen!

311
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:04,748
Welcome to Tiger Boxing World Stadium!

312
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:10,754
Woohoo!
Yeahhh!

313
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,557
After enjoying three thrilling fights,

314
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:17,995
we now arrive at the moment you’ve all been waiting for.

315
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:24,368
Our main event!

316
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,637
As you all already know,

317
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:35,012
this is gonna be exciting.
In the red corner, we have Typhoon “Roaring Thunder” from my own camp, P. White Tiger!

318
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:39,817
Yeah!
Woohoo!

319
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:47,091
And in the blue corner, a Thai boxer who’s made a name on the global stage!

320
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:51,028
Poppy “The Savage Crusher” from the IBF!

321
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:55,065
Ohhh!
Woohoo!

322
00:43:55,065 --> 00:44:01,905
But… we have a little surprise for you today.

323
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:05,776
A last-minute switch just for our honored audience—

324
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:10,648
The main event is now a revenge match lightning round!

325
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:16,887
In the red corner: Typhoon “Roaring Thunder”!

326
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:20,224
And in the blue corner:

327
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:43,747
Thun “Tiger-Taming Cannon”!

328
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:51,855
Woo!
Yay!

329
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,257
Fuck!

330
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:57,861
Pakorn, you traitor!!

331
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:02,166
Woo!

332
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:54,918
Let me just say this.

333
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,420
I didn’t take any drugs today.

334
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,422
I want to fight you fair and square.

335
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,623
Let’s settle this once and for all.

336
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:01,625
I want that too.

337
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:02,826
Secure Coach Petch.

338
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:04,495
We need to get out of here now.

339
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,497
Capture everyone from the Petchsak Academy!

340
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,065
Especially Keen.

341
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:10,701
At first, I thought your dad was trying to be a hero.

342
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,503
But no…

343
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:16,340
He came to get revenge for your mom, after we scammed her out of all her money

344
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,276
and she got so stressed that she had a brain aneurysm…

345
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,310
You bastard!

346
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,879
Keen!
