00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:28,040
This series is a work of fiction.
It is not related to any real persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,160
I’m sorry.

3
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,280
What you said was true.

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,560
I forced you into fighting Typhoon.

5
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,440
I won’t push you this time.

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,240
Are you mad at me

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,200
It’s fine.

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,080
If you had to force yourself to do it,

9
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,240
It would’ve been worse.

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,280
Thun the Tiger Taming Cannon will not be fighting...

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,040
He will be fighting...

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,040
with Typhoon Roaring Thunder.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,200
Then I guess your left hook isn’t heartless after all.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,720
Wanna find out if I’m truly heartless?

15
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,200
(Typhoon)

16
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,120
Do you like that?

17
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,920
I do.

18
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,800
If you do, then take it off for me.

19
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,280
(Typhoon)

20
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,800
Just answer it.

21
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,440
(Typhoon)

22
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,400
(Are you practicing?)

23
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,600
Why did you call?

24
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,960
I have something to ask.

25
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,600
(This time you really want to fight me, right?)

26
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,480
What exactly are you trying to say?

27
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,120
(Congrats on finally letting go of me.)

28
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,480
If that's all you wanted to say, I’m hanging up.

29
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,000
(I really have to beat you, Thun.)

30
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,720
The Fix

31
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,760
What’s going on between you and Typhoon?

32
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,680
In my life, he was all I had.

33
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Every time we trained,

34
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,360
we always trained together.

35
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,360
But I always held back.

36
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,600
I never thought that doing that

37
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,400
would make him think I was looking down on him.

38
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,120
But Keen, it’s all in the past now.

39
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Keen..

40
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,960
Thanks for sharing that.

41
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
Rest up for tomorrow.

42
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,560
Next weigh in is Thun, the Tiger-Taming Cannon

43
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
Keen.

44
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,040
Hmm? You’re staring.

45
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,800
Sorry, didn’t get much sleep last night.

46
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,920
If Thun doesn’t make weight, I’m blaming you.

47
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,560
For not fixing the scale.

48
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,720
We had to go use the coin-operated one at the street corner.

49
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,760
The one at the mall is still accurate.

50
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,360
I’ll fix it.

51
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,120
You all complain so much.

52
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,280
162 pounds.

53
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,000
He passed.

54
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,640
Still gotta fix it, though.

55
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,120
Next time we might not be so lucky.

56
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,480
I’m thirsty. Want anything? I’ll grab it for you.

57
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,320
I’m good.

58
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,640
Then take Thun back to the rest room.

59
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,520
I might take a while.

60
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,480
Dad.

61
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,960
Hey.

62
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,440
Hey, what are you doing here?

63
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,920
Then who’s watching Thun?

64
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,760
I came to get drinks.

65
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,200
Keen’s watching Thun.

66
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,120
One electrolyte, one water, and one Thai tea, please.

67
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,960
But would Keen even know what to do?

68
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,520
Come on, he’s done so much already.

69
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,840
Also, one more green soda, please.

70
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
This one too.

71
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
Alright, I’ll go check on Thun first then.

72
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,800
You catch up later.

73
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,840
Go ahead, Dad. I still have something to do here.

74
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,360
Wait.

75
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,440
Here.

76
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,480
Is this for Thun or for Keen?

77
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,840
It's for you.

78
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
You once said you liked green soda.

79
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,240
Have a little sugar, you look tired.

80
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,440
Thanks, bro.

81
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
No worries.

82
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,120
How much?

83
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Here you go, no need for change.

84
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,640
Water?

85
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,400
Sure.

86
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Oops, sorry.

87
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Want to try massaging me?

88
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Sure.

89
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Is that all the strength you’ve got?

90
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760
Harder.

91
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Deeper.

92
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,120
More.

93
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,960
More?

94
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,720
Yeah.

95
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,960
Is it usually this deep?

96
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Yeah.

97
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,920
Keep going.

98
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,960
Thun, here’s your electrolyte drink.

99
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What are you guys doing?

100
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,120
Oh, I was massaging Thun.

101
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Here, I got you an electrolyte.

102
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,600
You want to drink it now? I can keep massaging.

103
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,200
No need, come give me a massage instead.

104
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,640
Okay, then lie down.

105
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,160
Don’t go all out in the early rounds today.

106
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,200
Take it slow, conserve your energy.

107
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,280
Push in round three or four.

108
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,720
Got it?

109
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,840
Yes, coach.

110
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,840
I’m going to the bathroom.

111
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
Hold it there.

112
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,000
Just like that.

113
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,240
Go, go!

114
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,240
Stop! Go to your corner!

115
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,640
Blue! Blue!

116
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,680
Yeah!!

117
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,280
Thun vs. Typhoon!

118
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,640
You betting on Thun?

119
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,680
Of course, he’s from our gym!

120
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,680
He knocked out Typhoon in the last round.

121
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,480
No way he loses this one.

122
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,160
Well, if you’re that confident,

123
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,440
I’m putting down a big bet.

124
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,080
Hope you’re not throwing your money away.

125
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,320
Pakorn likes to bribe the judges.

126
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,440
Nonsense, man.

127
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,440
This time we’re getting a KO for sure.

128
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Just wait and see.

129
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:28,640
Hey bro, can I up my dose?

130
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,520
I can’t afford to lose this time.

131
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,480
If I lose to the same guy twice…

132
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
My future’s over.

133
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,000
But you know, once the drug wears off, it hurts.

134
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,320
The higher the dose,

135
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,160
the more it hurts.

136
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,520
And it’s bad for your health in the long run.

137
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,160
I know it only lasts 12 hours.

138
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Please, man.

139
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,520
( Yeah?)

140
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,880
Don’t tell Mr.Pakorn, I’m begging you.

141
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,520
Alright.

142
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,680
Hey!

143
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,240
Hey, hi Uncle Petch.

144
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,080
Hello.

145
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,440
You didn’t say you were coming.

146
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,000
Better late than never.

147
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,760
Come on, I’ve got work, you know.

148
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,840
Hey, but I made it in time for the previous match.

149
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,040
The blue corner got punched so bad their face was a mess.

150
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,280
Still won by points.

151
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,000
I bet the judges were bribed.

152
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What do you mean by bribed?

153
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,120
Huh? I’ll explain.

154
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,640
It’s pressure on the judges to favor certain fighters.

155
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,520
Keen,

156
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,120
come inside first, we’ll talk there.

157
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,040
Pressure on the referees from big bettors.

158
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,280
You go ahead, Uncle Petch is waiting.

159
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,000
See you.

160
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Sure.

161
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
Hey, there’s Keen and Bung!

162
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,640
Over there!
Oh,

163
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,360
you’re here too?

164
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,760
Hi!
Hi!

165
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,840
Wanna sit with us?

166
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,120
Come on, let’s go.

167
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,440
Welcome to the Redemption Fight Night!

168
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,040
Yeah!!

169
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,480
If you’re ready, the wait is over!

170
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,320
Give a big round of applause and cheer for our blue corner:

171
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:23,200
Thun, the Tiger-Taming Cannon from Petchsak Academy!

172
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,880
Known as the Heartless Left Hook!

173
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,320
Let’s see how heartless he really is.

174
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,720
Last time, Thun won by knockout.

175
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,120
Will tonight be the same or different?

176
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,280
And now, for the red corner, let’s hear it for

177
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,920
Typhoon Roaring Thunder from P. White Tiger Academy!

178
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,840
(Typhoon!)

179
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,000
Weighing 165 pounds,

180
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,600
standing 185 cm tall, 24 years old.

181
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,520
He’s here to settle the score.

182
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,280
Let’s see if he can turn the tables tonight.

183
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,120
Give it up one more time!

184
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,080
You got this!

185
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,440
The Cannon can really tame the Tiger, right?

186
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,160
Thun, don’t underestimate him.

187
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,840
He’s got punches too. Keep your hands up!

188
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,280
Stay focused! Let’s go.

189
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
To the blue corner.

190
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,960
Round one—fight!

191
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,960
Go get him, Thun!

192
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
Come on, Thun!

193
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,480
Good!

194
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
Don't lose focus.

195
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,360
Back to your corner!

196
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,400
Red, go! Red! Two times—who’s got it?

197
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,680
Cannon! Cannon!

198
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,960
Take your mouthguard out.

199
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,560
You got this, Thun!

200
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
You’re doing good, Thun.

201
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,160
Keep your hands up. Don’t get careless.

202
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,640
Don’t let emotions take over, got it?

203
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
Just keep those hands up.

204
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
He’s tougher this time.

205
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
But good job, good job.

206
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,440
Go Thun!

207
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,240
Here he comes!

208
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,160
Fifty thousand baht bonus for blue corner!

209
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,760
Yeah!!

210
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,720
Don't lose focus.

211
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,520
Thun, be careful.

212
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,800
Separate, separate!

213
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
Listen to the referee!

214
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,680
Thun, be careful.

215
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,560
Thun, fight!

216
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,960
Come on, P’Thun, give it your all!

217
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,680
Hang in there, Thun!

218
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,360
One more round and you've won.

219
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,240
(I really have to win this time.)

220
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,480
Fight!

221
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Keep fighting, Thun!

222
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Thun, move out.

223
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,360
Come on.

224
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,200
Come on!

225
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,040
Come on!

226
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,720
Come on.

227
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,400
Come on!

228
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,560
Come on!

229
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,240
Come on!

230
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
It’s done, it’s done.

231
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,760
Cannon!

232
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
Who’s got it?

233
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:09,520
Cannon!

234
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:29,120
Cannon!

235
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,720
What the hell kind of decision is that?

236
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,280
We clearly won by a mile.

237
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,520
I told you, this time wouldn’t be like before.

238
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,600
This time luck really isn’t on your side.

239
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,520
I told you guys, Pakorn…

240
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,120
he’d never let his boy lose for the second round, ha!

241
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,800
Those judges seriously don’t know what they’re doing?

242
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,560
Thun threw way more punches.

243
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,040
Ugh…

244
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,480
Damn it, he had to win!

245
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,680
Let it go, bro.

246
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,080
Shit, my money's gone, damn it!

247
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,200
Weren’t you betting at Mr. Thep’s table?

248
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,840
No need to stress, Mr. Thep’s easygoing.

249
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Damn it all.

250
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,640
Screw this.

251
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,360
You really wanted to win that bad, huh?

252
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,160
Huh?

253
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,800
It’s obvious the judges were biased.

254
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,280
Thun landed so many blows, how could he lose?

255
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,520
The blood on your face says it all.

256
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,160
Good you came.

257
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,480
The event’s yours, the boxer’s yours too.

258
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,000
And the judges—yours too, right?

259
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,880
Keen.

260
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,120
Cannon.

261
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,880
Typhoon, head back to your room first.

262
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,200
Yes, sir.

263
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,960
The judge’s decision is final.

264
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
Have some respect.

265
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,360
Take Thun to the interview backdrop now.

266
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,760
What do you think caused you to lose this match?

267
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
It’s normal.

268
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,520
Maybe I really was undertrained.

269
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,280
Guess we’re even now.

270
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,600
But most people think the result was fixed for Typhoon to beat Cannon.

271
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,880
What’s your take on that?

272
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,320
Is it true?

273
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,480
Whatever the case, I respect the judge’s decision.

274
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,480
It was still a really great match,

275
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
even though I lost.

276
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Can we get a photo, please?

277
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,280
Over here, please.

278
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,280
And here too.

279
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,280
Thank you.

280
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,240
I think this time was just way too much.

281
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,920
It was clear Thun won.

282
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,080
The judges were Pakorn’s people.

283
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,520
Probably just like they said, politics at play.

284
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
What are you looking at?

285
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,880
Nothing.

286
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,120
You really live up to your nickname, heartless.

287
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,640
Don’t you feel anything at all?

288
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,920
What kind of emotion do you want from me?

289
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,840
I’m hungry, does that count?

290
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
Let’s go.

291
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,160
Sorry I was a bit moody today.

292
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,840
I just can’t stop wondering how you lost.

293
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,560
I get it.

294
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
That’s boxing,

295
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,520
gambling’s always in the mix.

296
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,280
But are we really going to let it stay this way forever?

297
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,000
Feels like we're on a date.

298
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,080
What date?

299
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,520
It’s just the two of us in the restaurant.

300
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,560
Kinda romantic, right?

301
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,160
Why are you smiling?

302
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Nothing.

303
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,600
Just never seen Cannon Tiger Tamer grin this wide before.

304
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,400
We should’ve invited Mai to join us.

305
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,040
He’s been whining about wanting to eat outside of the academy for ages.

306
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,320
Come to think of it, this is our first time eating alone together.

307
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,600
We’ll probably end up doing it often.

308
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,640
Whoa.

309
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,640
You like it?

310
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,360
Mm-hmm.

311
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
I do.

312
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,640
You like this one?

313
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,560
Excuse me?

314
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,960
Is there any way I could get that plushie without playing the game?

315
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,200
Oh, if you want that one,

316
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,400
then go punch that machine over there.

317
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,360
If you score high enough, it’s yours.

318
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,760
Hey, no need—I’ll do it.

319
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,600
Hold this.

320
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,560
Hey.

321
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,400
You gotta throw your whole body into the punch like this.

322
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,760
Make a fist.

323
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,120
Then swing your whole body like this.

324
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,880
Give it a try.

325
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,240
Did that hurt?

326
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,960
Blow on it for me.

327
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,000
Blow on it?

328
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,000
Whoa, pain’s gone!

329
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
A bit dramatic?

330
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
Okay, okay—my turn.

331
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,640
Thanks.

332
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,400
Here.

333
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
Even though I lost today,

334
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,840
I’m really happy.

335
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,280
What about you, Keen?

336
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,840
I am really happy.

337
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Your faces match now.

338
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,160
Hello?

339
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,600
What time?

340
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,440
(Morning’s fine.)

341
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,360
Okay, got it.

342
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,640
What happened?

343
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,040
That was the flat owner.

344
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,440
I’ve got to clear my stuff out tomorrow.

345
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,160
I’ll come help.

346
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,480
Thanks.

347
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,120
Whoa, this new hospital is so pretty!

348
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,520
I’m glad you like it.

349
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,440
You’re going to get stronger now that we moved hospitals.

350
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,960
I’m already strong!

351
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,360
That’s great! Get well soon, Keaw.

352
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,720
Okay!

353
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,120
Excuse me.

354
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,040
Yes?

355
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,240
Your little sister is really lucky,

356
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
such a kind person helping out.

357
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,840
Can you sign here for the treatment consent?

358
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,400
Here you go.

359
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,720
Thank you.
Thanks.

360
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,120
So? You like it?

361
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,800
I do!

362
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,480
They even have cartoons for you to watch too.

363
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,160
Thanks for coming with me today.

364
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Of course.

365
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,160
Ait.

366
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,880
Can I ask you something?

367
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,600
Yeah?

368
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,160
Will you keep working massage jobs,

369
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,520
now that you don’t have to pay for Keaw’s treatment anymore?

370
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,120
Why do you ask?

371
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,360
Well, now that Keaw’s getting her new heart…

372
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,440
I was hoping you’d stop.

373
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,680
I’ll take care of you.

374
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
Is that okay?

375
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,360
Yeah.

376
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,800
I’ll quit.

377
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,560
From now on, I’ll finally get to be a full-time boxer.

378
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Well, well!

379
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,720
Heard you lost?

380
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,480
I just paid the last one off, why are you here again?

381
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,960
I’m not here to collect money, just passing by.

382
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,360
Thought I’d drop in.

383
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,240
So what do you want?

384
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,720
Jealous?

385
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,480
Anyway, thanks for paying it all off.

386
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,840
Your man is really something.

387
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,760
So impressive.

388
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,920
Ooh!

389
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,000
You smell so good.

390
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:25,960
Sa.

391
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,480
Yes?

392
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,880
Whose debt next?

393
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,480
That one, same as before.

394
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,720
Okay.

395
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,480
You shouldn’t have paid my debt.

396
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,200
It wasn’t your responsibility.

397
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,920
But I wanted to help you.

398
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,400
You really like to do things without telling me, huh?

399
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,160
If I told you, you wouldn’t have let me.

400
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,680
Sorry, I didn’t say anything.

401
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,240
But, Keen..

402
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,320
I just wanted to do something for you.

403
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,640
I’m sorry.

404
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,000
But I’ll pay you back when I can.

405
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,600
From now on, you’re debt-free.

406
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,920
Do you still want to stay at the academy?

407
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,120
Do you want me to stay?

408
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,480
Yes.

409
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,160
Stay with me, Keen.

410
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,080
So…

411
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,880
do you want a boxer as your boyfriend?

412
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,600
Do you?

413
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,680
Tell me.

414
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,440
There's too much dust.

415
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,720
You, should we change the way we call each other?

416
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,880
Do you want to?

417
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,960
Well, we’ve changed our relationship status,

418
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,960
so we should change how we address each other too.

419
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,560
Darling.

420
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,240
Right now, we’re together quietly like this. Are we really just going to let it slide?

421
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,040
Once we start… there’s no going back.

422
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,800
(Squeals)

423
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,120
What’s up, Mawin?

424
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,760
Didn’t you say you’d earn money from boxing to pay back Sia Thep?

425
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,080
Where’s my money!

426
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,360
Hey! What the hell are you guys doing?

427
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,240
If you don’t get it within a month…

428
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,560
you know what’s going to happen.
