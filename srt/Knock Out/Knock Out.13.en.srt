00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:28,248
This series is a work of fiction.
It is not related to any real persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:05,806
Thun.

3
00:01:05,806 --> 00:01:07,166
Wake up, there's some congee for you to eat.

4
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,934
Yeah.

5
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:12,365
Thun, wake up.

6
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,380
Wake up.

7
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:26,412
Hey, what's wrong? Didn't you get any sleep last night?

8
00:01:26,412 --> 00:01:28,412
It’s because of you.

9
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:05,425
Again?

10
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,686
It's cold.

11
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:07,935
If you’re cold, just put on a sweater.

12
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:10,955
I did, but it made me hot.

13
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,910
We’ve lived together so long and you’re still using the same trick to steal the remote?

14
00:02:37,747 --> 00:02:39,747
Then how about this trick instead?

15
00:02:39,748 --> 00:02:41,748
Ouch!

16
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,117
How do I change this?

17
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:52,521
Fine. You wanna play it that way?

18
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:02,817
Thun, give me the remote.
You little troublemaker.

19
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:05,305
Thun!

20
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:08,679
Alright.

21
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,102
Try this move!

22
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,483
Ow!

23
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:17,001
How’s that?

24
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:19,870
Come here!

25
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,638
Ouch!

26
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:23,165
One…

27
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:24,546
Two…
Thun!

28
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:26,450
Three!

29
00:03:32,683 --> 00:03:35,225
That really hurt, Thun.

30
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:42,884
What are you staring at?

31
00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:46,164
Hey! Hand it over!

32
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:50,368
Keen!

33
00:04:20,357 --> 00:04:21,717
It’s because of last night,

34
00:04:21,717 --> 00:04:23,879
that’s why I didn’t get any sleep.

35
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,591
Anyway.

36
00:04:28,591 --> 00:04:31,550
I made shrimp congee for you.

37
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,224
Hot and fresh.

38
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:38,431
Does it smell good?

39
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:49,293
Hey!

40
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:54,682
Thun, I told you not to add chili powder to the porridge!

41
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:56,682
You’ll get an upset stomach again.

42
00:04:56,683 --> 00:04:58,683
You never listen.

43
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:03,781
It tastes bland without it.

44
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:10,315
If you want to add it, then don’t eat.

45
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,083
If you're going to eat, hand me the chili powder bottle.

46
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:27,499
Give it here, Thun!

47
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:30,246
Give me the bottle, you're not eating it.

48
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,086
Thun.

49
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:31,772
No.

50
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:32,693
Give it to me.

51
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:34,258
No.

52
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:37,826
Give it to me.

53
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:38,739
I want to eat it.

54
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:39,614
You can't.

55
00:05:39,614 --> 00:05:40,642
But I want to.

56
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:42,330
Give it or your stomach’s going to get messed up again.

57
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,877
No.

58
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,609
Give it here, Thun.

59
00:05:46,609 --> 00:05:48,609
Come and get it, then.

60
00:05:49,854 --> 00:05:51,854
It’s up here.

61
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:57,508
Come get it.

62
00:06:29,707 --> 00:06:31,707
Hey!

63
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:33,751
That’s that.

64
00:06:33,992 --> 00:06:35,992
Now go finish your food.

65
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:38,677
Go eat.

66
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:47,741
You never listen.

67
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,212
Thun.

68
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:30,587
Yes, we have a private course if you want.

69
00:07:30,587 --> 00:07:33,961
Thun Tiger Taming Canon will be your instructor.

70
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:35,961
One, two, one, two.

71
00:07:45,744 --> 00:07:47,744
Like this, right?

72
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,841
Ouch!

73
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,897
Jay, come on, let’s keep going!

74
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:04,083
Alright, in one set now. One, two, three, four!

75
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,366
Sure, I can get it for you.

76
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:09,366
See you next week.

77
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:12,132
One, two.

78
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:21,776
Oh!

79
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:24,975
Hey Keen, I’ve got something I need your help with.

80
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:27,642
Nice, let’s do one more round.

81
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,508
Kaew!

82
00:08:31,508 --> 00:08:32,372
Hello, Keen.

83
00:08:32,372 --> 00:08:33,375
Hi.

84
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:37,440
Kaew wants to ask you to help tutor her in English.

85
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,138
Ait said you’re really good at English.

86
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:45,107
So I’d really like you to tutor me a little.

87
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:54,364
Alright, sure.

88
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:59,290
Stay with Keen and behave, okay?

89
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,864
I know! I’m not a little kid anymore.

90
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:03,421
Okay, then.

91
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:05,962
I’ll get going, look after Kaew for me.

92
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:08,309
See you. Bye-bye.

93
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:09,880
Bye!

94
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:32,259
So, what do you want me to teach you, Kaew?

95
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,780
Kaew.

96
00:09:39,516 --> 00:09:41,511
What do you want to learn?

97
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:43,757
Oh..

98
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:03,254
I want to learn this.

99
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:04,372
This.

100
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:15,000
Keen?

101
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,856
Yes?

102
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:19,510
Can we study out by the training area?

103
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:25,634
I want to sit somewhere open and comfy.

104
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,319
Is that okay?

105
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:32,109
Outside?

106
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:34,008
Yes, please.

107
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:39,633
Move your right foot more to the right.

108
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,436
Kick with your right leg.

109
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:42,600
Twist into it.

110
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,747
Right kick!

111
00:10:43,747 --> 00:10:45,230
Right kick!

112
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,676
Left!

113
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:52,949
Alright, Kaew. Today I’m going to teach you about W-questions.

114
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:55,338
It’s not hard, there are eight of them.

115
00:10:55,338 --> 00:11:01,220
There’s what, when, where, why, how, and then whose, whom.

116
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,220
Like what means?

117
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,991
For example, if I ask, What are you looking at?

118
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:10,104
I'm looking at the most gorgeous and handsome person of all time.

119
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:13,702
The combination of  strength and beauty.

120
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:19,988
Wait, are you talking about Thun?

121
00:11:19,988 --> 00:11:21,988
No! Eww!

122
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:24,795
Thun is your boyfriend.

123
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:26,071
I need it.

124
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:28,523
He...

125
00:11:31,046 --> 00:11:32,751
He what?

126
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:34,617
Friend. He’s my friend.

127
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:35,701
Friend?

128
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,310
Okay, that’s enough for today.

129
00:11:53,117 --> 00:11:55,609
Oh, hey Kaew.

130
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:58,590
What are you doing here?

131
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,128
Oh, I came to ask Keen to help tutor me in English.

132
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:09,592
Really? Even the top student needs extra tutoring?

133
00:12:09,592 --> 00:12:11,247
Huh?

134
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:13,483
Oh!

135
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:24,095
Uh... Jay, Phong’s been waiting a while.

136
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:27,888
Yes, Coach.

137
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,130
Hello.

138
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,010
I’ll go now, see you at school.

139
00:12:40,497 --> 00:12:41,906
You like Jay, don’t you?

140
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:43,763
How did you know?

141
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,089
Wow, it’s so obvious.

142
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:48,115
Anyone could tell.

143
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:49,273
Exactly.

144
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:52,274
Pretending to ask for English lessons

145
00:12:52,274 --> 00:12:54,968
just so you could peek at Jay, huh?

146
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:56,180
You’re sneaky.

147
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,101
Even from over there,

148
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:00,001
I could tell.

149
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:04,495
Can you promise

150
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:06,495
not to tell anyone?

151
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,804
Even Ait and Mawin don’t know yet.

152
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:10,425
Promise?

153
00:13:11,935 --> 00:13:13,640
Ah, fine.

154
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,499
We promise, our lips are sealed.

155
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:23,414
In that case… can you two help me win Jay’s heart?

156
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,760
No need to rush, Kaew.

157
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,577
Take your time, get to know him.

158
00:13:27,577 --> 00:13:30,374
You're in such a hurry.

159
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:31,797
Well,

160
00:13:31,797 --> 00:13:35,486
You're saying that because you don't know how to flirt.

161
00:13:37,808 --> 00:13:41,876
Come on, Kaew. I’ll help you.

162
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:45,239
Don’t listen to him,

163
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:46,902
he’s full of it.

164
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:50,398
But if you listen to me, you’ll have Jay falling for you in no time.

165
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:51,514
For real.

166
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:56,984
I’ll be watching.

167
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
Kaew!

168
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:31,184
What’s that in your hand? A love letter?

169
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:32,642
Yes!

170
00:14:32,642 --> 00:14:36,425
Whoa, super classic.

171
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,547
From my experience, if you like someone, just go for it.

172
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,788
Don’t hesitate, got it?

173
00:14:43,788 --> 00:14:45,788
Okay!

174
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,572
Should I go for it now?

175
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:49,686
Hmm?

176
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:52,464
Can you even drive?

177
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:55,372
If not, I guess I’ll have to learn right now.

178
00:14:56,022 --> 00:14:58,022
Kaew!

179
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,313
Ouch!

180
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:02,266
Kaew!
Jay!

181
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:04,005
Jay!

182
00:15:04,507 --> 00:15:06,507
Ouch!

183
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:09,241
Get up first.
Are you okay?

184
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,467
Are you hurt?

185
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:14,822
When I said go for it, I didn’t mean literally launch yourself!

186
00:15:14,822 --> 00:15:16,822
Maybe I went a little too hard.

187
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,260
Alright, get up.

188
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,714
Let’s go inside.

189
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:21,978
Ouch...

190
00:15:21,978 --> 00:15:23,715
It’s not too bad, right?

191
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:33,347
Listen. Put the pen here means

192
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:36,475
Place the pen here.

193
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:39,849
Take out your book means, take your book out.

194
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:43,589
Repeat after me means, say what I say.

195
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:47,012
Point to the picture means, point at the picture.

196
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:50,632
Clear the blackboard means, erase the board.

197
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:55,045
Draw a cat means, draw a cat.
Very good!

198
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:59,375
Colour the dog brown means, color the dog brown.

199
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:04,023
Go back to your seat means, return to your seat.

200
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:05,519
I’m going home now.

201
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,032
Oh, okay. Take care.

202
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:11,488
Bye.
Bye-bye!

203
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,541
Okay, let’s start over.

204
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:33,408
Forget everything Keen said.

205
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:43,616
If you like someone and want them to like you back,

206
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:46,256
you have to be ready to protect them.

207
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,996
Aah! Help!

208
00:16:51,996 --> 00:16:54,932
Help! Get out!

209
00:16:56,404 --> 00:16:57,567
Aah!

210
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,111
Stop!

211
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:01,457
Ouch!

212
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:05,979
Wait, Kaew!

213
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,618
What are you doing?!

214
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:11,614
I’m protecting Jay myself!

215
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,536
That’s my driver...

216
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,581
Driver?

217
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:17,660
Sorry about that.

218
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,334
It’s alright.

219
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:24,585
This is Phong, Jay's driver.

220
00:17:25,353 --> 00:17:27,791
He picks Jay up every day.

221
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,333
Haven’t you seen him before?

222
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:35,107
Sorry about that.

223
00:17:35,107 --> 00:17:37,121
It’s okay.

224
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:40,401
So what happened?

225
00:17:41,788 --> 00:17:46,497
It’s nothing, it’s just...

226
00:17:54,193 --> 00:17:55,701
I’m really sorry.

227
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,023
No worries.

228
00:17:57,023 --> 00:17:59,814
Mr.Jay, time to head home.

229
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:10,319
Ugh! I should’ve just asked Ait and Mawin for help, they’re lovey-dovey every day.

230
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,242
Please! We're the same!

231
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:16,086
No one’s lovey-dovey every day.

232
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:19,411
If you don’t believe me, go check it out yourself.

233
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:21,214
But you have to sneak.

234
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:25,616
Ait and Mawin never act sweet when others are around.

235
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:29,645
(Petchsak Boxing Gym)

236
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:31,990
Hmm.

237
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,118
Place your hand here.

238
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:34,941
Uh-huh.

239
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:35,728
Like that.

240
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:36,959
Exactly.

241
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:37,647
Right.

242
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:38,385
Yep.

243
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:40,109
Now try flicking it.

244
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:42,773
Like that?

245
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:44,689
Hmm, it looks good.

246
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:46,216
Do it again.

247
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:47,159
But gently this time.

248
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,518
Whoa, you’re pretty good, bro.

249
00:18:50,518 --> 00:18:52,665
Right? Natural talent.

250
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:56,439
You’re so good, I’ve got a reward for you.

251
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:58,925
What? What is it?

252
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:33,122
Who’s there?

253
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:37,924
Ait, I’m sorry.

254
00:19:37,924 --> 00:19:40,637
You okay?

255
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,260
Does it hurt?

256
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:47,478
Wow, I never see you two flirt.

257
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:51,259
Why?

258
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:54,790
You guys never flirt or what?

259
00:20:03,877 --> 00:20:06,168
I’m gonna go hang the laundry.

260
00:20:06,168 --> 00:20:08,269
It's probably all musty now.

261
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:10,269
Let’s go.

262
00:20:14,485 --> 00:20:16,042
Hey.

263
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:18,980
The washing machine’s behind the gym!

264
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:27,030
See? I told you so!

265
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,143
Who said we never flirt?

266
00:20:29,143 --> 00:20:31,143
We did, right, Thun?

267
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:33,546
Hmm…

268
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:38,353
You flirted with me first.

269
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:42,121
What? Says who?

270
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:43,776
You flirted first!

271
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:47,209
Oh yeah? When did that happen?

272
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:49,209
At the temple!

273
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:51,488
Temple?

274
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:53,411
Aah!

275
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:59,310
You stepped in to help me from some thugs because at that moment, I was just so charming and fragile.

276
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,626
So you risked yourself to protect me.

277
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:04,392
Nope, not true.

278
00:21:04,392 --> 00:21:07,961
Coach Petch told Thun to go get you.

279
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:12,785
I saw someone in danger, of course I’d help.

280
00:21:14,737 --> 00:21:16,737
Or maybe…

281
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:21,682
You fell in love with me at that moment?

282
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:23,239
What?! No way!

283
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:28,706
Who falls in love over something like that?!

284
00:21:34,028 --> 00:21:37,565
And when did I supposedly

285
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:39,565
flirt with you first?

286
00:21:41,577 --> 00:21:43,898
At the bathroom.

287
00:21:43,898 --> 00:21:45,898
When you asked me,

288
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,515
Can you help me shower?

289
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:04,630
That wasn’t flirting! I just wanted you to get back into the ring!

290
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,122
Mhm, sure.

291
00:22:12,317 --> 00:22:18,927
If we were really flirting, we’d have met at a bar, chatted each other up...

292
00:22:18,927 --> 00:22:20,927
Not done this.

293
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:27,256
But we’ve never done that kind of thing.

294
00:22:28,813 --> 00:22:33,426
Ugh, can I say something?

295
00:22:33,426 --> 00:22:38,381
If you’ve never actually flirted before, then just try it. It’d be adorable.

296
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:43,279
Anyway, I’ve got to work on my report now!

297
00:23:33,754 --> 00:23:35,754
Ugh...

298
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:50,509
What she said might actually work.

299
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:52,952
Should we try flirting with each other?

300
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:58,423
Why bother? We’re already a couple.

301
00:23:58,423 --> 00:24:00,423
Scared?

302
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:01,699
Who’s scared?

303
00:24:03,491 --> 00:24:05,491
Then let’s make it a challenge:

304
00:24:06,274 --> 00:24:10,277
Whoever’s heart races first, loses.

305
00:24:10,277 --> 00:24:16,114
Let’s play rock-paper-scissors, winner starts.

306
00:24:16,114 --> 00:24:18,114
Okay.

307
00:24:23,223 --> 00:24:26,011
Rock, paper, scissors!

308
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,000
Rock, paper, scissors!

309
00:24:32,363 --> 00:24:34,363
Rock, paper, scissors!

310
00:24:34,363 --> 00:24:38,376
Ugh, what is this?

311
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:45,498
Okay, let’s do a staring contest.

312
00:24:45,498 --> 00:24:47,498
Winner gets to start.

313
00:24:52,595 --> 00:24:54,595
Ready? Go.

314
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:27,609
Yes!

315
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,660
I won!

316
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,985
I'll start first.

317
00:25:35,443 --> 00:25:38,526
Whoever’s heart races first loses!

318
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:43,428
(Operation: Perfect Flirt Plan)

319
00:25:43,428 --> 00:25:46,476
Bro, why did you bring me here?

320
00:25:46,476 --> 00:25:47,853
How would I know?!

321
00:25:47,853 --> 00:25:51,011
I was dragged along too.

322
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:58,194
Thanks, everyone, for attending the presentation of my Perfect Plan to Flirt with Thun.

323
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:01,321
Let’s not waste time.

324
00:26:01,321 --> 00:26:10,795
I’m going to explain how my plan is guaranteed to make Thun’s heart race.

325
00:26:10,795 --> 00:26:14,071
It’s the ultimate sensual massage plan, candlelit and steamy.

326
00:26:14,071 --> 00:26:19,321
I’ll transform our bedroom into a romantic spa.

327
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:42,291
Wait, that’s too basic. You need something more surprising.

328
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:43,355
Surprising?

329
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:44,286
Mhm.

330
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:01,961
Why are you blindfolding me, Keen?

331
00:27:03,237 --> 00:27:05,729
Because it’s a surprise.

332
00:27:10,006 --> 00:27:12,006
Surprise!

333
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:30,000
Alright, please take off your clothes, sir.

334
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:33,458
Do I really need to?

335
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:08,433
Lie down on the bed.

336
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:13,514
Slowly now and down the other way.

337
00:28:13,514 --> 00:28:14,726
Turn the other way?

338
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:15,755
Yeah.

339
00:28:32,956 --> 00:28:36,680
How much oil should I use?

340
00:28:37,637 --> 00:28:41,016
Not too much, it gets sticky.

341
00:28:41,848 --> 00:28:42,666
Just a bit.

342
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:43,548
Sure.

343
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,089
Ok.

344
00:28:46,626 --> 00:28:47,838
Hey.

345
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,325
Whoa, isn’t that too much?

346
00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:51,376
Smells good, right?

347
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:59,070
It helps relax the body and rebalance your energy and spirit.

348
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,061
Just a little more…

349
00:29:01,804 --> 00:29:02,573
That’s enough!

350
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:03,553
Okay!

351
00:29:03,553 --> 00:29:05,204
If you’re gonna give a massage,

352
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:07,166
you have to really go all in, Keen.

353
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:09,727
Like, step on me if you have to.

354
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:12,232
Go all the way.

355
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:15,785
Wow, you weren’t into it just now.

356
00:29:15,785 --> 00:29:18,364
But suddenly you’re all enthusiastic?

357
00:29:21,068 --> 00:29:23,068
Step harder!

358
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:26,049
Ow!

359
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:27,964
Like this? Is that pressure okay?

360
00:29:27,964 --> 00:29:29,616
Yeah, this is good, right?

361
00:29:29,616 --> 00:29:31,361
Right, it’s okay?
Okay!

362
00:29:31,361 --> 00:29:34,125
It's ok?

363
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:35,822
If it’s too much, just let me know.

364
00:29:35,822 --> 00:29:37,005
Not too much at all.

365
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:38,630
Ow.

366
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:40,001
Right there!

367
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:41,055
Hold on a sec.

368
00:29:41,055 --> 00:29:42,360
Yeah, right there.

369
00:29:46,882 --> 00:29:49,088
Hey, hey.

370
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:50,251
Shit!

371
00:29:50,251 --> 00:29:51,650
What’s going on, Keen?

372
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:55,929
Nothing, Thun. Just lie down, I’ll keep massaging.

373
00:29:58,273 --> 00:30:00,000
You sure?

374
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,438
Yeah, I’ve got it under control.

375
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:08,710
Hey.

376
00:30:27,918 --> 00:30:30,657
Gently lift it.

377
00:30:30,657 --> 00:30:32,426
Just a sec.

378
00:30:32,426 --> 00:30:33,028
Go.

379
00:30:33,028 --> 00:30:34,410
Come on.

380
00:30:41,658 --> 00:30:43,412
All done.

381
00:30:43,412 --> 00:30:45,001
So? Looks good, right?

382
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:46,510
Looks awesome.

383
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:51,093
Thun, you just brought me here to watch a ghost movie?

384
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:54,570
Your plan to flirt with Keen is a bit basic, don’t you think?

385
00:30:56,983 --> 00:30:59,623
This is just the appetizer, Mai.

386
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,445
Let me tell you.

387
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:06,302
Hey, hey, not yet!

388
00:31:06,302 --> 00:31:07,752
I don’t wanna get spoiled.

389
00:31:07,752 --> 00:31:11,073
I mean, what if you're not ok with something?

390
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:16,398
I trust you guys.

391
00:31:17,181 --> 00:31:21,200
Whatever you want to do, go all out.

392
00:31:25,097 --> 00:31:26,161
Well said!

393
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:34,497
All I want is for Keen to be surprised and fall into my arms.

394
00:31:34,497 --> 00:31:35,193
Wow.

395
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,773
Then I’ll win.

396
00:31:36,773 --> 00:31:40,485
You can totally count on us.

397
00:31:44,192 --> 00:31:48,556
Man, you guys are so cringe.

398
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,651
You talk too much.

399
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:55,932
Get over here.
Whoa, Mai!

400
00:31:55,932 --> 00:31:57,144
Come on, group power!

401
00:31:57,144 --> 00:32:00,838
One, two! Yay!

402
00:32:03,344 --> 00:32:06,525
Step up, great job!

403
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:09,434
What are you doing?

404
00:32:09,434 --> 00:32:10,402
Wait a sec!

405
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,598
This is such a weird game.

406
00:32:19,222 --> 00:32:21,222
Go straight.

407
00:32:21,222 --> 00:32:22,892
Are we gonna hit the edge?

408
00:32:22,892 --> 00:32:23,862
Nope, we’re good.

409
00:32:23,862 --> 00:32:25,298
I'm watching, don’t worry.

410
00:32:35,225 --> 00:32:38,013
Well? Do you like it?

411
00:32:40,476 --> 00:32:42,574
What is this?

412
00:32:42,574 --> 00:32:44,146
We’re watching a movie?We’re watching a movie?

413
00:32:45,738 --> 00:32:47,154
Yeah.

414
00:32:47,154 --> 00:32:49,154
You’ll see.

415
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:16,029
Want some?

416
00:34:17,243 --> 00:34:19,244
Thun, the door’s creaky.

417
00:34:19,244 --> 00:34:22,524
Put some oil on it, it’s too loud.

418
00:34:26,804 --> 00:34:32,596
(Not working! On to the next plan!!)

419
00:34:40,753 --> 00:34:47,099
Help... Help...

420
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:25,425
Thun, there’s still so much dust in the air.

421
00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:28,209
Let’s go buy an air purifier tomorrow.

422
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Yeah.

423
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,032
Hey!

424
00:36:02,032 --> 00:36:02,850
Oww!

425
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,660
Ow, P’Thun, stop!
Hey!

426
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,757
Thun, don’t hurt me, please!
Whoa! Stop!

427
00:36:07,757 --> 00:36:10,236
Stop, stop!

428
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:12,236
This isn’t what we agreed on!

429
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,818
You said no punching!

430
00:36:13,818 --> 00:36:16,623
What the hell are you doing?! You scared the crap out of me!

431
00:36:16,623 --> 00:36:17,759
Ugh…

432
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:18,464
You okay?

433
00:36:18,464 --> 00:36:20,633
I’m not okay!

434
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:26,051
Didn’t you say you trusted us?

435
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:28,939
You said do whatever it takes to make Keen’s heart race and hug you.

436
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:31,549
We went all out!

437
00:36:31,549 --> 00:36:33,057
Look!

438
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,923
Argh!

439
00:36:40,548 --> 00:36:45,000
Bro, ghost face!

440
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:49,136
You're kind of cute when you're scared.

441
00:36:49,136 --> 00:36:51,136
My heart almost skipped.

442
00:36:55,236 --> 00:36:58,221
I’m in so much pain, bro.

443
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,121
It hurts like hell.

444
00:37:17,354 --> 00:37:18,812
What's wrong?

445
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:21,350
Mawin.

446
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,187
Do you think Thun and Keen will last?

447
00:37:25,266 --> 00:37:27,601
They won’t break up over something like this.

448
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:29,601
Yeah, seriously.

449
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:34,228
I’ve seen them argue all the time.

450
00:37:34,228 --> 00:37:37,280
But I think they love each other more than you guys.

451
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,895
Hey, that’s not true.

452
00:37:42,536 --> 00:37:44,536
If you don’t believe me.

453
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,304
Hey.

454
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:50,318
Whoa, what the heck?

455
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:52,387
Are you embarrassed in front of Mai?

456
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,175
I'm Jealous of Thun and Keen.

457
00:38:03,175 --> 00:38:06,061
Every time I see them, they’re always all lovey-dovey.

458
00:38:19,001 --> 00:38:21,001
Are you really mad at me?

459
00:38:29,085 --> 00:38:32,956
What do I have to do to make it up to you?

460
00:38:36,643 --> 00:38:41,647
Then kiss me on the cheek in front of Mai and I’ll forgive you.

461
00:38:43,963 --> 00:38:48,064
Kiss!
Kiss!

462
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,867
Do it, do it!
Hurry!

463
00:38:49,867 --> 00:39:08,423
Kiss!
Kiss!

464
00:39:08,423 --> 00:39:09,925
I’m kidding.

465
00:39:09,925 --> 00:39:11,727
Whoa.

466
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:15,000
As if I could stay mad at you.

467
00:39:36,766 --> 00:39:38,766
Looks like both our plans failed, huh?

468
00:39:43,785 --> 00:39:48,395
Who says? I still have a secret weapon.

469
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,666
Don’t get too cocky.

470
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:56,107
Your secret weapon doesn’t beat mine.

471
00:40:13,683 --> 00:40:15,683
Wow.

472
00:40:16,171 --> 00:40:20,781
Funny, when it comes to this stuff, we always agree.

473
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:25,260
Because it’s our special memory.

474
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:27,681
Yeah.

475
00:40:28,907 --> 00:40:31,744
We’ve come a long way, haven’t we?

476
00:40:36,465 --> 00:40:39,105
Here, let me light it.

477
00:41:02,311 --> 00:41:04,311
I'll try another one.

478
00:41:17,928 --> 00:41:20,836
Thun.

479
00:41:20,836 --> 00:41:23,230
It won’t light. It’s damp.

480
00:41:25,431 --> 00:41:27,776
Here, let me try.

481
00:41:44,782 --> 00:41:46,782
Stop, Keen.

482
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:07,140
Why are we always like this?

483
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:11,160
Why do we always try to outdo each other?

484
00:42:18,664 --> 00:42:20,664
Exactly.

485
00:42:22,647 --> 00:42:25,583
I don’t think we can keep going like this.

486
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:33,035
Should we just go back to being strangers?

487
00:42:43,108 --> 00:42:45,108
Keen.

488
00:42:46,285 --> 00:42:48,285
Keen!

489
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:30,238
Two whiskeys on the rocks, please.
Sure.

490
00:43:43,317 --> 00:43:46,943
Can I buy you a drink?

491
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:56,286
Why are you buying a drink for a stranger?

492
00:44:00,001 --> 00:44:09,142
I just want to get to know you. Is that okay?

493
00:44:13,395 --> 00:44:15,395
Sure.

494
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:41,138
But what about you?

495
00:44:44,499 --> 00:44:50,882
Someone as handsome as you must be taken.

496
00:44:53,744 --> 00:44:55,744
Nope.

497
00:44:59,049 --> 00:45:07,057
But maybe that person could be you, if you’ll let me court you.

498
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:13,519
Okay.

499
00:45:14,351 --> 00:45:17,484
If you can beat me first.

500
00:45:29,714 --> 00:45:31,714
Whoa.

501
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:37,425
Then do I even have a chance?

502
00:45:37,425 --> 00:45:41,740
I’ll give you head start, just hit the target once.

503
00:46:22,552 --> 00:46:28,546
The more stressed you are, the harder it is to hit the mark.

504
00:46:28,546 --> 00:46:31,038
You need to relax a bit.

505
00:46:37,689 --> 00:46:45,598
Maybe I’m missing on purpose so I can stay close to you.

506
00:46:45,598 --> 00:46:46,098
Ow!

507
00:46:46,098 --> 00:46:47,908
Hey, don’t block the way.

508
00:46:47,908 --> 00:46:49,071
Hey.

509
00:46:50,238 --> 00:46:51,795
Sorry.

510
00:46:51,795 --> 00:46:53,169
Yeah!

511
00:46:58,499 --> 00:47:00,499
It's ok.

512
00:47:00,499 --> 00:47:02,715
It's fine.

513
00:47:16,055 --> 00:47:19,037
I win.

514
00:47:19,037 --> 00:47:24,386
So that means I get to court you now?

515
00:47:26,501 --> 00:47:34,657
You kind of remind me of my ex.

516
00:47:35,673 --> 00:47:38,264
He always had to win.

517
00:47:41,171 --> 00:47:43,171
Really?

518
00:47:44,657 --> 00:47:51,032
And you’re not that different from my ex either.

519
00:47:51,032 --> 00:47:53,723
He always had to be in control.

520
00:47:53,723 --> 00:47:56,157
Always competing.

521
00:47:56,157 --> 00:47:59,389
And...

522
00:47:59,389 --> 00:48:04,670
Always doing everything to come out on top.

523
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:09,629
Honestly, he acted like a child.

524
00:48:09,629 --> 00:48:11,087
Hey!

525
00:48:11,087 --> 00:48:13,024
Ow! That hurts!

526
00:48:13,024 --> 00:48:13,947
Let go!

527
00:48:13,947 --> 00:48:16,475
Why? I can’t grab you back?
Why?

528
00:48:16,475 --> 00:48:18,057
You expect me to just give in all the time?

529
00:48:18,057 --> 00:48:20,211
You think the world revolves around you?

530
00:48:20,211 --> 00:48:22,946
Keep acting like this and we should just break up.

531
00:48:22,946 --> 00:48:23,908
I’m not breaking up.

532
00:48:23,908 --> 00:48:25,086
Why not?

533
00:48:25,086 --> 00:48:26,134
Why?

534
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,100
You don’t have the right to hurt people like this.

535
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,195
Ow!

536
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,016
What are you gonna do, huh?

537
00:48:35,016 --> 00:48:38,638
Stay out of it, this is between husband and wife!

538
00:48:38,638 --> 00:48:42,308
Husband and wife? We broke up ages ago.

539
00:48:42,308 --> 00:48:44,160
Move.

540
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,242
I said move.

541
00:48:52,277 --> 00:48:54,277
You’re dead, man.
Whoa!

542
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,927
Thun... Tiger Taming Canon.

543
00:49:03,927 --> 00:49:04,893
I’m taming you, punk.

544
00:49:04,893 --> 00:49:06,991
Sorry! I’m so sorry!

545
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:09,025
Sorry!

546
00:49:31,983 --> 00:49:33,983
Shit.

547
00:49:35,468 --> 00:49:40,369
Hey!

548
00:49:40,369 --> 00:49:42,369
Shit!

549
00:50:20,245 --> 00:50:27,219
At first, it seemed fine… but it ended in chaos again.

550
00:50:30,545 --> 00:50:36,140
Who says? I’ve still got one last move.

551
00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:46,088
Here.

552
00:50:49,069 --> 00:50:51,069
Let me light it for you.

553
00:51:22,982 --> 00:51:24,982
So pretty.

554
00:51:34,904 --> 00:51:36,904
What’s that?

555
00:51:36,904 --> 00:51:37,646
A heart.

556
00:51:37,646 --> 00:51:39,460
Correct.

557
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:49,339
A star.

558
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,058
That’s right too.

559
00:52:01,502 --> 00:52:03,502
Thun.

560
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:08,010
Do you think one day we’ll be like that?

561
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:11,635
Like… end up breaking up because we can’t find middle ground?

562
00:52:13,306 --> 00:52:15,897
Why are you thinking that?

563
00:52:18,196 --> 00:52:23,805
Because we’re still the same.

564
00:52:23,805 --> 00:52:30,000
Still arguing. Nothing’s changed.

565
00:52:33,771 --> 00:52:35,771
True.

566
00:52:37,218 --> 00:52:48,526
You're stubborn, bossy, always has to win.

567
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:16,453
But you know why I love you? Because you’re exactly like that.

568
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:32,001
Same goes for me.

569
00:53:34,102 --> 00:53:43,637
Overly sensitive, quietly stubborn, and always trying to win.

570
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,757
We’re still the same, aren’t we?

571
00:53:50,757 --> 00:53:56,598
Arguing about the same things, nothing’s changed.

572
00:53:58,203 --> 00:54:00,203
Can you accept that, Keen?

573
00:54:13,585 --> 00:54:20,559
But in the end, we always come back to loving each other.

574
00:54:21,794 --> 00:54:23,794
Yeah.

575
00:54:27,702 --> 00:54:33,740
Let’s keep loving each other like this for a long, long time.

576
00:55:07,249 --> 00:55:08,904
(Petchsak Academy)

577
00:55:15,987 --> 00:55:18,672
All of us came in a big group to eat like this…

578
00:55:18,672 --> 00:55:21,805
When Uncle Petch gets back from the temple, he’s going to complain again.

579
00:55:22,692 --> 00:55:24,347
Wow, Keen.

580
00:55:24,347 --> 00:55:27,190
Now that you have your own gym, you’ve totally forgotten about us.

581
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:31,500
Don’t you ever think about the times we spent together?

582
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,649
You’re being too dramatic, Mai.

583
00:55:33,649 --> 00:55:37,146
I can just tell coach that Kaew wanted to eat.

584
00:55:37,146 --> 00:55:39,728
He won't say anything.

585
00:55:39,728 --> 00:55:43,558
Fine, but only if there’s squid for me.

586
00:55:43,558 --> 00:55:45,444
Then I'm ok with that.

587
00:55:45,444 --> 00:55:47,310
Yeah, there is.

588
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,435
Go ahead and eat.

589
00:55:57,086 --> 00:56:02,097
Hey, have you two stopped trying to one-up each other?

590
00:56:02,097 --> 00:56:06,559
You're so sweet now, I’m seriously jealous.

591
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:15,000
Bung and Klao have been posting couple pics nonstop!

592
00:56:17,994 --> 00:56:20,367
Jealous of what?

593
00:56:20,367 --> 00:56:25,371
Everyone shows love in their own way.

594
00:56:27,832 --> 00:56:30,363
Ait, try looking at it positively.

595
00:56:30,363 --> 00:56:35,255
Maybe Mawin is just shy.

596
00:56:35,255 --> 00:56:38,662
But when you're with him,

597
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:43,275
aren’t those moments still special?

598
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:48,131
Your love doesn’t need to look like anyone else’s.

599
00:56:49,355 --> 00:56:52,975
Wow, Thun, that was deep.

600
00:56:52,975 --> 00:56:55,714
Super smooth.

601
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,430
Seafood’s here, everyone!

602
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:01,282
Here, here.

603
00:57:01,282 --> 00:57:04,776
Whoa.
Delivered right to your seats.

604
00:57:04,776 --> 00:57:07,277
Eat up, everyone!

605
00:57:07,277 --> 00:57:09,439
Come on, let’s eat.
It’s insanely fresh.

606
00:57:09,439 --> 00:57:11,384
Let's eat.

607
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:26,966
Ait.

608
00:57:26,966 --> 00:57:28,410
What?

609
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:31,806
Sneaking around like this is kind of nice, it’s exciting.

610
00:57:31,806 --> 00:57:34,060
I like it.

611
00:57:36,756 --> 00:57:38,756
Go on, eat.

612
00:57:48,512 --> 00:57:51,147
Hmm, Kaew?

613
00:57:51,147 --> 00:57:53,442
Who are you sending that picture to?

614
00:57:57,815 --> 00:57:59,815
Who are you sharing that with?

615
00:58:00,134 --> 00:58:02,134
Jay.

616
00:58:02,578 --> 00:58:04,332
Hmm?

617
00:58:04,332 --> 00:58:06,874
Aren’t you protective of your little sister?

618
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,701
Jay’s just my friend.

619
00:58:09,701 --> 00:58:12,679
Oh…

620
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:14,654
Friend.

621
00:58:14,654 --> 00:58:16,585
I see.

622
00:58:16,585 --> 00:58:20,035
Man, I almost cried.

623
00:58:20,035 --> 00:58:22,394
Not worried at all, huh?

624
00:58:24,867 --> 00:58:26,621
This squid is insanely good.

625
00:58:26,621 --> 00:58:27,369
Really?

626
00:58:27,369 --> 00:58:30,024
I took a bite and I was instantly by the ocean, man.

627
00:58:30,024 --> 00:58:31,297
By the sea, huh?

628
00:58:31,297 --> 00:58:33,069
Have you had any squid yet?

629
00:58:33,069 --> 00:58:35,315
Not yet.

630
00:58:35,315 --> 00:58:39,673
Let me get it for you.
Give her some.

631
01:00:11,807 --> 01:00:15,629
Tonight, I'm in charge, ok?

632
01:00:33,989 --> 01:00:37,310
You’re really going to let me sleep like this?

633
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:39,310
That’s kind of mean, isn’t it?

634
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,315
Oops, sorry.

635
01:00:59,228 --> 01:01:01,228
It’s okay.

636
01:01:04,726 --> 01:01:06,726
Sorry.

637
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,997
Come on, lie down properly. I’ll fix your pillow.

638
01:01:28,003 --> 01:01:30,003
Thun.

639
01:01:30,003 --> 01:01:31,841
Thun!

640
01:01:31,841 --> 01:01:34,164
Take that off!

641
01:01:34,164 --> 01:01:36,164
What are you doing?

642
01:01:36,164 --> 01:01:37,331
Hold still.

643
01:01:37,331 --> 01:01:39,358
Let go.
Hold still.

644
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:43,430
Thun, stop. What are you doing?

645
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:50,453
You know that I like to… win.

646
01:01:51,023 --> 01:01:53,023
Let go. Stop.

647
01:02:14,196 --> 01:02:16,196
Thun.

648
01:02:26,851 --> 01:02:30,752
Didn’t you say stop?

649
01:02:30,752 --> 01:02:34,919
Come on already.

650
01:03:26,144 --> 01:03:28,489
It’s okay, Keen.

651
01:03:30,103 --> 01:03:32,103
Aren’t you cold?

652
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:41,675
Just getting to hug you every night keeps me warm.

653
01:03:52,601 --> 01:04:00,954
Then let’s stay like this and hug forever, okay?

654
01:04:03,031 --> 01:04:05,031
Okay.

655
01:04:07,767 --> 01:04:09,767
Okay.
