00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:28,040
This series is a work of fiction.
It is not related to any real persons, places, organizations, or events.

2
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,320
He wants Thun to fight Typhoon again,

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,320
to give Typhoon a chance to redeem himself.

4
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,440
This was your doing, wasn’t it?

5
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,840
Pakorn made a deal with Uncle Petch himself.

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,760
I know now that you don’t want to fight Typhoon.

7
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,560
Where have you been?

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,720
It's because of these two guys.

9
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,960
My market is completely ruined!

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,560
You're under arrest

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,760
for fighting in public.

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,160
Sit down.

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,640
Why are you arresting me, officer?

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,040
Why don’t you go after those gang members instead?

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,040
Don’t try to run.
Why are you arresting us?

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,880
Everyone involved will be brought in.

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,920
Let us go right now!

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,400
How could you believe Muay's people?

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,560
We’ll talk at the station.

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,040
Officer.

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,680
Officer, release us immediately!

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,280
Hey, you.

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,800
Can you stop moving?

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,560
It hurts.

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,520
Then move with me.

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,000
Why are you sitting like a rock?

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,120
Are you really going to keep causing problems?

28
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,240
The only one causing problems right now is you.

29
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,640
If you hadn’t gone emo and made me look for you,

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,920
we’d still be at the academy, not in the back of a police car!

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,040
I never asked you to come after me.

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,960
Hey!

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,760
Oh!

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,520
Okay, I won’t move.

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Go. get in.

36
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
Get in.

37
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,440
Officer, I think this is a misunderstanding.

38
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,320
This is clearly a setup.

39
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,320
No yelling or causing a scene.

40
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,040
Calm down while you’re in here.

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,960
Officer, unlock the handcuffs. Now!

42
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,120
Just wait! If I get out of here,

43
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,440
I’ll sue everyone.

44
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,720
Hey.
Officer!

45
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,520
Enough already.

46
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,480
Officer!

47
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,520
Officer!

48
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,880
Why are you pulling me like that?

49
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Stop shouting.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It’s not helping.

51
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,960
I’m trying to figure out how to get us out of here.

52
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,200
If you’re not going to help,

53
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,000
then just sit quietly.

54
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,320
You’re the one who kept making a scene.

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,320
That’s why we got arrested.

56
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
It’s your fault, isn’t it?

57
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
If we can't find it.

58
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,160
Do you know how much the Academy will be fined?

59
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,080
All you ever think about is yourself and money?

60
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,200
Yeah, it's all about the money.

61
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,440
It’s my job.

62
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,120
And what about your job?

63
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,920
Aren’t you a boxer?

64
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,600
Then why did you run from the match?

65
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
You’re such a coward.

66
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,920
Who made me fight Typhoon?

67
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,040
No one ever asked me what I wanted.

68
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
I’m sorry,

69
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,880
for making Prince of the Coconut fields,

70
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,360
fight someone you didn’t want to.

71
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,120
I really feel bad.

72
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
How did you know about that?

73
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,560
You disappeared without a word.

74
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,560
I had to go to your house.

75
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,040
This is getting too much.

76
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,960
that you fucking around with my life.

77
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,440
I just wanted to talk to you properly.

78
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,120
I didn’t ask for this.

79
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,440
I left because I wanted to be alone.

80
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
Stop interfering with my life.

81
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
Learn your place!

82
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,200
The Heartless Left Hook.

83
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,480
Ouch..

84
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,880
Stay still.

85
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,160
It’ll hurt less.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,480
If we both move,

87
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,080
we’ll both get hurt.

88
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,800
I'm Sorry. You’re in pain too, right?

89
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,280
Yeah.

90
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
I’m sorry.

91
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
I didn’t mean to be harsh earlier.

92
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I didn’t really mean it.

93
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,760
It’s okay.

94
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,160
What you said was true.

95
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:21,120
I forced you into fighting Typhoon when you didn’t want to.

96
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,320
Even if it wasn’t my idea,

97
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,720
it still started with my lie.

98
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840
I was wrong too.

99
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,280
I knew you only did it because of the debt.

100
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,640
So you’re saying we’re both at fault?

101
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,480
As for the match, I’ll let you decide what to do.

102
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,480
I won’t push you this time.

103
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,760
Keen.

104
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,000
Huh?

105
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Hi, Uncle Nop.

106
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,880
What happened?

107
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
How did you end up here?

108
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,400
It’s alright, I’ll handle your bail.

109
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Uh, wait.

110
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Thank you.

111
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,320
Thun.

112
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,960
Where’ve you been?

113
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,080
Everyone’s been looking for you.

114
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Well, I’m back now, aren’t I?

115
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,760
So that means you’re fighting again?

116
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
I won’t be fighting.

117
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
Sorry, Coach.

118
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,480
Why not?

119
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,840
What the hell?

120
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,320
Thun?

121
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,040
Let him go.

122
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,720
I’ll go prep for tomorrow’s press conference.

123
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,880
After what happened,

124
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:32,000
Thun the Tiger Taming Cannon

125
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,680
won’t be able to fight.

126
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,400
I take full responsibility.

127
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Are you mad at me

128
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
that I’m not fighting?

129
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
It’s fine.

130
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,800
If you had to force yourself to do it,

131
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,040
it would’ve been worse.

132
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,320
And the press conference.

133
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
You really don’t want me to come with you?

134
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,360
It’s fine, I can handle it.

135
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,760
You going to bed?

136
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,680
Yeah.

137
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,800
Then I’ll head to the office to write.

138
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
You can head to bed.

139
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,760
You can stay here.

140
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,000
I’ll sleep just fine.

141
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,000
Sure.

142
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,840
If you want to sleep, you can sleep on the bed.

143
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,160
Sure, if you don’t take up the whole bed.

144
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,080
Hey.

145
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Hey.

146
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,080
Hey.

147
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Go sleep properly.

148
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,760
Hey.

149
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
Come here.

150
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,960
Hey.

151
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,000
Get up.

152
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Hello.

153
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,800
I’m sure everyone here

154
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:13,320
is excited for the match between Thun the Tiger Taming Cannon

155
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,760
and Typhoon Roaring Thunder, and so am I.

156
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,440
However...

157
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:38,880
On behalf of Petchsak Academy, I must inform you

158
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,760
that Thun the Tiger Taming Cannon will not be fighting...

159
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,760
He will be fighting...

160
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,240
with Typhoon Roaring Thunder.

161
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,040
And I urge you to stay tuned.

162
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,840
(What?)

163
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,280
(Petchsak Academy...)

164
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,000
(Thun Tiger Taming Canon won’t be fighting...)

165
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,560
(...He will be fighting Typhoon Roaring Thunder.)

166
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
Hi, Coach.

167
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh, you’re back.

168
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,160
Coach.

169
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,400
Yes?

170
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,600
I’m sorry for running away before.

171
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,680
It’s partly my fault too, for not asking you first.

172
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,480
What made you decide to come back and fight?

173
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,440
I want to face my own pain,

174
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,560
so I don’t burden others anymore.

175
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,960
Otherwise,

176
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,480
it’s just more painful for everyone.

177
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,440
I’m sorry,

178
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,320
I didn’t tell you directly from the start.

179
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,960
It’s okay.

180
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,800
Getting Thun to fight Typhoon again is amazing already.

181
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Coach.

182
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,360
I’ll do better from now on.

183
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
Thanks.

184
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,400
Let the past be the past.

185
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,520
Go get some rest.

186
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,600
Back to training tomorrow.

187
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,880
Thun, fighting!

188
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,400
Uncle Petch, someone just called asking to train with Thun.

189
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
Do we have any courses?

190
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,040
Sure!

191
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,000
I’ve been meaning to for a while.

192
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,200
Alright then.

193
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,400
Yes, the academy is open for Muay Thai classes!

194
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,160
I’ll send the details soon.

195
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,960
Sure.

196
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,920
Hi everyone.

197
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,000
Today, we’ll show you how to escape if someone pins you like this.

198
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,360
If an attacker is trying to overpower you.

199
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
How?

200
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Like this.

201
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
That’s the technique,

202
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,200
Now I will try.

203
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,600
You just have to use a bit more strength and you can do it.

204
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,320
Yes!

205
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And that’s the proper way to do it.

206
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,520
Go practice at home,

207
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,920
and if you want to learn more about defensive arts,

208
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,600
you can contact Petchsak Academy anytime.

209
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,600
We’ll leave it at that for now. Bye!

210
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,000
Where are you going?

211
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
I’ll show you another move.

212
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,000
No way, I’m tired today.

213
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
You’re messing with me!

214
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,080
Hi everyone!

215
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,760
Today I’ll give you a room tour of a Muay Thai fighter’s dorm!

216
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,120
Let's check it out.

217
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Let's start out with the first bed.

218
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,920
Here.

219
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,800
Seems the owner’s not here.

220
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,280
Let’s move to the next one.

221
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,720
This bed’s still unclaimed.

222
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
But if you want to become a muay thai fighter,

223
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,120
you can contact me.

224
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,920
The number’s here.

225
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,720
This is the third bed.

226
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Ah, someone’s here.

227
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,600
Hi!

228
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,880
Come here.

229
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,360
Hey there.

230
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,320
Introduce yourself.

231
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,040
I’m Ait.

232
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,280
Ait here is one of our fighters.

233
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,120
This is his bed.

234
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,600
Super neat guy.

235
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,240
Look at how tidy he keeps it, even living alone!

236
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,680
Oh!

237
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,640
You have a teddy bear?

238
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,000
Didn’t expect you to be the sweet type.

239
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,840
This bear?

240
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,320
That’s not mine.

241
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,840
It’s my little sister’s.

242
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,680
You have a sister?

243
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,800
Yeah, her name’s Keaw.

244
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,200
Here she is.

245
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,840
This is her. Cute, right?

246
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,560
She is!

247
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,040
Why haven’t I seen her at the academy?

248
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
She’s sick.

249
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,640
Do you want to talk about it?

250
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,840
Yeah, of course.

251
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,480
She’s waiting

252
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,640
for a heart transplant.

253
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,240
It’s okay,

254
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,480
she’s healthy right now.

255
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,320
She’ll get a new heart soon.

256
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,200
I’m not letting anything happen to her.

257
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,200
So if anyone knows a great doctor or has advice,

258
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,880
share in the comments, I’ll read them all.

259
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,600
That’s it for the live.

260
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,520
Thanks for watching!

261
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,120
See you next time, bye!

262
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,800
Goodbye!

263
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,600
Bye!

264
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,200
Good bye.

265
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Thanks! See you around.

266
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,800
You got this, man.

267
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
I’m fine.

268
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,720
She's tougher than she looks.

269
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,080
Was the clip alright?

270
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,800
Yeah, lots of viewers.

271
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,240
People are commenting, too.

272
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
(Can you handle it?)

273
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,160
Block it!

274
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Yeah, like that.

275
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,360
Coach, we’ve got more students now.

276
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,200
We should rethink our class schedules

277
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,280
or we won’t be able to manage.

278
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,440
Good idea.

279
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,040
You handle it, Keen.

280
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,200
Will do.

281
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,040
Woah, bro.

282
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,800
That's real salty.

283
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,040
You’re a teacher now, how can you yawn like this?

284
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,720
Teach the students.

285
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,800
Yeah, yeah, I know.

286
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,640
I’m just sleepy.

287
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,920
I saw an ad for Muay Thai lessons here?

288
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,920
How I do sign up ?

289
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,960
Uh... I...

290
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:33,320
Uh...I can speak English a little bit.

291
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Break time.

292
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,000
No problem.

293
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,080
Sorry.

294
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,640
Hey.

295
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,920
Hey.

296
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,800
I’m one of the instructors here.

297
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,240
You wanna sign up?

298
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,520
That'd be great.

299
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,600
I will get Keen.

300
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,920
He can help you.

301
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,960
He is here.

302
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,960
Keen.

303
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,280
Hi, welcome.

304
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,520
Welcome to Petchsak Muay Thai Academy.

305
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,600
What?

306
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,000
Macadamia something?

307
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,200
He's hungry?

308
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,120
You want nuts?

309
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,800
Or are they sneaking off to eat again?

310
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,960
Come on, I'll get it for you.

311
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,280
Hey?!

312
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Why just this much?

313
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,560
You’re getting chubby, watch your weight.

314
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,480
The scale’s broken,

315
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,680
how do you know I gained weight?

316
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,320
Well, I'm too lazy want to walk a whole block weigh myself.

317
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,800
You know it’s rude to comment on a woman’s weight, right?

318
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,960
But you’re a Muay Thai fighter.

319
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,120
Well, who’d know?

320
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,080
Ait.

321
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,320
Thanks, bro.

322
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,320
Same for you, how many times do I have to remind you not to be drowsy midday?

323
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,560
If you’re that tired, cut back on your side jobs.

324
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,680
Huh?

325
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,400
You know I can’t.

326
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,240
I do, but you’re a coach now.

327
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,480
Don’t ruin the academy’s name, okay?

328
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,920
Got it.

329
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,080
No more dozing off.

330
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,440
Take it.

331
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,440
Thanks.

332
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,600
You always give me something to nag about.

333
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,040
So scary.

334
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,760
Bro!

335
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,400
Search Thun’s name on your phone.

336
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
Damn.

337
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,120
Pakorn just called me.

338
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,680
He said he’s pulling Thun out of the match.

339
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,680
Shit.

340
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,440
Ma'am, it’s not like what they’re saying in the news, I swear.

341
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,280
Yes, ma’am. Please don’t worry.

342
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,920
We’re being framed, that’s all.

343
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,440
Yes, ma’am?

344
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,720
Hello?

345
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,560
Keen.

346
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,840
It’s okay.

347
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,840
I figured.

348
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,360
Our gym just opened a new course, and now all the students have bailed.

349
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,800
I’ll head to the market.

350
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Want to check something out.

351
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,200
Isn’t it dangerous for you to go out like that?

352
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040
I’ll go with him.

353
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,200
Do you think this shop has CCTV?

354
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,160
There.

355
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,000
You’re right.

356
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,320
But we just trashed their shop…

357
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,280
Will they even let us look?

358
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,480
Let’s try.

359
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,560
Auntie.

360
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,600
Can we see the security footage from that day, please?

361
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,720
You two were the ones from that day!

362
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,680
Why are you back? Here to wreck my shop again?

363
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,920
Get out! Don’t make me call someone to throw you out!

364
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,400
Go!

365
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,680
Go!

366
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,560
I said go!

367
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,760
Go!

368
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,840
Go!

369
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,600
Still not leaving?

370
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,680
Just go.

371
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,600
Go.

372
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,680
Here you go. Thanks, dear.

373
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,880
Come again next time.

374
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,960
Want some fruit?

375
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,600
Want some fruit?

376
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,680
What would you like?

377
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,240
Miss.

378
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,400
Yes?
You were there that day, right?

379
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,920
Huh? What are you talking about?

380
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,400
You know we were set up?

381
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,080
No, I don’t.

382
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,680
I know you saw it.

383
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,840
I didn’t see anything.

384
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,560
How could you not have?

385
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,400
I said I don’t know, go away.

386
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,240
Please help me.

387
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,200
I said I don’t know.

388
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,880
Why won’t you say anything?

389
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,160
Calm down.

390
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,320
We can check with other shops.

391
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,480
Fine.

392
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,160
Wait, wait.

393
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,960
Come here a sec.

394
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:47,240
Actually, I was there that day.

395
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,520
Did you happen to record it?

396
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,040
I filmed it.

397
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,880
But Muay

398
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,160
told us to delete everything.

399
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,840
No one dares to go against her.

400
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,080
I'm so sorry.

401
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,840
But I really can’t help.

402
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,520
What now?

403
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,520
Muay’s shutting every door on us.

404
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,480
Calm down, we’ll find another way.

405
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,040
Tiger Taming Canon Hello!

406
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,120
Hey.

407
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,080
Remember me?

408
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
I’m Mai,

409
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,840
the guy who took a picture with you the other day.

410
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,320
Let me show you.

411
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,520
Here, I was standing right here.

412
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,240
Oh, right.

413
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,360
Ring a bell?

414
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,960
Is there something going on?

415
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,600
Well, that's not my main point.

416
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,680
I’ve got something to talk to you about.

417
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,680
You remember the fight you were in, right?

418
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,200
I was recording at that exact moment.

419
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:15,600
It captured everything,

420
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,600
so clearly.

421
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,760
Didn’t Muay tell you to delete it?

422
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,760
Bro, come on.

423
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,040
If I deleted the video,

424
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,520
why would I even tell you about it?

425
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,320
Can we have the clip, then?

426
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,560
Uh… no.

427
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,720
What?

428
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,680
Calm down, my brother.

429
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,000
I’ll post it myself.

430
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,320
Just needs a little more editing.

431
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,760
I’m in a hurry. Please?

432
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,160
Bro, chill, okay?

433
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,440
Here’s the deal.

434
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,840
Once I finish editing, I’ll post it for you.

435
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:03,240
But I have one condition.

436
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,200
Sis, I sent you the link.

437
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,480
Please help fix the story.

438
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,480
Thanks.

439
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,640
(Can I give you a hug, bro?)

440
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,240
(Sure thing.)

441
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,600
(Man, thank you so much!)

442
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,800
You’re the coolest.

443
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,480
You’re my idol.

444
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,320
From the drama involving “Thun Tiger Taming Canon”

445
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,760
a.k.a. Thun Sukkasem,

446
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,120
who appeared in a viral video fighting in a fresh market,

447
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,800
which led to the #BoxerThug controversy.

448
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,240
Thun faced heavy criticism

449
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,760
about whether he’s fit to be a professional boxer.

450
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,560
But then the tide turned when an influencer

451
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,120
released another angle of the video

452
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,360
revealing Thun didn’t start the fight.
(Hey.)

453
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,680
revealing Thun didn’t start the fight.
(You’d better be ready.)

454
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,040
In fact, he was trying to protect someone from getting attacked.

455
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,880
(Let go!)

456
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,760
Now, the hashtag #HeroBoxer

457
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,840
is trending number one in Thailand,

458
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,040
praising Thun for his bravery and kindness.

459
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,200
And of course, people are swooning over Thun’s good looks.

460
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,880
(We’ll have to wait and see how Pakorn responds to this.)

461
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,080
Keen, you're surprisingly good at crisis-solving.

462
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,640
It’s nothing, but Klao!

463
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,040
She’s amazing, smart, pretty, and kind.

464
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,240
She helped us by correcting the news.

465
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,040
So how did you run into that kid?

466
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,880
Bumped into him at the noodle shop with Keen.

467
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,400
Turns out he’s a fan of Thun Tiger Taming Canon.

468
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,280
Oh, a fan?

469
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,120
Then why not let him help promote the gym?

470
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,000
Not a bad idea.

471
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,920
You serious?

472
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,240
He’s got a ton of followers, right?

473
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,400
Could make the gym famous.

474
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,480
Ahem!

475
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,760
Oh,

476
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,520
it’s the influencer kid!

477
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,560
Hi, bro!

478
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,440
Hi, P’Thun!

479
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,160
Hello.

480
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,240
My name’s Mai.

481
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,640
He helped post the video

482
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,840
in exchange for becoming a fighter at our gym.

483
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,640
I’ve already talked to Uncle Phet.

484
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,920
So from now on, Mai will be part of our gym.

485
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,640
Huh?

486
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,360
You totally called it, Bung.

487
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,040
Yeah.

488
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,680
The discourse is changing.

489
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,280
Look, people are starting to support Thun again.

490
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,600
Your efforts paid off, Keen.

491
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,560
More students will probably sign up now.

492
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,360
I was just joking earlier.

493
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,120
By the way, does this kid even know how to fight?

494
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,120
Can he handle it?

495
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,160
Uh…

496
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,600
Don’t worry, I’ll train him myself.

497
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,800
Your protégé, huh?

498
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,800
Guess we’d better start training him to get in shape.

499
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,840
Your name’s Mai, right?

500
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,680
Yes.

501
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,360
Come with me, I’ll show you the gym

502
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,400
and the room you’ll be sharing with me.

503
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,080
Let’s go.

504
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,840
Coming, thank you.

505
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,840
You think he’ll make it?

506
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
So, you know how to do nice things?

507
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,640
So what’s next?

508
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,720
Now we just talk to them.

509
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,920
Anyway, let’s eat.

510
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,640
Yeah, let’s eat.

511
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,960
Let’s eat.

512
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,400
Kid.

513
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,800
Pakorn is ready to see you, follow me.

514
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,680
I think you need to change your statement.

515
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:00,280
First of all, I have to commend you for handling the crisis well.

516
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,280
But tell me..

517
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,080
Why should I do what you ask?

518
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,160
Because it’s what the audience wants.

519
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,680
You know how popular Thun is right now.

520
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,880
Your decision will affect your future, too.

521
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,000
This isn’t a one-sided deal.

522
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,160
It’s a win-win for both of us.

523
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,720
So that’s all you came here for?

524
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,720
Yes.

525
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:40,440
And I hope that a top promoter like yourself

526
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,360
will choose the right path.

527
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,360
Will the Tiger Taming Canon get to fight again?

528
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,360
Yes! Will he?

529
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,360
What do you say?

530
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:58,000
Mr. Pakorn, are you really going to bar someone who helped others from competing again?

531
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,840
Yeah!

532
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,000
Right?

533
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,360
Please answer!

534
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:01,920
Tell us, please!

535
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,280
So what’s the decision?

536
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,640
Right, I’m here to tell everyone..

537
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,200
I’ve contacted Thun Tiger Taming Canon to fight Typhoon Roaring Thunder

538
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:17,280
in the upcoming event, please look forward to this grudge match!

539
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,960
I promise it’ll be worth the wait!

540
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,800
What are you doing here?

541
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,880
Why aren’t you in bed yet?

542
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,960
I'm waiting…

543
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,200
For my roommate.

544
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,640
Something on your mind?

545
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,560
You don’t have to be chained together like in the cell

546
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,920
just to open up, right?

547
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,360
What are you feeling right now?

548
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,080
I want to say thank you.

549
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,120
Thank you for what?

550
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,520
Thank you for....

551
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,520
Making my life better.

552
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,320
It wasn’t just because of me.

553
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,040
It’s because we all helped each other.

554
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,480
How could I take all the credit?

555
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,440
And also...

556
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,160
The fact that we're still together.

557
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,200
Still solving problems together.

558
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,320
Everything will get better soon.

559
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,000
Please turn to face each other for a moment.

560
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,000
Let’s scoot a little closer.

561
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,560
A bit more.

562
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,720
This time, I’m going to teach you what it means to lose,

563
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,720
Thun.

564
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,080
You're really good at massages.

565
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,400
Don’t tease me.

566
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,800
You were criticizing me so much earlier.

567
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,680
Sorry for being harsh.

568
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,120
Are you mad?

569
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,600
A little bit.

570
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,400
But I get where you were coming from.

571
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,800
From now on, I’ll try to manage my time better.

572
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,040
I’m not done with the massage yet.

573
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,720
How's your massage work going these days?

574
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,240
Any problems?

575
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:58,160
I’m good, I’m happy with how things are going.

576
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,160
Though I get some weird clients sometimes,

577
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,400
It’s not a big deal.

578
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,320
You booked for extra service?

579
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,480
You still haven’t figured it out?

580
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:59,160
Thanks for dropping me off every time.

581
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,880
Don’t mention it.

582
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,520
You’d better hurry, I’ll catch up with you later.

583
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,160
Okay.

584
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,960
Everything will get better.

585
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,480
But before you take care of your sister,

586
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,480
You need to take care of yourself first.

587
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,560
If you don’t, and you let yourself get tired,

588
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,560
How will you have the energy to take care of her?

589
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,640
Okay.

590
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,040
Thanks.

591
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,000
I’ll head in now.

592
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,720
Alright.

593
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,440
Huh?

594
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,760
Keaw,

595
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,720
Did you know someone who follows our page

596
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,640
Has connections at Ekkarin Hospital?

597
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:20,000
You're getting both a new heart and a new hospital!

598
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:20,920
Really?

599
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,360
Yay!

600
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,960
Congrats, keaw. You’re getting a new heart!

601
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,760
Hello, Mawin.

602
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,600
Congrats, Keaw. I hope everything goes smoothly.

603
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,600
Thanks.

604
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,280
It’s bedtime now, sweetheart.

605
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,000
Say bye-bye to the big brothers.

606
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,680
P’Ait, P’Mawin, I’m going to sleep now.

607
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,920
Bye-bye!

608
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,280
Bye-bye, keaw. Sweet dreams.

609
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,680
Bye-bye!
Bye-bye, keaw.

610
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,880
Get lots of rest.

611
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,360
Can I talk to P’Ait for a bit?

612
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,640
Oh, sure.

613
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,000
Mr.Ait,

614
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,480
Next week, could you come in to handle the patient transfer paperwork?

615
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,400
Of course.

616
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,240
Thank you so much.

617
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,280
Sure.

618
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,000
Let’s go to bed.

619
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,040
Okay.

620
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,440
Congrats, man.

621
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,360
So happy for you.
You don’t have to worry about your sister anymore.

622
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,880
Congratulations, P’Ait.

623
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,520
Thanks, you guys.

624
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,600
Yay, such a relief.

625
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,000
This calls for a celebration, right?

626
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:21,720
Let me think...

627
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,200
What should we eat?

628
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,160
Tell me what you want, I’ll hop on my bike and grab it for you.

629
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:26,680
What should we eat?

630
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,840
Somtum?

631
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:28,640
Somtum?

632
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,760
Sure!
Or maybe hot pot?

633
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,560
Hmm… I kinda want somtum.

634
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,520
Let’s ask P’Ait.

635
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,600
P’Ait, what do you feel like eating?

636
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,320
Are you treating?

637
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,640
Of course! Gotta treat for something worth celebrating.

638
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,720
Then salmon.

639
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,480
Huh?

640
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,400
Hey.

641
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,760
So..

642
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:11,240
Thanks for helping with Keaw’s heart situation.

643
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,240
All I did was spread the word.

644
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,240
And Ait too.

645
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:31,080
If you hadn’t filmed in that bedroom that day, none of this would’ve happened.

646
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,200
In the end, everyone helped.

647
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,920
Wait, you know how to smile?

648
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,320
I’m not smiling.

649
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,680
Come on, let me see your smile.

650
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,560
Let me see it.

651
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,040
No.

652
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:55,560
Just once.

653
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,160
No.

654
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,320
Just a quick smile.

655
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:57,840
No.

656
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,000
Thun, smile for me.

657
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,480
No.

658
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,400
Give me a sweet smile.

659
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,560
What do you think I am?

660
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,280
You look like someone heartless.

661
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:13,200
Like that nickname, The Heartless Left Hook.

662
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,200
I smiled at you so many times,

663
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,200
you just didn’t notice.

664
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,200
Really?

665
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:32,360
Then I guess your left hook isn’t heartless after all.

666
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:43,280
Wanna find out if I’m truly heartless?

667
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,440
I don't want to lose anymore.

668
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,320
Can I increase the dose?

669
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,760
But you know, if the medicine wears off, it'll be painful.

670
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,440
I know.

671
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,720
Fight!

672
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,720
Thun, fight him!

673
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,080
Thun, do it.

674
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,200
Fight, Thun!

675
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,800
Don't let your hands drop!
