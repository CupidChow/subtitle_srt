=Episode 8=

3
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,080
Stop.

4
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,960
Have you ever seen the girl in the painting?

5
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,080
- No.
- No.

6
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,520
City Lord will give a reward
for information on her whereabouts.

7
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,120
- OK.
- OK.

8
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,840
They are searching the city so late
just to find a slave.

9
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,030
Stop talking. You might bring trouble upon us.

10
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,390
My Lord,

11
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,310
there is still no news about Miss Xie for now.

12
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,710
It seems that she has finally got her wish.

13
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,470
She can even evade city searches.

14
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,710
Miss Xie may just have a moment of confusion

15
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,400
and misunderstand your intentions,

16
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,680
so she hid away.

17
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,910
After figuring it out,

18
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,590
she will naturally come back.

19
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,080
She tried every means to escape from me.

20
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,750
There is no way she will come back easily.

21
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,080
She has been staying at the mansion
for the past three years.

22
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,190
She should understand

23
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,910
only you can help her.

24
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,560
Miss Xie is intelligent.

25
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,430
She will surely understand your difficulties.

26
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,590
Go find her.

27
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,120
Continue searching.

28
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,240
Yes, My Lord.

29
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,270
Report!

30
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,750
My Lord, we found her.

31
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,030
My Lord.

32
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,120
My Lady, the wind is strong at night.

33
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,040
Let's go inside and wait.

34
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,800
No, I want him to see me first

35
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,160
when he comes back.

36
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,160
I want him to know

37
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,070
I will always be by his side.

38
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,880
Ji.

39
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,120
Why is it her again?

40
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,120
There are multiple abrasions on the body.

41
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,920
She can be recovered slowly.

42
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,720
The wound on the head matters.

43
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,480
Whether she can wake up

44
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,160
depends on fate.

45
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,780
(Qianyuan Pavilion)

46
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,390
These are 1,000 pearls.

47
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,920
If one peal is missing, you are doomed.

48
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,630
Xie Yun, I have said

49
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,480
no one can control your life,

50
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,190
including yourself.

51
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,560
If you are in eternal sleep,

52
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,430
I will let everyone around you

53
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,800
die with you.

54
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,060
(Qianyuan Pavilion)

55
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,630
Thanks to your careful care,

56
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,870
Miss Xie's condition has greatly improved.

57
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,830
She will wake up soon.

58
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,600
Who allowed you to leave the mansion
without permission?

59
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,390
Who allowed you to hurt yourself?

60
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,240
Who allowed you to talk to me like this?

61
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,760
Xiao Ji,

62
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,920
you just said you would treat me well.

63
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,920
Is this your attitude now?

64
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,510
What did you just call me?

65
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,910
Xiao Ji?

66
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,240
You called me by my name
from four years ago.

67
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,720
What trick are you trying to play?

68
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,640
Let go of me.

69
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,070
I told you to let me go.

70
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,350
Let go.

71
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,950
You hurt me.
Why can't I call you Xiao Ji?

72
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,480
Isn't Xiao Ji your name?

73
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,870
How strange.

74
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,510
Today you seem like a different person.

75
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,070
I'll see what tricks you're up to.

76
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,200
Where is this place?

77
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,840
I...

78
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,440
I...

79
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,030
What kind of clothes am I wearing?

80
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,550
Did your brother hit you again?

81
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,350
This wound...

82
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,720
It turns out you're pretending
to lose your memory.

83
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,390
Do you think you can forget
about what happened during this time

84
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,080
and start over?

85
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,390
This kind of thread...

86
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,790
Isn't it only qualified for City Lord to wear?

87
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,840
What exactly happened?

88
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,230
Xie Yun,

89
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,790
- are you too immersed in the role?
- Let go of me.

90
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,950
- Let go of me, Xiao Ji.
- I'm telling you,

91
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,230
- even if you don't remember anything,
- Let go of me.

92
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,210
- you can't leave.
- Xiao Ji.

93
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,990
Don't expect...

94
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,150
How dare you do this to me?

95
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,630
Fine. You lost your memory.

96
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,600
For your safety,

97
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,670
just stay here obediently.

98
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,200
Don't go anywhere.

99
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,390
Make it clear.

100
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,500
(Qianyuan Pavilion)

101
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,200
It's time for lunch.

102
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,200
Please have a meal.

103
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,590
Cai Tianxi.

104
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,390
Do you know what Xie Yun
hated to eat the most

105
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,870
in the past three years?

106
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,720
Miss Xie, all the dishes are ready.

107
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,680
Please enjoy yourself.

108
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,680
Thank you.

109
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,510
Miss Xie ate all the chicken on the table.

110
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,200
And she didn't feel sick

111
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,080
at the sight of chicken as she used to.

112
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,560
Miss Xie.

113
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,200
Miss Xie.

114
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,510
This is the wine we just made.

115
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,240
It contains more than ten kinds
of medicinal herbs.

116
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,790
It has the effect of nourishing the body.

117
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,670
Please give it a try.

118
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,080
Please.

119
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,320
Lanling wine?

120
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,510
It is indeed Lanling wine.

121
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,480
She was pleasantly surprised
when she tasted Lanling wine.

122
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,320
I can't see any flaws in the disguise.

123
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,320
Continue to keep an eye on her.

124
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,750
He

125
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,450
has brewed this wine so quickly.

126
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,530
I feel that something is not right.

127
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,320
Didn't you say

128
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,080
it's been four years already?

129
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,800
Mr. Cai.

130
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,000
You can leave now.

131
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,630
- OK.
- I'll freshen up.

132
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,160
OK.

133
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,980
(Register of Jinpo State)

134
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,960
Xie Yun!

135
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,680
Qi Yan.

136
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,280
Great!

137
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,590
You woke up.

138
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,960
What are you doing?

139
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,750
What are you wearing?

140
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,750
Take this with you.

141
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,750
Let's leave here quickly.

142
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,980
(Token)

143
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,080
What is this?

144
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,280
Xie Yun,

145
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,200
I know what you're thinking.

146
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,990
Let's go first.

147
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,390
Let go of me.

148
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,960
Where are you taking me?

149
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,910
Why are you all acting so strange?

150
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,440
And what is this?

151
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,750
(Token)
I don't want it.

152
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,900
(Token)

153
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,670
She really doesn't remember anything.

154
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,960
I don't believe it.

155
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,910
You know that after she was imprisoned,

156
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,240
she was fed raw chicken in her daily meals,

157
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,030
and since then she vomits
at the sight of chicken.

158
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,440
Yet you still used chicken to provoke her.

159
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,910
If I don't go to this extent,

160
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,550
how can we prove
that she really lost her memory?

161
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,550
By keeping her locked up like this,

162
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,700
how do you think she feels about you?

163
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,080
I suggest you go and see her,

164
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,390
and give both of you a chance to start over.

165
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,550
No way.

166
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,750
And

167
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,240
I didn't allow you to hug her.

168
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,720
It's been so many days.

169
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,480
It's so difficult

170
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,320
to see you.

171
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,790
What do you think of my mansion?

172
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Quite magnificent.

173
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,750
It may also be superficially impressive.

174
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,630
Anyway, the impression I have of you

175
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,390
is that you shouldn't live in a place
like this.

176
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,910
You dared to say this four years ago.

177
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,390
Xiao Ji,

178
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,670
in my memory,

179
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,080
we just got engaged

180
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,000
in front of everyone.

181
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,240
We are very happy.

182
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,150
But everything changed after I woke up.

183
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,080
You have gained glory, status,

184
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,390
and everything.

185
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,510
But it seems like I have lost everything.

186
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,200
I need an explanation, Xiao Ji.

187
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,510
What have you been doing these years?

188
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,510
I also need an explanation.

189
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,400
What a coincidence.

190
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,700
You have forgotten everything that happened
in the past four years.

191
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,630
Why don't you believe me, Xiao Ji?

192
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,870
What's going on exactly?

193
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,960
Why?

194
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,000
Do you want me to help you remember again?

195
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,080
Me...

196
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,600
You once said you were most afraid
of water ghosts.

197
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
It's impossible for you to learn
to swim in this life.

198
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,120
It seems like during the time I was away,

199
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,960
you have learned to swim.

200
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,320
People always change.

201
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,510
Help!

202
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,910
- Xiao Ji.
- Xie Yun,

203
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,000
you can swim, don't you?

204
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,840
Help!

205
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,870
Climb up.

206
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,180
Help!

207
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,870
Stop pretending. Climb up.
