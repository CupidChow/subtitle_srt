3
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,640
When I was little,
my brother made me a swing.

4
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,310
Xiao Baobao saw it.

5
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,710
She kept asking you guys for one.

6
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,870
But we weren't very good at it.

7
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,430
The swing fell apart,

8
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,950
resulting in her falling down.

9
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,710
She couldn't get out of bed for a few days.

10
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,400
You dragged me into this mess with you.

11
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,710
As a result, we were both in detention.

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,150
How time flies.

13
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,950
I always feel like

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,310
the four of us are still studying together,

15
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,150
being punished to stand together.

16
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,120
It's very similar to the school
we used to go to.

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,950
I will definitely find out the real cause
of her death.

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,790
I will definitely give Xiao Baobao
an explanation.

19
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,150
It's time to farewell to our old friend.

20
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,360
Let me out.

21
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,710
I want to see my daughter.

22
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,470
Let me out.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,960
Let me out.

24
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,080
My daughter is not dead.

25
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,400
Let me out quickly.

26
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,430
Let me out.

27
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,470
Xie Yun,

28
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,150
Xie Yun, let me out.

29
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,240
I want to see my daughter.

30
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,840
Tell me this is not true.

31
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
Let me out.

32
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,520
Xie Yun.

33
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,710
Let me out.

34
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,800
Sorry for your loss.

35
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,240
It was you who killed my daughter.

36
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,520
It must be Yin Ji who did it.

37
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,270
Xie Yun.

38
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,200
Xie Yun.

39
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,520
I don't have long to live.

40
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,310
I'll tell you a secret.

41
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,910
I indeed sent someone to kill you

42
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,470
on the road of exile.

43
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,310
But someone else did it ahead of me.

44
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,190
It was Yin Ji.

45
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,120
I saw it with my own eyes.

46
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,710
Xie Yun,

47
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,560
you are still kept in the dark, aren't you?

48
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,190
My Lord,

49
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,680
you should take a rest.

50
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,200
Well...

51
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,310
You cannot summon your wife
to come here either.

52
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,680
This is the rule.

53
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,240
The night before the ceremony,

54
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,800
you cannot meet your wife.

55
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,430
It should have been the same
when you got married.

56
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,800
But at that time, you didn't care.

57
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,320
OK.

58
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,560
You go first.

59
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,790
Yes, My Lord.

60
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,710
Let's go.

61
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
Yun?

62
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,880
Let's have a drink.

63
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,960
OK.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,840
Take a seat.

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,840
Lanling wine.

66
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,120
Didn't we agree to drink Lanling wine
with everyone tomorrow?

67
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,840
What?

68
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,510
You can't wait for tonight already.

69
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,000
Do you really think

70
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,120
I can't wait to drink Lanling wine?

71
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,000
How long has it been since we drank together?

72
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,750
Do you still remember

73
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,310
the promises you made
when we were drinking before?

74
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,600
Never forget.

75
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,030
Delicious.

76
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,250
Don't drink anymore.

77
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,870
Otherwise, you'll have a headache
again tomorrow.

78
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,160
It's all your fault.

79
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,870
Your brewing skills are so good.

80
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,680
Better than many craftsmen in the city.

81
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,680
That's because you are too stupid.

82
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,510
You still don't learn how to brew.

83
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,560
Wait and see.

84
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,800
I will definitely learn it.

85
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
I will invite everyone to come

86
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,070
and have a drink

87
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,390
on our wedding day.

88
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,440
OK.

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,840
Well...

90
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,830
Today, I'll allow you to have one last drink.

91
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,110
Two cups.

92
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,960
- One cup.
- Two cups.

93
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,190
- One cup.
- Two cups.

94
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,600
- Another drink, one more drink.
- No.

95
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,360
- Let me have one more drink.
- No.

96
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
Tomorrow, I will be able to fulfill my promise.

97
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,750
On the day of our wedding

98
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,750
I invite everyone to drink Lanling wine.

99
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,380
(Hanmo Pavilion)

100
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,070
Yin Ji.

101
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,270
I...

102
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,110
What's wrong?

103
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,190
I feel a bit cold.

104
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,600
Then let's go back.

105
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,350
No.

106
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,950
I want to drink

107
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,720
the ginger tea made by you

108
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,160
with your exclusive secret recipe.

109
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,960
OK.

110
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,430
I'll go cook for you.

111
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,080
Wait for me.

112
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,440
Cai Tianxi.

113
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,630
Here.

114
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,670
Read and archive it
to the Scripture Repository.

115
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,280
Yes, My Lord.

(Memorial Tablet of Xiao Xingcheng)

117
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,030
Why are you crying on such a happy day?

118
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,320
Three years ago,

119
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,030
I personally helped you get
on the bridal sedan chair,

120
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,240
watching you marry someone
you don't want to marry.

121
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,150
Let me down.

122
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,680
Let me go.

123
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,480
Let me down.

124
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,030
Let go.

125
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,440
Today

126
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,510
I am sending you off to marriage again.

127
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,030
You can finally marry

128
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,910
the person you originally wanted to marry.

129
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,750
Shouldn't you feel happy for me?

130
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,390
Stop crying.

131
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,870
Go wash your face.

132
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,480
You have to stay by my side later.

133
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,480
I know the pain in your heart.

134
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,790
I will always be by your side.

135
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,870
I'm finally going to marry you.

136
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,840
