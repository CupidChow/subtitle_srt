00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,380
=Enslaved by Love=

2
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,380
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,120
Young master!

4
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,710
Young master, it's you.

5
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,400
We've been looking for you for a long time.

6
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,240
Hush.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,840
Hand it over to Yun.

8
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,040
OK.

9
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,030
- You're back.
- Small trinkets.

10
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,880
What's wrong?

11
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,920
- I...
- Look at these exquisite trinkets!

12
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,880
Miss,

13
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,640
I'm feeling a bit unwell in my stomach.

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,710
Maybe we should go back first.

15
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,170
What's wrong? Did you eat something bad?

16
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,370
- Then let's go back quickly.
- Take a look.

17
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,710
- Let's go.
- Calligraphy and pairings.

18
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:43,750
Calligraphy and paintings.

19
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,120
Meet at 9 o'clock tonight
at the Wuli Pavilion outside the city.

20
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,070
He is really my brother.

21
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,590
Xiuxiu! Xiuxiu!

22
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,090
This is a letter written by my brother himself.

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,040
It's really him.

24
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,790
Absolutely true, Miss.

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,680
But I don't know why

26
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,950
he dressed as a beggar.

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,640
He looked so destitute.

28
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,350
He insisted that I must deliver
this note to you.

29
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,430
OK. I will go see him tonight.

30
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,630
By the way, if Yin Ji comes to me today,

31
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,360
help me come up with an excuse to stall him.

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,400
OK, Miss.

33
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,140
(Meet at 9 o'clock tonight
at the Wuli Pavilion outside the city)

34
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,310
I'll do it.

35
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,360
You can go.

36
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,710
My Lord, you should rest now.

37
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,360
What is Xie Yun doing?

38
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,910
Miss Xie went shopping in the afternoon

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,120
and went back to her room
after storing the items in the evening.

40
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,430
She might have rested by now.

41
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,200
My Lord,

42
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,590
do you need me to inform Miss Xie?

43
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,750
No need.

44
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,200
I'll go see her.

45
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,520
What should I do?

46
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,590
Greetings, My Lord.

47
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:27,990
Where is Xie Yun?

48
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,550
My Lord,

49
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,470
Miss Xie is taking a bath.

50
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,630
I'll wait for her here.

51
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,590
Well...

52
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,590
It rained yesterday and the house leaked.

53
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,800
The charcoal got wet.

54
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,800
I'm afraid this brazier won't burn.

55
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,310
It's cold inside the house.

56
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,400
If you wait here,

57
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,710
I'm afraid you will catch a cold.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,150
How about me asking Miss Xie

59
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,240
to see you in Qianyuan Pavilion after the bath?

60
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,520
Why didn't you say so earlier?

61
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,800
Cai Tianxi.

62
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,960
Here.

63
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,710
Have someone bring in a brazier.

64
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,430
Yes, My Lord.

65
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,720
Why hasn't she come out yet?

66
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,160
After Miss Xie lost her memory,

67
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,190
she returned to her previous meticulous habits,

68
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,950
so naturally she would take a longer time.

69
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,600
My Lord, Mr. Qi is here,

70
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,270
waiting in the Qianyuan Pavilion.

71
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,600
Make him wait.

72
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,270
Mr. Qi said

73
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,000
he has something important to discuss with you.

74
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,110
Got it.

75
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,430
My Lord, you're busy with official duties.

76
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,870
I will inform Miss Xie

77
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,310
to meet you at the Qianyuan Pavilion
after she is ready.

78
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,270
OK.

79
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,750
Please take care.

80
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,360
Let her come earlier.

81
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,320
Yes, My Lord.

82
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,590
Well...

83
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,360
18 beauties have all been dispatched.

84
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,070
There's still no clue about Xie Han.

85
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,870
Less than five days left before the ceremony.

86
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,240
Please make a decision
on how we explain to Miss Xie...

87
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,270
Keep it a secret then.

88
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,160
How long do you still want to hide it from her?

89
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,720
The lie will eventually be exposed.

90
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,310
The longer the time, the greater the trouble.

91
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,950
After our wedding,

92
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,800
I will tell Yun all the truth.

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,070
Right now, I just want her

94
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,310
to marry me happily.

95
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,150
Yin Ji,

96
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,680
you are being too selfish.

97
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,510
Then go tell her now

98
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,040
that the Xie family is a traitor,

99
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,110
her father passed away,

100
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,070
and her mother and brother are still missing.

101
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,870
Or do you want me to tell her

102
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,510
that she betrayed me for Yin Qi?

103
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,270
Yes.

104
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,510
You can totally evaluate me

105
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,690
by standing on the moral high ground.

106
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,680
Can you take the consequences

107
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,240
after she knows the truth?

108
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,990
If it wasn't for you forcing her
to jump off the cliff,

109
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
how could she lose her memory?

110
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,200
Yin Ji,

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,240
you owe her too much.

112
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,230
Yun.

113
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,200
Han.

114
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,640
Han.

115
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,670
Han.

116
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,080
Han.

117
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,030
Yun.

118
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,470
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,960
Yun, don't cry.

120
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,120
I am doing well, aren't I?

121
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,430
We are blessed.

122
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
I finally have the opportunity to meet you.

123
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,470
Yun,

124
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,950
I have a question for you.

125
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,390
Why will you still marry Yin Ji?

126
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,680
He is the root of the trouble in our family.

127
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,190
What exactly happened?

128
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,470
Back then,

129
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,720
although we were exiled together,

130
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,630
I never had the chance to tell you.

131
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,480
Our father told me in prison

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,830
we were entrusted by former City Lord

133
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,360
to deliberately approach Yin Qi

134
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,360
to find evidence of his rebellion.

135
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,390
But later

136
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,190
suddenly came the news
of the death of former City Lord.

137
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,890
(Four years ago)
I want to see Xiao Lingfeng.

138
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,760
Sir...

139
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,200
- But Xiao Lingfeng who knows the truth
- Sir...

140
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,630
refused to help.

141
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,360
- Our father wrote a letter with blood.
- Mr. Xiao...

142
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,680
This is the letter I wrote with my blood.

143
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,270
Xiao Lingfeng can prove my innocence.

144
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,980
(From Xie Chengyun)

145
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,750
Our father did not commit suicide.

146
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,840
He did not commit suicide.

147
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,320
Who did it?

148
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,150
If it weren't for Xiao Lingfeng,

149
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,270
that would be Yin Ji.

150
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,240
Our family is full of loyal
and righteous people.

151
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,550
We helped this illegitimate child

152
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,750
to ascend to the position of City Lord.

153
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,550
But he repaid kindness with ingratitude.

154
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,240
Yin Ji's foundation is unstable.

155
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,390
He is wary of the fact
that our family is the first noble family.

156
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,720
That's why he took advantage
of Yin Qi's rebellion

157
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,000
to bring down our family
by colluding with the Xiao family.

158
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,920
Mother!

159
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,030
- Mother!
- Mother!

160
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,280
Mother,

161
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,440
are you OK?

162
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,790
- Yun.
- Han, be careful behind you.

163
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,200
You guys go quickly.

164
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,510
Take care of yourself and mother.

165
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,150
Where are my mother and brother?

166
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,870
I managed to escape from the men in black.

167
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,840
But when I came back to find you,

168
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,390
everyone was dead.

169
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,840
You were taken back
to the City Lord's Mansion by Yin Ji.

170
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,680
Isn't all of this

171
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,150
what Yin Ji planned?

172
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,510
He...

173
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,750
Why did he do this?

174
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,910
Our father arranged your marriage to Yin Qi.

175
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,630
He has always harbored resentment.

176
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,200
These three years,

177
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,270
his spies have been looking for me everywhere.

178
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,320
He is trying to eliminate all of us.

179
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,200
I buried our parents' relics in backyard.

180
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,000
I don't know how many days I have left to live,

181
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,720
so I also set up a tombstone for myself.

182
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,390
Yun,

183
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,960
he kept you in the mansion as a maid,

184
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,870
but he married Xiao Baobao.

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,510
Don't you understand yet?

186
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,750
Yun,

187
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,150
