00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,360
It's delicious.

4
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,720
This Lanling wine

5
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,600
is really extraordinary.

6
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,200
You are so lucky.

7
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:07,990
Ji,

8
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,280
how do you like my skills?

9
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,310
It's clearly the same recipe.

10
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,710
But it's more delicious than what I had before.

11
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,270
What do you think?

12
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,120
I don't know much about wine.

13
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,710
Madam is intelligent.

14
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,400
My Lord, you're happy to have her.

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,870
You're a sweet talker.

16
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,990
Xie Yun,

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,120
you said you're telling the truth.

18
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,150
My Lord, you always keep your word.

19
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,150
But you broke it randomly.

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,760
I am just a humble maid.

21
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,200
Is it important for me

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,350
to tell the truth?

23
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,150
You are looking for death.

24
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,510
I am not afraid of death.

25
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,310
But I don't want to die in the mansion.

26
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,430
Please give me the token.

27
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,240
Let me die outside.

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,870
Ji, are you OK?

29
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,750
Xie Yun, call the doctor quickly.

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,360
Baobao,

31
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,120
we will spend our wedding night tonight.

32
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,560
There is no need

33
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,590
to bother about a lowly maid.

34
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,960
Now that we've drunk the wine,

35
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,640
I think

36
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,080
it's time for us to become a real couple.

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,360
But Ji,

38
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,240
your injury hasn't fully healed yet.

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,240
If we...

40
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,190
This minor injury

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,600
will only make the process more interesting.

42
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,240
But I haven't prepared anything yet.

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,960
- You also come here.
- My eyes are swollen.

44
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,030
Ji...

45
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,710
Put it on my wife.

46
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,910
On her ankle.

47
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,190
- Come here.
- You...

48
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,200
Let me go.

49
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,110
Miss Xie,

50
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,310
City Lord command you to kneel here tonight.

51
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,800
Why do you have to humiliate me like this?

52
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,480
(Qianyuan Pavilion)
Ji.

53
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,350
Ji.

54
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,060
Hurry up, Ji.

55
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,940
(Qianyuan Pavilion)

56
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:15,260
(Qianyuan Pavilion)

57
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,950
(My dear mother, brother,)

58
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,390
(seeing my letter is like seeing me.)

59
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,920
(How are you doing?)

60
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,390
(The new year is approaching.)

61
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,070
(I miss you more and more.)

62
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,190
(I also miss the joy of family reunion.)

63
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,160
(City Lord treats me very well.)

64
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,190
(Don't worry about me.)

65
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,590
(Xie Yun.)

66
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,400
In the middle of the night,

67
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,160
why did you come

68
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,600
to Qianyuan Pavilion

69
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,390
to arrest me?

70
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,630
Miss Xie, don't judge others by yourself.

71
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,920
I am here on the orders of City Lord

72
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,800
to summon you

73
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,870
to guard the night for City Lord and Madam.

74
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,510
For a lowly servant like you,

75
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,800
this is a great honor.

76
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,750
If you take good care of them,

77
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,800
City Lord and Madam will reward you greatly.

78
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,750
I'm not going.

79
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,790
What?

80
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,840
I'm not going.

81
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,720
What?

82
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,560
I said I'm not going.

83
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,880
Move aside.

84
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,750
How dare you hit me?

85
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,430
- Chase her!
- Got it.

86
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,270
18 beauties have arrived.

87
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,200
Did she drown? Hurry up and save her!

88
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,080
We should save her first.

89
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,990
Wait a moment.

90
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,150
This matter should be reported
to City Lord first.

91
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
- Got it.
- Got it.

92
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,140
(Qianyuan Pavilion)

93
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,390
Ji,

94
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,360
you should be careful tonight.

95
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,550
Don't waste another good night like last night.

96
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,500
(Qianyuan Pavilion)

97
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,630
Why hasn't Xie Yun arrived yet?

98
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,670
How dare she delay me and Ji?

99
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,320
Report!

100
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,000
Xie Yun couldn't accept it

101
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,270
and had an emotional breakdown.

102
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,280
How dare she!

103
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,960
Can she refuse orders just because of this?

104
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,120
Right, Ji?

105
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,670
Even so, bring her to me.

106
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,600
If necessary, tie her up.

107
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,630
But because of emotional breakdown,

108
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,030
she jumped into the lake.

109
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,030
What?

110
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Jump into the lake?

111
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,320
Did she drown?

112
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,080
Everyone in the mansion

113
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,390
goes to find her.

114
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
I want to see her alive

115
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,550
or her dead body.

116
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,630
Yes, My Lord.

117
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,330
Ji,

118
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,670
are you going to abandon me again for Xie Yun?

119
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,580
(Hanmo Pavilion)

120
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,420
(Xie Yun,)

121
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,390
(you can't swim.)

122
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,750
(Do you really want to die?)

123
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,080
Go over there and take a look.

124
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,040
- OK.
- Quick. This way.

125
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,200
She's not here.

126
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,440
Someone, go with me over there.

127
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,440
- Yes.
- Come on.

128
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,750
(Would you rather die than stay by my side?)

129
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,750
Four.

130
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,160
What are you doing?

131
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,960
Counting lanterns.

132
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,870
One wish for one lantern.

133
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,630
How many wishes have you made?

134
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,870
Just ten.

135
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,080
But now

136
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,200
I only have nine left.

137
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,600
So strange.

138
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,600
One, two, three.

139
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,870
- Look.
- Four.

140
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,720
This lake is so big.

141
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,870
The water is so deep.

142
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,550
Is it possible

143
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,360
something in the water stole it?

144
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,990
Look!

145
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,120
That water plant...

146
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,440
Doesn't it look like a hand?

147
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,790
You make me angry.

148
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,510
You know I'm most afraid of water ghosts.

149
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,920
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

150
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,800
Yun.

151
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,470
My Lord,

152
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,960
there is candlelight in Xie Yun's room.

153
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,480
You said you were most afraid of water ghosts.

154
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,240
It's impossible to learn to swim in this life.

155
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,390
People always change.

156
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,110
My Lord,

157
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,200
only one hairband of Xie Yun has been found.

158
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,390
Continue searching.

159
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,150
Don't let the body tarnish the mansion.

160
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,390
Yes, My Lord.

161
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,280
Add more charcoal.

162
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,080
No more charcoal.

163
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,240
