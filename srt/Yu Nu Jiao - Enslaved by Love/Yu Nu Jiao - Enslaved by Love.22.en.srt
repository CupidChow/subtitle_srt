00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,340
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,600
I heard the person who was arrested
on the street yesterday

4
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,560
used to be from the former City Lord.

5
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,400
He was dead on the street.

6
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,900
The new City Lord was still not satisfied

7
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,950
and ordered to burn him.

8
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,560
He even scattered his ashes.

9
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,260
(One week later)

10
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,590
Go away! You beggar!

11
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,710
Go, go.

12
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,590
- Excuse me.
- Can't you understand me?

13
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,630
My steamed buns.

14
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,120
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

15
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,710
I beat you to death.

16
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,900
You are still eating my steamed buns.

17
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,760
Put them down. Put them down.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,840
Just go.

19
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,870
Go.

20
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,430
Go.

21
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,870
I beat you to death.

22
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,520
You blind!

23
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,270
Just go.

24
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,750
Get out of here!

25
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,080
Get lost.

26
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,840
If he's sick, just stay at home.

27
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,240
Get out of here! Get out of here!

28
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,000
Where am I?

29
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,440
Who are you?

30
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,830
Why don't you speak?

31
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,040
Same as you,

32
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,480
I am also a poor person.

33
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,030
Sorry.

34
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,190
I have fallen to this.

35
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,120
I deserve it.

36
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,760
Here

37
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,270
will be your home in the future.

38
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,520
Thank you, miss.

39
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,560
But...

40
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,920
But I can't burden you.

41
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,800
You are really

42
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
like someone.

43
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,160
If anyone makes her unhappy,

44
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,750
she will definitely retaliate.

45
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,270
She is narrow-minded.

46
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,040
She is not.

47
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,430
She has suffered too much hurt and grievance.

48
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,430
She just wanted to protect herself.

49
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,680
Who is she?

50
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,030
She...

51
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,950
She is my wife.

52
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,790
She is...

53
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,590
She is...

54
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,000
She is the one I love the most.

55
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,510
I'm sorry.

56
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,040
I'm sorry.

57
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,200
Thank you for taking me in, miss.

58
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,790
Until I get better,

59
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,120
I won't bother you anymore.

60
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,200
You are really like her.

61
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,870
She always silently

62
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,720
takes care of me,

63
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,680
accompanies me,

64
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,630
and bears me like this.

65
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,720
Unfortunately, I didn't cherish her.

66
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,080
I lost her.

67
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,960
I'm sorry.

68
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,270
I always compare you and her.

69
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,280
Don't be angry.

70
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,750
I won't do that in the future.

71
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,030
What happened with you guys?

72
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,750
I...

73
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,910
I did something

74
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,200
to hurt her.

75
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,110
She

76
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,670
hated me very much.

77
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,720
She was also at fault.

78
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,240
She misunderstood you.

79
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,600
No, she was not at fault.

80
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,080
She did not hurt me.

81
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,320
I misunderstood her.

82
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,320
It's my fault for letting her down.

83
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,510
Don't you hate her?

84
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,480
All of this

85
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,360
is all my own fault.

86
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,960
But I hope to make it up to her.

87
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,550
Why...

88
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,960
Why do you not acknowledge me?

89
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,120
I didn't kill your father.

90
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,240
I have been looking for your family.

91
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,600
Yin Ji,

92
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,230
I'm sorry.

93
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,470
I

94
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,510
really don't know

95
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,080
