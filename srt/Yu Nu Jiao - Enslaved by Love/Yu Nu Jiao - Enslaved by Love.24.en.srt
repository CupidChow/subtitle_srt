00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,340
=Episode 24=

3
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,910
You bumped into me.

4
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,120
- Sorry.
- Apologize to me.

5
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,550
- Sorry.
- Apologize to me.

6
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,470
Shut up!

7
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,870
- Apologize to me.
- Shut up.

8
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,990
Apologize to me.

9
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,960
Who's there? Chase.

10
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,470
Stop.

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,240
Stop.

12
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,150
Don't run.

13
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,990
Over there. There.

14
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,520
Hurry.

15
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,150
-Qi Yan.
- Yin Ji.

16
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,150
My Lord,

17
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,190
I arrived late.

18
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,470
Please forgive me.

19
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,990
Xue Jing.

20
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,310
You guys...

21
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,750
You are all fine.

22
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,590
Mother,

23
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,800
I have a plan

24
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,590
to make Yin Ji and his followers perish.

25
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,120
How can you be so sure

26
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,840
he is still alive?

27
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,800
Just let me announce to the world tomorrow

28
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,240
I will appoint Xie Yun as Madam.

29
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,080
Everything will come to light in the end.

30
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,630
But

31
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,430
wouldn't it be easier

32
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,400
to just execute Xie Yun
to lure out Yin Ji directly?

33
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,640
No.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,300
This actually confirms the false accusation
against the Xie family,

35
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,080
the rumor of me forcibly seizing things.

36
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,430
Furthermore,

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,710
Xie Yun is originally my wife.

38
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,750
I just want everything

39
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,150
to return to normal.

40
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,030
Since you have made up your mind,

41
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,520
then do it your way.

42
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,710
I need to trouble you

43
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,310
to hold the ceremony.

44
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,710
Report.

45
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,470
After the notice
of the appointment of Madam was posted,

46
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,470
dozens of people publicly rioted

47
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,680
and cursed in the street.

48
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,840
Don't worry.

49
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,550
Go ahead.

50
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,000
They said you are a thief who seized power

51
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,680
and incited others to refuse to surrender.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,310
The troublemakers have been arrested by me.

53
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,520
But

54
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,910
rumors are escalating.

55
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,560
I don't know how to deal with it.

56
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
If we kill them,

57
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,750
I'm afraid the people's hearts
are becoming more unstable.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,430
Enhance the defense of the city

59
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,950
and crack down on riots.

60
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,680
As for rumors,

61
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
ignore them for now.

62
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,520
But

63
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,190
if no response is made to the rumors,

64
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,630
I'm afraid

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,220
those troublemakers will
become more and more unbridled.

66
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,110
There's no need to worry.

67
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,040
Someone will soon stand up

68
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,600
to clear the name of me.

69
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,240
Bring Xie Yun over.

70
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,910
Yes, My Lord.

71
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,420
(Hanmo Pavilion)

72
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,960
My Lord,

73
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,070
Miss Xie has arrived.

74
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,030
You can go.

75
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
Three years ago,

76
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,270
you, in your phoenix coronet and robes,
married me.

77
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,950
I didn't hold your hand tightly,

78
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,390
so you and I waste three years of time.

79
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,230
Today

80
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,270
I stand in front of you again
with this set of wedding dress.

81
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,480
In the identity of City Lord,

82
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,600
I give you the position of Madam.

83
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,440
Are you willing?

84
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,510
Three years ago, you valued
the status of my family.

85
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,720
Now the Xie family has declined,

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
I am the only one left.

87
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
What value do I have to you?

88
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,310
You have no idea of your own value.

89
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,510
The position of Madam

90
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,390
must be yours.

91
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,360
I am already Yin Ji's wife.

92
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,000
We have nothing to talk about.

93
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,830
What if I could clear Xie family 's name?

94
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,310
I just need to let the world know

95
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,160
that the real schemer is Yin Ji.

96
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,600
Three years ago, Yin Ji went insane

97
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,240
and murdered the former City Lord
for the position of City Lord.

98
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,000
He framed me

99
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,630
and the Xie family.

100
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,160
And you are the witness.

101
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,600
My family will never

102
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
do such a thing of distorting right and wrong.

103
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,310
Originally, I wanted to turn a blind eye

104
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,630
and let your family off the hook.

105
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,520
What a pity,

106
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,190
you are still as ungrateful

107
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,070
as you were three years ago.

108
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,560
Do you know

109
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,360
what I got

110
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,600
from Xiao Lingfeng?

111
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,270
He said

112
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,800
you are looking for a contract.

113
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,040
The content of the contract

114
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,920
is enough to vindicate the Xie family.

115
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,270
You were just so arrogant

116
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,360
and indifferent to the matter of your family.

117
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,070
I suppose you have found that contract by now.

118
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,070
Let me guess

119
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,760
where it is.

120
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,960
Give it back to me.

121
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,520
You!

122
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,310
You will have a bad death.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,430
The conferment of Madam

124
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,750
has been announced to the world.

125
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,430
In order to save you,

126
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,950
Yin Ji will definitely act at the ceremony.

127
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,600
By then he will fall

128
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,800
into the trap I have prepared.

129
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,950
He is doomed to die.

130
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,870
If you are willing to testify,

131
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,360
I'll let him go this time.

132
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,070
I can't wait any longer.

133
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,450
Yin Qi wants to forcibly marry Yun.

134
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,630
I must mobilize the troops now.

135
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,520
Don't act impulsively.

136
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,310
Yin Qi's actions are meant
to lure you into battle.

137
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,280
Rushing into battle
will only play into his hands.

138
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,180
Are you asking me to just stand by
and do nothing?

139
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:17,750
Qi Yan,

140
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,490
don't you love showing off heroism the most?

141
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,870
Why are you trying to stop me at this moment?

142
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,870
Stay calm.

143
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,390
Now the Baiyu City is heavily guarded.

144
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,310
We absolutely can't rush in.

145
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,750
We need to take the long view.

146
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,510
Take the long view?

147
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,360
The longer Yun stays in the mansion,

148
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,590
the more dangerous it becomes for her.

149
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,840
There's no time left.

150
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,270
Since Yin Qi wants me,

151
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,240
then I'll go alone.

152
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,120
Only I can save Yun.

153
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,630
- Yin Ji.
- Who says only you can save her?

154
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,800
My Lord,

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,120
the traitor caused trouble.

156
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,440
I've been deceived

157
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,790
and misunderstood you.

158
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,230
Get up.

159
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,360
I'm sorry for your family.

160
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,800
All right.

161
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,270
I am here to bring you some good news.

162
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,150
My army has gathered outside the city,

163
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,840
awaiting your command.

164
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,440
If so,

165
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,270
we can then battle against the Yin Qi's army.

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,450
But if we are to attack Yin Qi,

167
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,150
it's not a good solution for the Dou's army
to forcibly break through the city gate.

168
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,120
We need to sneak troops and weapons

169
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
into the city in advance.

170
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,240
But the city gate is heavily guarded.

171
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
What should we do?

172
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,800
Don't worry.

173
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,750
I have my own way.

174
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,030
You're sending charcoal in the snow.

175
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,510
I will definitely repay you.

176
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,720
We must rescue Yun
the night before the ceremony.

177
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,750
Qi Yan,

178
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,900
you set up ambushes everywhere
in the city with secret guards.

179
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,390
Dou Feiyang,

180
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,040
you lead the troops

181
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,240
to intercept reinforcements
outside City Lord's mansion.

182
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,670
The rest of you follow me
to attack City Lord's mansion.

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
- Yes, My Lord.
- Yes, My Lord.

184
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,130
Mr. Xie, how did you know

185
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,850
that there is a secret passage
to enter the city here?

186
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,270
Over the years, in order to evade pursuit,

187
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,320
I have lived here for a period of time,

188
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,510
so I know it very well.

189
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,510
Mr. Xie,

190
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,800
you have suffered a lot

191
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,870
these years.

192
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,600
My experience as a beggar

193
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,030
can contribute to the rebellion
against the rebels.

194
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,240
It can be considered as a comfort.

195
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,280
Let's go.

196
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,840
My Lord, you are so ruthless.

197
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,510
Wearing clothes made by me,

198
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,030
you will marry another woman.

199
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,200
How can Xie Yun be compared to you?

200
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,510
She is just a pawn I used to lure out Yin Ji.

201
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,480
When everything is over,

202
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,390
I will give you

203
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,960
whatever you want.

204
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,270
My Lord, please keep your word.

205
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,590
Sure.

206
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,710
My Lord,

207
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,690
Xie Yun requests an audience.

208
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,440
You go back first.

209
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,200
Be good.

210
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,150
It's really rare.

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,630
You actually came to me
on your own initiative.

212
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,630
I want to make a deal with you.

213
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,720
Make a deal?

214
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,600
What do you want?

215
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,240
I want a person's life.

216
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,710
Who is it?

217
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Fu Zirong.

218
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,750
He killed my father.

219
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,000
I want him to pay with his life.

220
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,360
He and I are sworn friends.

221
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,360
What can you offer in exchange for his life?

222
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,630
As long as you kill him,

223
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,790
I am willing to marry you

224
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,440
and cooperate with all your actions.

225
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,470
My Lord!

226
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,950
My Lord!

227
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,080
Yin Ji is attacking.

228
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,470
What?

229
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,440
Stop.

230
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,000
- Yun.
- Yun.

231
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,670
I'll kill you.

232
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,840
Stop.

233
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,360
You may still don't know

234
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,320
I have been taking good care of her

235
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,510
at my mansion these days.

236
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,750
It's worthy of being the noble lady.

237
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,670
She's different from others.

238
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,960
No wonder

239
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,200
you are willing to die for her.

240
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,750
Yin Qi,

241
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,270
let her go.

242
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,630
You come over here.

243
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,360
Exchange your life

244
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,360
for hers.

245
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,960
OK.

246
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,160
No...

247
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,150
You come alone.

248
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,960
Yin Ji.

249
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,200
No...

250
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,750
My Lord, no!

251
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:21,990
My Lord!

252
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,280
Yun.

253
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,040
Kill.

254
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:57,480
- Kill.
- Kill.
