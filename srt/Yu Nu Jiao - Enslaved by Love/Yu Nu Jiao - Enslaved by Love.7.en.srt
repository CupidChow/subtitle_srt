=Episode 7=

3
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,590
Look at her fair and delicate skin.

4
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,590
I really feast my eyes on this beauty today.

5
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,270
What?

6
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,120
Can you let her climb onto your bed?

7
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,590
She once climbed onto the beds

8
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,430
of City Lord and Yin Qi.

9
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,320
If she doesn't,

10
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,710
it's OK that I climb onto her bed.

11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,070
Are you qualified?

12
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,710
Look at that beauty.

13
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,550
Indeed.

14
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,640
Isn't this Mr. Qi?

15
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,840
Miss Xie is really cunning.

16
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,350
Even so, there are still people protecting her.

17
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,240
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,710
I'm late.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,840
Miss Xie.

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,280
That's Mr. Qi.

21
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,960
How dare you compete with him for a woman?

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,190
She may climb

23
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,240
onto Mr. Qi's bed tonight.

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,960
Why did you hit him?

25
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,800
Get lost.

26
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,150
Miss, you have just recovered from a fever.

27
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,470
You can't afford to catch a cold again.

28
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,550
I'm fine.

29
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,840
You go to rest first.

30
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,000
I want to be alone for a while.

31
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,360
I'll go cook something to eat for you.

32
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,520
How about some osmanthus cakes?

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,840
Well...

34
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,870
Let me heat up the medicine for you.

35
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,270
My Lord,

36
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,400
you have been working on documents all night.

37
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,430
You should rest properly.

38
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,680
The doctor also said

39
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,240
you are being too anxious.

40
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,190
You shouldn't be overworking.

41
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,240
What about her?

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,430
Miss Xie had a high fever last night.

43
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,960
Maybe she has just recovered from the fever.

44
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,400
Should I summon her?

45
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,910
I'll go visit her later.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,120
If she gets better,
I'll let her take care of you.

47
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,710
Have I gone too far?

48
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,400
You have your reason.

49
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,560
As long as you explain,

50
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,160
no matter what the reason is,

51
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,360
even if you lie to me...

52
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,800
I have no choice.

53
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,630
After she wake up,

54
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,430
she has been silent all the time.

55
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,190
She neither ate nor drank,

56
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,430
nor took any medicine.

57
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,950
She just sat there, looking out of the window.

58
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,430
I'm worried she won't be able to hold on.

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,430
Miss Xie is really pitiful.

60
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,590
Mr. Qi,

61
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,750
please save her.

62
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,760
Let her go.

63
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,030
Mr. Qi!

64
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,000
Protect City Lord. Quick!

65
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,760
Get out!

66
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,560
No one is allowed in.

67
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,270
My Lord...

68
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,230
Get out.

69
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,160
Yes. Leave here.

70
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,390
Have you vented your anger?

71
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,630
Are you talking about yourself?

72
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,750
You clearly promised me

73
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,950
to protect her well.

74
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,560
But what have you done?

75
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,360
Have you taken good care of her?

76
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,190
I have my considerations.

77
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,630
You always say you have arrangements and plans.

78
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,120
But can you bear

79
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,560
the consequences by yourself?

80
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,680
This time,

81
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,680
you have hurt her deeply.

82
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,870
Are you feeling better?

83
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,630
How can you manage without eating?

84
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,830
I brought you some pastries.

85
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,000
Eat some.

86
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,270
My Lady, if you come to laugh at me,

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,070
you can go back.

88
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,680
Don't be like this.

89
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,000
I heard that you were sold
to the Lianxiang Whorehouse by Ji.

90
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,510
I also think he went too far.

91
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,720
I know we didn't get along before,

92
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,870
but we have a bond from growing up together.

93
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,070
I can't bear to see Ji treating you like this.

94
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,430
After all, you two had an engagement before.

95
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,070
You don't have to worry.

96
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,160
My fate with City Lord has come to an end.

97
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,950
Maybe Ji has been busy
with official duties recently.

98
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,950
He has nowhere to vent.

99
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,270
Don't blame him.

100
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,470
Xie Yun,

101
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,360
do you still love Ji?

102
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,070
There is a secret room in Ji's study.

103
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,720
You may find information

104
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,510
about your family you want to know.

105
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,740
(City Lord has been treating me kindly.)

106
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,540
(Xie Han)

107
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,670
(This is my brother's handwriting.)

108
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,910
My dear mother and brother,

109
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,510
City Lord allowed me to leave the mansion

110
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,630
and meet you after three years.

111
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,550
My dear mother and brother,

112
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,150
City Lord treats me very well.

113
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,670
Please don't worry about me.

114
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,200
My dear mother and brother,

115
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,870
I am in unbearable pain.

116
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,150
Only by thinking of you

117
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,670
can I find a glimmer of hope.

118
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,590
It turns out

119
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,960
not a single letter has been delivered.

120
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,320
Yin Ji,

121
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,200
you can ridicule me,

122
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,480
trample on my dignity,

123
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,510
and even let others insult me.

124
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,910
But why do you have to deceive me,

125
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,120
and give me these non-existent hopes?

126
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,080
It seems

127
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,320
you have seen what you want.

128
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,840
You know what's in the secret room.

129
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,120
You went to great lengths to lead me there.

130
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,240
How could I disappoint your kindness?

131
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,720
I found it by chance.

132
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,390
I never expected that Ji would
go to such lengths

133
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,440
to keep you here.

134
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,350
Exactly.

135
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,150
I didn't expect

136
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,120
what merits or abilities I have

137
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,440
that would make him

138
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,440
try to weave such a beautiful dream for me.

139
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,670
Since you dislike me so much,

140
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,910
why don't you escort me
out of the mansion?

141
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,480
You want me to release you

142
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,600
whom Ji asked me to keep an eye on.

143
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,510
Do you think I'm a fool?

144
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,030
Do you think how serious it is?

145
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,270
There is no possibility
between me and Yin Ji anymore.

146
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,750
If you release me,

147
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,000
From now on, no one will
annoy you in the mansion.

148
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,360
This is beneficial to you without any harm.

149
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,840
It's not impossible for me to help you.

150
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,120
What do you want?

151
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,270
I want you to kneel

152
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,600
and kowtow to me.

153
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,120
What? You're unwilling?

154
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,470
I

155
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,030
beg you to help me leave the mansion.

156
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,440
OK.

157
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,350
I'll help you.

158
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,240
MY Lady, are you really going to help her?

159
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,200
Of course. Why not?

160
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,510
Go.

161
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,320
Have my people escort her out.

162
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,560
Yes, My Lady.

163
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,720
You'd never appear in front of Ji again.

164
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,630
Did you hear me?

165
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,440
Yes, My Lady.
