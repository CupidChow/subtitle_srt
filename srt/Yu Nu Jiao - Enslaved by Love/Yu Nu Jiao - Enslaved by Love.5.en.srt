=Episode 5=

3
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,350
(Hanmo Pavilion)

4
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,190
Report.

5
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,710
Miss Xie has been brought in.

6
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,680
Where did she run off to?

7
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,510
When Miss Xie was found,

8
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,150
she was already at the city gate.

9
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,710
You actually confused me.

10
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,430
Xie Yun,

11
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,640
you tried hard to escape.

12
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,790
In the end, it all came to nothing.

13
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,310
How is the feeling

14
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,070
of being fooled by others?

15
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,040
What are you laughing at?

16
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,840
I'm laughing at you.

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,430
You are the one playing with me

18
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,000
and betraying me.

19
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,310
But you're still

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,710
pretending to be the victim

21
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,840
and questioning my reasons.

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,400
How dare you!

23
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
Do you really think I dare not kill you?

24
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,230
Then kill me.

25
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,840
Set me free.

26
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,550
Fine.

27
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,760
You let me go.

28
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,400
Let me down.

29
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,400
Let go of me.

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,400
Let me go.

31
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,750
Behave yourself.

32
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,240
Let me go.

33
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,120
What qualifications do you have
to despise me?

34
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,630
What qualifications do you have
to despise me?

35
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,080
Let me go.

36
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,430
You let me go.

37
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,870
You're boring.

38
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,520
Wipe away the tears.

39
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,960
Come out.

40
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,630
Wang Xinu served me today.

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,270
I like her very much.

42
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,920
She is conferred the title of Lady Wang.

43
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,590
Starting from today,

44
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,160
she will live in Baiyun Pavilion.

45
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,000
- Yes, My Lord.
- Ji,

46
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,040
Wang Xinu's despicable.

47
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,190
How could you casually
bestow a title upon her?

48
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,670
Xie Yun,

49
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,070
are you satisfied?

50
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,920
Congratulations to you
on finding a good match.

51
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,400
My Lord!

52
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,000
Set her free, please.

53
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,030
Xie Yun,

54
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,360
your savior has arrived.

55
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,070
Are you going to go with him?

56
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,920
This matter has nothing to do with Mr. Qi.

57
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,240
Since it has nothing to do with Mr. Qi,

58
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,040
it must be someone in the mansion helping you.

59
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,590
Cai Tianxi.

60
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,760
Here.

61
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,270
The guards cannot identify the person clearly.

62
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,760
Deal with them according to military law.

63
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,800
Xie Yun's maid is punished with beatings,

64
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,950
- to deter others.
- Yes, My Lord.

65
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,040
- Don't...
- Guards...

66
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,950
It's none of their business.

67
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,320
It's none of Xiuxiu's business either.

68
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,920
I decided to escape.

69
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,950
Please do not punish them.

70
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,350
Qi Yan,

71
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,600
I don't want anyone
to get hurt because of me.

72
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,910
Help me.

73
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,510
If knowing the mistake is useful,

74
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,000
what's the use of the mansion's rules?

75
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,310
Miss Xie,

76
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,830
aren't you usually the strictest about rules?

77
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,630
Are you crazy?

78
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,830
Do you think a few slaps

79
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,070
will make me let them go?

80
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,600
I know my mistake.

81
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,480
Please punish me, My Lord.

82
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,080
OK.

83
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,190
How do you want me to punish you?

84
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,120
I know my mistake.

85
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,120
I'd rather not marry in my whole life

86
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,040
to serve you, Madam,

87
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,070
and Lady Wang.

88
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,270
If you want to summon 18 beauties,

89
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,480
I will go now.

90
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,600
I only plead you

91
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,830
to keep the promise

92
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,120
and protect my family's safety.

93
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,720
I'm sorry

94
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,870
to have you serve me.

95
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,400
Good.

96
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,710
Cai Tianxi.

97
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,880
Here.

98
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,640
Baobao.

99
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,560
These are 1,000 pearls from the South Sea

100
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,070
that I specially sent someone to search for.

101
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,680
This time I conferred on Wang Xinu.

102
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,800
I feel sorry for you.

103
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,800
I know

104
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,390
you have me in your heart.

105
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,230
It's for you.

106
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,880
Is it pretty?

107
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,480
What's wrong with the injury on your face?

108
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,200
Nothing.

109
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,270
What's going on exactly?

110
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,830
If you don't tell me, I won't take it.

111
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,240
My brother needed to practice boxing.

112
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,000
Five taels for one punch.

113
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,560
I think it's a way to make money.

114
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,670
So I can afford this pearl.

115
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,000
Why are you so silly?

116
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,360
What are you still standing there for?

117
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,670
Put it on my wife.

118
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,120
(Although I have nothing)

119
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,910
(and can only afford this one,)

120
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,630
(I, Xiao Ji, swear,)

121
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,510
(I will definitely give Xie Yun)

122
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,840
(thousands of pearls.)

123
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,390
It's all your fault, Xie Yun.

124
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,480
You must be jealous of me.

125
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,710
Ji,

126
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,270
you must stand on my side.

127
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,710
Hurry up and pick them up.

128
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,150
These are 1,000 pearls.

129
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,790
If one pearl is missing, you are doomed.

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,080
Miss Xie,

131
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,550
there is still time.

132
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,600
Just bear with it.

133
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,390
Report.

134
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,600
The pearls Miss Xie picked up are all here.

135
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,560
Have you counted them?

136
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,790
No one can be missing.

137
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,110
I have counted them all.

138
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,670
Not a single one is missing.

139
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,630
But there is even extra one.

140
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,560
What?

141
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,550
I counted three times.

142
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,630
Indeed, there are 1,001 pearls.

143
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,510
Which one is the extra one?

144
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,790
Each one is the same.

145
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,390
I can't tell.

146
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,960
It's different.

147
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,790
I'm sorry for my incompetence.

148
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,550
I really can't tell.

149
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,510
It's different.

150
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,840
My Lord, please calm down.

151
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,960
I said it's different.

152
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,510
There is one that is different.

153
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,390
Find it.

154
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,670
Find it.

155
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,790
Yes, I'll find it now.

156
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,230
My Lady.

157
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,680
My Lady, look at this.

158
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,440
Our family told me

159
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,000
if we put drugs in this wine pot,

160
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,720
no one will know it.

161
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,840
All your wishes will come true.

162
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,390
Good.

163
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,390
I will dress up nicely tonight.

164
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,150
Wish for getting a baby boy at once.

165
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,960
Madam is coming.

166
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,800
Ji.

167
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,510
Why aren't you resting so late?

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,840
Anything else?

169
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
I just brewed some wine.

170
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,270
I would like to invite you to drink with me.

171
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,920
OK.

172
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,200
Let me give it a try.

173
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,630
Well,

174
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,680
Ji,

175
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,120
taste it carefully

176
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,360
and see how skilled I am.

177
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,560
This wine...

178
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,000
Is there any problem with this?

179
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,870
I did not have dinner today.

180
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,470
I'm afraid I'll get drunk after just one drink.

181
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,480
- Why not...
- Ji, have the dishes first.

182
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,480
I smashed cucumber personally.

183
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,470
Try it.

184
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,710
OK.

185
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,750
Is it delicious?

186
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,920
It's very flavorful.

187
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,280
You should try it too.

188
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,510
Is it delicious?

189
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,380
Delicious.

190
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,440
Especially delicious.

191
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,270
Let's have a drink together.

192
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,080
Toast to the smashed cucumber.

193
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,870
Yes, toast to the smashed cucumber.

194
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,390
Here.

195
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,630
Ji,

196
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,750
how are you feeling?

197
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,870
Ji.

198
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,630
This wine

199
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,510
is a bit strong.

200
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,680
Ji,

201
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,870
why do you get dizzy?

202
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,550
Did I buy the wrong drug

203
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,790
or put the wrong drug?

204
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,590
Ji.

205
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,270
It's so hot.

206
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,750
Is my wine really that powerful?

207
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,630
Ji.

208
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,510
What should I do now?

209
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,960
Could it be

210
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,320
that I have to do it myself?

211
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,840
(Although the means are clumsy,)

212
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,960
(for you,)

213
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,360
(I can break through the bottom line.)

214
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,110
How dare you!

215
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,710
You will die now!

216
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,110
Come on.

217
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,510
Even if he took drugs,

218
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,120
how could he do like this?

219
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,910
Is he drunk or dizzy?

220
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,350
You wake up.

221
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,390
Ji,

222
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,630
you wake up.
