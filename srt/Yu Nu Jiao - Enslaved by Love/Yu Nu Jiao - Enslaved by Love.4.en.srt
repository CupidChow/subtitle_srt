00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,380
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,350
Are you feeling sorry for her?

4
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,920
Stop daydreaming.

5
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,400
No matter what, she is my woman.

6
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,840
She will never go with you.

7
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,230
You can give it a try.

8
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,430
Qi Yan.

9
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,040
I know she used to like you.

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,310
But under your so-called protection,

11
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,560
how much grievance has she suffered?

12
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,000
Ask yourself honestly.

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,200
How much affection between you and her

14
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,150
is left until now?

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,510
The torment named love

16
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,200
will only push her further away.

17
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,840
I have investigated on site

18
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,310
exile route of the Xie family three years ago.

19
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,560
I found the Xiao family
was not the only killer.

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,040
Three years have passed.

21
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,070
The clues are vague.
It's hard to investigate.

22
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,560
Should we continue or give up?

23
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,600
When you have made up your mind,
let me know.

24
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,790
Whether we tell her the truth

25
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,300
about her brother and mother's disappearance,

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,040
it's also up to you.

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,200
Why did you faint?

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,470
The doctor said it is stagnation in the heart.

29
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,360
She fainted from anger.

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,000
She will recover

31
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,200
if she can vent her anger.

32
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,120
Didn't your maid see her

33
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,240
falling into the lake?

34
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,750
What else do you want?

35
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,870
I heard

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,470
she just fell into the water.

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,710
But she didn't drown.

38
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,590
How can you compare it with my sufferings?

39
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,750
Xie Yun is still running a fever now.

40
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,960
Even medicine needs to be fed

41
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,000
by others.

42
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,630
For you,

43
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,520
she just fell into the water.

44
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
But after all,

45
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,360
this is her fault.

46
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,000
Who else can be blamed?

47
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,000
How about I beat Xie Yun to death

48
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,680
in front of you?

49
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,240
City Lord indeed cares about Madam the most.

50
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,910
If you really do like this,

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,750
Madam's illness will definitely...

52
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,920
Ji,

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,870
are you OK?

54
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,750
You can't even hold a bowl of medicine steady.

55
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,400
What's the use of keeping you?

56
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,520
Kill her.

57
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,030
- Please don't, My Lord.
- Ji,

58
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,800
let me make amends for her instead.

59
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,590
Forget it.

60
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,080
Give her a chance to make up for her mistake.

61
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,430
Someone fell into the water.

62
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,590
Your maid took half a day

63
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,280
to deliver the message to me.

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,840
She must have been searching her carefully.

65
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,870
I happened to lose a jade a few days ago,

66
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,800
and it just fell into that pond.

67
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,310
If she can find it,

68
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,400
I will not pursue this matter any further.

69
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,030
But it is so cold

70
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,000
and the pond is so deep.

71
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,030
Chenguang is just a little girl.

72
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,150
You care a lot about your maid.

73
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,560
It makes my maid look insignificant.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,200
Since your illness requires you

75
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,120
to vent your anger,

76
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,270
how about this,

77
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,390
I will deduct a year's salary from Xie Yun

78
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,120
and compensate you.

79
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,030
Are you satisfied?

80
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,360
I'm satisfied.

81
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,310
Find the jade pendant and give it
to your master.

82
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,160
The jade pendant happens to be
Xie Yun's salary.

83
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,000
My Lady,

84
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,720
judging by City Lord's attitude,

85
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,190
Xie Yun must have said something.

86
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,720
We really can't keep this person.

87
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,350
Shut up!

88
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,000
Can't you see what Ji did clearly?

89
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,720
No one can bully Xie Yun

90
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,630
except him.

91
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,870
But if I really want to harm her...

92
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,520
Ji,

93
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,360
do you really care so much about Xie Yun?

94
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,800
I beg you

95
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,920
to marry Yin Qi.

96
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,430
Let me go.

97
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,320
Let me go.

98
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,360
Let me down.

99
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,640
Let go.

100
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,400
Xie Yun,

101
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,390
what's the use of being stubborn?

102
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,680
You still actively throw yourself into my arms.

103
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,800
(Memorial tablets)
Yin Ji isn't interested in women.

104
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,510
He's very suspicious.

105
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,480
To complete the task,

106
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,630
you must start with his personal maid,

107
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,120
Xie Yun.

108
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,510
She has been entangled with Yin Ji for years.

109
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,380
(Ms. Xun from Baiyu City)
The entanglement is deep.

110
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,950
You must make good use of it.

111
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,240
(Wang Xinu)
I promise to complete the task.

112
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,060
(One week later)

113
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,590
You look in a good mood.

114
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,000
Greetings, My Lord.

115
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,390
You have lost a lot of weight.

116
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,320
Do you become mute after an illness?

117
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,710
No.

118
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,440
That's good.

119
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,440
Remember this lesson.

120
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,920
Keep up.

121
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,580
(Hanmo Pavilion)

122
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,350
My Lord.

123
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,150
Miss Xie looks better.

124
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,390
Mr. Cai.

125
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,350
Miss Xie,

126
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,960
without you,

127
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,440
I'm afraid

128
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,910
I can't hold up anymore.

129
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,200
Mr. Cai, you must be kidding.

130
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,510
Without you, Qianyuan Pavilion
would really not hold on.

131
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,040
Cai Tianxi,

132
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,590
you can go.

133
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,590
Yes, My Lord.

134
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,270
Why are you still standing here?

135
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,120
Go make tea.

136
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,160
Yes, My Lord.

137
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,710
Let me.

138
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,870
You just recovered from a serious illness

139
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,870
You should take a break.

140
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,360
How can you serve people?

141
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,030
Then I will take my leave first.

142
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,160
Miss Xie,

143
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,110
are you OK?

144
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,440
I didn't mean to.

145
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,720
Losing composure in front of the master

146
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,080
is the biggest taboo for a servant.

147
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,720
You clearly pushed me on purpose.

148
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,560
Even so,

149
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,960
can you shout and scream
in front of the master?

150
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,270
Making noise in front of the master

151
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,750
is the second biggest taboo.

152
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,720
Want to imitate me?

153
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,960
There's still a lot for you to learn.

154
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,910
It's not just

155
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,240
speaking.

156
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,160
Come here.

157
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,150
You are giving up on yourself.

158
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,960
Don't act in front of me.

159
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,440
I have always been curious

160
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,600
what you are thinking.

161
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,320
I figure it out.

162
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,630
I accept my fate.

163
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,630
No matter how I struggle,

164
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,080
you won't allow me to reunite with my family,

165
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,790
nor will you let me leave,

166
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,200
will you?

167
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,280
Good.

168
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,470
Congratulations!

169
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,960
You finally see the reality.

170
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,040
You can go.

171
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,680
Yes, My Lord.

172
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,800
I take my leave.

173
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,790
Now you look much better.

174
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,080
Don't let me see

175
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,000
that look again.

176
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,240
I don't like it.

177
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,680
Yes, My Lord.

178
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,150
I understand.

179
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,000
Then I will take my leave first.

180
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,150
Since you have recovered,

181
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,360
serve me tonight.

182
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,920
Yes,

183
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,440
Yin Ji.

184
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,540
(Qianyuan Pavilion)

185
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,540
(Four years ago)

186
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,600
The little tricks I used to please you before

187
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,080
are now being used on me.

188
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,510
You are really good at being lazy.

189
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,510
You're here.

190
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,510
Be

191
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,840
safe.

192
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,720
Guessing game.

193
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,550
You have never won before.

194
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,720
You're a bit different today.

195
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,720
You decide not to leave?

196
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,870
Are you using the same old tricks now?

197
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
It's useless.

198
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,320
Even after another three or five years,

199
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,510
in this lifetime,

200
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,440
don't expect to leave.

201
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,200
You are not Xie Yun.

202
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,710
What are you doing here?

203
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,630
Who allowed you to come in?

204
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,270
Miss Xie

205
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,840
let me serve you.

206
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,270
You're a maid.

207
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
I am also a maid.

208
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,390
You want to rise in status.

209
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,790
I can help you with that.

210
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,670
We have no conflict of interest.

211
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,600
I don't think we are enemies.

212
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,670
So, the price for your help

213
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,200
is to have me help you escape from this city?

214
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,870
I don't ask you to do such a thing.

215
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,390
I just need you to do a trivial little thing.

216
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,510
What's it?

217
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,670
Go to the pharmacy and buy some cassia seeds.

218
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,510
You asked Wang Xinu to come to me.

219
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,750
Aren't you afraid she will betray you?

220
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,390
If she betrays me,

221
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,750
she won't get what she wants.

222
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,630
(Token)
Seeing it is like seeing City Lord.

223
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,750
Apart from Yin Ji in the city,

224
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,070
I am the only one who has it.

225
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,830
Under the command of City Lord,

226
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,680
at sunset,

227
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,510
I'll send a squad of soldiers to the city gate.

228
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,720
By then,

229
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,440
you can leave the mansion and the city with it.
