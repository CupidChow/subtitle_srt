3
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:04,820
(The Dou's Mansion)

4
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,310
Your stunning beauty is truly extraordinary,

5
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,790
taking the shine out of all the other women.

6
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,790
You live up to the reputation.

7
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,840
Master Dou, your mind is sharp and profound.

8
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,680
You truly deserve the title of the Living Yama.

9
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,840
Greetings.

10
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,230
You and your brother look very similar.

11
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,120
But your heart is tougher than his.

12
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,430
To cling to Yan Qi,

13
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,120
you were willing to break
off the engagement with Yin Ji.

14
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,760
But you are willing to take risks
and come alone

15
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,430
to seek for medicine for him.

16
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,040
Xie Yun,

17
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,790
you are really a contradictory person.

18
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,590
I don't know what you are talking about.

19
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,310
You can deceive others.

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,950
But you can't deceive me.

21
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,200
I am actually a little interested

22
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,000
in what you are thinking in your heart.

23
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,360
Master Dou, don't make fun of me.

24
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,400
I only have one thing in my heart.

25
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,120
That is to keep Yin Ji alive.

26
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,080
Please give me the Fangji grass

27
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,430
to save Yin Ji's life.

28
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,910
Do I have to give you the medicine

29
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,800
when you see me?

30
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,190
You can't be that naive, right?

31
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,280
Don't forget.

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,680
I was driven here

33
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,400
because of the assassination of Yin Ji.

34
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,910
Why did the Dou family suddenly go crazy?

35
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,750
Aren't they always known
for staying out of any disputes

36
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,710
and keeping a low profile?

37
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,280
The newly appointed Master Dou Feiyang

38
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,590
regards you as a great enemy

39
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,240
for some reason.

40
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,190
But this should be done by him personally.

41
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,360
The elders of the Dou family mediated in it,

42
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,520
willing to use half
of the Dou's family property

43
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,360
to exchange for Dou Feiyang's life.

44
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,750
Ask the Dou family and that lunatic
to get out of Baiyu City.

45
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,840
They can never set foot here.

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,360
After you received a letter from City Lord,

47
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,470
you didn't refuse immediately,

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,470
but asked to see me.

49
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,280
There must be room for maneuver.

50
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,000
Why not directly propose conditions?

51
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,680
I am ready to pay the price.

52
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,470
At any price?

53
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,680
At any price.

54
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,080
Spend a night with me.

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,910
Are you willing?

56
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,750
I didn't expect Yin Ji to be a romantic person.

57
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,560
He's willing to give up his life for you.

58
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,310
He has chased you all the way here.

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,030
What do you mean?

60
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,040
City Lord,

61
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,300
this is the territory of the Dou family.

62
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,230
As agreed,

63
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,850
without permission, you are not allowed
to enter the territory of the Dou family.

64
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,640
Get lost.

65
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,480
My Master

66
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,240
wants you to enter alone.

67
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,480
But you must disarm.

68
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,200
My Lord!

69
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,920
Hope that you abide by the agreement.

70
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,000
I am willing to pay the price

71
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,800
to exchange for his safety.

72
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,870
The devoted lover sacrifices his life
to save his beloved.

73
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,560
The beloved sacrifices everything
to keep the devoted lover safe.

74
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,710
Wonderful!

75
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,310
So wonderful!

76
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,560
Doesn't that make me the villain

77
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,000
in the middle of the story?

78
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,310
But I, the villain,

79
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,190
enjoy seeing lovers end in tragedy.

80
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,590
Let's do it this way.

81
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,750
Since you somewhat meet my taste,

82
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,070
I'll give you a chance to repent.

83
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,000
What do you think?

84
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,560
I have no regrets.

85
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,780
(The Dou's Mansion)

86
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,560
Xie Yun! Xie Yun!

87
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,200
Yun.

88
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,630
Yun. Yun.

89
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,960
Xie Yun.

90
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,480
He looks

91
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,830
like a lost dog.

92
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,390
What do you mean?

93
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,630
Don't be angry.

94
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,830
Since I have promised you,

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,190
I will naturally not break my word.

96
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,950
I just want to invite City Lord

97
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,120
to quietly watch a play.

98
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,750
I don't want you to save me in this way.

99
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,910
Xie Yun!

100
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,960
No!

101
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,270
No!

102
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,350
Xie Yun!

103
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,030
Move aside.

104
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,390
If you want to see my dead body, then come in.

105
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,470
Why?

106
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,630
I don't need you to save me in this way.

107
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,160
Xie Yun, I beg you.

108
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,200
Come out.

109
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,950
But I want you to stay alive.

110
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,150
Yin Ji,

111
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,520
you go.

112
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,920
I don't need.

113
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,070
I don't need to stay alive in this way.

114
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,390
Xie Yun, if you don't come out,

115
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,190
I will die in front of you right now.

116
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,910
Move aside.

117
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,120
We don't stay here anymore.

118
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,080
We are going home.

119
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,030
Let's go.

120
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,350
Let's go.

121
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,760
Xie Yun,

122
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,310
are you really trying to force me to death?

123
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,080
I beg you.

124
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,430
Go back with me, OK?

125
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,360
Please, Xie Yun.

126
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,390
We don't need it. Let's go back.

127
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,760
Let's go home.

128
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,470
OK?

129
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,590
I beg you.

130
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,560
Not bad.

131
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,240
What a great show!

132
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,480
Dou Feiyang, I will kill you.

133
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,400
Yin Ji,

134
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,430
from the moment I stepped in here,

135
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,240
I only had one goal:

136
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,920
I want the two of us

137
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,000
all alive.

138
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,080
Miss Xie is the one with a clear mind.

139
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,870
It's my territory.

140
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,960
Do you think you can come and go

141
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,200
as you please?

142
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,470
Yin Ji,

143
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,630
this is my choice.

144
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,920
Yun...

145
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,280
Yun...

Yun!

147
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,370
Yun!

148
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,230
Yun!

149
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,000
Yun!

150
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,270
Yun!

151
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,750
Xie Yun,

152
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,750
why?

153
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,360
No...

154
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,720
No...

155
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,550
No...

156
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,200
No...

157
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,080
No...

158
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,870
Xie Yun...

159
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,240
Come back.

You actually made him cough up blood.

He won't die, will he?

173
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,480
Do you really want to save him or kill him?

174
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,240
I really want to save him,

175
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,870
but that doesn't stop me from

176
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,030
returning the humiliation he gave me to him.

177
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,840

that cannot be resolved with just an apology.

179

I want to save him.

180
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,870
But that doesn't mean I forgive him.

181
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,030
The two are unrelated.

than you did just now.

You have vented your anger.

185
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,240
I also have saved him.

186
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,750
Is it time

187
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,720
to fulfill the promise?

188
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,600
Are you really interested in me?

189
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,870
