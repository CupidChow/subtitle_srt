00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,380
=Enslaved by Love=

2
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,380
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,520
Our father and mother cannot die in vain.

4
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,400
I...

5
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,640
I'm going to marry him

6
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,120
to obtain evidence
proving the innocence of our family.

7
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,120
What evidence?

8
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,870
After the fall of the Xiao family,

9
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,870
I forced Xiao Lingfeng with Xiao Baobao's life

10
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,200
and knew something from his mouth.

11
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,070
Back then,

12
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,680
in his presence,

13
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,480
our father signed a contract
with former City Lord.

14
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,760
As long as our family

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,070
helps to obtain evidence of Yin Qi's rebellion,

16
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,120
former City Lord will clear the name for us.

17
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,790
That contract

18
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,590
is hidden in the Scripture Repository
in the high tower.

19
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,590
I can only become Madam

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,280
to have a chance to climb the tower

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,510
and obtain that contract.

22
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,000
So, how are you going to act?

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,400
I will find a chance
to enter the Scripture Repository

24
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,710
and get the contract

25
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,710
on the day of the celebration,

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,870
proving to everyone in the Baiyu City

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,630
that the Xie family is innocent.

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,520
OK.

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,910
I will be waiting for you under the tower.

30
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,080
You have to be careful.

31
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,030
Han, you must also be careful.

32
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,700
(Qianyuan Pavilion)

33
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,150
It must hurt at the time.

34
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,710
It hurts.

35
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,080
You have been City Lord for three years.

36
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,120
How many times have you suffered such pain?

37
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,400
Many times.

38
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,870
But it is the most painful this time.

39
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,680
What was the situation like at that time?

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,120
I happened to be hunting in the woods that day.

41
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,870
The assassins suddenly attacked me.

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,840
If Xue Jing hadn't arrived in time,

43
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,120
you probably would never see me again.

44
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,680
I must have cried a lot at that time.

45
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,870
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,080
I won't let you worry
about me anymore in the future.

47
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,080
Keep your word.

48
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,080
I swear.

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,310
By the way,

50
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,520
my parents and brother should be arriving
in a few days.

51
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,960
What's wrong?

52
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,520
I am just about to tell you about this.

53
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,680
Your brother replied to me,

54
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,520
saying they encountered a snowstorm
on the road.

55
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,400
They may not arrive until the ceremony.

56
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,080
You are not lying to me, are you?

57
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,310
How could it be so coincidental?

58
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,120
How could I possibly lie to you?

59
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,150
I was just kidding with you.

60
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,630
How could you possibly deceive me?

61
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,430
You can't play this kind of joke again.

62
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,430
I will not.

63
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,750
Time to eat.

64
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,750
Time to eat.

65
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,070
You freak me out.

66
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,510
You're like a ghost.

67
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,430
Is this all?

68
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,630
Are you feeding a dog?

69
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,310
You are correct.

70
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,310
Do you think you're Madam?

71
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,070
It's not bad to have some to eat.

72
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,830
Don't blame me for not warning you.

73
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,920
You kicked this meal yourself.

74
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,070
If you starve to death,
no one will care about you.

75
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,510
How dare you!

76
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,470
I'm telling you,

77
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,950
I'm just temporarily trapped here.

78
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,040
Wait until I get out.

79
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,430
I will teach you a lesson first.

80
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,880
Help!

81
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,120
Xiao Baobao is killing me!

82
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,030
Stop it!

83
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,430
Let me go.

84
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Stop daydreaming.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,950
Still want to go out?

86
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,670
I'm telling you,

87
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,720
City Lord has already appointed Xie Yun

88
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,430
as the Madam of the city.

89
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,750
Do you think he still has time to think of you?

90
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,760
What are you talking about?

91
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,200
You're talking nonsense.

92
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,510
This is impossible.

93
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,040
The fate is fair and just.

94
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,360
You used to be arrogant
and bully others too much.

95
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,360
Now you are getting your retribution, right?

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
You

97
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,270
get old alone in this place.

98
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,720
I want to see Ji.

99
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,840
Ji!

100
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,080
Xie Yun, you liar.

101
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,360
Ji!

102
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,310
You won't see City Lord
even though you're hoarse.

103
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,750
City Lord has already given the order.

104
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,560
He doesn't want to hear any news
from Zhaoyang Pavilion.

105
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
However,

106
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,070
you just said Xie Yun is a liar.

107
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm starting to get interested.

108
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,240
I can help you convey it.

109
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,680
Why should I believe you?

110
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,680
Just because she's my enemy too.

111
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,750
You don't have to believe me.

112
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,680
Except for me,

113
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,510
who is willing to help you?

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,240
Tell Ji

115
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,680
that Xie Yun has already seen the letters
in the secret room.

116
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,910
(City Lord treated me kindly.)
She has known everything for a long time.

117
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,310
She is malicious.

118
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,720
She is framing me,

119
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,950
framing the Xiao family.

120
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,480
Why do you say that?

121
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,430
After she finished reading the letters,

122
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,830
she completely gave up on Ji

123
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,500
and begged me to help her leave the mansion.

124
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,120
Since you dislike me so much,

125
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,390
why don't you help me leave the mansion?

126
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,630
You are the person monitored by Ji.

127
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,070
But you let me help you out of the mansion.

128
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,630
Do you think I'm so foolish

129
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,270
that I don't know how serious it is?

130
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,070
There is no possibility
between me and Yin Ji anymore.

131
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,160
You let me go.

132
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,160
No one will bother you in the mansion.

133
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,800
It benefits you without harming you in any way.

134
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,160
But I don't know why she came back again.

135
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,310
Step by step, she framed my family
to this point.

136
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,270
She is pretending to have amnesia.

137
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,870
She came back with a purpose.

138
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,270
Is there anything else?

139
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
And

140
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,950
after she left the mansion,

141
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,390
she went to the Xie's Mansion.

142
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,540
(The Xie's Mansion)

143
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,790
Who else have you

144
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,750
mentioned these words to?

145
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,750
I used tricks to get her into the secret room

146
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,670
and read those letters.

147
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,030
How could I easily mention it to someone else?

148
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,510
OK.

149
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,710
I understand.

150
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,630
What do you want to do?

151
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,670
I won't let you ruin

152
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,790
the ceremony.

153
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,660
(Hanmo Pavilion)

154
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,670
Bad news! Bad news!

155
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,000
Cai Tianxi, ask him to come in.

156
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,230
Yes, My Lord.

157
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,030
Stop being panic.

158
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,480
Report inside.

159
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,630
My Lord,

160
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,630
the one living in Zhaoyang Pavilion
hung herself.

161
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,990
When did it happen?

162
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,030
Chunlan found her body

163
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,150
when delivering dinner tonight.

164
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,320
Why?

165
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,030
This is not something she would do.

166
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,400
According to Chunlan,

167
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,200
when she delivered breakfast
to Ms. Xiao this morning,

168
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,320
she created all sorts of obstacles.

169
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,440
Chunlan, in a hurry, told Ms. Xiao

170
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,840
that you are going to marry Miss Xie Yun.

171
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,870
Perhaps this matter has stimulated Ms. Xiao.

172
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,320
Hang herself?

173
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,920
This is not something she would do.

174
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,990
Cai Tianxi.

175
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,290
Here.

176
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,540
Thoroughly investigate this matter.

177
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,840
Yes, My Lord.

178
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,440
You all can leave now.

179
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,320
Yes, sir.

180
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,910
- You two can go.
- Yes, sir.

181
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,320
My Lord,

182
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,510
I'm sorry for you loss.

183
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,360
Xiao Baobao has a stubborn personality,

184
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,320
but she is not bad.

185
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,150
She has been living proudly.

186
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,240
Maybe meeting me

187
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,550
is her greatest misfortune.

188
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,680
Give her a decent burial.

189
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,590
Yes, My Lord.

190
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,710
My Lord,

191
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,670
I'm thinking

192
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,270
the ceremony is imminent,

193
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,360
if Master Xiao were to find out
about this matter,

194
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,000
he would look for trouble.

195
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:11,630
Can this matter of Ms. Xiao be kept secret?

196
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,110
I understand.

197
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,840
Xiao Baobao's words make sense.

198
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,790
Xie Yun knew that Yin Ji had been
imitating Xie Han's handwriting

199
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,360
to write letters to deceive her
for three years.

200
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,550
After escaping from the mansion,
she went to the Xie's Mansion.

201
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,150
When she came back, she had lost her memory.

202
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,840
If she was pretending to have lost her memory,

203
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,030
then everything could be explained.

204
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,200
She was stabbed in the abdomen.

205
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,840
It triggered the conflict
between the Xiao family and Yin Ji.

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,510
She acted in the brazier ceremony
to eliminate the Xiao family.

207
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,360
The premise of all this plan is

208
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,480
that Yin Ji trusts her enough.

209
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,440
In the past three years,

210
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,510
we all witnessed

211
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,510
how Yin Ji treated her.

212
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,000
If she wanted to regain Yin Ji's trust,

213
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:00,440
the best way was to pretend to lose her memory.

214
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,390
After getting rid of the Xiao family,

215
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,150
she took the risk to seek for medicine.

216
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,750
After they came back,
Yin Ji insisted that he would marry her.

217
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,120
Why does she want this position of Madam?

218
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,440
Is it just for the sake
of seeking wealth and status?

219
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,960
You underestimate Xie Yun too much.

220
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,670
Her goal is indeed related to this position,

221
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,840
but it is definitely not wealth and status.

222
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,840
What she wants

223
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,910
must be related to the Xie family.

224
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,790
You once told me

225
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,600
three years ago,

226
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,960
Master Xie sought justice in prison.

227
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Could it be related to Master Xie's injustice?

228
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,750
The Xie family's injustice?

229
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,750
The position of Madam.

230
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,750
It's really a blessing for me!

231
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,510
My Lady, could you explain it to me?

232
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,600
Did you know

233
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,070
that the most important part of the ceremony

234
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,150
must be completed in the high tower?

235
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,510
And there is a secret place on this tower

236
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,630
where no one can enter except City Lord.

237
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,220
That is the Scripture Repository.

238
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,260
(Scripture Repository)

239
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,550
Scripture Repository?

240
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,670
Inside the Scripture Repository

241
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,480
there are various secret documents of City Lord
from various generations.

242
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,320
It is the most important place in Baiyu City.

243
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,600
You mean

244
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,120
Xie Yun's goal is the Scripture Repository.

245
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,150
I can't think of a second possibility.

246
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,200
She was scheming

247
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,480
to obtain the position of Madam,

248
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,000
so as to enter the Scripture Repository.

249
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,670
There must be the evidence she wants.

250
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,510
If so,

251
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,200
our chances of winning have increased.

252
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,080
As long as we make good use of Xie Yun,

253
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,320
Yin Ji's fate will be in our hands.
