=Episode 15=

3
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,320
No...

4
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,270
No...

5
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,910
Yun.

6
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,680
Dou Feiyang!

7
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,550
Let go of me.

8
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,150
You are a despicable person.

9
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,560
I will kill you.

10
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,240
Let me go.

11
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,640
If you dare, let's fight one-on-one.

12
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,600
Yun.

13
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,120
If I don't tie you up,

14
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,680
I'm afraid that you might hurt yourself

15
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,910
when I apply medicine to you.

16
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,430
You obtained it in this way.

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,870
I don't need.

18
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,310
Xie Yun,

19
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,030
why did you act on your own?

20
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,430
What about you?

21
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,000
You don't even care about your own life.

22
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,400
How did you promise me a lifetime?

23
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,310
Don't leave.

24
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,200
Don't leave.

25
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,470
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,560
I didn't protect you well.

27
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,120
Yun,

28
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,200
I beg you.

29
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,120
Don't leave me, OK?

30
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,800
Let me be your husband, OK?

31
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,470
I won't let you get hurt again in the future.

32
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,430
Silly you!

33
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,680
Do you really think something happened
between me and Dou Feiyang?

34
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,150
You are really stable.

35
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,310
Not like me, I can't control my emotions.

36
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,840
Are you worthy of your brother by doing this?

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,840
You...

38
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,190
Turns out

39
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,430
you don't like me after all.

40
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,910
You are indeed as my brother described.

41
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,600
He often mentioned you.

42
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,320
What did he say about me?

43
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,000
He said you are simple.

44
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,350
Nothing else?

45
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,750
Is that all?

46
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,750
If Xie Han were here,
I would ask him to punish you.

47
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,870
(Now only you)

48
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,160
(still believe our family.)

49
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,630
It would be great if he could punish me.

50
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,160
My brother's life is currently unknown.

51
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,680
I can't find him no matter how hard I try.

52
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,270
I have heard of the things

53
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,680
that happened to you on the way to exile.

54
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,960
I also know

55
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,600
the contradiction in your heart towards Yin Ji.

56
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,430
After this test,

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,160
I found he genuinely cares about you.

58
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,600
Whether Yin Ji is the murderer,

59
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,480
you need to judge carefully by yourself.

60
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,750
I don't know.

61
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,640
What are you doing?

62
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,390
Teach you a lesson for your brother.

63
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,800
Sleep here tonight.

64
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,190
Put on your clothes.

65
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,600
I am the noble lady of the Xie family.

66
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,430
What can Dou Feiyang do to me?

67
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,070
I have ways to ask Dou Feiyang save you.

68
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,800
I don't need this at all...

69
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,590
Master.

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,000
Master.

71
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,270
What are you looking at?

72
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,330
Hush.

73
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,080
Unbearable.

74
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,590
Hurry up, hurry up.

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But the medicine is not...

76
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,230
Medicine?

77
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,750
He is so strong.

78
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,310
He doesn't need to take medicine.

79
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,560
Hurry up, hurry up.

80
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,640
My Lord.

81
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,230
What's going on?

82
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,360
I'm worried about your safety.

83
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,480
I mobilized secret guards yesterday

84
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,600
and surrounded the Dou's Mansion.

85
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,360
I found out that Master Dou was treating you,

86
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,750
so I've been waiting outside.

87
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,510
I just met Tang Ting
and he said you are doing well,

88
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,560
so I hurried over.

89
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,800
Did you hurt the Dou family?

90
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,270
No.

91
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,320
It's strange.

92
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,720
The Dou family saw me mobilizing troops

93
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,120
and let me pass directly.

94
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,160
It seems that I need to formally meet
with Dou Feiyang.

95
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,350
Why not go out?

96
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,760
Yes, My Lord.

97
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,120
Just say what you want to say quickly.

98
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,310
Then leave quickly after that.

99
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,750
Why are you so eager?

100
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,120
Any questions?

101
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,070
This time, I mainly want to thank you
for the medicine.

102
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,720
Don't mention it.

103
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,270
I'm just doing this as a favor

104
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,240
to Xie Yun.

105
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,160
Don't flatter yourself.

106
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,800
I have to thank you.

107
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,110
Fine.

108
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,120
Since you want to make it clear,

109
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,830
you brought so many soldiers

110
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,270
to the territory of the Dou family,

111
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,000
how do you want to settle this account?

112
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,190
As long as your family is loyal to me,

113
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,800
I can lift the restriction on you.

114
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,240
Do you trust me so much?

115
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,360
At my moment of peril,

116
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,920
you didn't take advantage of it,

117
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,830
nor did harm to Xie Yun.

118
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,750
Why should I not trust you?

119
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,680
But I have one condition.

120
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,920
Before the situation is clear,

121
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,550
you must not act recklessly.

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,440
You're changing too fast.

123
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,440
I was still a bit touched just a moment ago.

124
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,390
And now you're already giving me orders.

125
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,550
There are too many forces at play now.

126
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,440
I'm doing this for the sake of your family.

127
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,630
I know.

128
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,800
What's more,

129
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,440
I'm not interested

130
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,670
in your stuff.

131
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,870
I'm so comfortable here.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,720
Has anyone ever judged you like this?

133
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,630
Like what?

134
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,270
You are so simple.

135
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,110
I?

136
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,270
Get lost.

137
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,230
I...

138
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,780
(The Dou's Mansion)

139
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,560
It's for you.

140
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,960
What's this?

141
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,790
Just take it.

142
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,670
Consider it as a wedding gift from me.

143
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,000
Who said I'm getting married?

144
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,000
He wants to marry you.
It's just a matter of time.

145
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,150
But if he dares to bully you in the future,

146
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,440
you must come to me.

147
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,550
If you have anything else,

148
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,750
you can also come to me.

149
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,040
OK.

150
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,280
Yun.

151
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,080
What are you talking about?

152
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,670
Dou Feiyang, you are looking for death.

153
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,710
What are you fanning for?

154
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,870
There is no smell on me.

155
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,510
What is this? Let me take a look.

156
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,470
No way.

157
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,960
Come on.

158
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,480
Hurry up. You're running out of time.

159
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,200
Hurry up, go.

160
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,000
Go. Go. Go.

161
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,160
We'll be leaving.

162
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,230
Take care. Farewell.

163
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,870
The assassination failed.

164
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,790
Unexpectedly, the Dou family
actually saved him.

165
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,320
Could it be that the Dou family
is already on Yin Ji's side?

166
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,390
After all, the Dou family has attempted
to assassinate Yin Ji.

167
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,750
This time, Xie Yun asked for medicine.

168
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,510
Master Dou

169
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,440
used Xie Yun to humiliate Yin Ji.

170
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,750
I find it hard to tell

171
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,550
if it's true or false.

172
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,630
Xie Yun is very good at seducing men.

173
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,720
Maybe

174
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,750
she obtained the medicine by selling her body.

175
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,270
She's really charming.

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,240
Maybe she also climbed
onto Yin Qi's bed like this.

177
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,200
All right. Continue to watch them.

178
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,360
Look for a suitable opportunity later.

179
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,160
Yes.

180
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,920
Dead?

181
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,630
The person is a man of sacrifice.

182
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,120
No clues were left behind.

183
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,790
- Don't move.
- Who sent you here?

184
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,840
Could it be those people

185
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,870
who helped Yin Qi escape back then?

186
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,230
Very likely.

187
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,960
I'm afraid Yin Qi is now lurking in the dark.

188
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,200
Just in case,

189
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,870
I have convinced the Dou family.

190
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,080
They will send troops at a critical moment.

191
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,920
Is the Dou family

192
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
sincere?

193
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,320
Dou Feiyang is not a man
who goes back on his word.

194
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,280
By the way,

195
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,360
the position of Madam has been vacant
for a long time.

196
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,870
I have made up my mind.

197
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,120
I want to marry Xie Yun.

198
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,960
I want to make her

199
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,910
become my legitimate wife.

200
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,630
This

201
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,350
is very good.
