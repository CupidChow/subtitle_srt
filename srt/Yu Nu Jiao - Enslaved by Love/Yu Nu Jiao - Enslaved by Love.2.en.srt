(Token)

4
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,280
What a pity.

5
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,280
We had an agreement

6
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,000
that I will be a maid

7
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,750
in the mansion for three years.

8
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,590
When time's up,

9
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
you'll let me reunite with my family.

10
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,360
If you want to leave here,

11
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,590
you have to get my permission.

12
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,240
Otherwise, every moment of the day

13
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,870
when you stay in the mansion,

14
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,590
you must serve as a maid.

15
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,080
Ji,

16
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,030
how about we let her kneel here

17
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,430
and deal with her after patrolling the city?

18
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,990
OK.

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,280
Do as you say.

20
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,240
Quickly send for the doctor.

21
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,560
Quickly send for the doctor.

22
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,360
Everyone, listen up.

23
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,630
- If anything happens to Ji,
- One, two, three.

24
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,520
I want all of you to be buried with him.

25
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,840
My Lady, shall we go back first?

26
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,520
You are weak and cannot see blood.

27
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,470
Shut up.

28
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,800
It's just blood phobia.

29
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,560
For Ji,

30
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,590
I can endure anything.

31
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,190
My Lady! My Lady!

32
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,310
My Lady, wake up!

33
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,360
Wake up.

34
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,390
Doctor! Doctor!

35
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,240
Send for the doctor! Quick!

36
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,150
Commander Xue.

37
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,160
What did you say? He's dead?

38
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,150
That's right.

39
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,870
At the back molar position of that assassin,

40
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,190
there is a wax-sealed poison pill.

41
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,720
After being captured,

42
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,920
he immediately bit the pill
and committed suicide.

43
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,710
I have only seen this technique

44
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,920
on the warriors

45
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,830
trained by noble families.

46
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,600
Block messages completely.

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,160
Keep an eye on the assassin's body.

48
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,430
After City Lord wakes up,

49
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,390
it's up to him to decide.

50
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,350
Yes, sir.

51
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,960
Doctor, how is City Lord doing?

52
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,310
His life is temporarily saved.

53
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,190
But tonight is a critical period.

54
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,950
And it is cold now.

55
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,190
Someone needs to take care of him all the time.

56
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,630
Thank you for your hard work.

57
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,800
- Please.
- It's my pleasure.

58
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,400
Miss Xie,

59
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,070
City Lord was shot and lost a lot of blood.

60
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,430
triggering an old illness of extreme cold.

61
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,310
Whether he can survive, it depends on tonight.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,070
While assassins are still lurking in the dark.

63
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,360
In the entire residence,

64
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,480
the only person I can trust

65
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,160
is you.

66
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,350
Miss Xie,

67
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,800
would you be willing

68
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,430
to take care of City Lord?

69
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,190
Aren't you afraid I will kill him and escape?

70
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,670
Miss Xie,

71
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,120
you can give it a try.

72
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,390
It's been three years.

73
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,120
Don't you understand yet?

74
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,600
Being a maid in the mansion

75
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,800
is better

76
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,720
than losing chance of survival outside.

77
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,240
In the city, you can only

78
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,120
trust City Lord, don't you?

79
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,360
I have asked those guards

80
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,800
to leave.

81
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,480
To save him or not,

82
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,270
it's your choice.

83
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,310
I will keep my mouth shut.

84
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,070
Add more charcoal.

85
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,350
It's cold.

86
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,760
So cold.

87
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,750
City Lord was shot and lost a lot of blood,

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,950

89
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,070

91
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,560

143
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,240

00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,040
He's awake now.

162
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,390
Mr. Qi...

163
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,820
(Qianyuan Pavilion)

164
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,710
I checked it out.

165
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,680
It was done by the Dou family.

166
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,200
What are you going to do?

167
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,440
Why did the Dou family suddenly go crazy?

168
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,120
Aren't they always known for being aloof

169
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,520
and not getting involved in any struggles?

170
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,360
I don't know

171
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,670
why the new master, Dou Feiyang,

172
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,550
regard you as a great enemy.

173
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,600
Let the Dou family get out of this city.

174
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,720
They can never enter here again.

175
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,000
Miss Xie is a guilty person.

176
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,720
Even if she requires your protection,

177
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,630
the enemies are becoming more arrogant.

178
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,750
Yin Ji,

179
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,480
are you sure you can still protect her well?

180
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,360
It's none of your business.

181
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,270
She is also an old friend of mine.

182
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,080
I don't want

183
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,360
to see her get hurt.

184
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,150
As long as she stays by my side,

185
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,390
I can protect her well.

186
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,360
My Lord, Miss Xie has arrived.

187
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,080
Let her in.

188
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,280
Yes, My Lord.

189
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,480
Miss Xie, please.

190
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,920
Mr. Qi.

191
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,150
You should leave.

192
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,320
When I need someone to take care of me,

193
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,750
where are you?

194
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,270
My Lord, you have your wife
to take care of you.

195
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,550
Yesterday you made me kneel,

196
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,480
so I knelt the whole time.

197
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,790
Why don't you tell the truth?

198
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,840
Every word of mine is true.

199
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,000
As my maid, why are you not here?

200
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,630
Ji,

201
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,750
be careful of your wound.

202
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,990
Xie Yun,

203
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,790
how dare you make Ji angry?

204
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,390
Baobao,

205
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,590
bring me the wine.

206
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,150
This is the first wine I have brewed.

207
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,270
Ji, please don't look down on it.

208
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,110
Pour the wine.

209
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,230
Yes, My Lord.

210
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,480
Pour another cup. You drink it.

211
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,750
Ji,

212
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,720
this is our wine.

213
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,390
Why should she drink it?

214
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,960
Today I narrowly escaped death.

215
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,270
We should reward those servants.

216
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,750
She should taste your wine.

217
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,800
Pour.

218
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,960
