00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,790
What time is it now?

5
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,040
My Lord, it's about 9 o'clock.

6
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,710
My Lord, aren't you going to bed?

7
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,710
How about me asking Miss Xie to come over?

8
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,950
If she wanted to come,
she would have come earlier.

9
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,430
Forget it. I'll go to sleep.

10
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,760
Yes, My Lord.

(Qianyuan Pavilion)

00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,350
(It's been so many days since she last came.)

13
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,960
(She's not coming to warm the bed.)

14
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,360
(I didn't say I couldn't go.)

15
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,910
If you want to leave here,

16
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,240
you must get my permission.

17
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,240
Otherwise, every moment of the day

18
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,560
when you're in the mansion,

19
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,280
you will be a maid.

20
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,400
Leave here.

21
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,080
Otherwise, don't blame me for shooting you.

22
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,710
Trust me.

23
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,590
All this is not my intention.

24
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,120
Then what is your intention?

25
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
I just want to protect you well.

26
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,120
Be careful!

27
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,520
Yun,

28
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,190
don't leave me, OK?

29
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,560
Let me be your husband.

30
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,920
OK?

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,910
Xie Yun,

32
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,190
isn't this what you wanted?

33
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,310
Just one step away.

35
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,360
You didn't see anything.

36
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,000
Understand? Get to work.

37
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,840
Yes.

(Memorial Tablet of Yin Gong,
Memorial Tablet of Yin Xingcheng)

39
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,870
City Lord has arrived.

40
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,960
Come in.

41
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,360
You have just recovered from illness.

42
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,430
Why are you so restless
and run around everywhere?

43
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,480
You don't take care of yourself at all.

44
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,270
It's not a bother

45
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,600
to greet you.

46
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,430
Although I haven't been with you for long,

47
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,160
I also know a bit about your temperament.

48
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,560
Go ahead.

49
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,750
You came to me so early in the morning.

50
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,040
Is there something you need my help with?

51
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,440
Ms. Xun,

52
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,310
I want to marry Xie Yun.

53
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,480
We don't have elders by our side,

54
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,630
so I would like to ask for your help
in handling the ceremony.

55
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,680
Have you ever thought her identity

56
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,070
of being the daughter of the traitor

57
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,190
and also the fianceé of Yin Qi?

58
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,120
If she takes on the position of Madam,

59
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,480
it not only goes against ethics,

60
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,480
also causes further turbulence.

61
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,600
Xie Yun risked her life
to seek medicine for me.

62
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,600
She has long been the only one
I want to marry.

63
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,000
Please fulfill my desire.

64
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,560
Since you have made up your mind,

65
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,870
I can't break you up,

66
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,680
Xie Yun once saved my life.

67
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,160
I naturally acknowledge her.

68
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,560
Let's do it this way.

69
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,120
I, in the name of her saving my life,

70
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,240
acknowledge Xie Yun as my adopted daughter.

71
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,480
It's good to make those opponents shut up.

72
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,480
Thank you for this.

73
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,270
I will leave for now.

74
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,600
OK, go ahead.

75
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,030
Son,

76
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,750
just wait a little longer.

77
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,960
I will take back everything

78
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,030
that belongs to our family very soon.

79
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,920
Sir.

80
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,200
How is the situation going?

81
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,790
Ms. Xun plans

82
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,080
to use the ceremony to help you
attack the city

83
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,630
and replace the guards around the tower

84
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,080
by Fu Zirong's men.

85
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,670
I heard that when Yin Ji was critically ill,

86
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,870
the Dou family offered medicine.

87
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,390
Master Dou used life-saving medicine

88
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,200
for one night with Xie Yun.

89
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,910
It's a transaction.

90
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,120
No need to be afraid of the Dou family.

91
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,480
As long as they can offer chips,

92
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,240
the Dou family can become a help
to Yin Ji at any time.

93
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,440
We must be beware of the Dou family.

94
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,790
I will arrange manpower

95
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,790
to block the way for Yin Ji to seek help.

96
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,720
You should also pay attention
to Yin Ji's movements at all times

97
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,510
and give me a signal in time.

98
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,710
Yes, sir.

99
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,590
Sir,

100
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,910
we have finished talking about business.

101
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,390
Should we talk about personal matters?

102
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,440
You don't have the smell
of Yin Ji on you, do you?

103
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,320
You know

104
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,440
I hate the smell
of lower-class people the most.

105
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,840
Sir, you are wise.

106
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,870
Yin Ji is in love with Xie Yun.

107
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,480
Between me and Yin Ji,

108
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
there has been no intimate relationship.

109
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,120
Very good.

110
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,990
Remember.

111
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,870
I only like you to belong to me.

112
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,390
It doesn't matter.

113
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,680
Cai Tianxi.

114
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,160
Here.

115
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,670
Read and archive it
to the Scripture Repository.

116
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,680
Yes, My Lord.

117
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,630
Come here.

118
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,110
Stay with me for a while.

119
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,510
By the way,

120
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,550
I plan to invite my parents and brother

121
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,870
to attend our wedding.

122
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,720
Let's write a letter to them later, OK?

123
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,470
OK.

124
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,840
We must find Xie Han within half a month,

125
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,510
no matter he is alive or dead.

126
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,800
Yes, sir.

127
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,910
(Notice)
Yin Ji, City Lord of the Baiyu City,

128
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,390
is announcing to the world

129
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,240
that the Xun family's adopted daughter Xie Yun

130
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,480
has noble character and virtuous heart.

131
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,000
I want to marry Xie Yun as Madam.

132
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,120
The ceremony will be held one month later.

133
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,390
Come on.

134
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,120
She is the daughter of a traitor.

135
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,630
How could she marry City Lord?

136
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,240
Ridiculous!

137
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,840
Exactly.

138
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,960
Yes, how could he make such a decision?

139
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,840
Exactly.

140
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,790
Last time I heard Hongyu say
she wanted to buy some jewelry.

141
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,120
But we always work.

142
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,750
It's not convenient
to wear accessories on hands.

143
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,870
Having more beads and sachets
would be nice though.

144
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,080
This suits you very well.

145
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,750
You don't have to, miss.

146
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,480
Besides those I bought for the servants,

147
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,960
this is specially for you.

148
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,600
When you get married in the future,

149
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,910
I will give you more.

150
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,750
Miss, what are you saying?

151
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,000
Why are you being shy?

152
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,080
Do you have a crush on someone?

153
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,910
Tell me who it is. I'll help you matchmake.

154
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,840
Miss, I won't talk to you anymore.

155
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
I'll go take a look over there.
