00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,380
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,880
Stop pretending. Climb up.

4
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,230
Help!

5
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,480
Help!

6
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,190
Help!

7
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:21,790
You are awake.

8
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,590
I was really scared just now.

9
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,350
You know I'm most afraid of water ghosts.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,840
It's good...

11
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,920
It's good to have you here.

12
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,430
All right. All right.

13
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,680
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
I didn't take good care of you.

15
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,240
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,900
I...

17
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,560
I really didn't know

18
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,640
why I lost my memory.

19
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,230
What has happened in these four years?

20
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,710
Have we

21
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,470
already separated?

22
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,750
No.

23
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,960
We haven't separated.

24
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,150
We are doing well.

25
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,190
We have been very happy these four years.

26
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,150
But a lot of things happened.

27
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,800
I don't know how to explain it to you.

28
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,190
Then just make it short.

29
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,360
It all started with my identity.

30
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,430
Actually, my surname is not Xiao.

31
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,870
My last name is Yin.

32
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,030
I am the illegitimate child

33
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,630
of former lord and a woman
from the Xiao family.

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,000
Four years ago,

35
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,120
I returned to my roots.

36
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,280
So you mean

37
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,030
my family voluntarily requested
to be stationed at the border

38
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,910
to help you secure the position.

39
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,270
That's right.

40
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,470
There are vast grasslands

41
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,150
and boundless starry sky there.

42
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,470
Bro Xie really liked that place.

43
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,310
He has been writing to you to show off.

44
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,470
Don't you remember?

45
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,710
I don't remember.

46
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,710
It's fine.

47
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,800
I'm helping you

48
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,120
recall these things slowly.

49
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,590
It's not right.

50
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,470
You and I are not yet married.

51
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,000
How could my father and brother allow me

52
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,680
to live in your mansion?

53
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,630
This is inappropriate.

54
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,000
You are a female official of my mansion,

55
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,520
responsible for the celebrations and ceremonies
of the mansion.

56
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,470
Your family is very supportive of you

57
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,240
doing what you love.

58
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,360
I have come this far today,

59
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,470
thanks to your great help.

60
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,360
Wait a moment.

61
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,390
Last time I woke up,

62
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,160
why did you treat me so badly?

63
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,870
It's all because you didn't listen to me

64
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,750
and got injured while riding a horse secretly.

65
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,000
Do you know how worried I was?

66
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,000
Is that so?

67
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,560
I'm sorry about that.

68
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,510
It's my fault.

69
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,750
I won't do this again in the future.

70
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,830
Madam is coming.

71
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,630
- Ji.
- Madam?

72
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,520
Ji!

73
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,120
You have a wife now?

74
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,790
Ji.

75
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,910
My Lady!

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
- My Lady!
- Xie Yun,

77
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,870
you bad woman! Let go of him quickly.

78
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,070
What are you doing?

79
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,080
My Lady!

80
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,870
- My Lady.
- Let go of me.

81
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,960
Xie Yun,

82
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,880
you have already left.

83
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,920
Why do you come back?

84
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,870
I am his wife.

85
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,600
You stole my man,

86
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,270
my bed.

87
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,000
Shame on you!

88
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,110
Shut up!

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,840
You shut up!

90
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,870
Is this what you said,

91
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,720
we've been happy these four years?

92
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,910
Yin Ji,

93
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,630
why did you betray me?

94
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,560
Xie Yun, are you out of your mind?

95
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,400
Get lost.

96
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,630
My Lady, let's go.

97
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,750
- Don't stop me.
- My Lady.

98
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,310
- I can go by myself.
- Let's go.

99
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,350
Let me go.

100
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,790
Xie Yun.

101
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,560
Answer me.

102
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,830
This is just a transaction.

103
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,750
We have no feelings.

104
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,950
So,

105
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,160
you clearly brewed Lanling wine.

106
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,630
But we cannot get married.

107
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,430
You clearly know that Xiao Baobao likes you,

108
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,600
yet you still use her to benefit yourself.

109
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,230
Yin Ji,

110
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,070
you are an arrant liar.

111
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,560
- Xie Yun...
- You go.

112
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,680
I don't want to see you again.

113
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,040
Get out. Get out.

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Xie Yun, listen to my explaination.

115
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,630
After I inherited the position of City Lord,

116
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,360
the Xiao family used the favor of raising me

117
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,600
and saving me to control me.

118
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,100
They asked me to agree to a marriage alliance.

119
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,870
I resisted and refused at first,

120
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,750
but the result was

121
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,310
the uprising of the Xiao family.

122
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,800
Baiyu City plunged into chaos.

123
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,430
Xie Yun, do you know?

124
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,600
When a marriage becomes a transaction

125
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,390
and one party

126
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,390
controls the lives
of half the people in Baiyu City,

127
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,800
I have no right to choose.

128
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,040
And I have never slept with Xiao Baobao.

129
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,120
Besides her,

130
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,270
who else?

131
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,120
There is also another woman.

132
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,520
She's called Wang Xinu.

133
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,480
Is it also a transaction with her?

134
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,120
Wang Xinu is just my execuse
to refuse Xiao Baobao.

135
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,510
I want to live somewhere else.

136
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,240
You arrange a place for me.

137
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,160
You still don't trust me.

138
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,160
This place,

139
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
I find it dirty.

140
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,080
OK.

141
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,510
I'll have someone send you back.

142
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,620
(Hanmo Pavilion)

143
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,390
Take good care of your lady.

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,830
What should be said
and what should not be said,

145
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,160
I think you should be very clear.

146
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,630
You probably don't want your lady

147
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,430
to commit suicide.

148
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,230
Yes, My Lord.

149
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,160
(Xie Yun)
Stab your head to make you stupid.

150
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,510
Stab your soles to make you suffer.

151
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,830
I stab, stab, stab.

152
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,070
My Lady! My Lady!

153
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,430
My Lady, something happened at home.

154
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,450
18 followers and relatives
of the Xiao family were executed

155
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,920
for spreading rumors about Xie Yun before.

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,840
What?

157
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,630
Ji actually killed people from my family

158
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,870
for Xie Yun.

159
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,750
There is another bad news.

160
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,920
Another bad news?

161
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,440
City Lord issued a gag order,

162
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,390
requesting everyone in the mansion
to cooperate in acting

163
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,600
for fear that Xie Yun may remember
what happened before.

164
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,310
If there is a mistake,

165
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,680
related persons will be beaten to death.

166
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,120
Xie Yun...

167
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,720
But you don't need to worry too much.

168
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,190
As long as Xie Yun's injury is healed,

169
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,430
her memory will definitely recover.

170
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,040
Then everything will be back to normal.

171
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,390
We can wait a little longer.

172
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,270
But what if she never gets better

173
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,840
and her memory never recovers?

174
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,230
Well...

175
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,630
It seems

176
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,030
I have to personally take action.

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,840
Xie Yun!

178
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,320
Didn't you say you want to go?

179
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,670
Why did you come back?

180
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,630
I don't know what you are talking about.

181
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,750
OK.

182
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,510
Then let me remind you.

183
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,270
Your family rebelled
and the whole family was exiled.

184
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,840
You're a traitor's daughter.

185
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,870
In this mansion,

186
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,430
you are just a maid thrown into the brothel

187
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,910
by Ji at will.

188
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,870
What? Do you remember?

189
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,200
What nonsense are you talking about?

190
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,240
My family was just reassigned
to the border.

191
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,320
I have read all the letters
my brother wrote to me.

192
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,320
Don't try to deceive me.

193
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,200
Fine.

194
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,320
Open your eyes and take a good look.

195
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,350
These

196
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,510
are letters written by Ji
imitating your brother's handwriting

197
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,480
to you.

198
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,750
How do you think?

199
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,510
Don't you remember any of this?

200
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,500
(Xie Han)

201
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,110
Impossible!

202
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,630
Impossible!

203
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,510
This is impossible.

204
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,790
Do you remember?

205
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,750
I do.

206
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,390
How could I not remember?

207
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,240
(Under the command of City Lord,)

208
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,350
(the wedding day)

209
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,510
(is the best time
to break Yin Qi's tendons and bones.)

210
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,120
(After Yin Qi is captured,)

211
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,630
(City Lord will clear your name. No worries.)

212
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,510
This...

213
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,550
This is the secret letter
that Master Xiao passed to my father.

214
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,080
So...

215
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,270
I beg you to marry Yin Qi.

216
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,630
So, my father

217
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,030
is the undercover agent sent to Yin Qi.

218
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,840
Why did Xiao Lingfeng refuse to save him?

219
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,550
My family

220
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,360
is innocent.

221
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,630
My father did not rebel.

222
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,390
The person who should die

223
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,720
is not me.

224
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,360
So I want to thank you

225
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,550
to let me see you clearly.

226
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,480
In that case,

227
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,910
why should I leave?

228
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,910
Don't you value the position of Madam?

229
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,110
What a coincidence.

230
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm also a little interested in it now.

231
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,320
I want all of you

232
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,360
to accompany the Xie family to the grave

233
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,320
step by step.

234
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,390
You are indeed pretending.

235
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm going to tell Ji.

236
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,680
You...

237
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,710
Move aside.

238
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,560
Are you OK?

239
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,990
Get up.

240
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,360
Ji, she's just pretending.

241
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,480
She's lying to you.

242
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,630
It's all my fault.

243
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,360
You two are the real couple.

244
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,360
I crossed the line.

245
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,840
Why are you pretending to be innocent?

246
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,670
You just said you want to replace me.

247
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,360
- She also said she hates you, Ji.
- That's enough.

248
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,550
All of you, get out of here!

249
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm not leaving. She's lying to you.

250
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,670
Don't make me say it again.

251
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,150
Whatever.

252
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,390
Xie Yun.

253
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,470
Xie Yun.

254
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,270
Did you really say you hate me?

255
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,840
Why don't I hate you?

256
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,150
You clearly have a legitimate wife.

257
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,480
But you still keep saying

258
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,240
that you deeply love me.

259
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,270
Why do you treat me like this?

260
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,200
Yin Ji,

261
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,200
I can't afford a relationship full of lies.

262
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,480
I don't want it either.

263
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,080
I...

264
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,990
Xie Yun.

265
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,990
Xie Yun.

266
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,750
You hit the target.

267
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,870
Thank you.

268
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,320
Well done.

269
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,710
Give it to me.

270
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,870
- Yun.
- So cute.

271
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,800
Which one do you want?

272
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,120
I'll shoot them all for you.

273
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,720
Then shoot yourself.

274
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,680
Leave here.

275
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,600
Otherwise, don't blame me for shooting you.

276
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,230
I'm not leaving.

277
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,360
If you come any closer,
I'll really shoot you.

278
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,030
Why don't you kill me?

279
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,840
You have a soft heart.

280
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,120
There is no such thing.

281
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,790
You stand back again.

282
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,280
Believe me.

283
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,440
All this is not my intention.

284
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,120
What is your intention?

285
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,270
I just want to protect you well.

286
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,480
I will always be sincere to you.

287
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,280
Believe me.

288
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,710
Xie Yun,

289
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,550
what a clever tactic.

290
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,910
How dare you offend the Xiao family?

291
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,720
I'm afraid you don't have the ability
to laugh till the end.
