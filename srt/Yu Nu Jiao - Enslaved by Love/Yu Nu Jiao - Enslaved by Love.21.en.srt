00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,380
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,960
My Lord.

4
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,950
My Lord, look at this.

5
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,120
The true love knot Madam gave you.

6
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,280
I bring it back.

7
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,400
My Lord,

8
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,280
Madam doesn't want

9
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,950
to see you like this.

10
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,400
She wants you to live well.

11
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,580
(Enjoy it together)

12
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,750
My New Year gift for you.
Hang it up when you're back.

13
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,910
I want to survive.

14
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,240
- I want to survive.
- Good.

15
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,580
Here. Take it.

16
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,470
My Lord, eat slowly.

17
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,750
Master, this is a letter from Yin Qi.

18
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,560
If the Dou family's army retreats,

19
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,520
all can be forgiven and forgotten.

20
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,400
He is trying to mend the relationship.

21
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,870
Seemingly mild,

22
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,520
but actually a threat.

23
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,360
Now my army is at a stalemate

24
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,000
with the Yin Qi's rebel army.

25
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,280
Yet Yin Ji's whereabouts are still unknown.

26
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,480
If our army insists on opposing the rebels,

27
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,600
I'm afraid the Dou family
will also be in danger.

28
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,640
Pass on the order.

29
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,190
Continue to search for Yin Ji.

30
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,120
Any clues must be reported.

31
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,230
Yes, Master.

32
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,160
Then we...

33
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,150
Withdraw.

34
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,960
Mr. Qi.

35
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,160
Have you found the whereabouts of City Lord?

36
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,800
All 18 beauties have already left to search,

37
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,270
yet not a single clue has been found.

38
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,270
Could it be that Yin Qi has...

39
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,790
Probably not.

40
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,040
If City Lord is now in the hands of Yin Qi,

41
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,600
then the Dou family will not retreat.

42
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,070
However, it seems that

43
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,390
the Dou family has no intention
of getting involved in this matter anymore.

44
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,630
We need to find City Lord faster than Yin Qi.

45
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,040
First, find all the members
of our undercover team.

46
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,110
Make them on standby at any time.

47
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,590
Yes, sir.

48
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,070
Han, you're back.

49
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,680
I brought you medicine.

50
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,480
Any news about him?

51
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,800
But it can be confirmed

52
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,160
that the power behind Yin Qi is the Xun family.

53
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,160
Wang Xinu is also their person.

54
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,600
Do you remember

55
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,190
that I once told you

56
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,920
on the day of rebellion,

57
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,390
I saw the jailer

58
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,450
who killed our father in prison?

59
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,000
Of course I remember.

60
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,190
His name is Fu Zirong.

61
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,600
Now he's the leader of the Yin Qi guards.

62
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,480
Where are you going, Commander Xue?

63
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,270
The one who killed our father

64
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,830
is not someone from Yin Ji.

65
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,680
So,

66
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,630
you want to cooperate with me?

67
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,910
That's right.

68
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,950
As long as we make good use of Xie Yun,

69
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,270
Yin Ji's fate will be in our hands.

70
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,950
Ms. Xun plans

71
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,240
to use the ceremony
to help you conquer the city.

72
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,710
I'm sorry.

73
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,720
Yin Ji...

74
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,000
You hold my head

75
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,560
to deceive Yin Qi

76
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,960
and survive.

77
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,680
To protect me,

78
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,900
Yin Ji turned against the Xiao family,

79
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,070
giving the Xun family an opportunity.

80
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,480
I originally thought our father's death
was related to Yin Ji.

81
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,270
It seems now

82
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,600
it was all done by Yin Qi and the Xun family.

83
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,870
It's all because I was blinded by hatred.

84
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,080
I misled you.

85
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,430
I'm going to look for him.

86
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,360
You have just managed to save your life.

87
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,270
What should you do if you are caught
when you go out now?

88
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,830
You saved me from the fire.

89
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,800
I am very grateful.

90
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,720
But I caused Yin Ji to lose everything.

91
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,630
I must find him.

92
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,870
In the vast sea of people,
where can you find him?

93
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,950
If I can't find him in a day,
I'll search for a month.

94
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,120
If I can't find him in a month,
I'll search for a year.

95
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,310
If I can't find him in a year,
I'll search for a lifetime.

96
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,750
I must find him.

97
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,240
I know I can't stop you.

98
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,400
Be careful.

99
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,360
Thank you.

100
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,070
There's one more thing I need your help with.

101
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,270
Go to the north
and ask the Dou family for help.

102
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,680
Feiyang?

103
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,480
He gave me this jade pendant back then.

104
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,360
Show it to him.

105
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,630
He will understand.

106
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,040
Cai Tianxi.

107
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,920
Cai Tianxi.

108
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,920
Cai Tianxi.

109
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,750
Here.

110
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,910
Are you not feeling well?

111
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,910
Thank you for your care, My Lord.

112
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,910
I'm fine.

113
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,160
My Lord,

114
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,150
it's not early now.

115
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,630
I'll go find some food.

116
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,680
Wait for me.

117
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,040
OK.

118
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,510
Be careful.

119
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,560
OK.

120
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,870
Search this area carefully.

121
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,870
The rebel Yin Ji may be hiding here.

122
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,920
No one can be missed.

123
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,960
Yes, sir.

124
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,240
(No! City Lord is still inside.)

125
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,150
Yin Qi, you rebel,

126
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,960
you deserve to die.

127
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,000
- Chase him.
- OK.

128
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,670
Don't run. Stop!

129
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,230
Move aside.

130
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,630
My Lord,

131
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I will go first.

132
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,440
I came to pay my respects to you.

133
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,840
It is getting cold recently.

134
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,720
Please take care of yourself.

135
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,870
It is so late now.

136
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,360
It's hard for you to have such filial piety.

137
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,120
The young City Lord passed away due to illness.

138
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,320
If it weren't for your secret support,

139
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,270
I wouldn't be in the position I am today.

140
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,080
Back then, you compromised
and stayed by City Lord's side.

141
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,550
That chronic poison couldn't kill that old guy,

142
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,750
so that Yin Ji, this illegitimate child,

143
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,320
seized power ahead of time.

144
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,720
My son is not blessed.

145
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,510
Not like you,

146
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,200
you are blessed by ancestors.

147
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,510
Everything I have is given by you.

148
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,750
If the young City Lord were still alive,

149
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,720
I would also follow him

150
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,910
and be loyal to him.

151
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,240
From now on, I will be your son.

152
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,240
I am willing to share the power
of governing the city with you.

153
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,800
Get up.

154
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,120
I am a woman.

155
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,750
How could I know these things?

156
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,390
Since you have this intention,

157
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,600
I will take it in my heart.

158
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,080
Nowadays

159
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,200
we are engaged in battle with reinforcements
from the Dou family in the north.

160
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,910
If the Dou family finds out
that Yin Ji's whereabouts are unknown,

161
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
they will definitely retreat.

162
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,120
I never expected that the Dou family
would join forces with Yin Ji.

163
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Luckily,

164
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,790
you made early arrangements

165
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,510
and intercepted the Dou family's troops.

166
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,920
However,

167
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,480
Yin Ji has not been found.

168
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,360
He is ultimately a troublemaker.

169
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,440
Don't let the Dou family and Yin Ji
join forces to counterattack.

170
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,750
That would be troublesome.

171
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,440
You are right.

172
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,250
I will definitely handle it cleanly

173
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,480
just in case.

174
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,080
Report.

175
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,350
Say.

176
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,910
Cai Tianxi refuses to confess anything.

177
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,320
He can't hold on and died.

178
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,360
That old thing!

179
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,750
Burn him.

180
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,110
Yes, My Lord.

181
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,910
Have you found the escape route?

182
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,320
We have sent people to search.

183
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,750
- Hurry up.
- Yes, My Lord.
