Yes, sir.

6
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,590
- Search in the room.
- Yes, sir.

7
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,480
Follow me.

8
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,790
Search.

9
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,910
Is anyone here?

10
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,040
Not here.

11
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,120
- No.
- Go check over there.

12
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,070
OK.

13
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,040
Search carefully.

14
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,790
Over there.

15
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,710
Yes, sir.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,360
There's no one here either.

17
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,960
None.

18
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,920
Go.

19
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,400
Yun,

20
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,000
since you are unwilling to acknowledge me,

21
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,310
why expose your identity again to save me?

22
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,710
Are you stupid?

23
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,840
Why take all the responsibility yourself?

24
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,750
I...

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,240
I don't know how to face you.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,840
Silly girl.

27
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,800
It's all my fault.

28
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,710
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,240
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,400
It's all my fault.

31
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,310
I shouldn't have lied to you.

32
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,710
I shouldn't have kept it from you

33
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,080
to let you misunderstand me to this point.

34
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,590
I can't lose you.

35
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,920
Yun.

36
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,710
Yun.

37
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,890
I know...

38
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,800
I know I've done a lot of wrong things.

39
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,030
I didn't choose to believe you.

40
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,080
But for your family,

41
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,270
I...

42
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,870
I really have no ulterior motives.

43
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,680
I have always believed you.

44
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,080
Stop crying.

45
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,080
Don't cry, don't cry.

46
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,560
Clearly it's my fault.

47
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,430
Clearly I am stupid and unaware,

48
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,560
being manipulated by villains.

49
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,430
Why are you still apologizing to me?

50
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,560
Why?

51
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,800
I can't lose you.

52
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,190

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
I want to eat anything

77
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,080
you cook.

78
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,880
It's for you.

79
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,670
Smells so good.

80
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,640
What is this?

81
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,400
Sachet.

82
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,800
Even if my eyes never see again,

83
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,600
I can still rely on the scent of the sachet

84
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,440
to find you.

85
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,520

86
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,910
I...

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,560
I really can't lose you again.

88
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,840
Can we?

89
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,350
Darling,

90
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,440
please be gentle.

91
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,470
Yun,

92
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,840
you're alive.

93
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,360
Let me take a good look at you.

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,840

95
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,440
Yin Ji.

96
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,920
You are losing weight.

97
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,480
Thank you for taking care of me

98
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,800
during this time.

99
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,510
I'm sorry.

100
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,680
I shouldn't have...

101
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,030
Taking care of you is not difficult at all

102
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,840
when I'm with you.

103
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,870
I'll take care of you in the future.

104
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,440
Ma'am, how much is this vegetable?

105
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,200
If you buy more, I'll give you a discount.

106
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,590
Thank you.

107
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,910
- I'll take all of these.
- OK.

108
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,560
Take a look at those trinkets.

109
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,270
Take care, girl.

110
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,330
Sachets.

111
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,720
- Chase her.
- Yes, sir.

(Hanmo Pavilion)

113
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,270
You're getting bolder,

114
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,080
daring to tempt me.

115
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,960
So when are you planning to marry me?

116
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,080
Report!

117
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,560
My Lord,

118
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,360
Fu Zirong caught the traitor Xie Yun.

119
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,320
Good.

120
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,550
Bring her in.

121
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,800
Yes, My Lord.

122
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,870
You go back first.

123
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,670
My Lord...

124
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,710
Be good.

125
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,840
Do not make things difficult for me.

126
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,350
Yes, My Lord.

127
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,350
My Lord,

128
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,390
I did not disappoint your trust

129
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,720
and successfully captured the traitor Xie Yun.

130
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,870
Good.

131
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,480
Promote Fu Zirong
to the commander of the guards.

132
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,440
Thanks, My Lord.

133
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,360
- You can go now.
- Yes, My Lord.

134
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,910
You are even more fascinating

135
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,600
than three years ago.

136
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,030
You are even more disgusting
than three years ago.

137
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,440
With your current situation,

138
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,360
What qualifications do you have

139
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,870
to despise me?

140
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,470
Do you think

141
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,720
you're still the noble lady from the Xie family
three years ago?

142
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,870
Do you think you can rest easy

143
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,600
just because you have become
the lord of a city?

144
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,270
That is why you appear here

145
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,750
to solve my worries for me.

146
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,910
Are you trying to use me to lure out Yin Ji?

147
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,510
Stop dreaming.

148
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,440
During the ceremony,
I caused him to lose everything.

149
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,720
Now he hates me to the core.

150
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,790
He would never reveal his whereabouts
for my sake.

151
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,720
You are miscalculating.

152
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,390
Good.

153
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,550
Then let's make a bet.

154
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,630
Someone.

155
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,840
Dress her up nicely.

156
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,320
Don't let down the noble lady
from the Xie family.

157
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,320
