00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,470
Don't come over.

45
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,670
What does it mean?

46
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,920
You don't really think
I want to marry you, do you?

47
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,600
I carry the title of the traitor's daughter,

48
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,360
serving as a maid for three years.

49
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,000
How could I forget such humiliation?

50
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,800
So you didn't lose your memory.

51
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,150
Of course not.

52
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,070
If I didn't do this,

53
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,720
how could I possibly

54
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,650
(My Lord, please clear the name for our family)
obtain evidence that our family did not rebel?

55
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,720
My family helped you
ascend to the position of City Lord

56
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,160
and endured humiliation by Yin Qi's side.

57
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,040
But what about you?

58
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,310
These three years,

59
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,750
you deceived me,

60
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,310
played with me,

61
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,920
and gave me the so-called hope.

62
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,600
But it turns out that you killed my father.

63
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,040
I didn't kill your father.

64
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,120
I have been looking for your family.

65
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,800

Yun,

67
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,310
now is not the time to talk about this.

68
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,310
The rebel army of Yin Qi is outside.

69
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,720

00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,040
Yin Qi should have killed you.
