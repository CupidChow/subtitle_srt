=Enslaved by Love=

00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,380
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,680
Ji.

4
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,070
You...

5
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,120
What do you want to do to me?

6
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,840
I want you to belong to me forever.

7
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,760
Yun...

8
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,230
Take a good look.

9
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,790
I am Xiao Baobao.

10
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,270
Ji,

11
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,070
you're going to see that woman, aren't you?

12
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,070
I am right by your side.

13
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,790
Can't you just look at me?

14
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,820
(Hanmo Pavilion)

15
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,150
This wine pot is broken.

16
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,790
So changing the cups won't help.

17
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,070
But the aphrodisiac is very potent.

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,510
How did you manage to resist it?

19
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,870
Could it be...

20
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,280
Is the drug very strong?

21
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,640
I think it's just average.

22
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,430
Just bear with it.

23
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,190
Now only two of the four great families remain.

24
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,270
The Xie family declined.

25
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,850
The Xun family suffered great losses
in the battle to suppress the rebellion.

26
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,590
The Dou family has moved
to the northern border.

27
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,840
Only the Xiao family remains dominant.

28
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,800
The Xiao family has become more arrogant

29
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,140
because you were once fostered
by them.

30
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,590
Look at this.

31
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,000
(My Lord,)

32
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,680
(there is an interesting story
in Changle Town under my jurisdiction.)

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,280
(An old man has never seen snow in his life.)

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,240
(Suddenly, white flakes fell from the sky,)

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,310
(he felt it's auspicious
and refused to take shelter,)

36
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,630
(finally, he was frozen to death.)

37
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,960
(How stupid he is.)

38
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,520
Meng Qixia is a serious, old-fashioned man.

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,910
He won't treat such life-threatening anecdotes

40
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,870
as jokes.

41
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,680
He's using the anecdote

42
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,840
to tell us about the impending cold disaster.

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,910
I suppose Meng Qixia

44
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,960
must know the Xiao family will obstruct it.

45
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,520
That's why he thought of this plan.

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,960
The Xiao family has always been like this.

47
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,680
Greedy, rebellious, and unscrupulous.

48
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,260
(Xiao Ji, the adopted son of the Xiao family)

49
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,190
Yun gave it to me.

50
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,520
Why do you think you can take my things?

51
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,870
Why?

52
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,120
Because my father is the master
of the Xiao family.

53
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,520
Xiao Ji, you are an illegitimate child.

54
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,590
(The third son of the Xiao Family)
You eat and drink at my house.

55
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,150
You all rely on my family.

56
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,120
You!

57
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,680
It's like plugging pig nose with green onions.

58
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
What are you pretending to be?

59
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,960
After knowing my identity,

60
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,240
the Xiao family changed their attitude

61
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,310
to help me ascend to the position of City Lord.

62
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,520
They asked me to marry Baobao

63
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,520
in exchange for their support.

64
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,590
But the Xiao family has always been wary

65
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,150
that I will settle the accounts with them.

66
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,710
So they want to balance against me

67
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,560
by making Baobao pregnant with my bloodline.

68
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,080
Since Xiao Baobao came,

69
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,680
this mansion is no longer safe

70
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,630
for Miss Xie.

71
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,630
Yin Ji, you might as well...

72
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,470
Enough.

73
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,150
Your pity

74
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,910
will only put her in greater danger.

75
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,680
I don't want to see

76
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,720
what happened last time again.

77
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,120
No matter what I do to her,

78
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,270
that's between us.

79
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,270
Qi Yan, do not cross the line.

80
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,630
Take care of yourself.

81
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,190
Report.

82
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,120
Today, rumors about Miss Xie

83
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,560
are spreading throughout the city.

84
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,950
Even...

85
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,760
Even what?

86
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,000
Even the storytellers in the city

87
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,510
spread Miss Xie's background

88
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,120
with exaggerations on every street and alley.

89
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,270
What did they all say?

90
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,520
They...

91
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,310
They said...

92
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,040
I'm asking you.

93
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,430
They said Miss Xie had been played many times

94
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,830
in the prison long ago

95
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,630
and is just a maid to warm beds.

96
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,490
They even said

97
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,720
she learnt to dance from prostitutes

98
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,160
to seduce Yin Qi

99
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,510
and please him.

100
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,430
Nonsense!

101
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,190
My Lord , calm down.

102
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,390
Xie Yun has had a leg injury since childhood.

103
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,270
It's impossible for her to learn dancing.

104
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,240
Who spread these rumors?

105
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,950
How long have they been spread?

106
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,270
They spread throughout Baiyu City overnight.

107
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,760
The rumors came from

108
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,120
the Xiao's Mansion.

109
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,600
Now that we know who did it,

110
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,270
just kill them.

111
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,160
But most of them

112
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,000
are servants and followers of the Xiao family.

113
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,270
Any problem?

114
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,400
Yes, My Lord.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,840
She...

116
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
Has she heard about this?

117
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,800
Miss Xie has always been
in the Qianyuan Pavilion.

118
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,190
She probably doesn't know.

119
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,520
Miss,

120
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,640
you're back.

121
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,560
I'll go prepare something for you to eat.

122
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,430
What happened to you?

123
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,950
Was it done by Xiao Baobao's people?

124
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,000
No.

125
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,000
I just tripped and fell.

126
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,040
Tell me the truth.

127
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,880
Tell me.

128
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,480
It is...

129
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,390
It's the maids under Chenguang.

130
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,270
Why did they hit you?

131
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,440
They said

132
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,430
you have unclear relationship with Yin Qi.

133
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,750
That's why you broke off the engagement
with City Lord.

134
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,360
I heard as I passed by,

135
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,480
so I got into a fight with them.

136
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,830
If you lose your innocence,

137
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,240
does that guy still want you?

138
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,080
Let me go.

139
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,080
Let go of me.

140
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,400
Xiao Ji...

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,840
Let me go.

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,920
Xiao Ji...

143
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,800
Xiao Ji, save me.

144
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,630
What else did they say?

145
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,360
They said...

146
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,270
They said you learnt to dance

147
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,680
to please Yin Qi.

148
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,270
They are right.

149
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,640
Miss...

150
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,310
So you believed them, don't you?

151
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,070
No, Miss.

152
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,360
I have always believed in you.

153
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,510
People only believe what they want to believe.

154
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,800
They said

155
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,950
I was willing to do it.

156
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,070
They said I didn't keep chastity.

157
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,000
No one is willing to believe me.

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,840
Miss...

159
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,680
No one is willing to believe me.

160
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,030
Xiuxiu,

161
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,560
luckily I have you.

162
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,000
Miss,

163
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,470
I...

164
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,000
I will go and argue with them.

165
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,030
No need.

166
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,430
They just want this outcome.

167
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,190
No one cares about the truth.

168
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,070
But City Lord...

169
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,800
Someone.

170
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,600
My Lord, here I am.

171
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,550
I want to take a bath.

172
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,240
Prepare hot water for me.

173
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,680
Yes, My Lord.

174
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,270
Have you gone to bed, Miss Xie?

175
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,510
Yes, I have, Mr. Cai.

176
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,510
Miss, please get up.

177
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,080
City Lord wants to take a bath.

178
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,440
He asked you to serve.

179
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,110
Coming.

180
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,870
Why not come over?

181
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,440
Yes, My Lord.

182
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,120
Wash here first.

183
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,240
My Lord, please behave yourself.

184
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,030
It's so ridiculous

185
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,200
for you to say this.

186
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,240
Isn't this your specialty?

187
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,630
You're correct.

188
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,960
My Lord, you're noble.

189
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,270
I'm afraid that a lowly servant like me,

190
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,000
will tarnish your eyes.

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,600
This scar was left by your fiancé, Yin Qi,

192
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,440
at the day of your wedding.

193
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,480
Aren't you deeply in love with him?

194
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,720
Do you also need

195
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,550
to help him repay his debt?

196
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,040
I repay.

197
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,510
Come on.

Let me see what tricks you have.

199

When you serve him,

200
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,720
you should be very open, right?

201
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,110
You flatter me.

202
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,800
Go ahead.

203
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,120
Please me.
