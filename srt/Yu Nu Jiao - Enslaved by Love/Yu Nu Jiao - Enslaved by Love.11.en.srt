=Enslaved by Love=

2
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,380
=Episode 11=

3
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,480
Miss, please stop.

4
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,680
It's not worth it.

5
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,630
What's wrong?

6
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,280
Mr. Xiao has been sent back
to the Xiao's residence.

7
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,430
It is clarified to the public

8
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,790
that Mr. Xiao visited Madam,

9
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,390
got drunk and stayed at City Lord's mansion

10
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,850
and he was not arrested for injuring someone.

11
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,000
You were stabbed for nothing.

12
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,710
Miss, why bother...

13
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,550
Xiuxiu,

14
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,150
misfortune may be a blessing in disguise.

15
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,150
At least Xiao Baobao is grounded now.

16
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,640
The conflict between Yin Ji and the Xiao family
has also intensified.

17
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,070
We did gain something after all.

18
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,600
Furthermore,

19
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,920
we need to wait for a right opportunity

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,590
to destroy the Xiao family completely.

21
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,040
Someone is here.

22
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,400
Go open the door.

23
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,080
Yun, I'm here to visit you.

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,030
Who is this young lady?

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,430
I know you don't remember me.

26
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,400
I am Wang Xinu.

27
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,560
You are Yin Ji's concubine.

28
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,400
You don't have to care about my identity.

29
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,240
I was originally a slave.

30
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,080
Thanks to City Lord 's grace,
I have been freed from slavery.

31
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,310
I do not seek favor.

32
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,630
I only hope to live comfortably in the mansion.

33
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,750
I know

34
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,000
you and City Lord love each other.

35
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,290
I will definitely fulfill your wishes.

36
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,430
Hope that we can get along well in the future.

37
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,960
If you say so,

38
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,150
we will naturally get along well.

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,680
Yun.

40
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,800
My Lord, please put it on.

41
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,800
Be careful not to catch a cold.

42
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,990
My Lord,

43
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,030
the New Year blessing ceremony
is always hosted by Madam.

44
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,870
But Madam has been grounded now.

45
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,630
Who do you think can host this ceremony?

46
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,030
What do you think?

47
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,470
I think Miss Xie is a right person.

48
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,630
Miss Xie has already recovered.

49
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,710
The blessing ceremony
is originally arranged by her.

50
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,360
I suppose hosting the event

51
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,520
should be very easy for her.

52
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,560
These days,

53
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,870
Miss Xie

54
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,280
may have understood you.

55
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,430
She looks much more relaxed.

56
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,400
Whenever she stands beside you,

57
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,590
I seem to see

58
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,470
the former Miss Xie and Mr. Xiao.

59
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,750
What a perfect match!

60
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
OK. You arrange it.

61
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,520
Yes, My Lord.

62
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,430
I heard that you want me to personally come
and get the key to the warehouse.

63
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,960
I'm here.

64
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,880
Xie Yun,

65
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,310
why do you have to be against me?

66
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,920
Before, you competed with me for the title
of the most noble lady,

67
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,950
for Ji's love.

68
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,000
Now you are competing with me
for the power of managing the mansion.

69
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,190
What's next?

70
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,390
Is it the position of Madam?

71
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Four years ago,

72
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,630
I traded my marriage

73
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,950
for my family's safety,

74
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,560
and my father's peace of mind.

75
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,360
Four years later,

76
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,430
I traded my freedom

77
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,390
for the safety of my family on the border.

78
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,720
Until you married into the mansion,

79
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,830
I was still using my dignity

80
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,270
to ensure that my whole family
can leave safely.

81
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,750
I have used all my strength

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,160
to obtain safety.

83
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,000
What about you?

84
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,190
Just like your father, you

85
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,590
played with me,

86
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,630
the Xie family in the palm of your hands.

87
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,560
You strive for things
that do not belong to you.

88
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,040
It's you

89
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,560
always treating me as your enemy.

90
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,950
- No...
- All you've ever wanted

91
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,390
is the thrill of plunder.

92
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,190
Why do you think my love is just a demand,

93
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,630
and your love is nobler than mine?

94
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,070
I

95
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,270
deserve the best in the world.

96
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,750
Yin Ji is the best.

97
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,000
He should be mine.

98
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,800
It's all about mutual affection.

99
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,270
He loves me,

100
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,630
not you.

101
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,190
My Lady, please don't be sad.

102
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,310
Endure it for a while.

103
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,950
Master will speak for you.

104
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,600
No,

105
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,310
he won't.

106
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,750
My brother suffered because of me.

107
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,040
He won't care about me anymore.

108
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,590
Greetings, Master.

109
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,720
I entrusted Baobao to you.

110
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,950
How did you protect her?

111
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,390
Please forgive me. It's all my fault.

112
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,000
I didn't take care of her properly

113
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,480
that she fell into Xie Yun's trap.

114
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,920
Master, give me another chance.

115
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,150
Get up.

116
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,390
Although Baobao is a bit spoiled,

117
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,560
she is simple and innocent.

118
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,150
And you

119
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,950
are the knife I prepared for Baobao.

120
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,720
Eliminate everything when necessary.

121
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,400
Chenguang,

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,360
you disappoint me this time.

123
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,880
Master, please forgive me.

124
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,040
I'll give you the last chance.

125
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,750
Otherwise,

126
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,870
your family will pay the price

127
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,160
for your uselessness.

128
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,520
Yes, Master.

129
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,190
My Lady, these flowers...

130
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,600
I had the servants place them over there.

131
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,270
OK.

132
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,120
Red silk can bring a festive touch
to the new year.

133
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,000
Great!

134
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,120
My Lady, see.

135
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,240
Touch it. It's all top quality.

136
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,790
Thank you.

137
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,180
(Right Scroll)

138
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,590
What's wrong?

139
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,350
Don't move.

140
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,960
There is ink on your face.

141
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,960
Have you wiped it off?

142
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,440
It's done.

143
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,800
This...

144
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,080
Please review it, My Lord.

145
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,630
These are the items for the ceremony.

146
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,630
Please take a look.

147
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,750
Let me take a look.

148
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,510
The arrangements are fine.

149
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,600
We just need to add a brazier ceremony.

150
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,960
In previous years, it was Ms. Xun
who completed the ritual

151
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,360
by throwing the old clothes into the brazier.

152
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,990
It symbolizes bidding farewell to the old
and welcoming the new.

153
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,630
I see.

154
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,870
I add this ceremony right now.

155
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,030
It's already past midnight.

156
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,390
Let's discuss tomorrow.

157
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,630
How can that be?

158
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,350
The rehearsal for the process
will be held tomorrow.

159
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,240
I must get it done.

160
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,670
I'm already tired.

161
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
It's so cold today.

162
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,920
You warm the bed for me.

163
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,150
Don't joke about this. I have to...

164
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,660
(Qianyuan Pavilion)

165
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,030
I am a concubine.

166
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,510
I actually have to help Xie Yun
count the goods here.

167
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,440
I expressed my loyalty to her.

168
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,870
She really treated me as a servant.

169
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,440
16 bolts of satin and silk.

170
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,440
20 strands of jade.

171
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,390
The ink that just arrived this morning.

172
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,240
They have been stored in the storeroom.

173
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,870
Where did you go today?

174
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,200
Where else can I go?

175
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,670
I only went to the storeroom until now.

176
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,680
Storeroom?

177
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,790
This is sulfur powder.

178
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,270
Since you manage the affairs in the mansion,

179
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,390
you have set more and more rules.

180
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,720
I don't know

181
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,030
why you called us all here today.

182
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,910
The New Year blessing ceremony

183
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,750
is a major event in the mansion every year.

184
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,550
The brazier ceremony tomorrow night
must not go wrong.

185
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,790
It needs to be rehearsed in advance.

186
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,120
Make sure not to hurt Ms. Xun.

187
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,870
Wait a moment.

188
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,480
This bamboo pole is for tomorrow's blessing.

189
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,870
If we burn it today,
how can we use it tomorrow?

190
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,480
I'll go get a new one.

191
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,390
This pole won't be used tomorrow.

192
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,790
It's OK if it is burnt black.

193
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,470
Well...

194
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,870
One, two, three, four, five.

195
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,120
Chenguang.

196
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,360
It is indeed her.

197
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm going to tell Xie Yun.

198
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,120
Are you saying

199
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,870
someone tampered with the brazier ceremony?

200
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,150
I dare not conceal it.

201
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,000
It was done by Chenguang,
the confidant of Madam.

202
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,960
- Get up.
- Thank you, Ms. Xun.

203
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,160
Tell me

204
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,120
about Chenguang's plan.

205
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,960
Chenguang has stuck this object

206
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,600
on the bamboo pole

207
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,960
used for the ceremony.

208
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,550
Once it encounters an open flame,
it will ignite,

209
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,910
burning the person who seeks blessings.

210
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,080
What is this?

211
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,750
Sulfur.

212
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,630
Chenguang is Xiao Baobao's confidant,

213
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,840
as well as the confidant of the Xiao family.

214
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,240
What is the intention behind targeting me?

215
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,960
Xiao Baobao is currently out of favor.

216
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,030
The Xiao family sees me as an enemy.

217
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,870
I am in charge of all the affairs
in the mansion.

218
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,870
If something happens to you

219
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,550
during the New Year blessing ceremony,

220
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,960
it must be me who will be held accountable.

221
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,870
You came in the middle of the night.

222
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,630
Do you want to save me

223
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,870
or want me to save you?

224
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,600
You are intelligent.

225
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,750
This move by the Xiao family
not only gets ride of me,

226
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,200
but will also harm the Xun family.

227
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,720
I want to save myself.

228
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,480
But I really want to protect you, too.

229
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,870
If I pretend to be sick,

230
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,670
it will be easier to avoid it.

231
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,390
But without you,

232
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,030
isn't it a waste of such a good opportunity

233
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,120
to deal with the Xiao family?

234
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,030
So you want to cooperate with me?

235
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,470
That's true.

236
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,390
What Xie Yun said makes sense.

237
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,550
As long as it doesn't harm you,

238
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,080
it is indeed

239
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,750
a good opportunity to harm the Xiao family.

240
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,240
What do you want to do?

241
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,440
It's OK as long as you are willing
to believe me.
