=Episode 12=

3
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,180
(Year after year)

4
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,740
(Enjoy it together)

5
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,580
(Early birth of a noble son)

6
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,220
(Peace and joy)

7
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,820
(Enjoy it together)

8
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,630
My gift for you.
Hang it after you go back.

9
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,800
New Year's fire burns high,

10
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,000
the morning sun shines far and forever.

11
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,190
Please welcome Ms. Xun
to hold the brazier ceremony.

12
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,640
Ms. Xun.

13
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,750
Yesterday, I accidentally sprained my hand.

14
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,080
I want to know if you can replace me

15
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,750
to complete this ceremony.

16
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,520
It's a great honor for me.

17
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,680
(Sulfur.)

18
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,360
Be careful.

19
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,990
My Lord!

20
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,190
- My Lord!
- Quick, someone!

21
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,270
Call the doctor.

22
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,950
Call the doctor quickly.

23
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,680
Miss, you're finally awake.

24
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,950
I thought your protective suit malfunctioned

25
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,680
and you would never wake up.

26
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,840
I'm fine.

27
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,160
Where is Yin Ji?

28
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,750
How is he doing?

29
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
City Lord...

30
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,870
Tell me quickly.

31
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,950
The brazier suddenly exploded at that time.

32
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,630
City Lord was the first

33
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,240
to stand in front of you.

34
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,520
The doctor said

35
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,720
he got injured badly.

36
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,110
He'll be fine.

37
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,680
He'll be fine.

38
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,120
How is Ms. Xun doing?

39
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,680
Ms. Xun is fine.

40
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,510
She just got a little scared.

41
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,270
Miss, please forgive me for being talkative.

42
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,270
City Lord treats you like this.

43
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,160
It shows he loves you very much.

44
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,680
Is there a misunderstanding

45
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,950
between you and City Lord?

46
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,480
Help me get a piece of clothing.

47
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,920
- OK.
- I'll go see him.

48
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,510
It is done.

49
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,560
Please.

50
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,320
Miss Xie,

51
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,510
why aren't you resting well?

52
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,310
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Cai.

53
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,240
I'm fine now.

54
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,600
City Lord...

55
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,870
City Lord suffered severe burns.

56
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,040
It may take some time for him to recover.

57
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,560
The doctor has already prescribed him

58
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,510
painkillers and sleeping medication.

59
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,390
He just fell asleep.

60
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,580
(Qianyuan Pavilion)

61
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,750
Yin Ji,

62
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,390
why are you so silly?

63
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,840
As long as you're OK.

64
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,600
I can't lose you again.

65
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,390
Report! The murderer has been found.

66
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,360
It's Chenguang, Madam's personal maid.

67
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,990
Bring her in.

68
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,960
You interrogate her in person.

69
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,230
Yes, My Lord.

70
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,870
Ji...

71
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,360
My Lady, please rest assured.

72
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,960
City Lord is fine.

73
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,910
No, I have to go see him myself.

74
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,800
My Lady,

75
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,390
I am acting on the orders of City Lord

76
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,960
to investigate the fireworks incident.

77
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,750
Please cooperate with us.

78
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,120
This was found in Chenguang's room.

79
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,050
There is still some sulfur powder
that has not been completely washed off

80
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
on the inside of the cuff
of the newly washed clothes.

81
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,250
And there is evidence from the servant.

82
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,200
The other day during patrol,

83
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,790
he saw her sneak out of the storeroom.

84
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,270
I went to check.

85
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,030
I don't know what powder it is.

86
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,080
I must have accidentally touched it.

87
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,800
Exactly.

88
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,150
Xie Yun ordered everyone in the mansion
to prepare New Year gifts.

89
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,750
Isn't it normal that Chenguang
accidentally touched some powder?

90
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,120
You bribed the old farmer
who sells bamboo poles

91
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,840
and gave him this pearl as a reward.

92
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,040
After that,

93
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,600
he took this pearl to the pawnshop to sell it.

94
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,910
But the things in the City Lord's Mansion

95
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,840
are not so easy to sell.

96
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,560
My Lady,

97
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,480
you instructed a servant to frame Xie Yun,

98
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,960
with the intention of harming Ms. Xun.

99
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,550
What crime do you think
you should be guilty of?

100
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,720
I don't know. This is impossible.

101
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,000
You are all talking nonsense.

102
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,790
You have been writing
so many secret letters to Master Xiao.

103
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,670
Still want to argue?

104
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,910
This has nothing to do with my master.

105
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,960
She is completely unaware.

106
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,750
It's all done by me alone.

107
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,270
My Lord, Chenguang has already confessed.

108
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,790
The Xiao family disregards the law

109
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,790
and plots against Ms. Xun,

110
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,870
intending to shift the blame to Xie Yun.

111
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,670
The Xiao family trafficks women
and seizes land.

112
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,790
Their crimes are unforgivable.

113
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,240
Depose Xiao Baobao from the position of Madam.

114
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,510
Expose their evil deeds to the world.

115
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,670
The whole family will be imprisoned,

116
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,790
awaiting punishment.

117
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,350
Yes, My Lord.

118
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,120
They deserve it.

119
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,720
(Notice)
How dare they plot against Ms. Xun?

120
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,840
No one can tolerate it.

121
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Yes, it's intolerable.

122
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,870
(Hanmo Pavilion)
Yes, the Xiao family falls into the net.

123
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,390
Xiao family's undercover agents
among the guards have been exposed.

124
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,720
Master Xiao has also been arrested.

125
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,550
Why are you staring at me?

126
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,600
The Xiao family has been dealt with.

127
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,550
Why do you look unhappy?

128
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,150
The Xiao family has a notorious reputation.

129
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,030
Now that they have been dealt with,
the people are all applauding.

130
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,710
However...

131
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,000
Just tell me directly.

132
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,390
Can you let Xiao Baobao go?

133
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,670
Don't detain her.

134
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,200
Just confine her to the mansion.

135
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,160
Don't you hate her?

136
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,870
She seems to be unaware

137
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,720
of what the Xiao family has done.

138
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,480
Xiao Baobao grew up with us since childhood.

139
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,750
Although she is a little wayward,

140
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,270
she is not a bad person in nature.

141
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,320
Just let her off the hook.

142
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,870
OK.

143
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,320
Thank you, Yin Ji.

144
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,000
Do you know this medicine is really bitter?

145
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,600
Good medicine tastes bitter.

146
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,240
You are not a kid anymore. Drink it.

147
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,680
No way.

148
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,440
Sweet now, huh?

149
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,870
Take another sip.

150
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,510
Just one sip.

151
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,200
OK.

152
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,350
You can leave.

153
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,470
Yes, Miss.

154
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,230
You're here.

155
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,390
Master Xiao, you're really sharp
and perceptive.

156
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,440
It feels like you are still that Uncle Xiao who likes
to make me happy when I was a child.

157
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,750
You are still the clever and smart lady
of the Xie family.

158
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,120
If Baobao had half of your intelligence,

159
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,030
she wouldn't have been deposed like this.

160
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,600
You should understand

161
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,120
the advantage of striking first.

162
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,440
With this boldness,

163
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,000
you deserve to be a daughter of the Xie family.

164
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,270
Even if you have fallen to this point,

165
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,080
you didn't bring shame to your father.

166
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,600
As long as I am still alive,

167
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,390
I will definitely find out

168
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,320
the real culprit of harming my family.

169
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,910
Master Xiao, do you still
remember this piece of cotton?

170
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,580
(Your plan can destroy Qi's tendons and bones.
I'm willing to testify.)
