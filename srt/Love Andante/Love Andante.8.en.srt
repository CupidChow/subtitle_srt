(This series was produced
with the support of MCST, KOCCA,)

2
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:10,000
(Gangwon-do Province,
and Goseong-gun County.)

3
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:16,766
Everyone will hear.

4
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:17,866
Please stop.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,333
What should I do?

6
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:53,300
No...

7
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,466
It's not what you think.

8
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,166
What's going on here?

9
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,833
Did Gyeong Ho hit her by mistake?

10
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:04,666
There's no way.

11
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:08,100
He's an excellent sniper with four degrees
in taekwondo and three in judo.

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,666
What does that mean?

13
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:13,200
It couldn't have been a mistake
with his exceptional vision.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,033
I see.

15
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:19,033
No. I would never.

16
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,933
This isn't good...

17
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:43,200
I can't believe this.

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,900
Thanks to you, I might be misunderstood.

19
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,300
See that? Everything is my fault.

20
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:05,233
All the gifts Tong Il received...

21
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:08,633
will be sent to kids in the North as well.

22
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:11,733
As a newborn,

23
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:14,433
Tong Il is already helping comrades
in our people's republic.

24
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:17,866
That's right.

25
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,100
What's going on?

26
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:28,366
Can't you tell?

27
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:29,800
What?

28
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,733
Ju Hui must have felt so much pressure
because of the video,

29
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:37,400
and she got emotional
when she saw Gyeong Ho.

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,400
(Love Andante Episode 8)

31
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,100
(Pyeongyang
Military Security Command office)

32
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,533
What does the party say?

33
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:12,033
They're deciding
whether the foreign reaction...

34
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:13,200
is beneficial or not.

35
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:17,933
Considering the growth
and economic profit,

36
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:21,466
isn't it worth attempting
a partial revelation?

37
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,466
You have a point, but...

38
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,466
shouldn't we consider the side effects?

39
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:44,433
This is Great Assistant Ha speaking.

40
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,533
Comrade.

41
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:46,833
Chief Commander.

42
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,666
I received your report.

43
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,766
The supreme leader said...

44
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,466
Yes.

45
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,400
Are you done crying?

46
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,533
Nothing has been decided.

47
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:07,700
Don't worry about it yet and let's wait.

48
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,733
If I get kicked out tomorrow...

49
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,866
Hey, don't be rash now.

50
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:20,500
Everything has a procedure.

51
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,633
Do you have to be so extreme?

52
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,700
Let's wait.

53
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:32,400
You've been bubbly and cheerful,

54
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
so I thought you would shrug this off.

55
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,466
I see you're actually very scared.

56
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:50,300
Why are you laughing?

57
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,466
(Pyeongyang
Na Gyeong's home)

58
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:29,533
Eat this.

59
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:31,833
Let's both eat.

60
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,100
Is Na Gyeong doing well?

61
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,333
She's fine.

62
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,133
I'm glad she is.

63
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,266
Eat up.

64
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:55,700
Are you done already?

65
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,800
You barely ate.

66
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,266
I have to leave
since I have to be at the politburo.

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,733
(Pyeongyang
The office of the politburo chief)

68
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:09,100
Our people's republic stands firm.

69
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:12,866
Yes, sir.

70
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:17,166
To handle the matter with grace,

71
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,933
let's show leniency.

72
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes, sir.

73
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:25,500
We'll treat it as if it never happened.

74
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:28,800
Great Assistant Ha,

75
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,066
I heard your daughter is making
huge research progress.

76
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:35,700
You're too generous.

77
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,733
Just know that the party is taking notice.

78
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,400
Yes, sir. Thank you.

79
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,366
You may leave.

80
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:46,133
Yes, sir.

83

both nations agreed to keep the village.)

84
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,933
Hey!

(Accepting South Korea's request,)

86

(North Korea agrees to keep the village
until the official termination.)

87
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:24,533
Hey!

- Jun Mo!
- Jang Su!

Jun Mo!

90
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:36,433
What's gotten into them?

91
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:39,466
Did they eat something strange
for breakfast?

92
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,800
It's done!

93
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,233
What is?

94
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:51,400
The people's interest will keep
Peace Village alive!

95
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,300
The party will let this slide!

96
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,566
That's great!

97
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,333
Villagers, we have an announcement.

98
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,066
The South and North agreed...

99
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:16,800
to recognize the video incident
as a mistake.

100
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,400
They ask us to prevent similar incidents
from happening again...

101
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,100
by being extra careful.

102
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,166
Mister!

103
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,100
Did you hear the announcement?

104
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,133
They will overlook it as a mistake.

105
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:40,733
You were right.

106
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:44,466
Comrade Ju Hui, let's be careful
not to make a mistake again.

107
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,466
Okay.

108
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,166
I told you.

109
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,300
I'm going in first.

110
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,166
Okay.

111
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,033
You have to be careful.

112
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:05,500
Mister, let's have breakfast.

113
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,133
What?

114
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:10,000
Why would I eat breakfast with you?

115
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,733
Let's just eat.

116
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,800
What's that?

117
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,433
This is an egg sandwich...

118
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:32,166
and fragrant coffee that I made myself.

119
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,866
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

120
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:48,600
I'm running late.

121
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,833
I'll see you at night.

122
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,933
As soon as the newborn
came into the world...

123
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:05,400
He looks like me.

124
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,400
The baby became a celebrity
that every villager knew.

125
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,166
- Hello.
- Hi, Ju Hui.

126
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,933
- Wave at me.
- You can stop that.

127
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:19,100
First, I can fry eggs.

128
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,500
I'm a good cook.

129
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:23,766
- You can cook?
- I can cook.

130
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:25,133
What are you good at cooking?

131
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,800
People from the North and South...

132
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,900
returned to their buzzing daily lives.

133
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:45,833
(One month later)

134
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,033
Hey, Jang Su.

135
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:51,300
It doesn't look ripe yet, right?

136
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,833
I don't see the red color yet.

137
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,533
Should we leave it?

138
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,633
Let's wait a few days.

139
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:01,400
- Should we?
- Yes.

140
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,233
- Okay, let's do that.
- Okay.

141
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:05,233
Let's go.

142
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,000
Hold on!

143
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,466
My back hurts.

144
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:15,100
You should exercise regularly.

145
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,066
You just stood up for a moment
and you're holding your back.

146
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:20,433
You try getting old. You'll see why.

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,600
- My gosh.
- Let's go.

148
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,866
Help me here.

149
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:26,866
Here comes a young man who can help.

150
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,066
- This is tiring.
- Come on now.

151
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:30,266
- Grab me properly. Use your strength.
- Stand up straight.

152
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,300
Villagers came together
to get ready for the new year.

153
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,166
As the produce was neatly stacked,

154
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,233
the villagers felt generous as well.

155
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:43,100
- It'll sting.
- Okay.

156
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:51,566
Dr. Gu, it's ready.

157
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,566
- You can inject the anesthetics.
- Okay.

158
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:00,233
Everyone was in their setting...

159
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,366
It'll sting.

160
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:03,000
Everyone was doing their jobs.

161
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:14,766
Every moment was literally peaceful.

162
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:20,233
We appreciated the momentary joy
of being together.

163
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,966
You can't dodge that?

164
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:30,533
How can I dodge this?

165
00:13:23,766 --> 00:13:25,633
- Be careful.
- What's going on?

166
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:27,433
Walk slowly.

167
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:30,133
(Village shelter)

168
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:32,100
Walk slowly.

169
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:35,966
Seon In Ho, Yang Chang Ju.

170
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:36,900
Get in first.

171
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,133
- Choi Dae Woong.
- What's going on?

172
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,466
Get in first and we'll let you know.

173
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:02,566
We're currently figuring out
the situation.

174
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:05,933
Let's wait until our safety is secured.

175
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:09,033
Jun Mo, I don't see Mr. Piano
and Comrade Na Gyeong.

176
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,700
What?

177
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:16,933
Where did they go?

178
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,700
Warm tea is the best
when your body is freezing.

179
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:14,866
The wind is harsh and cold
during the winter in Gangwon-do.

180
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,366
It's okay.

181
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,400
Try it.

182
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,433
I heard a cannon fire just now.

183
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:39,500
It's very quiet. I feel anxious.

184
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:42,400
Should we head back?

185
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,733
We better go back.

186
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,433
Okay, let's go.

187
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,600
They went together in a car.

188
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,100
I'm sure they're safe somewhere.

189
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:15,766
They should be fine.

190
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:23,033
What's this sound?

191
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,000
I think it was another one.

192
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,833
It sounds like something is collapsing.

193
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:40,733
The sound stopped.

194
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,866
You two go and have a look.

195
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,866
Be careful.

196
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,400
- Okay.
- Okay.

197
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:03,366
(Village shelter)

198
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:07,000
(Peace Village)

199
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,800
Nothing is going on.

200
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:17,800
I think we're safe.

201
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,733
What in the world was going on?

202
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,833
They're here.

203
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,866
What's going on?

204
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:40,600
We were very worried about you.

205
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,566
Where have you two been? Are you okay?

206
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,833
Yes, we're okay.

207
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,533
Why are you all out here?

208
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,733
We heard bombs all of a sudden.

209
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:50,800
We also heard something collapsing.

210
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:53,233
Is everyone okay?

211
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:55,766
Yes. Fortunately,
we all came to the shelter.

212
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,100
- Sir.
- Yes?

213
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,400
May I see you for a second?

214
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,966
Sure.

215
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,033
A wild boar seems to have stepped
on a land mine.

216
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,300
It's the middle of winter,
and a wild boar was roaming for food.

217
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:20,333
It stepped on a land mine
from the Korean War and the explosion...

218
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,600
scared the village.

219
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,733
And skeletons were found
where the land mine exploded.

220
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:32,633
The news became huge
in the Korean Peninsula.

221
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:37,933
A wild boar came close to Peace Village
to find food to survive for winter...

222
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:39,700
and stepped on an unfounded land mine.

223
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,900
This led to the discovery of the remains
of people who died during the Korean War.

224
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,833
The military forensic unit is at the site,

225
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,566
examining the skeletons.

226
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,400
The skeletons found in the mountain
near Peace Village will be...

227
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,733
organized by the Korean army,
and the extracted DNA will be...

228
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,866
used to track the descendants.

229
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:56,933
According to military personnel,

230
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:58,966
battles broke out in the area
during the Korean War,

231
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:02,100
and it is estimated
that many have died there.

232
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,366
The Korean government registered
the families of the Korean War veterans.

233
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:07,166
Using the DNA database,

234
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,400
the government tracked
the families of the skeletons.

235
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,666
Mr. Kim went missing
at around February of 1951.

236
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,433
After the armistice,
his family looked for him for 70 years...

237
00:19:15,433 --> 00:19:17,266
but was unable to do so.

238
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,566
But about 70 years after leaving home,

239
00:19:20,566 --> 00:19:22,766
Mr. Kim came back to his family.

240
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:24,033
His family said...

241
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:27,466
they are so happy to have found
their grandfather's remains,

242
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,400
expressing gratitude to Goseong-gun
and to the relevant agencies.

243
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:35,600
After 70 years...

244
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,466
Imagine how the family felt
when they found the skeletons...

245
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,700
The skeletons were secured
jointly by the South and North.

246
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,866
After finding the family,

247
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:48,333
the government delivered the remains
with due respect.

248
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:55,000
Comrade, stop being a wet blanket
and let's go.

249
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,533
Wait for me.

250
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:18,533
So this is a Christmas party.

251
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:21,166
- You do this every year?
- We do.

252
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,566
Isn't it too often...

253
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,666
Listen to Woo Bin.

254
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:33,966
<i>You better watch out, you better not cry,
you better not pout...</i>

255
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,366
Stop right there. Now you try.

256
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:44,166
<i>You better watch out, you better not cry,
you better not pout...</i>

257
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:48,900
Let's give up. It's a lost cause.

258
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,166
Hey, teach me.

259
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,433
I'll try again.

260
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:55,500
Teach me.

261
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,266
I'll try again.

262
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:58,366
Okay.

263
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,700
It can be hard.

264
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,166
The rice cake is here.

265
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:31,866
I'm glad to see this day.

266
00:21:31,866 --> 00:21:35,933
We all gathered to spend
Christmas together.

267
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:38,033
Jun Mo, it's so touching.

268
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:45,433
Since Korea split into two,

269
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:48,966
it was the first time for us
to spend a merry end of the year.

270
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:51,966
Everyone was excited
to welcome the next year together,

271
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:53,766
planning a joyous year.

272
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,966
Look!

273
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:06,066
It's snowing.

274
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,733
It's a white Christmas.

275
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:11,800
It's true.

276
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,733
I remembered that if you spend
a white Christmas with someone you love,

277
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:28,366
he will love you back for sure.

278
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:10,233
(Goodbye, 2023.)

279
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:17,700
Soon here in Jonggak,

280
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,500
the bell will ring at midnight
to say goodbye to this year.

281
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,100
To wrap up this year,
friends and families came running...

282
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,266
with unique hopes of their own.

283
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:27,400
To every viewer out there,

284
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,500
I wish you only good spirits
in the New Year.

285
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,533
Aren't you cold?

286
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,600
I'm fine.

287
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,566
Are you cold?

288
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:40,266
No, it's warm.

289
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,500
And it's cozy.

290
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,766
Time flies so fast.

291
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:52,133
Right?

292
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:54,666
Yes.

293
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:07,700
- Ten, nine, eight, seven,
- Ten, nine, eight, seven,

294
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:13,266
- six, five, four, three, two, one!
- six, five, four, three, two, one!

295
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:17,800
It's the New Year!

296
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,633
- Everyone, Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

297
00:24:23,515 --> 00:24:28,585
(2024)

298
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,333
Look! The sun is rising!

299
00:25:05,866 --> 00:25:07,400
It's the first and last New Year...

300
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:10,666
that we get to see together.

301
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:14,266
This moment,

302
00:25:14,266 --> 00:25:15,600
this feeling...

303
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,700
I don't think
I'll ever forget this feeling.

304
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:28,366
(Three months later)

305
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,733
What's wrong?

306
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,433
People say you get attached to your home.

307
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:51,366
Now I understand.

308
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,266
Yes.

309
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:02,800
I'll miss this home, too.

310
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,966
Home...

311
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,766
Home can feel comfortable.

312
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:11,033
I now know that, thanks to you.

313
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,666
Thank you...

314
00:26:21,766 --> 00:26:24,066
for being here with me.

315
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:30,200
I remember the first time I met you.

316
00:26:32,366 --> 00:26:34,166
That kick?

317
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,833
It hurt so much.

318
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,166
Let's eat.

319
00:27:12,866 --> 00:27:17,333
The season that tickles your nose tip
with the cold wind has passed.

320
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,766
The forsythia flowers in the yard...

321
00:27:19,766 --> 00:27:22,600
seems to be telling us that...

322
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,933
our time is almost up.

323
00:27:25,766 --> 00:27:28,133
Dr. Gu, let's eat
and finish that together.

324
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:30,666
Those are sandwiches.

325
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:31,900
It looks good, right?

326
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,100
I made it to share with you.

327
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:39,166
Try it.

328
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,533
Thank you.

329
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,533
Where will you be going now, Dr. Park?

330
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:19,700
Well, I'm not sure...

331
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:21,066
What about you, Dr. Gu?

332
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:23,800
I'll be going to
Kim Il Sung University Hospital.

333
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
That's great.

334
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,033
Yes, I'm glad to be
a Pyeongyang citizen, but...

335
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But?

336
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,000
I like it here.

337
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:37,300
I like this village so much,
but to have to leave...

338
00:28:39,366 --> 00:28:41,800
Take any medicine you need here.

339
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:51,200
I'm sure you have medicine there,
but instead of keeping it here,

340
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,900
you could bring it to where it's needed.

341
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,100
Dr. Park.

342
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:10,533
I'm sorry.

343
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:13,000
I mean...

344
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,100
I mean, I like you.

345
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,700
I like you, Dr. Gu.

346
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:28,300
My heart has been longing for you
for a long time.

347
00:29:55,533 --> 00:29:58,533
This is crazy...

348
00:29:58,533 --> 00:29:59,533
Be quiet!

349
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:01,433
Let's pretend we didn't see it.

350
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:11,000
While preparing to go back,
there are sparks suddenly flying.

351
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:13,466
I feel bad.

352
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:16,966
That's true. They'll never see each other.

353
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,666
I bet their hearts are breaking, right?

354
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:25,266
I'm sure it's inexplicable.

355
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,933
Mister, slow down.

356
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,066
Was it necessary to walk here?

357
00:30:42,266 --> 00:30:44,066
I have a lot of memories with you.

358
00:30:44,866 --> 00:30:46,200
I won't call you "Mister" anymore.

359
00:30:48,266 --> 00:30:52,666
I used to fall in love in a heartbeat.

360
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:55,300
Now I know the type of person I like,

361
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,033
the type of personality I like,

362
00:30:57,033 --> 00:30:59,433
and the type I prefer clearly.

363
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:03,133
What does that have to do with me?

364
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,000
What I'm saying is...

365
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:11,366
you're my type,

366
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:12,533
Nam Gyeong Ho.

367
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:18,700
We're wrapping things up, too.

368
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:21,133
Why are you confessing?

369
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:24,033
What?

370
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:27,300
I mean it's...

371
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,700
so that you don't forget me.

372
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:39,233
It's to see each other
after reunification.

373
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:44,233
I want you to promise me
to wait until that day comes.

374
00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:48,300
We don't know when that will happen,

375
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,966
and you want a promise?

376
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:58,833
We could meet and marry someone else...

377
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,900
and even have kids,

378
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,833
but we could meet again.

379
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,233
We have so many memories in this village.

380
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:19,100
Let's go and get something to eat.

381
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:39,400
I could tell you're not a big eater.

382
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,766
What do you like?

383
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:46,433
Have you been watching me?
I like everything.

384
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,733
Then are you craving anything?

385
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,433
Jun Mo.

386
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,300
Are you crying?

387
00:33:33,033 --> 00:33:34,633
If we say goodbye like this,

388
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:37,733
when will we see each other again?

389
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,466
After cleaning up this area,

390
00:33:50,466 --> 00:33:54,066
won't we see each other
in about two years?

391
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:58,066
We can't guarantee that...

392
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,500
it will be us at that time.

393
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,900
Who knows?

394
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,933
We'll see each other again.

395
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:09,133
Hey.

396
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:11,566
I'll miss you so much.

397
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:23,833
Come on now.

398
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:27,633
The South and North spent 70 years apart.

399
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:30,300
After spending one year together,

400
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,033
we understand each other
and have built a deep bond.

401
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,766
(To Dr. Gu Jin Sang
From Park Dam So)

402
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:56,900
Will you be busy back home?

403
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:00,233
I probably will be.

404
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:03,300
I'll have to do all the delayed concerts.

405
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,266
I'll go to your concert
if I get the chance.

406
00:37:09,266 --> 00:37:10,200
Okay.

407
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,300
Will you go to Germany
right after you go back?

408
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,400
After the report, I might have to.

409
00:37:24,866 --> 00:37:26,466
I don't know when,

410
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,133
but we can see each other again, right?

411
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,866
I can't promise you that.

412
00:37:41,966 --> 00:37:43,533
I won't change my number.

413
00:37:44,533 --> 00:37:45,700
Call me anytime.

414
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,866
I don't know when I'll leave for Germany.

415
00:37:51,233 --> 00:37:54,000
Even if I knew your number,

416
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,700
it'll be hard to see you again.

417
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,200
What is this?

418
00:38:09,866 --> 00:38:10,900
Open it.

419
00:38:23,433 --> 00:38:24,666
It's pretty.

420
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:47,733
On the way back home
after winning the Chopin Award,

421
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:51,166
I bought this as a gift...

422
00:38:52,966 --> 00:38:55,400
to give to someone I would like.

423
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,433
Does it look good on me?

424
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,266
Yes.

425
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:28,666
If I promise you...

426
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,000
not to forget and wait,

427
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:35,166
will you call me?

428
00:39:36,266 --> 00:39:39,200
When he said he won't forget and wait,

429
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,100
I felt a rush of pain deep in my heart.

430
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:45,766
I know I'll never see him...

431
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:48,100
and that we can't be together like now.

432
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:54,200
I wish time could just stop
right now like this.

433
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,533
I can't believe that...

434
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:07,833
I can't see someone
I have been seeing every day after today.

435
00:40:09,266 --> 00:40:13,533
She slowly took a place in my heart...

436
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:17,100
and became everything to me.

437
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,966
I don't want to let her go.

(Peace Village to Seoul)

439
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:36,966
I was happy being with you all
for the past year.

440
00:40:38,066 --> 00:40:42,833
I spent a historical moment
I can never forget with you.

441
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:44,133
It was an honor.

442
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,833
Please head back home safely.

443
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:58,133
I'll see you again one day
healthy and well.

444
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:00,933
Thank you.

445
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,100
It was a great pleasure.

446
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,533
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

447
00:41:11,633 --> 00:41:12,933
We don't see Tong Il's family.

448
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,500
- I don't see them.
- Where are they?

449
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,200
I don't see Dam So either.

450
00:41:19,433 --> 00:41:21,600
- Tong Il's family...
- They left...

And Dr. Park is sending them
to the station.

454
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,433
Why would you cut me off?

455
00:41:33,433 --> 00:41:36,833
Whether you say it or not,
it's all the same.

462

We'll be late for the train. Let's get in.

Let's get in.

464

I'm sorry I'm late.

470
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,733
It's okay, Dr. Park.
Thank you for your service.

471
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:16,366
Did Tong Il's family board the train?

472

I still have one week left.

477

One week is practically nothing.

Hey, Ki Nam still has
eight years and four months.
