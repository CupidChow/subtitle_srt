00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,133
(This series was produced
with the support of MCST, KOCCA,)

2
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:09,966
(Gangwon-do Province,
and Goseong-gun County.)

3
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:21,600
Is something wrong?

4
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:24,166
Mr. Park fainted.

5
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:27,133
Why did he faint?

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,966
It was a mistake.

7
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:39,100
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,500
What was the mistake?

9
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:52,800
(A newborn at Peace Village
urgently sent to the hospital)

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,566
(Tong Il, a baby born prematurely
in Peace Village yesterday morning...)

11
00:00:57,566 --> 00:00:58,566
(was sent to South Goseong Hospital.)

12
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:02,233
Ju Hui.

13
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:04,233
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:07,000
It was a mistake.

15
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:47,733
Is he okay?

16
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:51,400
His blood pressure soared, so he fainted.

17
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:55,333
His blood pressure is 130 over 80.
His pulse rate is 64.

18
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,966
They're back to the normal range.

19
00:01:58,233 --> 00:01:59,900
When will he wake up?

20
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,266
He'll get better after some sleep.

21
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:07,266
But it's urgent...

22
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,166
I'll come back in the afternoon.

23
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:56,500
(Love Andante Episode 7)

24
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,500
Should I start?

25
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:59,200
Thank you.

26
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,300
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

27
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:16,566
Eat well.

28
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,633
Hello, I'm pianist Lim Joo Hyung.

29
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:54,666
The village I'm staying in is...

30
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,100
Peace Village, where Tong Il was born.

31
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,700
Please pray for the baby
to come back to its parents healthy.

32
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,066
Issues distract issues.

33
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,066
(In progress)

34
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:25,333
(Upload in progress)

35
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:41,433
We have sand everywhere.

36
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:43,200
Why does it have to be this one?

37
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:46,400
Sand isn't all the same.

38
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,233
Stop whining and fill up.

39
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,800
My back is about to snap.

40
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,233
Stop complaining.

41
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:03,900
It has the natural marine minerals,
salt, and moisture.

42
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,766
It also has the right temperature
for microorganisms to live.

43
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:10,000
It may revive the oxidized soil
of our people's republic.

44
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:14,533
For our people's republic, I must do this.

45
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,000
(Aunt)

46
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,833
Auntie, what made you call me
at this hour?

47
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,633
Na Gyeong,
is there a problem at the village?

48
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:36,566
Problem? What problem?

49
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,066
Your father is traveling to Peace Village.
What's going on?

50
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:46,900
Auntie, when is he coming?

51
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:50,400
I don't know. He said in a few days.

52
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:55,033
Na Gyeong, is everything okay with you?

53
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,566
Everything is fine.

54
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:02,066
I'm doing well at work. Don't worry.

55
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,000
You should look into this.

56
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,533
Your father had an uneasy look.

57
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:14,900
Okay.

58
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,533
Don't worry. Bye.

59
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:27,866
What is it this time?

60
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:29,633
Comrade Na Gyeong!

61
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:32,933
Comrade, wait for me!

62
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:05,133
He shouldn't look that attractive.

63
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,333
It's about time...

64
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,933
- It's about time for what?
- My gosh!

65
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:24,466
You scared me.

66
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:27,533
Why would you be scared?

67
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:28,600
Were you planning something?

68
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,966
Why would I do that?

69
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:32,533
Then why were you so startled?

70
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:36,466
In the name of sacrifice,
I'm protecting this village...

71
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:37,600
What are you talking about?

72
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:42,400
Look here.
This is my social media account.

73
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:48,733
(Hello, I'm Lim Joo Hyung.)

74
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:55,733
Tong Il...

75
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:09,500
Tong Il's treatment is going well.

76
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:14,033
The South Korean doctors
are doing their best for Tong Il.

77
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,866
Don't worry and just focus on recovery.

78
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,033
Thank you.

79
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,300
Thank you.

80
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,466
Make sure to take your supplements, too.

81
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:34,466
You need to be healthy
for your baby to grow healthily.

82
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,933
Thank you.

83
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,766
Thank you.

84
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,533
You're helping Ju Hui and Tong Il...

85
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:11,866
by uploading the video?

86
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:13,100
That's right.

87
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,166
You steer the public away from an issue
with another issue in a positive way.

88
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,800
Isn't that too rash?

89
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,933
Don't you think that will jeopardize you?

90
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:24,533
I'm Lim Joo Hyung,

91
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:26,733
the world's beloved pianist.

92
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:30,400
Even so, making this into a big issue
is dangerous.

93
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,300
Hey, people are watching.

94
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:52,400
You go home first, Joo Hyung.

95
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,800
What about you?

96
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,733
I need to stop by the center
with Comrade Gyeong Ho.

97
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,133
Should I come?

98
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,266
It's okay.

99
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,166
I'll be fine with Comrade Gyeong Ho.

100
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:11,033
- Joo Hyung.
- Yes?

101
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:13,133
I want to try spice rice cakes
from the South.

102
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:14,933
Spicy rice cakes?

103
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,833
You told me before.

104
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,266
It's sweet, spicy, and tasty.

105
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,000
I did, right?

106
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:25,833
You said yours is good.
You can cook it for me today.

107
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:30,100
Come home quickly. I'll be preparing it.

108
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,566
Comrade Gyeong Ho, wait up.

109
00:11:57,266 --> 00:12:02,066
Jun Mo, the higher-ups told us to wait...

110
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:07,800
Sir, the social media...

111
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,700
Hey, don't even utter the "S" word, okay?

112
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,300
I could...

113
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,200
My head is splitting.

114
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:17,733
It won't just end like this, right?

115
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,033
No one knows.

116
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,533
What do we do now?

117
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:30,600
The higher-ups will work this out.

118
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,666
Let's wait.

119
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,566
Comrade Na Gyeong and Gyeong Ho,
what's going on?

120
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,166
My father is visiting here for work.

121
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:51,366
The Great Assistant is coming?

122
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,600
You'll have to quickly
organize a house for me.

123
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:58,366
A house?

124
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,833
This is bad. What do we do?

125
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,366
I don't know.

126
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:09,166
I mean, we do have a way...

127
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,500
What is it? Tell us.

128
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,500
My friend lived with his girlfriend...

129
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,466
behind his parents' back this way.

130
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,466
What did he do?

131
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,733
So you see...

132
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:24,500
- The Great Assistant is visiting, right?
- Yes.

133
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
He won't be sleeping over.

134
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:30,900
This isn't what I did, but...

135
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:07,200
My eyes are burning.

136
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:14,166
I'm glad that Ju Hui will cooperate.

137
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:17,566
Whether my father will overlook it
is the problem.

138
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:20,666
I should find out
when the Great Assistant will arrive...

139
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:21,800
if you were to switch houses.

140
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,633
I'll ask my aunt.

141
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,800
You ask my father's acquaintances.

142
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:31,466
Yes, I'll get to work and do my best.

143
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:42,433
Wait for me.

144
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,266
I made it with care and love.

145
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:54,300
Try it.

146
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,933
You're pretty good.

147
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:58,533
It looks good, too.

148
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,733
It's better than it looks. Try it.

149
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,733
My mom used to make stir-fried soy meat...

150
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:20,833
that tasted just like this.

151
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:23,600
I thought I would never taste this again.

152
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,566
Really? Does it taste like that?

153
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:34,733
This recipe is my grandma's.

154
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,833
- Your grandma?
- Yes.

155
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:41,433
She came to the South when she was young
when the war broke out.

156
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,933
Was your grandma from the North?

157
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,766
Yes. She's from Haeju, Hwanghae-do.

158
00:15:47,766 --> 00:15:49,033
Have you been to Haeju?

159
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,800
No, I haven't.

160
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,900
I haven't been there,

161
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,533
but I learned that
it's a quaint and peaceful city.

162
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,633
My grandma was very caring.

163
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,300
She worked so hard to raise me
since my mom was busy.

164
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:12,233
My aunt worked hard to raise me, too.

165
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,800
I shouldn't have said that.

166
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:21,833
What I want to say is...

167
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,900
when I'm talking to you,

168
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,000
I feel at ease.

169
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:30,233
It's kind of relaxing.

170
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,433
Just like my grandma.

171
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:40,100
Are you that touched by what I said?

172
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,566
No.

173
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:47,966
It was really spicy at first
but sweet at the end.

174
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,166
It's spicy.

175
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,833
Did I put in too much chili?

176
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,700
Hold on.

177
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:13,233
Milk can help ease the spiciness
better than water.

178
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,300
Drink it.

179
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:23,933
I can't feel my mouth.

180
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,566
Is it good?

181
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:57,433
Yes.

182
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:18,166
(Seven days later)

183
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,466
(Peace Village Joint Chamber)

184
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:46,400
(UN South-North Peace Village
Project Manager)

185
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,233
I'm with the world-famous pianist.

186
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,233
This will go down in history.

187
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:53,400
The South and North should talk...

188
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,000
(Minster of Unification, Lee Sang Hyun)

189
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,466
to handle this matter.

190
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,200
(Middle Assistant, Choi Dae Man)

191
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:03,033
(Director of NIA, Bae Byung Eun)

192
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:05,933
What were you thinking,
creating this mess?

193
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:08,266
We didn't expect this to happen.

194
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,666
You put our lives on the line!

195
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,900
What do you mean
by putting lives on the line?

196
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,100
We're here to resolve this, aren't we?

197
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:22,100
We were going to reveal the village
after the project ended well.

198
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:28,466
It's already happened,
so let's try to resolve it.

199
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,333
Look here.

200
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:34,466
If the South had kept the promise,
this wouldn't have happened.

201
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:39,166
Our party stands firm.

202
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,466
We want a termination.

203
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:46,966
It's been partially revealed
on social media.

204
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,700
It doesn't make sense to hide it now.

205
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,466
Minister Lee!

206
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,766
Do you think this is acceptable?

207
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:56,633
Didn't South Koreans learn
about legal compliance?

208
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,233
From a moral perspective,

209
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:03,833
it's true that
it's the South Koreans' fault.

210
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,566
But she said it was a mistake.

211
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:09,900
How can you guarantee
that it was a mistake?

212
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:13,033
Middle Assistant Choi.

213
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:16,033
I know you come from
the Military Security Command,

214
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:18,133
but aren't you blowing this
out of proportion?

215
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,733
South Korea has a habit
of breaking promises.

216
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:23,200
How will you take care of this?

217
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,800
In our people's republic,

218
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,400
this can never happen.

219
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,100
What?

220
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,166
Hurry up! Open the website!

221
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,066
- Quickly!
- Yes, sir.

222
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,333
(Hello, I'm Lim Joo Hyung.)

223
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:07,866
(I'd love to visit Peace Village!
Tong Il's birthday is the day of peace!)

224
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,600
(Tong Il, get well!)

225
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:24,400
(Is this real? This is crazy!)

226
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,466
Peace Village,
designed by South and North Korea,

227
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:31,233
is receiving the raging attention
of the world,

228
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:34,066
which can only mean
the project is a success.

229
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:37,733
Now the village represents peace.

230
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:40,966
This is a cultural heritage
to pass on to the next generation.

231
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:45,533
Now the South and North must decide.

232
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,433
The UN is also right.

233
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:53,166
Look, Director Bae.

234
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,966
It took so much to build the village,
and opening it publicly might...

235
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:58,200
create an unexpected problem.
Then what will do?

236
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:05,033
Great Assistant Ha.

237
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,766
Please don't get upset.

238
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:09,333
Let's try again.

239
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:19,733
The wind is nice.

240
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:23,233
Do you think so?

241
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,100
The wind feels pretty cold.

242
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:29,600
What if we catch a cold?

243
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,300
With this breeze, we'll be fine.

244
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,533
It's been a week, right?

245
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:38,266
Yes.

246
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:42,133
Your father came, right?

247
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,266
Yes, he did.

248
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,700
Aren't you going to see him?

249
00:22:51,766 --> 00:22:53,866
He didn't come to see me.

250
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,633
Na Gyeong.

251
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:01,600
You may say that,

252
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,266
but you want to see him.

253
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:10,800
What makes you say that I miss him?

254
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,466
You don't have to say anything.

255
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,333
I can tell by your look.

256
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,033
Should I go with you?

257
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,866
Why would you go with me?

258
00:23:30,866 --> 00:23:32,300
I have Comrade Gyeong Ho.

259
00:23:34,266 --> 00:23:36,533
You're lovely...

260
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:39,166
and so smart.

261
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:43,966
I wonder what your father is like...

262
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,966
Having silly curiosity is only dangerous.

263
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,366
Is your father that scary?

264
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:57,533
No.

265
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,766
Na Gyeong, what is...

266
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:05,166
your father like?

267
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,666
My father is...

268
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,600
a dignified person.

269
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,566
And he's a strong person.

270
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,533
Even if he breaks, he never bends.

271
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:25,866
He devotes himself
to the country and the party.

272
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,200
On the day my mom died,

273
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:36,733
my father was calm and collected.

274
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:38,966
Just like that,

275
00:24:40,866 --> 00:24:42,900
without showing sadness.

276
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:46,833
As always,

277
00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:52,866
he kept his dignity...

278
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,833
My father is that kind of person.

279
00:25:08,366 --> 00:25:11,966
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

280
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,700
What's wrong?

281
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:23,133
I have sand in my eye.

282
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,700
When you cry, the sand will come out.

283
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,966
Cry as much as you want.

284
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:49,400
You have one shot.

285
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,333
That shot will bring immense profit
to both the South and North.

286
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,400
What do you mean?

287
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:04,600
Think about it.

288
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,633
When Peace Village is revealed,

289
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:10,766
many countries will start trading with us.

290
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:13,666
They will provide much aid to the North.

291
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:18,000
With that, the North can achieve
economic development and fast growth.

292
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,900
Then, very soon,

293
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,733
the South and North could unify.

294
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:30,500
Which side is benefiting from this?

295
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,800
What you're saying is...

296
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,300
that our people's republic
needs financial aid.

297
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,400
Is that it?

298
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,733
Great Assistant, I didn't mean that.

299
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:46,966
We're the only divided country
in the world.

300
00:26:46,966 --> 00:26:50,166
So we should reconcile for the sake
of the Peace Village's purpose...

301
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:52,333
and achieve unification.

302
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:03,400
Great Assistant.

303
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:07,100
It'll be hard to hide this from the party.

304
00:27:10,466 --> 00:27:13,000
We must report this
before the party knows.

305
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:15,000
I know, but wait.

306
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,500
Shouldn't we report this
as soon as possible?

307
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:20,266
I know.

308
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:22,966
The problem is the UN's push.

309
00:27:27,933 --> 00:27:29,200
Great Assistant.

310
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,600
We should report to the party
to make time...

311
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,500
and reveal the project
after the residents move out.

312
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:38,666
If the village becomes public,

313
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,833
it'll open up our nation in no time.

314
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:47,400
Trade and opening
are two different matters.

315
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:03,600
Minister Lee,
I have the presidential office.

316
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:05,533
Do you?

317
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,300
Let's take a break.

318
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,066
Let's do that.

319
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:25,533
Let's meet again an hour later here.

320
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,300
The day is ending earlier.

321
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,866
The meeting might have finished by now.

322
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,600
It's probably still ongoing.

323
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:55,366
It's been almost a whole day.

324
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:59,266
When people gather
to do something together,

325
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:01,933
when have they ever decided
then and there?

326
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,900
Come to think of it, you're right.

327
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:09,766
But what made you post that?

328
00:29:09,766 --> 00:29:11,233
Comrade Na Gyeong!

329
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,800
It was nothing special.

330
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,766
It's been made out
to be one person's fault.

331
00:29:20,766 --> 00:29:22,200
I wanted to share the responsibility.

332
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:24,166
How is that possible?

333
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,466
Where have you been?

334
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:35,433
We were making unforgettable memories.

335
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:40,033
Mr. Piano is out of his mind, right?

336
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:41,633
Do you think this is acceptable?

337
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:43,633
You'll see.

338
00:29:43,633 --> 00:29:46,033
I'm Lim Joo Hyung. I can do it.

339
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,866
What a bluff.

340
00:29:49,866 --> 00:29:51,066
You have some courage.

341
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,100
Let's go.

342
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:15,500
The VIP wants the two sides
to talk it out and continue.

343
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,200
That's relieving to know, but...

344
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,966
It's impossible to read them.

345
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,633
It's frustrating.

346
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:56,933
You know,

347
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,733
to persuade the Supreme Leader,

348
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:03,966
I'll give all my passion and care.

349
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:09,233
But don't expect too much.

350
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,166
We'll make decisions for matters except
for revealing the village and the baby.

351
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,066
We should discuss...

352
00:31:19,066 --> 00:31:22,633
Discussion means the end of this matter.

353
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:27,366
Do you accept our offer?

354
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:32,966
Fine.

355
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,866
We ask for a quick decision to save time.

356
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:40,300
Very well.

357
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:46,233
I'll send you the specifics
once I head back to Pyeongyang.

358
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,533
Great Assistant, have you been well?

359
00:32:20,766 --> 00:32:21,900
You're here.

360
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:24,500
Where's Na Gyeong?

361
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,300
If you were going to ask,
you could have told me to bring her...

362
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
It's fine.

363
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,266
How's the research?

364
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:36,466
Comrade Na Gyeong is finding a solution
by giving every bit of her effort.

365
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,266
Are there any sicknesses?

366
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:41,466
I'm healthy.

367
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:45,566
I'm talking about Na Gyeong, not you.

368
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:48,966
Yes, she's healthy.

369
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:52,466
She's so well that she has brightened up,
going on dates...

370
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,300
What?

371
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:57,766
What did you just say?

372
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,600
Lead the way.

373
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:16,166
Great Assistant...

374
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:44,066
Great Assistant, have some tea.

375
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:49,966
Thank you.

376
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:52,933
What's taking her so long?

377
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,633
Should I call her?

378
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:58,566
Don't call. Text her.

379
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:21,300
Great Assistant.

380
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,666
Comrade Na Gyeong is here.

381
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,500
You're here?

382
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,566
Sit down.

383
00:34:40,633 --> 00:34:42,366
Please go ahead.

384
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:48,233
Please give us some space.

385
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:49,700
Sure.

386
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,400
Take as much time as you need. Let's go.

387
00:35:16,433 --> 00:35:19,100
He seems to know, right?

388
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,400
Yes, I think so.

389
00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:29,333
We might have to pack up.

390
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:32,966
Stop talking nonsense.

391
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,366
Where is he?

392
00:35:43,366 --> 00:35:45,000
Who are you talking about?

393
00:35:45,366 --> 00:35:46,933
I know everything.

394
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,366
Don't worry about it.

395
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:52,800
We're friends.

396
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:54,800
Is that so?

397
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,633
Then...

398
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,900
you wouldn't mind me meeting him.

399
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,566
Why would you meet him?

400
00:36:05,966 --> 00:36:07,233
You don't have to.

401
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,966
You...

402
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:18,566
like him.

403
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,900
Why did it have to sync?

404
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:39,100
And why did the important
North Korean man have to come?

405
00:36:39,566 --> 00:36:41,500
It's driving me crazy.

406
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:45,700
If things go wrong because of me...

407
00:36:50,966 --> 00:36:52,233
- What are you doing here?
- My goodness!

408
00:36:53,766 --> 00:36:55,266
Did I scare you?

409
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:56,966
But why are you here?

410
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:58,800
I was taking a walk...

411
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,366
I might die soon.

412
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:02,100
What? Why?

413
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:03,900
It just...

414
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,433
It just happened that I was logged in.

415
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:09,466
As soon as I plugged my phone,
it started syncing and uploading.

416
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:13,500
Don't worry. I made an even bigger mess.

417
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,866
What?

418
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,900
You distract people from an issue
with a bigger issue.

419
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:20,700
What does that mean?

420
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:22,300
You'll see.

421
00:37:23,266 --> 00:37:24,800
See what?

422
00:37:25,266 --> 00:37:28,266
You'll see later,
so you can stop worrying.

423
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:35,100
Go home and eat something.

424
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:37,000
Do you think I can?

425
00:37:37,566 --> 00:37:38,200
Yes.

426
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:54,233
You told me not to worry,
but I can't stop worrying.

427
00:37:55,366 --> 00:37:58,400
A high-ranking man came from the North...

428
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,966
and Gyeong Ho ran to him.

429
00:38:00,233 --> 00:38:01,500
Who came?

430
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,700
I think Gyeong Ho said
it's Na Gyeong's father.

431
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:10,633
Are you okay?

432
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,066
They're okay, right?

433
00:38:23,266 --> 00:38:25,000
They've been talking for a long time.

434
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,800
Hey, look over there.

435
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:34,433
Is that Mr. Piano?

436
00:38:34,733 --> 00:38:36,400
Why is he coming here?

437
00:38:39,866 --> 00:38:40,800
What?

438
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:47,700
Na Gyeong...

439
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,366
Na Gyeong's father...

440
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,400
Mr. Piano, take a breath first.

441
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,700
One more time.

442
00:39:00,733 --> 00:39:01,900
Good job.

443
00:39:03,766 --> 00:39:05,133
Na Gyeong's...

444
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,500
Where's her father?

445
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,500
How did you find out?

446
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,800
Where is he?

447
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,900
He's inside.

448
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,966
Hey!

449
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,433
Hey, move aside.

450
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:48,200
What's going on?

451
00:39:54,466 --> 00:39:57,133
I wanted to meet your father.

452
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,233
Why would you want to meet him?

453
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,400
It's your father.

454
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,466
Are you Lim Joo Hyung?

455
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:16,166
Yes. It's nice to meet you.

456
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Sir, I'm Lim Joo Hyung.

457
00:40:27,266 --> 00:40:30,066
I've never felt this nervous.

458
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It's because...

459
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,333
I love this woman.

460
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,200
Since you're here, have a seat.

461
00:41:06,066 --> 00:41:07,000
I...

462
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:13,200
Well...

463
00:41:14,866 --> 00:41:16,233
Sir.

464
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,366
It's the first and last time.

465
00:41:26,466 --> 00:41:29,466
I plucked up every courage I had.

466
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,133
I...

467
00:41:36,566 --> 00:41:38,033
like Na Gyeong.

468
00:41:38,033 --> 00:41:39,133
Are you crazy?

469
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,966
- And?
- Pardon?

470
00:41:43,966 --> 00:41:45,600
After spitting the words out,

471
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,600
my head went blank.

472
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,600
What do you expect from me?

473
00:41:52,466 --> 00:41:54,900
I don't expect anything from you...

474
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,300
Father, let's talk.

475
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,633
You have no business with him.

476
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,500
(Health Clinic)

477
00:42:22,266 --> 00:42:24,300
How about bulgogi for dinner?

478
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,400
Okay.

479
00:42:26,233 --> 00:42:28,866
But what are they doing there?

480
00:42:31,233 --> 00:42:32,700
What are you doing there?

481
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:38,866
Yes, well...

482
00:42:38,866 --> 00:42:40,333
You must be off work.

483
00:42:41,466 --> 00:42:43,200
You're off work a bit later today.

484
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:47,533
Yes, we were organizing the medicine.

485
00:42:47,533 --> 00:42:48,700
What are you doing?

486
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,800
Well, Na Gyeong's father is here.

487
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:55,633
Do you mean the Great Assistant?

488
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,700
The Great Assistant?

489
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,766
Who is that?

490
00:43:00,433 --> 00:43:02,700
Why is the Great Assistant here?

491
00:43:03,133 --> 00:43:04,966
What do you think?

492
00:43:04,966 --> 00:43:08,200
Tong Il was born and admitted
to a hospital in the South, and...

493
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,900
He came for the video Ju Hui uploaded.

494
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:14,033
Why did you cut me off?

495
00:43:34,566 --> 00:43:37,266
Why are they sending things here?

496
00:43:38,633 --> 00:43:40,966
- Let's swap shifts.
- You're here?

497
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:44,533
What's all this?

498
00:43:44,533 --> 00:43:47,600
The whole country...
No, the whole world is sending gifts.

499
00:43:48,733 --> 00:43:51,766
So all of this is for Tong Il?

500
00:43:51,766 --> 00:43:54,600
Yes, and his parents aren't even here.

501
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,933
Look at this. This must be why.

502
00:44:07,266 --> 00:44:11,666
So just with a few words
from a world star,

503
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:13,033
this is possible.

504
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,100
No wonder...

505
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,766
They're coming.

506
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:27,566
I'm sorry it took so long.

507
00:44:27,566 --> 00:44:29,733
No, Great Assistant.

508
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,566
Did the talk go well?

509
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:35,000
Thanks to you.

510
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,700
Well...

511
00:44:39,066 --> 00:44:40,566
- I shall get going.
- Yes.

512
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,233
- Lead the way.
- Yes, Great Assistant.

513
00:44:55,033 --> 00:44:56,700
Don't embarrass yourself.

514
00:44:57,033 --> 00:44:58,166
Handle it properly.

515
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:00,433
Don't worry.

516
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:03,966
Sir.

517
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,900
Please get back safely.

518
00:45:12,133 --> 00:45:14,933
I could never be your father-in-law.

519
00:45:14,933 --> 00:45:16,866
Father!

520
00:45:16,866 --> 00:45:19,800
What? Am I wrong?

521
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,766
You didn't have to go that far.

522
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:28,366
He doesn't frown even once.

523
00:45:28,366 --> 00:45:32,166
As he treats my father with a kind look,

524
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:33,866
my heart breaks.

525
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:45,100
- Let's go.
- Yes, Great Assistant.

526
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,833
Are you two okay?

527
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,300
On the day I met her father,

528
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,000
I was reminded of my father
who faintly lives in my memory.

529
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,166
And seeing Na Gyeong's father
looking at her,

530
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:26,333
I remember that when my father saw me,

531
00:46:26,866 --> 00:46:29,100
his eyes were warm.

532
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:48,800
Say what you need to say.

533
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,766
I don't have anything.

534
00:46:52,533 --> 00:46:55,366
I'm sorry about my father.

535
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:59,500
I understand him.

536
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,133
Even if you don't mean it, thank you.

537
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,633
I do mean it.

538
00:47:07,633 --> 00:47:10,000
I would've done the same
if I were your father.

539
00:47:11,633 --> 00:47:12,666
What?

540
00:47:13,866 --> 00:47:18,633
If I had a beautiful daughter
who is kind, warm,

541
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,633
and smart as a whip like you,

542
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:24,766
I would be the same.

543
00:47:34,466 --> 00:47:36,133
You give and take.

544
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:39,533
Your eyes are overflowing with sweet love.

545
00:47:42,566 --> 00:47:45,166
This isn't the time to laugh.

546
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:47,033
Haven't you heard
what the Great Assistant said?

547
00:47:47,033 --> 00:47:48,233
Are you jealous?

548
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,166
Jealous of what?

549
00:47:52,533 --> 00:47:54,033
I see a dark path coming up.

550
00:47:54,033 --> 00:47:55,966
Wasn't it enough to tell on me?

551
00:47:55,966 --> 00:47:57,566
Don't rile us up and go on your way.

552
00:47:58,766 --> 00:48:00,533
I was going to, even if you didn't ask.

553
00:48:05,366 --> 00:48:07,833
Gyeong Ho can be cute sometimes.

554
00:48:08,733 --> 00:48:10,466
Cute?

555
00:48:10,466 --> 00:48:12,000
Don't you think he's gross?

556
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,633
Sometimes.

557
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:18,766
Let's go.

558
00:48:38,933 --> 00:48:39,933
Hello.

559
00:48:40,466 --> 00:48:42,233
What? Yes...

560
00:48:43,433 --> 00:48:44,466
Why are you here?

561
00:48:46,866 --> 00:48:49,733
Mister, take care.

562
00:48:50,766 --> 00:48:51,466
What?

563
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,766
I waited to see you one last time
before I left.

564
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:57,933
What are you talking about?

565
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:03,433
I might be kicked out of the village.

566
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,866
Are you crying?

567
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:17,733
Everyone will hear.

568
00:49:17,733 --> 00:49:18,900
Please stop.

569
00:49:19,366 --> 00:49:21,266
What should I do?

570
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,900
Come on now!

571
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,633
Mr. Piano, please stop bugging me.

572
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:01,466
I'm really busy.

573
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:03,766
Give me a second. I have a question.

574
00:50:03,766 --> 00:50:05,066
Seriously.

575
00:50:05,066 --> 00:50:07,733
What's going on here?

576
00:50:08,933 --> 00:50:10,866
I was saying...

577
00:50:10,866 --> 00:50:13,000
when a guy meets
his girlfriend's family...

578
00:50:13,466 --> 00:50:15,066
I mean,

579
00:50:15,066 --> 00:50:16,600
how do you make a good impression?

580
00:50:17,133 --> 00:50:18,000
What?

581
00:50:19,533 --> 00:50:20,733
What are you talking about?

582
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,500
Let's say a man loves this woman.

583
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:29,300
He has a chance to meet her family.

584
00:50:30,266 --> 00:50:33,133
What does he need to do to be courteous?

585
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,466
What else is there?
You greet them politely and...

586
00:50:37,466 --> 00:50:38,966
What I'm saying is...

587
00:50:38,966 --> 00:50:41,666
how do you greet politely?

588
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:45,933
In my area, you give them a big bow...

589
00:50:45,933 --> 00:50:50,033
or lower your head politely like this.

590
00:50:50,033 --> 00:50:51,400
- Jang Su.
- Yes?

591
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,966
Is it different in the North?

592
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,800
The big bow is for marriage.

593
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,933
And we're always polite
when we do our greetings.

594
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,300
This is frustrating.

595
00:51:04,933 --> 00:51:07,700
What about a gift
when you first meet them?

596
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:10,533
In our people's republic,

597
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:14,400
we mostly marry childhood friends.

598
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,533
We don't really do that.

599
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:19,366
You just greet them? You just say "Hello?"

600
00:51:19,366 --> 00:51:20,866
Yes, we just do that.

601
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,733
It's not much different
in the North and South.

602
00:51:25,733 --> 00:51:27,633
- Yes.
- Mr. Piano.

603
00:51:28,133 --> 00:51:30,966
You just need to say hello politely.

604
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:34,366
Hold on.

605
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,966
But...

606
00:51:37,966 --> 00:51:40,433
why are you curious about that?

607
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,233
Well, it's nothing.

608
00:51:47,866 --> 00:51:49,733
I'm just curious.

609
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,900
I thought it might be different.

610
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:59,000
Isn't it too trivial
for him to be this serious?

611
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,533
You're right.

612
00:52:02,366 --> 00:52:06,366
Mr. Piano, are you planning to meet
Comrade Na Gyeong's father?

613
00:52:06,366 --> 00:52:07,400
No!

614
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,566
No, I'm not.

615
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,533
In case...

616
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:14,566
Just in case something happens,

617
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,466
I wanted to be prepared.

618
00:52:19,066 --> 00:52:21,133
What's the time?

619
00:52:21,133 --> 00:52:23,400
Isn't your watch on the other side?

620
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,900
Something is up.

621
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,366
Nothing is up.

622
00:52:29,366 --> 00:52:31,366
I have to practice, so I'll get going.

623
00:52:34,533 --> 00:52:36,533
See that? I told you.

624
00:52:36,933 --> 00:52:39,233
It's like "Crash Landing on You."

625
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,733
Does that mean...

626
00:52:42,733 --> 00:52:44,100
You'll see.

627
00:52:44,633 --> 00:52:46,300
Does that mean...

628
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,533
the Great Assistant is coming here?

629
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,200
Great Assistant Ha Jin Cheol?

630
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:58,001
