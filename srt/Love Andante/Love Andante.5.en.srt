00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,133
(This series was produced
with the support of MCST, KOCCA,)

2
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:09,966
(Gangwon-do Province,
and Goseong-gun County.)

3
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:46,700
Look up there.

4
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:29,900
What's this?

5
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,333
Is my heart beating?

6
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,266
Don't get too excited.

7
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:36,633
What did you say? I didn't hear you.

8
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:40,866
No, it's nothing.

9
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:09,266
Do you like the stars?

10
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:11,866
I did when I was little.

11
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,266
When you were little?

12
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:16,533
Yes.

13
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,366
I miss her more when I see the stars,
so I stop watching them.

14
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,066
Who do you miss?

15
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:28,066
My mom.

16
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:31,966
Do you look like her?

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,533
Then do you look like your dad?

18
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,966
No, I look like my mom.

19
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,966
I should've known better.

20
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,633
You didn't have dinner yet?

21
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:57,700
It wasn't me.

22
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,133
Don't lie. I heard it.

23
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:03,133
You didn't hear anything.

24
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:11,300
Do you want this?

25
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:14,000
No thank you.

26
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,466
Recharging will take some time.

27
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:43,833
Just take a bite.

28
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,200
It takes away the hunger, right?

29
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:16,566
When you came here,

30
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:18,400
did you want to do anything
other than research?

31
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,400
What about you?

32
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,566
Not being chased by work...

33
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:30,866
and relaxing in my free time...

34
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:32,866
was what I wanted to do the most.

35
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:38,233
Then your wish has been fulfilled.

36
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:40,233
Has it?

37
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,566
Don't you think so?

38
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:45,266
I envy you.

39
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:48,933
Na Gyeong.

40
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:52,666
Tell me your bucket list.

41
00:04:53,866 --> 00:04:55,366
I'll do the list with you.

42
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:59,600
So you'll do...

43
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,900
what I ask you to do?

44
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,766
Joo Hyung.

45
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,933
Do you like me?

46
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:18,766
Maybe.

47
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:57,033
But are you starting to talk
more casually to me?

48
00:05:58,933 --> 00:05:59,966
It's because I'm older.

49
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,866
You don't like it?

50
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:05,833
Then you can talk to me casually, too.

51
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:22,700
A fair man for a fair lady.

52
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,533
A man from the South
and a woman from the North.

53
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,900
How nice.

54
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,366
Who is that?

55
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:54,033
Did they have a date?

56
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,233
And I'm all alone. I'm jealous.

57
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:07,100
What is she thinking?

58
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,033
(Love Andante Episode 5)

59
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,200
- Jun Mo.
- Yes?

60
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,700
Is something falling from the sky?

61
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,433
No.

62
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,033
Then why are you holding your head high...

63
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:20,300
to stare at the sky until it hurts?

64
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,933
It's autumn.

65
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,033
The falling leaves are saddening.

66
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:30,100
We're up to ears in work.

67
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:34,733
It's the season for men. Autumn is here.

68
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:38,766
Ki Nam, Woo Bin.

69
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:40,933
- Yes, we're ready.
- Yes.

70
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,666
But is Mr. Park okay?

71
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:45,966
Let him be.

72
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:48,633
He's been like that around this time
for three years already.

73
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:50,966
Get in.

74
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,133
What are we harvesting today?

75
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:57,733
Today, we harvest Shine Muscat and apples.

76
00:08:57,733 --> 00:09:00,100
Shine Muscat and apples?

77
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,100
Okay.

78
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,300
But how do we open the door?

79
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,366
Come on now.

80
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,600
How fascinating.

81
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,066
Do I just get in?

82
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,933
- Just like this? How fascinating.
- Get in.

83
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:19,700
<i>When autumn comes, don't go...</i>

84
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,733
Hey! Don't go! Take me!

85
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:23,700
Hey!

86
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,133
Comrade Na Gyeong.

87
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,333
Comrade Na Gyeong!

88
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:49,700
- What are you looking at?
- You scared me!

89
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:53,766
They're not in. They left early together.

90
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:55,466
- What?
- What?

91
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:56,533
Where did they go?

92
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:58,033
I wouldn't know that.

93
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:06,066
<i>My heart is beating</i>

94
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,533
<i>Don't tell anyone
I'm actually seventeen</i>

95
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:13,566
(Comrade Na Gyeong)

96
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:23,366
Why isn't she answering?

97
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,400
Are you allergic to something?

98
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,466
Isn't it rhinitis then?

99
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:57,800
No, I have something in my throat.

100
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:04,366
Look at me. I'm doing good, right?

101
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,966
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

102
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:33,333
Be careful.

103
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:49,133
I don't think it was a mistake.

104
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:51,366
I'm sorry. I apologize.

105
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,600
It's cold! Wait!

106
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:28,933
Look at them having fun.

107
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,466
What is she thinking?

108
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,866
Isn't it like a movie scene?

109
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:38,266
They're a couple who just fell in love.

110
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:42,633
They look like children
playing with water.

111
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,833
Don't you know romance?

112
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,466
See how happy they look.

113
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:50,033
Watch closely.

114
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,433
What are you doing?

115
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:12,266
You scared us.

116
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:16,533
You two were watching something,
so we just got curious.

117
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:18,466
What are you watching,
putting your heads together?

118
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,100
It's nothing.

119
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,900
We were watching Comrade Ju Hui's video.

120
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:26,733
You were watching those two?

121
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,033
Isn't it like a sweet music video?

122
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,566
What should we do about
the film screening this month?

123
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:51,800
What do you mean?

124
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,500
The wind blew hard last month...

125
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,533
and knocked down the screen.

126
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,200
I remember now.

127
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:01,366
We could use the columns of the house...

128
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:04,100
to fix a wide white cloth with rope.

129
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,500
- White cloth?
- Yes.

130
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,900
But where would we do that?

131
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:10,666
We have the wide white cloth
at the management center.

132
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,566
We can fix it by using a rope like this.

133
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:15,600
- No, what I'm asking is...
- Yes?

134
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,966
where do we install the white cloth?

135
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:20,333
I see.

136
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,200
Well...

137
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,733
We could do that at Mr. Piano's house.

138
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,766
I don't think so.

139
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:29,500
Mr. Piano will get really cranky again.
Will it be okay?

140
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,300
Don't worry.

141
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:35,033
Just trust me. I'll make it work.

142
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:43,133
I'll just trust you
and let the villagers know.

143
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,366
Okay.

144
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:45,266
Leave it to me.

145
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:48,333
<i>Trust your man</i>

146
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,400
Good work.

147
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:54,266
- Hello.
- Salute.

148
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:55,700
Mr. Park, is this it?

149
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,966
Woo Bin, fix that
on Mr. Piano's home wall.

150
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,366
- What?
- What?

151
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:03,833
Is that going to be okay?

152
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,766
Won't we have to move it again?

153
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,966
We could just hang it on the trees.

154
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:11,166
- Jun Mo will take care of Mr. Piano.
- I do.

155
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,800
- Let's go.
- Go on.

156
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:14,933
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

157
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:16,800
- See you later.
- Okay.

158
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:26,166
It'll be nice to enjoy the film together.

159
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,466
Okay.

160
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,133
(As One)

161
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:10,000
What is this place?

162
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:12,733
You'll know when you get in. Let's go.

163
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,600
(DMZ Museum)

164
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:50,800
(Welcome.)

165
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:54,200
(Status quo of Trans-Korean Railway)

166
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,466
What is this?

167
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:21,466
Write down your wish.
I'll write mine, too.

168
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:38,033
Never saying goodbye to you who I miss
even when I'm looking at you.

169
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,900
I'm now used to having you around.

170
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,600
We'll go our separate ways soon,

171
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,566
but I wait for the day...

172
00:17:57,566 --> 00:18:02,300
when we can be together happily
in the united nation.

173
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:12,700
What did you write?

174
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:14,666
Nothing much.

175
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,066
Did you make a wish?

176
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:19,333
A wish?

177
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,766
What's the point?

178
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:22,633
I did.

179
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:25,233
I wished for fast reunification.

180
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:28,100
Why?

181
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,900
We could see each other when we wanted to.

182
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,100
It'll be nice to meet each other
when we want to.

183
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:40,266
Do you like me that much?

184
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:41,700
It's not about us.

185
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,233
We're divided into two.

186
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:48,766
I can understand the divided families
that miss each other.

187
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,333
I see.

188
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:53,966
That happy day might come one day.

189
00:18:56,466 --> 00:19:00,366
If I go to Pyeongyang Airport
after a concert...

190
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:03,233
and see you there,
I think I'll be really happy.

191
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,600
You're ambitious.

192
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,233
You're warmhearted.

193
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,233
You dream of hope.

194
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,900
I can't help but like you for that.

195
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:37,266
I can't help but love you, so it's hard.

196
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:44,100
From a certain point,

197
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,500
I didn't want to let go of this hand.

198
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,466
Can you touch it?

199
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,066
(Seafood bar)

200
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,933
Raw fish calls for soju.

201
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:02,166
No.

202
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,600
Raw fish calls for white wine.

203
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,066
Don't be silly.

204
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:13,200
Enjoy.

205
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,200
I like squid.

206
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:18,266
Squid?

207
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:19,533
This is called an octopus.

208
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,633
This is an octopus?

209
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:22,933
No, it's not.

210
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:24,433
This is called a squid.

211
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:26,633
You can't tell the two apart?

212
00:22:28,966 --> 00:22:32,000
Fine. Let's call it octopus from now on.

213
00:22:41,966 --> 00:22:43,066
It's good.

214
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:44,233
Try it.

215
00:23:16,366 --> 00:23:17,366
It's good.

216
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,633
I'll do it.

217
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:28,200
Fix it well so that it doesn't flap.

218
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,100
Okay.

219
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,266
It's not a sail.

220
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:32,500
That's good.

221
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,600
Yes, fix the bottom.

222
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:36,433
I think it's done.

223
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,100
It's good. That's right.

224
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,800
But what if Mr. Piano gets mad
for not telling him about this?

225
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,333
It's fine. Don't worry.

226
00:23:50,233 --> 00:23:52,600
Mr. Park, is it good?

227
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,800
Well, no. Woo Bin,
raise your side a little.

228
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,733
- Okay.
- Just a little more.

229
00:23:57,733 --> 00:23:59,466
A little more.

230
00:23:59,466 --> 00:24:01,700
Okay, that's it.

231
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,266
- That's it?
- Yes, that's it.

232
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:05,400
Fix the bottom.

233
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,833
What do you think? It looks done, right?

234
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,566
Yes, it's about right.

235
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:11,966
That's good.

236
00:24:11,966 --> 00:24:14,133
- It looks good.
- Yes.

237
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:28,433
It's chilly since the sun is about to set.

238
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:32,766
Whenever it's cold,
I'll hug you like this.

239
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,033
Everywhere I go, the lighthouses
in Korea are the prettiest.

240
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:47,833
Have you seen many lighthouses?

241
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:51,566
I've seen lighthouses
in most European countries.

242
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,200
I look for an open space
when I travel for a concert.

243
00:24:57,133 --> 00:24:57,833
That's when I look.

244
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:00,100
I was in Germany...

245
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,000
when I saw a lighthouse
being turned on once.

246
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,800
When the light hit the dark sea,

247
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:11,133
I saw people finding their way home
with the light.

248
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:14,866
I had thought the light looked cold,

249
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:17,000
but it turned warm then.

250
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:23,266
Is my hug warm, too?

251
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,133
Na Gyeong, do you want to watch a movie?

252
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,500
A movie?

253
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:46,733
We could if we go back. Shall we go?

254
00:25:57,866 --> 00:25:58,966
I almost forgot.

255
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,166
- You're here.
- Hello.

256
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,500
Welcome.

257
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,500
Listen up.

258
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,000
Corn puffs are on the house today,
so have as much as you want.

259
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:21,200
The movie is about to start.

260
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,666
What's this?

261
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:33,800
How do we get inside?

262
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,766
Mr. Park.

263
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:41,500
Mr. Park.

264
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,900
Yes?

265
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,900
What did you do to my door?

266
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:47,800
Do what?

267
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,233
Didn't I give you the pass?

268
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,133
I lent you my car, too.

269
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:53,966
My new car.

270
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,266
You have to be back by 8 p.m.

271
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,133
I promise.

272
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:04,633
- And...
- And?

273
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:07,233
My car's still new, so it's sensitive.

274
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:09,833
Promise you'll drive it gently.

275
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:15,666
Yes, I'll drive safely.

276
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,200
- And...
- And again?

277
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:23,333
No matter what happens,
you won't get mad today...

278
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:25,466
and accept it happily.

279
00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:26,600
You promised.

280
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,766
Yes, I won't be mad about anything.

281
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,900
The front seats are for the VIPs.

282
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,466
They're for you and Na Gyeong.

283
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,966
- Go ahead and be seated.
- Yes.

284
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,100
So this is why you gave me the pass.

285
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,633
This wasn't exactly why.
It just happened so.

286
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:08,966
- The movie is about to start.
- It's starting.

287
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:10,666
Please go and be seated.

288
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:11,933
Go ahead.

289
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:26,300
What happened?

290
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:29,800
For now, let's watch the movie
and talk later.

291
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,733
What movie is this?

292
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:35,866
I don't know either. Let's just watch.

293
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:44,000
It's starting.

294
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,233
Here we go.

295
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:46,966
It's starting.

296
00:29:08,066 --> 00:29:10,133
Don't you think
those two look good together?

297
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,133
Don't be ridiculous!

298
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:14,000
Make friends with the North Koreans.

299
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,400
Let's plan a blind date
with the North Korean girls.

300
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,033
Why can't I say what I see or feel?

301
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:25,100
For the World Table Tennis Championships
in April,

302
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,400
the two Koreas have agreed to enter
a single team representing both nations.

303
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,033
Enjoy the movie.

304
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:33,500
At the meeting today,
South Korea suggested...

305
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,833
forming a single team
for the world championship.

306
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:40,366
Excluding the player selection
and team managers...

307
00:29:40,366 --> 00:29:42,866
What does that mean?

308
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,100
Thank you.

309
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,166
Hello, mister.

310
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:06,066
- Jun Mo.
- Yes?

311
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:09,166
How come Mr. Piano is quiet?

312
00:30:10,566 --> 00:30:12,300
I told you.

313
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,333
- Just watch the movie.
- Okay.

314
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:17,533
Coach, that's so irresponsible.

315
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:19,933
Jeong Hwa, what's wrong with you, too?

316
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:21,933
I just got fired as a coach.

317
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,066
The coach is the North Korean guy,
Jo Nam Pung or something.

318
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:28,800
Who painted this ridiculous picture?

319
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,166
If you knew,
would you go to the president?

320
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:32,033
Do you want cab fare?

321
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:33,100
Tell them we can't do it.

322
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,266
It's a picture we can't refuse.

323
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,633
This isn't a picture
we can just erase and paint again.

324
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:40,966
I see you have many problems
with the government's decisions.

325
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:44,300
When in Rome, do as Romans do.

326
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:01,433
(Don't Answer)

327
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:25,700
Sir.

328
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,466
Chan Yeong, are you there?

329
00:31:27,466 --> 00:31:29,500
I'm counting on you.

330
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:33,300
Sir, find another way. This isn't right.

331
00:31:33,866 --> 00:31:36,200
You know we canceled
every other concert, right?

332
00:31:37,266 --> 00:31:37,933
Yes.

333
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:40,766
But we can't cancel the ones in Europe.

334
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,733
Do you know how much the penalty is?

335
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:45,200
It's 50 times the contract.

336
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,833
But this still isn't right.

337
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,966
A gold medal is important to me.

338
00:31:58,566 --> 00:32:00,166
For you and me,

339
00:32:01,566 --> 00:32:03,933
a gold medal for Team Korea.

340
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,000
Jun Mo,

341
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,733
this is so sad.

342
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:37,766
It's my second time watching,
but I'm still touched.

343
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,966
Let's do it!

344
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,800
It's been years
since I was discharged, too.

345
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:55,800
Thanks for the movie.

346
00:33:57,233 --> 00:33:59,000
Well, I...

347
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,566
The film wasn't the one I suggested...

348
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:04,600
I know. You don't have to say it.

349
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:07,333
I saw Mr. Park's face...

350
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:09,833
and realized your plan didn't work.

351
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:12,533
How did you know?

352
00:34:14,866 --> 00:34:17,966
We spent six months here together.

353
00:34:17,966 --> 00:34:22,333
Isn't that enough time to get to know you?

354
00:34:22,866 --> 00:34:23,833
Na Gyeong,

355
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:26,366
so you liked me a lot.

356
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,633
Is that any reason to be so touched?

357
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:35,500
We spent time together in the same space.

358
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,633
It's natural to care for each other.

359
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,566
Your hand is cold.

360
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:52,766
It must have been cold.

361
00:34:53,866 --> 00:34:55,266
Do you want more hot tea?

362
00:34:57,566 --> 00:34:58,666
No thanks.

363
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,500
When you say that,
do you know you sound really cold?

364
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:04,800
What?

365
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,966
When you say, "No thanks."

366
00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:12,066
But that's what I mean...

367
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:14,700
Do I sound cold?

368
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,900
I understand you're fine without it,

369
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,433
but whenever I hear that,

370
00:35:20,433 --> 00:35:22,933
it almost feels like
you're distancing yourself.

371
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:27,100
No, it feels like an outright rejection.

372
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,433
It feels like that.

373
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Our regional dialects are different.

374
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,333
You don't have to be hurt by that.

375
00:35:39,566 --> 00:35:40,766
I was joking.

376
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:44,466
You looked cute just now.

377
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:07,200
Is this the right way?

378
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:14,833
Darn it! Joo Hyung!

379
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,933
Why do I feel happy?

380
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,633
They're the first official couple
of the two Koreas.

381
00:37:06,566 --> 00:37:07,833
See?

382
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,133
That's good.

383
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:16,500
No.

384
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,600
They might have a huge fight
if their families are against it.

385
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:26,466
I should pretend it never happened.

386
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:33,000
Hi.

387
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:54,800
Joo Hyung!

388
00:37:55,866 --> 00:37:58,333
Comrade Na Gyeong seems
to have made research progress.

389
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:00,600
I'm really happy to hear that.

390
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,733
Keep an eye on her.

391
00:38:02,733 --> 00:38:04,333
Yes, sir.

392
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,733
Get the best result possible
for the time remaining.

393
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:09,766
Do you understand?

394
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:13,333
Yes, I'll do my best, Great Assistant.

395
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:14,800
I'm hanging up.

396
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,766
Who's there?

397
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,466
My gosh!

398
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,533
Please don't kill me!

399
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:55,900
Why were you up at this hour?

400
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,000
To report...

401
00:38:58,566 --> 00:39:01,433
I was exercising
since the air is fresh early...

402
00:39:01,433 --> 00:39:02,833
And you're crazy, right?

403
00:39:03,933 --> 00:39:06,133
It wasn't my decision.

404
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:07,233
The CEO...

405
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:09,433
You still shouldn't have come here!

406
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:10,866
What choice did I have?

407
00:39:10,866 --> 00:39:12,600
His business is going under.

408
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,533
What do we do now?

409
00:39:18,366 --> 00:39:21,300
We can resolve this.

410
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,133
Will there be a solution?

411
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Your name will land in the history book.

412
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,833
Don't talk to him like that!

413
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Joo Hyung, it'll only be two days.

414
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,700
Don't be ridiculous.

415
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,866
Joo Hyung!

416
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:40,066
I put my life on the line...

417
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:42,700
and came here, being prepared to die.

418
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,800
Hey, that was your choice, not mine!

419
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:49,200
That is harsh.

420
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,233
Let's call the management.

421
00:39:53,066 --> 00:39:53,900
- No!
- No!

422
00:39:56,633 --> 00:39:58,766
Chan Yeong, get out of here
before this gets out of hand.

423
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:01,533
- Joo Hyung!
- Hey!

424
00:40:05,633 --> 00:40:06,400
Hey!

425
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,600
You go back home.

426
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:14,666
Get in.

427
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,466
What are you lashing out at me for?

428
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,200
Joo Hyung, the sun came up.

429
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,600
If the villagers catch me leaving,

430
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,666
aren't all of you in trouble?

431
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:29,433
Right?

432
00:40:37,566 --> 00:40:39,000
This is just annoying.

433
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,500
Can I eat it?

434
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:57,333
Eat it.

435
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,600
(Recycling center)

436
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:42,966
What will you do?

437
00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:48,300
If we get caught, we're all in trouble.

438
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:51,633
Tell us a solution
instead of what we know.

439
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:54,666
You two pretend you have no idea.

440
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:56,200
I'll take care of it.

441
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:58,666
Do you think that will work?

442
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,533
Anyone can tell we're all in it.

443
00:42:01,533 --> 00:42:03,233
Count me out.

444
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:04,800
Do you think that will work?

445
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:07,600
Give me a second to think!

446
00:42:11,733 --> 00:42:14,733
I'm going home.

447
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:16,433
I'll see you when you're done thinking.

448
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,066
What?

449
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,900
Why is he coming from that way
and not this way?

450
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,566
How come there's trouble every day?

451
00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:45,600
Not a day passes by peacefully.

452
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:49,133
What's going on?

453
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,333
Why is he coming out there at this hour?

454
00:42:51,966 --> 00:42:52,966
Why?

455
00:42:57,633 --> 00:42:59,366
Where are you going this early in the day?

456
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,566
I haven't been anywhere...

457
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,733
Then why are you here
this early in the day?

458
00:43:10,066 --> 00:43:11,833
It's just...

459
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,933
I wanted to exercise with you, so I came.

460
00:43:16,933 --> 00:43:17,800
Aren't you working out today?

461
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:22,533
You're going to exercise
while dressed like that?

462
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:24,166
What?

463
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,566
I forgot my sneakers.

464
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,100
It's fine. Go on.

465
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,433
How annoying.

466
00:43:45,433 --> 00:43:47,600
If only if had I worn sneakers,
I could've insisted.

467
00:44:02,233 --> 00:44:05,566
<i>It's the autumn and the wind...</i>

468
00:44:05,566 --> 00:44:07,066
It must be the fresh air.

469
00:44:07,066 --> 00:44:09,433
Don't you feel healthier?

470
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,233
Yes, while staying here,

471
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,633
everything comes out
so well every morning.

472
00:44:14,633 --> 00:44:17,066
Did you have to talk about poop now?

473
00:44:17,066 --> 00:44:19,466
With clean water and fresh air,

474
00:44:19,466 --> 00:44:22,466
my constipation is completely gone.

475
00:44:22,466 --> 00:44:23,600
My gosh.

476
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,433
It even has a nice color.

477
00:44:24,433 --> 00:44:26,933
How disgusting! Go away!
Stay away from me!

478
00:44:26,933 --> 00:44:28,300
Keep your distance from me.

479
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,866
Seriously.

480
00:44:29,866 --> 00:44:32,300
- Wait up!
- Don't come near me.

481
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,133
Jun Mo!

482
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:37,366
- Hello.
- Woo Ri, where are you off to so early?

483
00:44:37,366 --> 00:44:39,133
I have to see Mr. Piano.

484
00:44:39,133 --> 00:44:40,166
This early?

485
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,066
(Kim Woo Ri, manager of
the Peace Village Reunification Fund)

486
00:44:41,066 --> 00:44:43,533
I have to pick up the fund information
at the bank first.

487
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,600
- What's the fund?
- What?

488
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:50,133
Don't mind him. Go ahead. Let's go.

489
00:44:50,133 --> 00:44:52,066
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day.

490
00:44:52,066 --> 00:44:53,533
Come here.

491
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:55,100
No, stay away.

492
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,766
- Come on!
- Get away from me.

493
00:45:01,633 --> 00:45:04,833
You're distracting me. Sit or go to bed.

494
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,966
How can I sleep now?

495
00:45:07,766 --> 00:45:09,800
If we get caught,

496
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,466
Gyeong Ho and I might be revolutionized.

497
00:45:11,466 --> 00:45:12,933
(Revolutionization, A punishment
by resignation or forced labor)

498
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,233
This crazy fool.

499
00:45:23,533 --> 00:45:25,466
What's wrong?

500
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,533
- I have an idea.
- What?

501
00:45:28,066 --> 00:45:30,033
Hear me out.

502
00:45:30,033 --> 00:45:32,966
- First, you do your job.
- My job?

503
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,233
Should I go to the farm?

504
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,700
No, do something else.

505
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:42,733
What should I do?
I can't think of anything.

506
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,500
Relaxing...

507
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,700
Should I practice the piano?

508
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,233
Do whatever.

509
00:45:50,633 --> 00:45:53,566
I have to work at the lab,
so when I come back in the evening...

510
00:45:53,566 --> 00:45:56,533
How is that going to work,
especially with him here?

511
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:01,133
It'd be nice if you could be here.

512
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:05,100
You do what you do.

513
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,266
If I work at the lab,
people will think we're out.

514
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,966
No one will come, right?

515
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:12,266
He just needs to stay here
and not go outside.

516
00:46:13,866 --> 00:46:14,933
And then?

517
00:46:23,766 --> 00:46:26,033
We'll call someone to pick him up.

518
00:47:27,633 --> 00:47:29,466
Are you making coffee?

519
00:47:30,133 --> 00:47:31,733
You told me to do what I do.

520
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,833
Yes, I see.

521
00:47:38,933 --> 00:47:40,266
It's fragrant.

522
00:47:40,266 --> 00:47:41,566
Of course.

523
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:44,433
You fall in love
with the aroma and flavor...

524
00:47:44,433 --> 00:47:46,233
of the best Columbian beans.

525
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:47,566
It's the best out of fair-trade coffee.

526
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,266
After tasting it, you'll want it again.

527
00:47:52,633 --> 00:47:54,333
It's like you.

528
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,600
It's like me?

529
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,333
That's a bit cheesy.

530
00:48:01,933 --> 00:48:03,833
Can't I say what's in my mind?

531
00:48:07,666 --> 00:48:09,966
Never mind. I'm leaving.

532
00:48:12,466 --> 00:48:13,566
When are you coming back?

533
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,000
I need to know the time for the plan.

534
00:48:38,033 --> 00:48:39,600
Can you sleep through this?

535
00:48:40,933 --> 00:48:42,266
- Drink this.
- Thanks.

536
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:56,233
Where's Mr. Piano?

537
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:57,333
Let's go.

538
00:48:58,066 --> 00:48:59,833
What will you do?

539
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:02,866
What do you think?
We need to send him out.

540
00:49:02,866 --> 00:49:04,233
Get ready for tonight.

541
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,200
Why are you asking me?

542
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:11,000
Then should I do it?

543
00:49:16,366 --> 00:49:17,733
(Epilogue)

544
00:50:11,766 --> 00:50:12,500
Joo Hyung.

545
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,233
Yes?

546
00:50:14,233 --> 00:50:15,633
Joo Hyung.

547
00:50:27,466 --> 00:50:28,533
Wake up.

548
00:50:29,266 --> 00:50:30,433
