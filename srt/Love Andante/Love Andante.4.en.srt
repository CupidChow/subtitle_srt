(This series was produced
with the support of MCST, KOCCA,)

2
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:10,133
(Gangwon-do Province,
and Goseong-gun County.)

3
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:52,800
You might have killed Mr. Piano.

4
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,900
He's so weak.

5
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,133
He can barely be a man.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,633
It's probably because it's his first day.

7
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,333
I don't think he can make it tomorrow.

8
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:11,066
I have to stop by the shop.

9
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,666
Go ahead.

10
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,466
This is Peace Village Mart.

11
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:48,966
They have a variety of products
and fresh food.

12
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:50,733
Hello.

13
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:53,133
Big sister! Can I call you that?

14
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:54,233
Sure.

15
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:56,666
When are you due?

16
00:01:57,566 --> 00:02:00,366
Tong Il is due sometime in October.

17
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:02,000
Tong Il must be his fetal nickname.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,133
Are you having a son?

19
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,933
Yes, it's a son.

20
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:06,333
Big sister.

21
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,633
Eat these eggs.

22
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:10,400
Cage-free fertilized eggs.

23
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,166
You have to eat well when you're pregnant.

24
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,333
Try this, too.

25
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,733
It's a meal kit
made with 100 percent Korean produce.

26
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:18,233
It's popular these days.

27
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:21,466
I've tried that. I highly recommend it.

28
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:22,900
Am I in the video, too?

29
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,166
Yes, you can watch it
on my social media account later.

30
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:33,866
Hello.

31
00:02:33,866 --> 00:02:35,200
Welcome, Gyeong Ho.

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,533
It's really good.

33
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:45,666
You have to try it.

34
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,233
Is that so?

35
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:07,800
(Love Andante Episode 4)

36
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,333
Do you want instant noodles?

37
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,500
No thanks.

38
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,866
Who refuses instant noodles?

39
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,633
Instant food is unhealthy.

40
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,000
It makes your hands and face puffy
in the morning.

41
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:37,366
Speaking like a true brat
who was served food on a silver platter.

42
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:39,833
What did you say?

43
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,366
If you don't want to eat it, it's fine.

44
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,966
Do you want a bite?

45
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:17,900
If you insist,

46
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,466
maybe I'll eat it just for today.

47
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,266
Is the village doing well?

48
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,333
The system is stabilizing.

49
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:17,400
Do the villagers get along?

50
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,900
Yes, based on the last few months,

51
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,400
they get along peacefully
without clashing.

52
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,133
That's a relief.

53
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,066
How is Na Gyeong doing?

54
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:32,466
Her research is making good progress.

55
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:38,833
There's no issue.

56
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:43,200
Okay, keep on observing well.

57
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,900
Yes, I will,

58
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,300
Great Assistant.

59
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:47,966
He looks fine outside,

60
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,433
but he's weak inside.

61
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

62
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,266
- Woo Bin, help her.
- Hello.

63
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:17,100
- You're carrying a child. Come this way.
- Thank you.

64
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,833
Yes, good job.

65
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,900
Did you get a checkup at the clinic?

66
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,500
No, not yet.

67
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:33,200
You should get a checkup today if you can.

68
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,866
They provide supplements
to pregnant women for free.

69
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:38,400
I'm sure they also offer other benefits.

70
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,400
- I was going to go today.
- That's good.

71
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:45,266
Please take her today.

72
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:46,733
- I will.
- Okay.

73
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,533
Let's go.

74
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:23,333
My back hurts.

75
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:28,766
Did I sleep on the sofa?

76
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:33,033
She totally got me yesterday.

77
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,066
But who brought this blanket?

78
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,533
She couldn't have...

79
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:37,966
Are you going to the Olympics?

80
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:39,700
What are you talking about?

81
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,766
Comrade Na Gyeong,
you're not yourself these days.

82
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:44,466
You're distracted.

83
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,933
Don't be ridiculous.

84
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:49,666
Don't you know how sharp I am?

85
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,900
You can't lie to me.

86
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:55,333
You must have been slacking
for the last four months,

87
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,933
being observant of others.

88
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:59,266
Don't be too harsh on me.

89
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:00,866
You can keep that mouth shut.

90
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,933
Is something going on
between Mr. Piano and you?

91
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,433
Nothing's going on.

92
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:10,600
Comrade Na Gyeong,

93
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
do you and Mr. Piano like each other?

94
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,700
Are you crazy?

95
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,333
Your eyes change
when you look at Mr. Piano.

96
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,933
Don't be so nosy.

97
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,900
Comrade Na Gyeong,

98
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:31,233
don't be offended
and just tell me the truth.

99
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:37,866
Tell you what?

100
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,266
Comrade.

101
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:43,033
Do you like Mr. Piano?

102
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,433
No, I don't.

103
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:59,133
Then why do you bicker like
you're at each other's throats?

104
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:01,866
You fight like a cat and a dog
that want to kill each other.

105
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:05,100
I never asked for this much attention.

106
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,066
Comrade.

107
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:10,966
When you open your heart to someone,

108
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:13,733
you have to think carefully
and think again...

109
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:14,766
Run!

110
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,733
Where's the first aid kit?

111
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,000
Why are you running like crazy?

112
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:58,266
Like you said, I'm going to the Olympics.

113
00:13:59,166 --> 00:13:59,864
What?

114
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,133
Comrade, take it easy.

115
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:12,400
I'm leaving.

116
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,066
Isn't that Comrade Na Gyeong?

117
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,833
Why is she running like crazy?

118
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,566
I heard losing weight is the trend.

119
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:35,166
I guess Comrade Na Gyeong
is trying to lose weight, too.

120
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,766
Is that so?

121
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,966
My mother would love this.

122
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:44,566
Yes, you have to tell her I bought it.

123
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:45,933
Okay, I will.

124
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:49,800
If I use the post train
to Pyeongyang tomorrow,

125
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,533
my mother will receive it
in seven days, right?

126
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:54,533
I'm sure.

127
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,066
- Is your mother well?
- She's well.

128
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,166
Do you like Mr. Piano?

129
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:49,966
(Health Clinic)

130
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:56,166
Hello.

131
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,033
Hello.

132
00:15:58,033 --> 00:15:59,900
You're early today.

133
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,666
It must be the clear air here.

134
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,833
My eyes get wide open when the sun is up.

135
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,000
But what's all this?

136
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,733
I saw beautiful wildflowers on the way.

137
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,866
They're pretty.

138
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,866
We could call the clinic the flower shop.

139
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,300
Are these mini chrysanthemums?

140
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,033
No, this is sweet wormwood.

141
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:25,600
In Korean medicine,
it's used for fever, cold, dysentery,

142
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,066
malaria, children's seizures,
and indigestion.

143
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:30,600
Really?

144
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:39,566
Smell this.

145
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,833
This native herb is called...

146
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,066
the Korean mint.

147
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:49,633
Just like its name,
it deodorizes the air.

148
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,566
In Korean medicine,
it's called "kwakhyang."

149
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:55,966
It's used for gastrointestinal diseases
like indigestion and diarrhea.

150
00:16:55,966 --> 00:17:00,033
Its dried leaves can make tea.
It's an all-rounder herb.

151
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:04,400
What's that willowy flower there?

152
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,866
That's "chamchwi."

153
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:08,900
Chamchi?

154
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,933
It's chamchwi, a friend of gomchi.

155
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:15,600
It's fragrant and it has warm properties.

156
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,500
It's eaten as salad
since it's full of vitamins and minerals.

157
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,400
It helps the blood circulation.

158
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,366
It can be used for colds,
pharyngitis, and headaches.

159
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:27,100
When the acid inside meets calcium,

160
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,733
it's highly possible to create stones.

161
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,266
You parboil it instead of eating it raw.

162
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:32,366
I see.

163
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:35,866
What about that gomchi?

164
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:40,066
It was named "gomchi"
since bears in the forest eat it.

165
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:42,066
It's tasty and fragrant,
so you eat it raw...

166
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:44,133
or make it into a pickle.

167
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:46,200
The Korean medicine uses
the root and stem...

168
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,333
for coughs, whooping cough, asthma,

169
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,533
back pain, joint pain, or contusion.

170
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,433
I see.

171
00:17:57,533 --> 00:18:00,100
Is something on my face?

172
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,200
Yes.

173
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:07,600
For you, who is serious
about studying home remedies,

174
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,866
I'll buy morning coffee.

175
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:11,333
- Do you want it sweet?
- Yes.

176
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:54,533
Do you need...

177
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:55,800
any help?

178
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,100
The left or right side?

179
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,066
Both sides.

180
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:39,733
Is that good?

181
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:41,866
Thanks.

182
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,166
How's the baby?

183
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,700
The baby is slightly smaller
considering the number of months.

184
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,200
But you shouldn't worry too much.

185
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,533
If you eat well, sleep well,

186
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:32,600
and exercise moderately, it'll be fine.

187
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:37,233
Babies feel at ease when moms do.

188
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,633
Okay.

189
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,000
Do you take any medications
or supplements?

190
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,800
I don't exactly take such...

191
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,833
No.

192
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:01,866
I'll give you some for the baby and you.

193
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:04,266
Make sure to take them.

194
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:12,033
It'll be better
if you get regular checkups.

195
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:13,566
Okay.

196
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,366
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

197
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,266
Thank you.

198
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,100
Are you okay?

199
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:40,033
When you wake up,
have the porridge and medicine.

200
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:11,300
I must be crazy.

201
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,433
Get a hold of yourself.

202
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,100
(Comrade Gyeong Ho)

203
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,600
Where are you?

204
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,433
I'm at home.

205
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,633
Why are you still at home?

206
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:32,600
I'm going out now. Bye.

207
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:10,133
That looks good.

208
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,866
You're here.

209
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:16,333
Gyeong Ho, did you eat?

210
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,266
I'll eat later.

211
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:18,633
You should eat with us.

212
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:20,666
It's barley bibimbap. It's really good.

213
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:22,900
Okay.

214
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:24,733
- Come along.
- Okay.

215
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,133
What took you so long?

216
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:32,466
Something came up.

217
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:33,866
What came up?

218
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:36,700
What are you thinking?

219
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,400
My job is to protect you.

220
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,033
Of course, I have to ask...

221
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:43,266
- He's bedridden...
- Are you sick?

222
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:44,266
Let's go straight to the clinic...

223
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,066
Simmer down.

224
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:49,733
It's not me. It's Mr. Piano.

225
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:53,800
When you wake up,
have the porridge and medicine.

226
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,000
How was she able to make this?

227
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:26,366
It tastes like nothing.

228
00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:40,433
How can this be possible?

229
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:50,766
It's salty.

230
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:52,766
It's so salty.

231
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:38,400
This is...

232
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,933
Who is going to clean all this?

233
00:33:02,233 --> 00:33:03,333
My back hurts.

234
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:11,200
Can you lower the volume?

235
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,700
How can you play a game without sound?

236
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:17,733
This is the lowest volume.

237
00:33:17,733 --> 00:33:19,666
I can't focus because of that sound!

238
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,566
Your head is filled...

239
00:33:22,566 --> 00:33:25,166
with thoughts other than your paper.

240
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:26,666
That's why this sound is distracting.

241
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:28,133
Are you trying to instigate me?

242
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,033
Let's go home.

243
00:33:39,766 --> 00:33:43,133
When have you ever clocked out on time?

244
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,133
When you're in Peace Village,

245
00:33:47,133 --> 00:33:49,400
you have to follow the system here...

246
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,333
Just leave.

247
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:52,200
Go and enjoy your evening.

248
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:54,266
Comrade.

249
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:56,100
If something comes up,
call me on my cell phone immediately.

250
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,866
Okay, now go.

251
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,233
The watermelon this year
is sweet like honey.

252
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:24,800
It's the best
out of all the watermelons I've eaten.

253
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:28,033
We're lucky to be here
to have this precious fruit.

254
00:34:30,366 --> 00:34:32,633
Ki Nam, take some to Tong Il's family.

255
00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:36,566
Yes, it must be hard for the lady
to step outside. Give some to her.

256
00:34:36,566 --> 00:34:38,466
Yes, I'll bring some for them.

257
00:34:38,466 --> 00:34:39,833
Should I go with you?

258
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:42,233
Woo Bin, you can stay. I'll be quick.

259
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:46,166
- Did you have watermelon in the North?
- Yes, I did.

260
00:34:47,433 --> 00:34:49,166
You better be quick
since one person is missing.

261
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,166
It has so many seeds.

262
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:53,100
- Spit out the seeds.
- Did you just swear at me?

263
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:04,100
The heat patch smells bad.

264
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:15,200
(Peace Village)

265
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:39,033
What's going on?

266
00:35:40,366 --> 00:35:44,233
<i>If someone asks me where I'm from</i>

267
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:47,333
<i>I tell them I'm from Busan</i>

268
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:48,366
That's our manager.

269
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:52,233
Are you out for a stroll?

270
00:35:52,966 --> 00:35:54,233
Yes, I guess.

271
00:35:54,233 --> 00:35:55,300
I told you.

272
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,066
You get bored just staying at home.

273
00:35:57,066 --> 00:35:59,000
You should come out to meet people.

274
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,733
You can help others. How great is that?

275
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:03,800
I'm okay. I can keep myself company.

276
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,966
What?

277
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:17,400
Do you have something you want to say?

278
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,066
No, I don't.

279
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,366
Mr. Lim.

280
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,000
When you came here,

281
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,500
what did you have in your mind?

282
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,933
I've never stayed in one city
for more than seven days.

283
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,366
Why not?

284
00:36:36,366 --> 00:36:37,733
It's the concerts.

285
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,833
I feel pushed all the time.
It makes me sick.

286
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:47,300
I feel like hiding somewhere just to rest.

287
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:49,233
I'm sure.

288
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:52,466
Traveling nonstop like that
would tire your body and soul.

289
00:36:53,266 --> 00:36:54,233
Yes.

290
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:57,933
The more time passes, the emptier I feel.

291
00:36:57,933 --> 00:36:59,233
I was getting exhausted.

292
00:37:03,233 --> 00:37:04,600
Mr. Lim,

293
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,933
why do you think villagers came here?

294
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,466
Have you thought about that?

295
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,800
No.

296
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,533
Maybe they came
for the benefits that they wanted?

297
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:20,966
Mr. Lim,

298
00:37:20,966 --> 00:37:25,500
this village blossoms with new hope.

299
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,000
Some felt their lives were so dry,
being so busy without a second to breathe.

300
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,500
Some people want a fresh start.

301
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,733
(Lim Joo Hyung Piano Recital)

302
00:37:50,766 --> 00:37:53,966
Some want to hide
from the sight of others...

303
00:37:53,966 --> 00:37:56,566
to avoid being talked about by people,

304
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,833
so they came here, just like you.

305
00:38:05,266 --> 00:38:07,300
Hello, I'm Ju Hui.

306
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,366
I'm on the Myeongdong street.

307
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:18,933
Some got hurt
by their family's expectations.

308
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:20,833
They get to be free...

309
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,766
and pursue their aspirations.

310
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:27,100
But from the North,

311
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,400
some want lives that are a little better
than their current ones.

312
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,600
Wanting an environment
where their family can stay full,

313
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,966
they came here to create that.

314
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:46,100
To give a better world to their child,

315
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:49,533
a couple came with a baby inside, too.

316
00:38:55,766 --> 00:39:00,600
With a small hope of treating
whoever is sick...

317
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,466
whenever he wants, a doctor came, too.

318
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,933
Once we develop the new species,

319
00:39:08,933 --> 00:39:12,933
our people will have corn
to their hearts' content.

320
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:17,133
With more people hungry and worrying
about putting food on the table,

321
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:20,033
Na Gyeong came here...

322
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:21,833
to resolve the food shortage.

323
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:27,133
This is...

324
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:29,933
where people came with their own stories.

325
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,300
Their stories...

326
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,533
Our villagers want...

327
00:39:37,533 --> 00:39:42,066
Peace Village to be maintained smoothly.

328
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:46,066
They might be a little sensitive.

329
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:51,166
They might be a little generous, too.

330
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:53,133
Those are the people that came here.

331
00:39:54,966 --> 00:39:58,733
So try to get along together,

332
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:01,833
work at the joint farms,
and have meals with them.

333
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,666
I think it'll be nice for you
to open your heart.

334
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:13,666
What is there to ponder?

335
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:15,366
What?

336
00:40:15,366 --> 00:40:17,533
Mr. Lim, aren't you lonely?

337
00:40:18,366 --> 00:40:20,200
I've always been alone.

338
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,666
See?

339
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:25,166
You're hurt inside,

340
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:27,266
but you can't even feel it.

341
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:29,166
I can't?

342
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:38,033
Forget the Lim Joo Hyung
from outside the village.

343
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:40,666
Hang out with the people.

344
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:41,900
Mingle with them.

345
00:40:42,766 --> 00:40:44,500
It'll definitely help.

346
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:51,866
(My lovely daughter)

347
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:55,333
My gosh, I'm getting a call.
Just a moment.

348
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,500
Hi, sweetie.

349
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,866
Yes, it's me.

350
00:41:00,866 --> 00:41:02,166
I see.

351
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:03,733
Was everything good at school?

352
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:06,633
Okay.

353
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:08,266
Okay, what about Mom?

354
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:11,500
Yes, of course.

355
00:41:12,766 --> 00:41:14,466
I miss you, too.

356
00:41:15,066 --> 00:41:17,300
Okay.

357
00:41:29,766 --> 00:41:30,633
That's hot!

358
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,600
You have to cool it down first.

359
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,566
Did you have to go "michugai" like that?

360
00:41:46,566 --> 00:41:48,600
Do you need any help?

361
00:41:53,533 --> 00:41:55,033
Is that good?

362
00:41:55,033 --> 00:41:56,100
Thanks.

363
00:42:32,433 --> 00:42:34,300
- What are you doing alone?
- My goodness!

364
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:38,366
What are you doing here?

365
00:42:38,366 --> 00:42:40,766
Are you having fun,
scaring me like a burglar?

366
00:42:42,066 --> 00:42:43,166
Wait.

367
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,266
I'm sorry if I scared you,
but I have a question.

368
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,233
What is it?

369
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,433
What did you do
to make the porridge taste like that?

370
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,566
I guess it was to your liking.

371
00:42:58,866 --> 00:42:59,900
No.

372
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:02,366
It couldn't have tasted any worse.

373
00:43:02,366 --> 00:43:03,566
What?

374
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,766
I felt all better after eating it,

375
00:43:07,766 --> 00:43:09,666
so you must have put something in it.

376
00:43:11,366 --> 00:43:12,866
My gosh.

377
00:43:12,866 --> 00:43:16,700
I can tell you're still sick,
listening to your silly joke.

378
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,866
Go and rest.

379
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,900
Hey.

380
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,133
Thank you...

381
00:43:28,366 --> 00:43:31,600
for putting a blanket and wet towel on me.

382
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:36,600
Thank you for everything.

383
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:41,466
Also, I really wanted to say this.

384
00:43:43,766 --> 00:43:45,333
For showing up in front of me,

385
00:43:48,766 --> 00:43:50,066
I thank you.

386
00:43:58,566 --> 00:43:59,400
See you later.

387
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:28,433
Did she not see me?

388
00:44:33,266 --> 00:44:34,633
There's no way.

389
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:43,166
What?

390
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:44,400
Excuse me.

391
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,333
Push the car.

392
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:47,400
What?

393
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,333
The battery is dead.

394
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,900
Let's push it to the charging station.

395
00:44:55,766 --> 00:44:58,133
I'm only helping you
since I was born a nice guy.

396
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,533
Try to push stronger.

397
00:45:12,933 --> 00:45:14,433
I'm pushing it!

398
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,033
Look up there.

399
00:47:21,866 --> 00:47:24,566
(Epilogue)

400
00:47:29,566 --> 00:47:32,000
The two look so serious late at night.

401
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,966
That's not being serious.

402
00:47:34,966 --> 00:47:36,733
That's young passion.

403
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,233
- They're locking lips!
- "Locking lips?"

404
00:47:43,233 --> 00:47:45,333
Come on. They're not wrestling.

405
00:47:57,066 --> 00:47:59,333
Hey, let's go.

406
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:01,400
We should pretend
that we never saw this type of thing.

407
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,133
Let's go.

408
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,033
Blow it harder!

409
00:48:18,033 --> 00:48:19,333
Do you still feel it?

410
00:48:20,366 --> 00:48:21,900
Try to blink a few times.

411
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,166
It's still there.

412
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,533
It's out now.

413
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,633
How did you do it?

414
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,033
It was nothing special.

415
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:55,531
