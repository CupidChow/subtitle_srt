A small village
is at the end of this road.

11
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:39,866
I remember at the beginning of
that village, you can only visit...

12
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,666
once a year.

The fairytale about a lumberjack
who met his angel originated...

16
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,066
from this small village beside Lake Gamho.

17
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,300
I was there with an unforgettable woman.

(Love Andante Episode 1)

19
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,400
Since declaring the end of the war,

20
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,633
as the South and North came together...

21
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:06,166
to establish a joint village,

22
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,166
this is historically meaningful.

23
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,766
("Reunification may be possible.")

24
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:12,166
As the two nations were determined...

25
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,566
to achieve this,

26
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:17,200
we could glance at the possibility
of reunification shortly.

27
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,400
Did Peace City Village Project...

28
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,700
start with the possibility
of reunification?

29
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,466
Dreams do come true.

30
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:28,666
The people won't have to wish
for reunification for long...

31
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,400
as their wish will come true.

32
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,200
Also, the world is watching us.

33
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
After 70 years,

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,666
the South and North will live in harmony
in one village,

35
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,300
which will start friendly reunification
in the Korean Peninsula.

36
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,200
Yes, thank you.

37
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,966
We will now go to the reporter on site.

38
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:48,900

00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:51,700
(Residents start moving to Peace Village,
expecting reunification.)

40
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,533
Yes, I'm at the entrance of Peace Village.

41
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:57,466
Since declaring the end of the war,

42
00:03:57,466 --> 00:03:59,566
the South and North agreed
to establish Peace Village...

43
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:00,866
and the residents are moving in today.

44
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:05,000
People are arriving one by one.

45
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,566
Reporter Kim, what is the current mood
in the village?

46
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:19,466
It's bustling
with the village residents...

47
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:21,666
who are lightening up the place.

48
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,500
I can't believe
I'm moving into Peace Village.

49
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,066
I'm so excited.

50
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,966
The beach is stunning. It's the best.

(Boardroom of the committee
for friendly reunification of Korea)

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,200
After 70 years,
the South and North declared...

53
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,466
to live in the same village.

54
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:14,700
The whole world watched this moment.

55
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,466
(Peace Village will be run for a year
on a trial basis.)

56
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:25,000
Rewatching the moment
almost makes me choke up.

57
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,933
It's such a meaningful moment, isn't it?

58
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,233
It's hard for me to believe it, too.

59
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:33,833
Among the countless applicants
from the South and the North,

60
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,133
I heard ten were picked through AI.

61
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:39,366
What does the future hold for them?

62
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:41,933
For now,

63
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:44,766
they will be living in Peace Village...

64
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:47,900
on a trial basis for about a year.

65
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,600
If this plan is successful,

66
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,700
the plan is to invite more residents.

67
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,633
With the demarcation line as the border,

68
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:58,733
the people who led different lives
from one another...

69
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,900
will now become neighbors
with fences between them.

70
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,600
I'm excited to see
how they will embrace each other.

71

to Peace Village!)

I'm the general manager of Peace Village.

74
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,800
I'm Park Jun Mo.

75
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,833
Yes, give us a brief introduction
of Peace Village.

76
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,666
Sure.

77
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,066
Peace Village is founded
on 33,000-square-meter land...

78
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:40,333
to facilitate homes and farms
as a self-sufficient village.

79
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,933
Providing a safe, cozy living environment
to the residents is...

80
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:45,866
Comrade Jun Mo, we have to...

81
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:47,600
Who is this?

82
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,300
This is Lee Jang Su,
the manager from the North.

83
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,233
Yes.

84
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,666
Please stop calling me "comrade."

85
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,833
Okay.

86
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,200
- Comrade Jun Mo.
- Comrade...

87
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,266
Where was I?

88
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:02,833
- It was on "cozy living environment."
- Yes.

89
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:06,133
Providing a cozy living environment...

90
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,466
and making a peaceful village are...

91
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:10,966
the foremost important purposes.

92
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,466
The Peace Village residents turned
from enemies to comrades.

93
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:20,200
Now they are reliable neighbors...

94
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,033
who will farm and rehabilitate together...

95
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:26,100
while promoting an environment
of self-sufficiency.

96
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,966
This is Kim Min Sun
reporting from Peace Village.

97
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:35,200
The project started,
with a focus on reunification, right?

98
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,000
Yes, that's right.

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,833
That's why the success
of the village is crucial.

100
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,566
Until the day the South and North unite!

101
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,833
I'm sure some of our
viewers would hope to...

102
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,600
be able to join Peace Village.

103
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,466
Hopefully,
the project will end successfully...

104
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:56,766
and bring a positive shift
to the South-North relations.

105
00:07:57,966 --> 00:08:00,166
It's a lot of money
to spend on a single village,

106
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,233
but I'm excited since its success
will bring an earlier reunification.

107
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,900
What would you say
to your family moving to Peace Village?

108
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:10,200
You're representing South Korea.

109
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,666
Be proud, eat well, and take care.

110
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,766
Are you going to be okay?

111
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:27,100
Why?

112
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,866
Just about everything bothers you.

113
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:32,266
Can you stand living out here
in the countryside?

114
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:34,933
It's a feast of small flies, big flies,
grasshoppers, mosquitoes, and centipedes.

115
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:37,300
The smell of cow dung and dogs barking
also comes standard with it.

116
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:40,100
Just give me my luggage.

117
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,500
It's just that I'm seriously worried.

118
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,933
Is this the right solution?

119
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:49,933
Keeping you here in the middle
of nowhere for a year is...

120
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:53,000
so cruel to your fans across the world...

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,366
as it is to you.

122
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:56,466
Take care.

123
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:59,466
Joo Hyung!

124
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:00,766
- Mr. Lim Joo Hyung!
- Joo Hyung!

125
00:09:00,766 --> 00:09:01,900
- Excuse me, Mr. Lim Joo Hyung!
- Mr. Lim Joo Hyung!

126
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,300
We're sorry! He won't be doing interviews!

127
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,100
Hurry inside.

128
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:10,266
- Mr. Lim!
- Mr. Lim!

129
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:12,033
- Take his photos!
- Mr. Lim!

130
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:21,133
- Mr. Lim!
- Mr. Lim!

131
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,866
Salute. Welcome to Peace Village.

132
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,400
I'd like to see your identification.

133
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,933
Can I have your ID?

134
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:33,433
I need IDs for the movers, too.

135
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,766
(Resident, male, Lim Joo Hyung)

136
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:53,366
Thank you.

137
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:58,000
The movers must leave before 3 p.m.

138
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,566
What about our IDs?

139
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,033
As you have been informed,

140
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,666
I'll give it back to you
after you drive out.

141
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,633
You must leave the village before 3 p.m.

142
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:09,600
They run a tight ship.

143
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,233
We understand.

144
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:16,500
(Peace Village)

145
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:36,333
(North entrance to Peace Village)

146
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,833
What's going on here?

147
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,900
What's going on? They're not here yet?

148
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:48,966
- I guess not.
- What?

149
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:51,200
They told me they left a while ago.

150
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,366
I don't what happened.

151
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:54,600
For crying out loud.

152
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:39,633
Please be careful with that.

153
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:41,233
You'll break the coffee dripper inside.

154
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:43,166
Okay.

155
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,733
You can hang that
in the middle of the living room wall.

156
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,266
Right here?

157
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:16,300
Yes.

158
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:19,900
You'll hang your photo here?

159
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,800
Yes. Make sure to get the right angle.

160
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:14,733
(Daffodil)

161
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,900
You can't drop it down like that!

162
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,600
Is it broken?

163
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,033
It was a tiny bump.

164
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,733
Tiny?

165
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:33,000
This piano is like a living thing.

166
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,566
A tiny scratch on its leg
changes the sound.

167
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,200
You don't know what you're talking about!

168
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,466
Sure thing.

169
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:43,266
Ignorant people like us wouldn't know.

170
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,766
Let's go.

171
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:51,133
What are you doing?
You have to move the piano inside.

172
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,800
We're too ignorant to move the piano.

173
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,200
Call someone who is educated.

174
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,300
Are you really leaving?

175
00:13:58,133 --> 00:13:59,700
It's almost 3 p.m. We have to leave.

176
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,600
Bring this inside before you go.

177
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,100
I can't pay you otherwise.

178
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,200
We've already been paid
since we're doing good for the nation.

179
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:12,433
You can't go.

180
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:14,066
Go.

181
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:29,566
Hey!

182
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,466
You can't leave this here!

183
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,300
This is nuts.

184
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,733
I didn't expect to hear the piano
out here in the countryside.

185
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,133
I hear piano music.

186
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:08,900
Me, too.

187
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:14,500
I heard a famous pianist
from the South moved in.

188
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,733
I guess it's him.

189
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,866
It sounds so classy.

190
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,233
I almost forgot.

191
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:31,200
It's about the cell phones
to be used in the village.

192
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,366
All the residents have one, right?

193
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:34,933
Say no more. It's been done.

194
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,566
The internet of the South is so fast.

195
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,166
Jang Su.

196
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,933
It's the speed from the temporary station.

197
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:47,300
Don't be too impressed.

198
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:51,700
If we reunite, there will come a day
for the North Koreans to feel...

199
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,833
the South's formidable
internet speed, right?

200
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,166
It's so fast that you won't feel a thing.

201
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:58,066
Anyway...

202
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,633
(The file has been sent successfully.)

203
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:33,433
What's the problem?

204
00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:36,033
The engine is overheated.

205
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,800
My goodness! You're Lim Joo Hyung, right?

206
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,800
You've been called a piano prodigy
since you were in school.

207
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,900
In 2015, you became
the first Korean to win...

208
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,266
the International Chopin
Piano Competition.

209
00:18:59,266 --> 00:19:01,333
After winning, you traveled the world
for seven years...

210
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,433
and became the pianist
with the most performances.

211
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,800
You must be a fan.

212
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,866
Do you want an autograph?

213
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:08,966
No, I'm okay.

214
00:19:08,966 --> 00:19:10,166
I'm Kim Ju Hui.

215
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,833
I moved behind you.

216
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,633
But what brings you all the way here?

217
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,333
I mean,

218
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:25,333
others came for the house and benefits,

219
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:29,033
but you wouldn't need any of those,
so why would you come here?

220
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,000
I can't seem to ignore my curiosity.

221
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,166
I just came to rest.

222
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,933
I see. You must be exhausted.

223
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,000
Hold on! Is this the piano?

224
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,066
Don't touch it without asking.

225
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,600
By any chance, if you have time,

226
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,000
teach me the piano.

227
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,600
I don't give lessons.

228
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,766
You don't teach.

229
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:53,500
Then I can come over sometimes, right?

230
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:56,400
He's cool.

231
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,966
Does anyone have a cell phone?

232
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,333
Here you go. Use this.

233
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:11,166
Is this
the Reunification Promotion Agency?

234
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,266
The bus has stopped.

235
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:15,433
We're at...

236
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:20,700
about 10km away from the DMZ
in the direction of Goseong.

237
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,533
We'll send a car, so wait there.

238
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:24,133
Yes, sir.

239
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,133
They want us to wait for a car.

240
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:33,266
But it'll take some time.

241
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,600
We're late as it is.
How long do we have to wait?

242
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,033
I wouldn't know for sure.

243
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,100
How much further do we have to go?

244
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,200
We'll reach the entrance in about 10km.

245
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,666
Then let's go.

246
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,566
Bring only the necessities.

247
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,433
Are we walking?

248
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:05,600
Then should we run?

249
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,900
It'll be chilly after the sunset.

250
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,300
Hurry up.

251
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:55,933
For crying out loud.

252
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:57,766
Are things already ruined from the start?

253
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,700
No way. It's not.

254
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,233
What is wrong with you people?

255
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,400
Nothing ever gets done on the dot.

256
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,733
Instead of the girl we invited,

257
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:10,300
we might see a missile coming instead.

258
00:22:12,266 --> 00:22:14,066
Excuse me.

259
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,000
Why can't you trust our people's republic?

260
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,166
That will never happen.

261
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:23,633
We keep our words
in our people's republic.

262
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:27,666
Comrade, I just can't seem to buy that.

263
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:29,233
My goodness.

264
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,166
Look!

265
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,533
Over there.

266
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:39,600
What?

267
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,666
Why are you walking here?

268
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,366
The bus broke down. We had to walk.

269
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,166
Please give that to me.

270
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:02,533
It's fine.

271
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:04,266
Just bring the others to their homes.

272
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:06,133
Yes, I will do that.

273
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:07,866
Come this way.

274
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:30,366
It's me. Report to the higher-ups
that she just arrived.

275
00:23:30,866 --> 00:23:31,900
Yes.

276
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,866
My feet are all puffy.

277
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,266
No one asked you to come along.

278
00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:51,866
Do you think I came
to protect my fair lady?

279
00:23:51,866 --> 00:23:55,566
It was the Great Assistant's order
to protect his precious daughter.

280
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:56,400
I'm not a child.

281
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,733
Comrade.

282
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:01,433
Someone else would have come
even if I hadn't.

283
00:24:01,433 --> 00:24:02,866
Don't you think I'm a safe choice?

284
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,900
Do you think I'm a fool?

285
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,333
If you stay put for a year here,

286
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:10,600
you'll get to live in Pyeongyang
and have preferential rights to rations.

287
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,900
I know you licked my father's boots.

288
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:17,766
If it weren't for the benefits,

289
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:20,433
why would I protect someone
so "kkakkeun" like you?

290
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:21,300
(Kkakkeun, A North Korean expression
for a consistently frigid person)

291
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,166
You can go now.

292
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:27,233
Have a good night's rest then.

293
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,200
Bye.

294
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,366
What's this?

295
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,166
(Daffodil)

296
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,466
Ask him what happened.

297
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,200
What's with your eye?

298
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,533
He attacked me first.

299
00:26:52,633 --> 00:26:54,733
An ear for an ear, an eye for an eye!

300
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,266
Why did you stand like a ghost
in a stranger's home?

301
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:22,166
It's my home!

302
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:24,833
What are you talking about?
That's my home!

303
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:26,400
Both of you please calm down.

304
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,933
- Yes.
- Let's see.

305
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:31,766
- It shouldn't be a big deal.
- Right.

306
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:37,866
Mr. Lim...

307
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:39,566
(Lim Joo Hyung, Ha Na Gyeong, Choi Ji Hun)

308
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:49,933
(Lim Joo Hyung, Ha Na Gyeong, Married)

309
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,600
(Married)

310
00:27:58,966 --> 00:28:00,233
Why does it say...

311
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:04,033
Well...

312
00:28:09,466 --> 00:28:13,633
One moment, please.
Let us check something quickly.

313
00:28:29,966 --> 00:28:31,433
(Health clinic)

314
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:42,566
What do we do about this?

315
00:28:42,566 --> 00:28:45,566
She's the daughter of the Great Assistant
of the Military Security Command.

316
00:28:45,566 --> 00:28:47,000
- If they find out...
- Be quiet.

317
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,866
This will cause chaos.

318
00:28:49,766 --> 00:28:52,333
Shouldn't we report this
to the higher-ups...

319
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,533
and find a solution?

320
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:55,800
I know.

321
00:28:59,566 --> 00:29:01,500
Hey, Jang Su.

322
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,366
Yes?

323
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,333
If this gets out,

324
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,933
you and I might be blamed...

325
00:29:07,966 --> 00:29:09,200
and have to step down.

326
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,666
What?

327
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,700
If that happens,

328
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,100
your chance to live in Pyeongyang
will go out the window.

329
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,100
What was that again?

330
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,533
The right to rations?

331
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:19,633
You'll lose all that, too.

332
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,933
That can't happen.

333
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:25,200
I'm the only hope
for my wife and my kids at home.

334
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:33,766
- Jang Su.
- Yes?

335
00:29:33,766 --> 00:29:35,700
You need to start focusing now...

336
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,733
and just follow my lead, okay?

337
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:39,500
What do you have in mind?

338
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:41,600
Look here.

339
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,400
Try to imagine it.

340
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:50,500
Due to an accidental error, a man
and a woman live in the same house.

341
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,600
Then they look at each other...

342
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,166
and fall in love.

343
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,200
What do you think?

344
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,133
Can't you just picture it?

345
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:05,033
Yes, I can picture it.

346
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:06,066
Right?

347
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,933
- Of me being shot to death...
- Shot to death...

348
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:12,866
Hey, why are you so pessimistic?

349
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,033
Haven't you watched,
"Crash Landing On You?"

350
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:17,900
I did watch it.

351
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,133
That's what I mean.

352
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:21,066
Let me see that.

353
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:23,666
What we should do is...

354
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:26,133
make the two come together.

355
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:28,466
- To do that,
- You're right.

356
00:30:28,466 --> 00:30:30,700
- we must put them together.
- That's right.

357
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:48,000
What happened?

358
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,033
Did you check the system?

359
00:30:49,033 --> 00:30:51,566
Yes, we checked,

360
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:57,600
but we don't have a solution
at the moment.

361
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,233
No.

362
00:30:58,866 --> 00:31:01,266
To be honest,

363
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:02,300
there's no place left.

364
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,100
- What?
- What?

365
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,766
An error occurred
while grouping the residents.

366
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:13,033
All the remaining houses have been filled.

367
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:16,133
What ridiculous nonsense is this?

368
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,966
How can I live with a fully grown man?

369
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,033
Look who's talking.

370
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:22,566
Seeing her roundhouse kick,

371
00:31:22,566 --> 00:31:24,033
I think she has to be a trained spy.

372
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:25,966
- She'll poison me while I sleep...
- Excuse me!

373
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:31,033
- Hold on, Both of you, please calm down.
- Yes.

374
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:33,700
Frankly,

375
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,900
it is true that this is our mistake.

376
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,166
But what if you see this
in a different light?

377
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,100
Like how?

378
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:46,366
You two represent the South and North.

379
00:31:46,366 --> 00:31:49,500
If you let go and open your hearts,

380
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,466
this will become the first step
of the South and North's reunification.

381
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:56,866
But if you report this to the higher-ups,

382
00:31:57,933 --> 00:32:00,233
Peace Village Project might...

383
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:02,266
go back to square one.

384
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:06,166
Do you want that?

385
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,233
Instead of the ingenious pianist,

386
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:17,200
you'll be known as a man who turned
the clock backward for the two Koreas.

387
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,633
Do you want that?

388
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:23,666
You don't have to be so extreme.

389
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:25,500
Seriously...

390
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:30,100
Then about my piano in the front yard,

391
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,866
please move that inside the house.

392
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:37,833
- Sure.
- We'll do that right now.

393
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:39,600
- Yes.
- We will.

394
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,233
And about this woman hitting me,

395
00:32:43,233 --> 00:32:46,233
I'll accept this situation
if she sincerely apologizes.

396
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:48,633
Excuse me.

397
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,166
Apologize?

398
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:51,500
Apologize for what?

399
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:55,800
Also, don't speak for me
because I won't go with this!

400
00:33:15,566 --> 00:33:18,900
(Pyeongyang)

401
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,366
Before being my daughter,

402
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:33,966
you are representing
the party and the people.

403
00:33:35,566 --> 00:33:36,633
Behave yourself accordingly.

404
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,333
Don't worry.

405
00:33:40,233 --> 00:33:43,133
Also, after a year,

406
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:44,900
you must keep your promise.

407
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:49,966
If things go wrong, you'll be responsible.

408
00:33:49,966 --> 00:33:50,966
Got it?

409
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:53,233
Yes, sir!

410
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,000
Father.

411
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:58,266
Speak.

412
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:01,900
"Take care."

413
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,600
Can't you just say that?

414
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,066
Fine.

415
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,266
How hard can it be to live with him?

416
00:34:37,766 --> 00:34:39,733
For the party and the people,

417
00:34:39,733 --> 00:34:41,333
I'm more than happy to make sacrifices.

418
00:34:42,366 --> 00:34:45,466
Comrade Na Gyeong,
we can't thank you enough.

419
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:48,333
You've made the right choice.

420
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:53,133
Excuse me.

421
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,133
Aren't you going to apologize to me?

422
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:04,400
About your black eye...

423
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:09,533
I'm sorry for making it that way.

424
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,833
Was that an apology?

425
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,500
Why did she have to say it like that?

426
00:35:26,566 --> 00:35:28,033
Where's the master room?

427
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,866
What an entitled brat.

428
00:36:22,866 --> 00:36:25,900
He's been all over the world,
yet he's a greedy pig.

429
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,700
How dare he take the master room?

430
00:36:37,966 --> 00:36:39,666
I don't see any clots...

431
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:40,900
or other issues.

432
00:36:43,866 --> 00:36:45,466
I can't seem to focus my sight.

433
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,133
One second.

434
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,133
Does that hurt?

435
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,900
Were you hit by someone?

436
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,600
No, I fell.

437
00:36:59,366 --> 00:37:02,366
How did you get a black eye by falling?

438
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:06,133
Shouldn't I go to a bigger hospital?

439
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:07,600
It was such a big blow.

440
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:11,400
Usually, big blows hurt.

441
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,333
I wasn't hit! I fell!

442
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,366
Isn't that a crack?

443
00:37:17,366 --> 00:37:18,266
It's fine.

444
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:48,733
Wait, this isn't it.

445
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,300
So is this how it's going to be?

446
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:06,366
No way. It can't be.

447
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,033
What are you doing?

448
00:39:33,933 --> 00:39:35,266
Well...

449
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,800
What is it?

450
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:43,733
You know,

451
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:45,366
this is my room.

452
00:39:45,366 --> 00:39:47,266
You didn't even say a word.

453
00:39:47,266 --> 00:39:49,300
It's rude to swap rooms this way.

454
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:53,666
And you're so polite
that you touch other people's stuff?

455
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:56,633
Well, that's...

456
00:39:57,933 --> 00:39:59,233
Forget it. Just come out.

457
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:08,366
I have to change.

458
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:12,266
Be polite and leave.

459
00:40:22,466 --> 00:40:25,333
This is crazy.

460
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:26,966
I don't even have a bed.

461
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:30,900
Sleeping in a new place
makes me toss and turn.

462
00:40:42,266 --> 00:40:43,533
One lamb.

463
00:40:45,466 --> 00:40:47,066
Two lambs.

464
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,400
Lambs...

465
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:43,733
Why would you embarrass yourself
by taking off your shirt?

466
00:41:45,533 --> 00:41:47,366
South Korean boys are weak.

467
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:51,033
I want to show them how manly the men
of our people's republic are.

468
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:54,166
How pointless.

469
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,933
Will you be okay?

470
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:03,800
With what?

471
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,333
About that guy.

472
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:09,066
He managed to bring the piano here.

473
00:42:09,066 --> 00:42:10,700
He doesn't seem typical.

474
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:12,966
Will you be okay?

475
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:15,333
You can mind your own business.

476
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,666
How can I do that?

477
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:18,433
My business is protecting you.

478
00:42:18,966 --> 00:42:20,300
You won't have much to do.

479
00:42:23,466 --> 00:42:26,933
But don't we need to report this
to the party?

480
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,566
Hello!

481
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:34,266
It's the second day in Peace Village.

482
00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:37,100
I met two North Korean residents
during my morning walk.

483
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,833
Wave at me, please!

484
00:42:46,766 --> 00:42:47,933
Peace!

485
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,233
Comrade Gyeong Ho, aren't you coming?

486
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:53,966
I'm coming.

487
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:01,100
How cool.

488
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,333
My lower back hurts. My upper back hurts.

489
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:16,766
If I don't sleep on the bed,
I'll break my back at this rate.

490
00:43:16,766 --> 00:43:20,200
What man has such a weak back?

491
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:22,033
Excuse me.

492
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:24,000
This is all because of you!

493
00:43:35,933 --> 00:43:37,700
She's really pushing it.

494
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,433
That scared me.

495
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:44,533
Comrade Joo Hyung, are you awake?

496
00:43:45,033 --> 00:43:48,333
I came to bring in the piano.

497
00:43:58,533 --> 00:43:59,633
A little to the left.

498
00:44:03,366 --> 00:44:04,133
No, you went too far.

499
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:06,933
Go about 12cm to the left.

500
00:44:06,933 --> 00:44:09,066
Twelve...

501
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:10,400
No.

502
00:44:10,966 --> 00:44:13,300
Move it about 5cm this way.

503
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,433
Five centimeters...

504
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:21,200
That's good. Put it down.

505
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,266
Yes.

506
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,233
Are we good?

507
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,433
One second.

508
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:18,400
Come on.

509
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,100
What's going on? Are we done or what?

510
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,966
It seems just a bit off...

511
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,200
but it's okay enough for what it is.

512
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:45,566
We did it!

513
00:45:46,866 --> 00:45:48,833
Attention, Peace Village residents!

514
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,866
(Peace Village General Manager
Park Jun Mo)

515
00:45:59,866 --> 00:46:03,833
To all the residents
who moved into Peace Village,

516
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:05,100
we welcome you.

517
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,133
It's just that...

518
00:46:07,133 --> 00:46:10,700
we have a welcoming party tonight
to celebrate your moving in.

519
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,166
- We'll have a meet and greet.
- Hello.

520
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:14,700
Hello.

521
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,866
It'll be held in the front yard...

522
00:46:17,866 --> 00:46:20,766
of the world-famous pianist,
Mr. Lim Joo Hyung.

523
00:46:20,766 --> 00:46:23,066
It starts at 5 p.m.

524
00:46:23,066 --> 00:46:26,666
Every single one of you must come.

525
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:28,933
What's this nonsense?

526
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:31,866
We have good food, sweets,

527
00:46:31,866 --> 00:46:34,900
and a small amount of alcohol as well.

528
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:38,400
You can show up casually,
but if you can gather on time,

529
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,833
we would appreciate it.

530
00:46:44,133 --> 00:46:45,433
Do we have a celebration today?

531
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:48,066
Also,

532
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:51,800
Mr. Lim Joo Hyung from the South
will play the piano.

533
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:57,900
Ms. Ha Na Gyeong from the North
will play the violin.

534
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:02,733
Every single one of you must come.

535
00:47:02,733 --> 00:47:03,966
Thank you.

536
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:11,500
Then don't we have to
bring out the piano again?

537
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:15,866
We barely got it inside, too.
This is like dog training.

538
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,533
Who said you can throw a party here?

539
00:47:18,533 --> 00:47:20,600
Play the piano? Really?

540
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,100
Seriously...

541
00:47:29,866 --> 00:47:31,266
Woo Bin.

542
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:34,066
Mark the location of the piano legs.

543
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,333
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

544
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:37,966
We have to move this again.

545
00:47:43,066 --> 00:47:45,100
There's a party today,

546
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,100
so I'm picking out clothes for the TPO.

547
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,433
Which one would look good?

548
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:53,400
The first one.

549
00:47:54,366 --> 00:47:55,433
The second one.

550
00:47:58,366 --> 00:48:00,933
They're both pretty.
Should I take a look at others, too?

551
00:48:08,966 --> 00:48:09,966
Mr. Park.

552
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,433
What are you doing?

553
00:48:12,433 --> 00:48:15,033
You didn't discuss the party with me.

554
00:48:15,033 --> 00:48:17,566
Why did you announce that
I'll play the piano?

555
00:48:17,566 --> 00:48:18,733
Are we in a communist country here?

556
00:48:18,733 --> 00:48:21,033
No, it's not that...

557
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,800
Our people's republic
doesn't do things this way.

558
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,500
Is this how things are handled
in the South?

559
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,233
You don't discuss anything
or ask for an opinion.

560
00:48:31,466 --> 00:48:34,900
This one-way announcement is unethical!

561
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,700
She's right. This is unethical.

562
00:48:40,566 --> 00:48:44,066
(Epilogue
MOU Peace Village Project)

563
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,033
- Brush it off!
- What?

564
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:10,600
Brush off the keyboard!

565
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,533
Brush it off!

566
00:49:11,533 --> 00:49:13,400
- Yes, brush it off.
- I brushed it off.

567
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,433
I did it.

568
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,066
(Do you want to register a spouse?)

569
00:49:16,066 --> 00:49:16,666
(The registration is complete.)

570
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:21,233
(Lim Joo Hyung and Ha Na Gyeong
are registered as married.)

571
00:49:22,101 --> 00:49:24,101
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
