(This series was produced
with the support of MCST, KOCCA,)

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,900
(Gangwon-do Province,
and Goseong-gun County.)

3
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:15,533
Where's Mr. Piano?

4
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:16,600
Let's go.

5
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:19,133
What will you do?

6
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:20,733
What do you think?

7
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:22,200
We need to send him out.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,533
Get ready for tonight.

9
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:26,466
Why are you asking me to do it?

10
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,233
Then should I do it?

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,566
I'll just do it then.

12
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,333
Sit down.

13
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,533
Joo Hyung, I have to go to the bathroom.

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,033
(Don't Answer)

15
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,533
Did you meet with Joo Hyung?

16
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:30,933
Sir, I did meet him...

17
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:32,633
Then drag him out of there right now.

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,433
But he has no intention of leaving here.

19
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:37,866
You'll have to kidnap him.

20
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:38,666
Kidnap Joo Hyung?

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,866
Me?

22
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:42,966
Sir, you have to reasonable.

23
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:45,033
There is no choice.

24
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:49,533
Bring him out tonight,
no matter what happens.

25
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:51,000
It has to be tonight.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,666
I'm counting on you.

27
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:53,700
It has to be tonight.

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,100
But sir, you have to reasonable...

29
00:01:58,766 --> 00:01:59,900
Darn it.

30
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,366
Come out.

31
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:06,633
Okay, I'll be right out.

32
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:25,866
(Love Andante Episode 6)

33
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:37,266
Chan Yeong, did you talk to Mr. Choi?

34
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:40,633
Yes, I can explain...

35
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:43,500
You were so loud
that I couldn't help but listen!

36
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,533
I heard everything.

37
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:46,766
I see...

38
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,700
So what did he say?

39
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,466
He told me to bring you back,
no matter what.

40
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,566
If I don't, his business will go down.

41
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,866
He told me to just stay here
if I can't bring you.

42
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,833
What kind of village do you think this is?

43
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:14,100
I think it's about reunification...

44
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,766
You have no idea, right?

45
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:20,366
But you know I can't go in and out
by my own free will, right?

46
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:24,066
Because of you,

47
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:27,533
if other's lives and mine are ruined,
can you take responsibility?

48
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:31,866
No, I can't take responsibility.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,133
So you have to leave here tonight,
no matter what.

50
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,200
But what about Mr. Choi?

51
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,133
What about you? And his business?

52
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,533
If you had thought of me and his business,

53
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:45,700
you shouldn't have come here!

54
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,333
Joo Hyung, I didn't want to come either,

55
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,833
but Mr. Choi...

56
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,966
Yes, I know.

57
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,966
I can only resolve this
only if you leave here.

58
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,733
You understand, right?

59
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,400
Joo Hyung!

60
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,933
Take a shower. You smell.

61
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Okay.

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,833
The bathroom...

63
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,100
Everything is fine, right?

64
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,500
It's fine for now.

65
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,800
If something comes up, call me right away.

66
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,533
Where have you been?

67
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,233
I submitted a report.

68
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:18,633
Mr. Piano? Are you in?

69
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,133
Did you report to the party?

70
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,500
I did.

71
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,266
- Comrade!
- Don't worry.

72
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,766
I didn't report your love affair.

73
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:32,400
What are you talking about?

74
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,566
What's going on?

75
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:40,666
Sir,

76
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,766
you said you were interested
in the Reunification Fund before.

77
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:45,200
You asked me to plan an investment.

78
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,166
Yes, about that, for next time...

79
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,100
I actually have time now.

80
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:54,200
I'm a little busy now.

81
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:58,066
So you were about to take a shower.

82
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:58,933
What?

83
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:01,800
Yes.

84
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,966
Let's take a rain check.

85
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:05,566
I had no idea.

86
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,433
Should I wait out here?

87
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,233
No. You can leave.

88
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:10,333
I'll go to you later.

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,500
Okay then.

90
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,766
I'll visit you again later.

91
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,000
I thought I got caught.

92
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,866
That scared me.

93
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,133
Hello?

94
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:07,900
- Joo Hyung.
- Where are you?

95
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:09,666
Why are you using a foreign number?

96
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,733
Joo Hyung.

97
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:14,800
I was going to deal with Daniel
in person, but...

98
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,633
You tried but couldn't?

99
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:19,300
Is that why you sent Chan Yeong to get me?

100
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,300
Are you out of your mind?

101
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:25,933
Joo Hyung, the penalty
is 50 times the contract.

102
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:28,233
After reimbursing your canceled shows,

103
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:30,433
I'm about to go out of business.

104
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:33,233
I didn't have a choice.

105
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:35,966
But this still isn't right.

106
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,433
Joo Hyung, please save me, will you?

107
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:42,700
No, we should survive together.
Please help me.

108
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:49,666
Tell Daniel you'll do a charity show
next spring and come back.

109
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,866
They can set the date.

110
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:53,333
Okay? Bye.

111
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,600
Mr. Lim Joo Hyung!

112
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,400
Mr. Piano, are you in?

113
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,933
Joo Hyung!

114
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,366
Don't you hear noise from inside?

115
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:18,300
(Kang Byul Li
Peace Village recycling expert)

116
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,200
What noise?

117
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,000
Is anyone in?

118
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,966
Ms. Ha Na Gyeong?

119
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,300
Joo Hyung, I need conditioner.

120
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:32,933
Do not come out.

121
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:33,800
Why not?

122
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,300
Don't even breathe, okay?

123
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,766
Mr. Piano, are you in?

124
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,700
Ms. Ha Na Gyeong?

125
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,033
It's the harvesting season.
Everyone must be at the farm.

126
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:01,500
Let's go to the farm.

127
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,566
- Should we?
- Yes.

128
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,566
Wait.

129
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:06,400
What is it?

130
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:10,400
It's...

131
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:17,733
You see...

132
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:21,300
We brought toilet paper
made with recycled water packs...

133
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,966
and flower pots.

134
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,533
You look uncomfortable.

135
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,100
- I'm comfortable.
- What?

136
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,200
Ms. Ha asked for replacements. Is she in?

137
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,233
She's at the lab.

138
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:41,433
I mean, she's at work.

139
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:42,900
I see.

140
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,433
Then can you give these to her?

141
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:47,733
Here you go.

142
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,700
You can leave them here.

143
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:52,400
I'll bring them inside later.

144
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:58,166
By the way...

145
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:01,266
- Is something wrong, Mr. Lim?
- No.

146
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,333
I just want to rest.

147
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:06,866
Well...

148
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,600
Let's go.

149
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,266
Get some rest.

150
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,066
Yes, get some rest.

151
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:32,700
I thought she said no one would come.

152
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,666
Did they leave? Can I come out?

153
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,000
Come out. They left.

154
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,900
I must have been too anxious. I'm hungry.

155
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:54,666
We have food in the kitchen.
Help yourself.

156
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,833
Is everything okay?

157
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:14,666
Yes, for now.

158
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,533
I'll be home soon.

159
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:45,700
Joo Hyung,

160
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,300
I'm asking since I'm getting a feeling.

161
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,000
What?

162
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:55,433
Do we have to prepare for a scandal?

163
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,633
Don't be presumptuous.

164
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,733
The noodles will get soggy. Eat up.

165
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:16,566
What are you looking at?

166
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:19,933
Comrade, you're too interested in me.

167
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,966
My job is guarding you.

168
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:25,100
Isn't that obvious?

169
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:28,200
I guess you can't help it.

170
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,600
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,600
It's fine as long as you know.

172
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,366
What about Mr. Choi?

173
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,233
I talked to him.

174
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:06,300
It'll be fine.

175
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,733
Okay.

176
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:13,033
Eat up.

177
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,800
Get ready as I told you.

178
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:31,533
If we get caught,
we might really end up revolutionized.

179
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:34,133
Only when you get involved...

180
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:36,700
will this be resolved smoothly.

181
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,200
You know that, too.

182
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,833
I understand.

183
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,266
At least send him on time.

184
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:00,266
I can't believe this.

185
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:33,933
The stars are falling.

186
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,066
This is nice.

187
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,500
Did I see something?

188
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,600
I think I saw a ghost...

189
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,333
Is that how hard I've been working?

190
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:58,833
I'm doing a good job.

191
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,400
It's almost time. Why isn't he out?

192
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,033
What took you so long?

193
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,233
None of the clothes fit me.

194
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:40,400
Be quiet and just follow me closely.

195
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,600
If we get caught, we all die.

196
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:49,200
Did you serve in the military?

197
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,000
Of course.

198
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,700
Then you must have done
the disguise drill.

199
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,800
Just think of this as a drill
and follow me closely.

200
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,633
A disguise drill?

201
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:58,300
- You mean camouflage...
- Lower your voice.

202
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,400
Camouflage drill.

203
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:02,466
Say no more and follow me.

204
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:31,966
Don't be anxious and sit down.

205
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,066
Do you want warm tea?

206
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:36,666
No, I'm fine.

207
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:40,166
I hope they left safely.

208
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:47,533
They must be around the entry by now.

209
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,100
If you walk 1km straight from here,

210
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,500
it'll be the path from where you came.

211
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,366
Go.

212
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:29,233
- You're not coming with me?
- Why would I?

213
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:31,066
But I'm scared.

214
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:33,166
I can't believe this.

215
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,600
Where was that courage
when you came in here?

216
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,600
Go now.

217
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,800
The patrol will start now.
You have to be quick.

218
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,866
But it's cold and dark, so I'm scared.

219
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,400
If you're scared, you shouldn't have come.

220
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,300
You caused this mess
and now you're scared.

221
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:02,533
Hurry up. Go now.

222
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,900
Are you anxious?

223
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,300
Well...

224
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:33,066
Trust Comrade Gyeong Ho.

225
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,933
They're caught for sure.

226
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:47,433
This is bad.

227
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,300
We still don't know. Let's check.

228
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:01,600
Joo Hyung, look at me.

229
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,333
The management said nothing yet.

230
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,700
Let's give it time.

231
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,266
What's this?

232
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,600
Peace Village villagers,
I have an announcement.

233
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,433
Peace Village villagers,

234
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:48,933
we have an emergency.
I apologize for the announcement.

235
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:52,266
Tong Il's mother is in labor.

236
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:58,100
Doctors at the clinic,
if you can rush her home,

237
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,300
we would greatly appreciate it.

238
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,300
Again, I have an announcement.

239
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,133
Tong Il's mother is in labor.

240
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:08,133
So for the doctors,

241
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:11,166
we would greatly appreciate it
if you could rush to Tong Il's home.

242
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,800
Also, for the villagers,

243
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,700
if you can come and help out,
we would greatly appreciate it.

244
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,100
Are you okay?

245
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,466
What do we do?

246
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:31,000
What should we do?

247
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:44,466
What should we do?

248
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,066
We have to carry her.

249
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,233
What?

250
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,366
Let's get up.

251
00:20:57,266 --> 00:21:00,600
We're going to the clinic,
so please bear with us.

252
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:06,266
What are you doing?

253
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,766
Come and help her!

254
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:15,366
Ma'am!

255
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,566
Ma'am!

256
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,566
- We're here!
- Just a moment!

257
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:24,733
Honey...

258
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,333
Dr. Gu, her water broke.

259
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,666
What about the cervix?

260
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,766
Hold on.

261
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,200
We have to rush to the clinic.

262
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,733
Let's help her together.

263
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:39,600
Be careful.

264
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:43,433
Help us.

265
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:45,433
Be careful.

266
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,300
It's okay.

267
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,033
We'll lift. One, two, three.

268
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,333
We have to hurry. It's okay.

269
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,400
Breathe.

270
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:05,266
This is big news!

271
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:06,633
Isn't it so touching?

272
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:08,566
A baby is born in our village.

273
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:10,933
I hope our countries reunite...

274
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:13,166
on Tong Il's birthday, right?

275
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,333
Want to go together...

276
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,566
to the clinic...

277
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,366
Come with me. Let's go!

278
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,700
Did you send him off well?

279
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,200
I can confirm that he left safely.

280
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:39,400
Thank you.

281
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,366
I owe you for this.

282
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:51,366
We take this to our graves.

283
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,233
Yes, don't worry.

284
00:22:54,966 --> 00:22:55,666
You may go.

285
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,566
Are you sick?

286
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:31,000
I might have been more nervous
than I thought.

287
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,233
You don't have a fever.

288
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:45,000
- Wait here.
- Hold on.

289
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:47,900
Stay here.

290
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:12,266
It must have been a long day.

291
00:25:04,966 --> 00:25:06,233
Relax comfortably.

292
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,666
Let's push a little harder.

293
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,566
The left head must be hard.

294
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,800
Isn't it taking too long?

295
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,600
The first child always takes a long time.

296
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,300
How do you know that?

297
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,133
My mother told me
when my neighbor had a baby.

298
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:04,066
I see.

299
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,700
How come I'm more nervous
than when I had mine?

300
00:26:10,233 --> 00:26:11,466
That's what I'm saying.

301
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:13,666
Honey...

302
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:17,800
Come this way.

303
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,500
Hold him.

304
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:24,833
What about the baby?

305
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:27,333
I think it'll be born soon.

306
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,600
Honey...

307
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,833
Don't worry.

308
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:53,833
Honey, hang in there.

309
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,500
Hang in there.

310
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:03,333
Everyone at Peace Village is...

311
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:05,700
waiting for a new life to be born.

312
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,500
We wish for Tong Il to be born healthy.

313
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:18,333
Dr. Gu, check her blood pressure.

314
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,333
Yes.

315
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:30,633
Ma'am, let's push one more time.

316
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:32,866
I'm seeing the baby's head.

317
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,233
Ma'am, please.

318
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:48,866
Let's push hard one last time! Push!

319
00:28:17,633 --> 00:28:18,600
What?

320
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:20,266
What's going on?

321
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:22,000
Why don't we hear anything?

322
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,233
Is this right?

323
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:31,933
How come the baby only cries once?

324
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:35,433
Did we not hear the baby?

325
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:41,533
Mr. Park, call the ambulance now.

326
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,633
Why? Is something wrong?

327
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:45,533
It's a premature birth.
The baby took a breath...

328
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:47,633
but it can't breathe on its own.
Please hurry.

329
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:50,400
Jang Su, look for a hospital
in North Goseong.

330
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,000
Ki Nam, look for an ambulance
in North Goseong.

331
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,600
And you look for an ambulance
in South Goseong.

332
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,800
- I'll report this to the higher-ups.
- Okay.

333
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,500
Move quickly!

334
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:05,033
(North Goseong emergency contacts)

335
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:06,233
Call Goseong Hospital.

336
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:15,700
Hello, is this Goseong Hospital?

337
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,800
Do you have a gynecologist available?

338
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,266
Yes, sir.

339
00:29:19,266 --> 00:29:21,200
It's a premature birth.
The baby's in danger.

340
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,366
Is an emergency transit possible?

341
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:25,966
I have the emergency medicine department
at South Goseong Jaesaeng Hospital.

342
00:29:25,966 --> 00:29:27,466
Yes, I'll call you.

343
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:31,900
Hello?

344
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,566
Is it possible now?

345
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:36,633
Yes, thank you.

346
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:41,500
The baby was born before the due date.

347
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,133
The breathing is unstable.
It has hypothermia and jaundice.

348
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:46,133
It needs to be rushed
to a bigger hospital for treatment.

349
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:51,633
Doctor, is my wife okay?

350
00:29:52,466 --> 00:29:53,766
She's getting better.

351
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:58,633
Thank you.

352
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:00,133
Thank you.

353
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,333
- I'm counting on you.
- Yes, of course.

354
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,333
That's a relief.

355
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:06,366
It's here.

356
00:30:27,466 --> 00:30:28,600
I'm the medical officer from Division 22.

357
00:30:29,066 --> 00:30:30,966
It's a premature birth at 32 weeks.

358
00:30:30,966 --> 00:30:33,766
It has hypothermia and jaundice.
Its breathing is unstable.

359
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:35,000
This is the chart.

360
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:37,033
Am I taking the mother, too?

361
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:39,100
No, she's in recovery.

362
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,666
One of you has to come.

363
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:45,300
Excuse me.

364
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:49,366
Dr. Park, here is a pass.

365
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,000
Tong Il...

366
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,733
Don't worry.

367
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:19,166
It'll be okay.

368
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:39,133
Let's see.

369
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,766
(A new device has been recognized.)

370
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:50,400
(Upload is in progress.)

371
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,100
I feel stiff.

372
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,666
I should take a shower before editing.

373
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:20,433
Let's go.

374
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:22,133
What about Mr. Piano?

375
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:23,233
He's sick.

376
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
Don't report this to the party.

377
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,266
I hope this village project ends smoothly.

378
00:32:38,566 --> 00:32:39,766
Don't worry.

379
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,766
I'm glad.

380
00:32:43,466 --> 00:32:44,733
By the way, Comrade Na,

381
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:47,600
what will you do about Mr. Piano?

382
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,933
What do you mean?

383
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:55,233
Honestly, I know there's something
going on between you two.

384
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:56,666
What do you know?

385
00:32:57,866 --> 00:32:59,133
You can't lie to me.

386
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,366
Is this a threat?

387
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Why do you have to say it that way?

388
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:10,000
How can I possibly threaten you?

389
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:13,200
Let's negotiate.

390
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,566
You wanted this project
to end well, right?

391
00:33:25,733 --> 00:33:26,900
Very well.

392
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,566
When we go back to Pyeongyang,

393
00:33:30,566 --> 00:33:32,433
you have to do me at least one favor.

394
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:41,933
Comrade Na, whatever happens,

395
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:44,000
don't cross the line.

396
00:33:45,266 --> 00:33:46,500
What do you know?

397
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,433
(Great Assistant
of Ministry of State Security)

398
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,733
I answered the phone, Great Assistant.

399
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:07,533
(Ministry of State Security office
in Pyeongyang)

400
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:08,033
Please report.

401
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,333
No event has occurred in the village...

402
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,233
You need to be revolutionized.

403
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,233
No, sir.

404
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:15,666
Be straight with me.

405
00:34:17,566 --> 00:34:18,933
Yes, sir.

406
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:21,366
A villager from our people's republic
gave birth.

407
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,666
Let's see. Should I start editing?

408
00:34:31,066 --> 00:34:31,866
No.

409
00:34:32,566 --> 00:34:33,700
What do I do?

410
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:37,900
I'm dead.

411
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:42,400
What's this?

412
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,333
What? Why is this...

413
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,433
(This is crazy! How awesome! I wish
we were reunited! A happy occasion!)

414
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:52,266
(Tong Il, get better soon! Ju Hui's video
is awesome! It stands out.)

415
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:53,766
(I want to see the baby's safe.
Tong Il, be well! Ju Hui, I missed you!)

416
00:34:53,766 --> 00:34:55,066
(This is crazy. Will we be reunited soon?
I mean, is this for real?)

417
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:56,666
(So this is why the uploads were slow!
I love this! I want more of this!)

418
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:58,166
(Is this real? Congratulations!
It seems like a mistake, but thanks!)

419
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:00,000
(So that's why your uploads are slow,
because you're there.)

420
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,733
(This is content
you can't find anywhere else.)

421
00:35:12,933 --> 00:35:14,266
Did he go somewhere?

422
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,300
Use a kitchen towel...

423
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,833
to remove the blood.

424
00:35:56,466 --> 00:35:58,133
It's easy.

425
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,566
Let's just try it.

426
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:21,033
When did you get back?

427
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:23,466
I got in just now.

428
00:36:24,366 --> 00:36:25,566
Aren't you hungry?

429
00:36:26,766 --> 00:36:30,233
Seeing you, I guess I'm hungry.

430
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,600
Sit and wait for a moment.

431
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,200
I'll serve dinner soon.

432
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,666
(Pyeongyang
Na Gyeong's home)

433
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,533
You're home?

434
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:54,633
Have dinner.

435
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:56,266
No thanks.

436
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,200
Just give me water.

437
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,266
Is something wrong?

438
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,266
I might go on a business trip.
Pack my things.

439
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,633
Did you say a business trip?

440
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:07,600
Yes.

441
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,100
Where are you going?

442
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:13,800
To Goseong.

443
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,433
Are you going to see Na Gyeong?

444
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,533
I should if I'm there.

445
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Nothing happened to Na Gyeong, right?

446
00:37:57,633 --> 00:37:58,900
Have coffee.

447
00:38:00,766 --> 00:38:02,000
The service is great today.

448
00:38:02,966 --> 00:38:06,300
I got a good dinner and coffee. Thanks.

449
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:09,033
It's nothing.

450
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:10,766
I enjoyed it so much.

451
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:14,700
Then...

452
00:38:15,866 --> 00:38:17,400
you can help with the dishes.

453
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,166
The dishes?

454
00:38:20,266 --> 00:38:21,266
You can do it yourself, right?

455
00:38:24,366 --> 00:38:26,000
Do you want me to wash everything?

456
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:29,166
Then is it a job for two?

457
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,733
No.

458
00:38:31,733 --> 00:38:34,466
You cooked a great dinner.

459
00:38:34,466 --> 00:38:36,666
I'll do the dishes.

460
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:01,133
(Comrade Gyeong Ho)

461
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:04,400
Why isn't she answering?

462
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:18,166
If you're done, let's start washing.

463
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:19,500
Wait.

464
00:39:51,866 --> 00:39:53,233
Comrade Na Gyeong!

465
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,566
Comrade Na Gyeong!

466
00:39:55,566 --> 00:39:57,633
Comrade Na Gyeong! We have a problem!

467
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,900
Comrade Na Gyeong! We have a problem!

468
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,900
What's the problem?

469
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,433
Why don't you answer your phone?

470
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,500
I didn't realize my phone was vibrating.

471
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,933
That's that, but what's the problem?

472
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:26,833
The Great Assistant is coming here soon.

473
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,400
Why is my father coming here?

474
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,833
A citizen of our republic gave birth.

475
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:34,966
She did.

476
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,966
He might have found out
about you and Mr. Piano.

477
00:40:45,133 --> 00:40:47,833
Don't stare at me like that
in such a scary way.

478
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,000
Did you get home safely?

479
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,266
Yes, Joo Hyung.

480
00:40:55,266 --> 00:40:57,533
I might have to hire a cleaner.

481
00:40:57,533 --> 00:41:00,933
You can stay at my place
until Mr. Choi comes back.

482
00:41:00,933 --> 00:41:03,966
Don't do anything silly. Got it?

483
00:41:03,966 --> 00:41:05,033
Bye.

484
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,233
Hasn't your aunt called you?

485
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:21,600
No.

486
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:27,633
Did you report to the party by any chance?

487
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:30,500
Are you accusing me?

488
00:41:32,133 --> 00:41:35,433
Forget it. I'm not accusing you.

489
00:41:35,433 --> 00:41:36,833
I was just checking.

490
00:41:40,866 --> 00:41:42,000
Anyway, what do we do now?

491
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:44,700
If Great Assistant finds out...

492
00:41:53,066 --> 00:41:55,400
Then we'll have to resolve this.

493
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,100
Let's think.

494
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:02,533
Comrade Gyeong Ho, you can go.

495
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,433
The storm is coming.

496
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:18,966
What will she do?

497
00:42:24,466 --> 00:42:26,600
Why does she look so confused?

498
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:52,533
(Peace Village)

499
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:08,133
Thank you.

500
00:43:08,133 --> 00:43:10,233
I'm glad she arrived at the hospital
within the golden hour.

501
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:13,000
Yes, it's all thanks to you.

502
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:15,500
I was only doing my job.

503
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,866
You handled it well, too.

504
00:43:18,533 --> 00:43:22,000
I hope the baby comes back
well-treated and healthy.

505
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,433
That will happen. Don't worry.

506
00:43:26,466 --> 00:43:27,466
Take care.

507
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:54,133
- You must be tired.
- My goodness!

508
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,566
Dr. Gu, you scared me.

509
00:43:57,566 --> 00:44:01,833
I just got worried and waited for you.

510
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:03,833
You looked tired,
so I wanted to give you this.

511
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:07,033
What's that?

512
00:44:08,033 --> 00:44:10,166
It's good for fatigue. It's mulberry tea.

513
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:14,300
Thank you.

514
00:44:31,466 --> 00:44:32,500
Here you go.

515
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:42,800
Dr. Park, are you okay?

516
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,333
Why are you suddenly having hiccups?

517
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:45,800
I'm...

518
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,933
I'm okay.

519
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,733
Here you go.

520
00:45:09,633 --> 00:45:10,566
Comrade Na Gyeong...

521
00:45:13,733 --> 00:45:14,700
Let's go.

522
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,300
Have you called Pyeongyang?

523
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,366
No, I haven't.

524
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:21,466
Let's look for a house in the center.

525
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:23,633
Let's go.

526
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:28,466
(Health clinic)

527
00:45:30,133 --> 00:45:31,600
Hello, doctor.

528
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,666
Good morning.

529
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:34,466
When did you come back?

530
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,566
Is the baby okay?

531
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:38,733
Yes, I saw the baby getting treated.

532
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:41,066
You're all coming together.

533
00:45:41,066 --> 00:45:41,833
Hello.

534
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,133
Hello, Dr. Gu.

535
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:59,333
<i>I ordered a cup of coffee</i>

536
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:00,833
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

537
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:03,066
My gosh.

538
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:04,300
You came?

539
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,833
- Let's all have coffee and get started.
- Yes.

540
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:07,866
- Okay.
- Okay.

541
00:46:11,766 --> 00:46:13,100
Jang Su,

542
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,500
have you reported to
the propaganda department?

543
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,666
Yes, I did it immediately. Have you?

544
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:20,333
Yes, I submitted a report to MOU and NIS.

545
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,833
Mr. Park, you should see this.

546
00:46:26,566 --> 00:46:28,300
What? What's this?

547
00:46:31,566 --> 00:46:33,366
(Tong Il, a baby born prematurely
in Peace Village yesterday morning...)

548
00:46:33,366 --> 00:46:34,733
(was sent to South Goseong Hospital.)

549
00:46:34,733 --> 00:46:36,200
(Meanwhile, the internet is buzzing
with supporting comments,)

550
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,333
(offering congratulatory words and wishing
for the health of Tong Il and his family.)

551
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:41,966
What's this?

552
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:44,533
What is it?

553
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:49,266
What's this?

554
00:46:49,266 --> 00:46:51,366
How can this be?

555
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,900
But...

556
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:56,033
- Mr. Park!
- Mr. Park!

557
00:46:56,466 --> 00:46:58,466
Mr. Park, are you okay?

558
00:46:58,466 --> 00:46:59,933
How could...

559
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,500
Hello, Mr. Park.

560
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,033
Ms. Ju Hui, what is this?

561
00:47:11,933 --> 00:47:13,966
What on earth did you do?

562
00:47:14,633 --> 00:47:16,566
It's just that...

563
00:47:16,566 --> 00:47:19,800
I was so excited for Tong Il...

564
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,133
and I was hyped up...

565
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:24,033
and I was sleep-deprived...

566
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:25,733
And?

567
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,166
I uploaded the videos
before taking a shower.

568
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:31,566
I came out and was going to edit them...

569
00:47:31,566 --> 00:47:32,533
And?

570
00:47:34,433 --> 00:47:36,966
The real-time upload app
synced with my computer...

571
00:47:36,966 --> 00:47:39,133
and posted the video automatically.

572
00:47:39,133 --> 00:47:40,666
I'm sorry.

573
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,866
I'm glad they have an incubator.

574
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:51,500
It's even better since a gynecologist
was working the night shift.

575
00:47:53,966 --> 00:47:56,233
But what about Tong Il's mother?

576
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,200
I gave her a shot of vitamins
and sent her home.

577
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,566
- Dr. Gu, let's visit the parents.
- Okay.

578
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,266
Let's do that.

579
00:48:12,533 --> 00:48:14,233
Let's bring supplements...

580
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,333
and buy some seaweed and meat.

581
00:48:19,466 --> 00:48:20,600
Yes, let's do that.

582
00:48:26,933 --> 00:48:28,066
Ms. Kim Ju Hui...

583
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,833
I begged you to be careful!

584
00:48:38,533 --> 00:48:40,633
Mr. Park, I'm sorry.

585
00:48:41,733 --> 00:48:43,666
You're sorry...

586
00:48:49,066 --> 00:48:50,433
Mr. Park, are you okay?

587
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,433
Are you okay?

588
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:09,133
(Tong Il, a baby born prematurely
in Peace Village yesterday morning...)

589
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:10,033
(was sent to South Goseong Hospital.)

590
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:10,866
(Meanwhile, the internet is buzzing
with supporting comments,)

591
00:49:10,866 --> 00:49:12,066
(offering congratulatory words and wishing
for the health of Tong Il and his family.)

592
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,700
This will get blown out of proportion.

593
00:49:21,733 --> 00:49:23,600
It was Ju Hui...

594
00:49:48,033 --> 00:49:49,033
Is something wrong?

595
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:51,566
Mr. Park fainted.

596
00:49:52,566 --> 00:49:54,566
Why did he faint?

597
00:50:01,266 --> 00:50:03,366
It was a mistake.

598
00:50:05,266 --> 00:50:06,900
I'm sorry.

599
00:50:08,433 --> 00:50:09,866
What was the mistake?

600
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:20,166
(A newborn at Peace Village
urgently sent to the hospital)

601
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,600
Ju Hui.

602
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,666
I'm sorry.

603
00:50:32,966 --> 00:50:34,400
It was a mistake.

604
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,110
