00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,133
(This series was produced
with the support of MCST, KOCCA,)

2
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:10,000
(Gangwon-do Province,
and Goseong-gun County.)

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,066
Comrade Na Gyeong.

4
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,633
Comrade Na Gyeong.

5
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:33,700
Comrade Na Gyeong.

6
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:14,100
Comrade Na Gyeong.

7
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,300
Comrade Na Gyeong.

8
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:20,600
Why isn't she answering?

9
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:42,800
Is Comrade Na Gyeong awake?

10
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:45,633
How would I know that?

11
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:48,833
She doesn't usually sleep in.

12
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,266
Is something wrong?

13
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:52,166
What do you mean something is wrong?
She slept well.

14
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:58,833
My gosh.

15
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,833
Why are you two men so chatty this early?

16
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:13,233
Is something on my face?

17
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,966
No, there's nothing.

18
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:52,566
Why are you looking at me like that?

19
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:54,666
Say what you need to say.

20
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,200
You drank with Mr. Piano, didn't you?

21
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,633
So what? Is that a problem?

22
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,033
You're a grown woman. There's no problem.

23
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:06,866
But...

24
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:08,166
But what?

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,633
You don't remember what happened
when you drink.

26
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:14,666
Nothing happened.

27
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,166
Fine, then don't open your mouth.

28
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,733
You reek of alcohol.

29
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:43,366
(Love Andante Episode 3)

30
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:45,466
Isn't that why we have to...

31
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:47,733
gather together for the morning clean-up?

32
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:48,800
That's right.

33
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,166
If you tell everyone
at the resident meeting,

34
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,400
wouldn't they come and clean?

35
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,033
When South Koreans are told
to do something,

36
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:58,533
they get spiteful and end up not doing it.

37
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,000
Unless we make it feel voluntary.

38
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:02,700
They get spiteful?

39
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,466
What's wrong with you people?

40
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:09,666
Let's announce tomorrow
that it's a group activity.

41
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,666
Okay.

42
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,833
Is there another agenda?

43
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:17,100
It's time to sow,
but we lack people that can work.

44
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,333
On that note, we'll need help...

45
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:23,400
to sow the plants that are top priority.

46
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,633
For top priority...

47
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's sow the potatoes first.
The season is passing.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,466
- Yes, let's do potatoes.
- Potatoes.

49
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:32,933
- Big potatoes!
- Big potatoes!

50
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:34,133
That sounds good.

51
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:38,400
We'll sow chilies, cucumbers,
and tomatoes.

52
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,466
I'll walk you through that.

53
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:43,433
Okay, since you look like a cucumber.
You can take the job.

54
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:45,700
The next agenda is...

55
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,966
What do I look like?

56
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:47,833
You look like corn.

57
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,100
My head hurts.

58
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,333
We were talking about the house rules...

59
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,100
and we had some wine...

60
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,933
What woman drinks like her?

61
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:09,000
She even mixed in soju, too.

62
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:13,066
And then after...

63
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,300
It's driving me crazy. I can't remember.

64
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,866
What did I say...

65
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,533
Wait!

66
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,933
You're back?

67
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,333
Why are you so surprised?

68
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,666
How long have you been there?

69
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:24,766
I worked out and took a shower,

70
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:27,100
and it only took 15 minutes.

71
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,066
So it's been about 30 minutes.

72
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:31,800
Is that why you're so surprised?

73
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,466
I mean...

74
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:36,733
I'm just surprised you kept the rule.

75
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,033
I guess you're no longer hung over,

76
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,433
seeing that you were playing the piano.

77
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,866
I think I heard that song.
What's it called?

78
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,933
Do you know the song?

79
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,433
What was it...

80
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,400
It's...

81
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,966
You don't remember?

82
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,800
I'll leave you to it.

83
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,733
She has heard of it?

84
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,700
Does she remember?

85
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,366
And yet she feels nothing?

86
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:30,400
So she's playing it cool.

87
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,933
Okay, fine.

88
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:33,500
I'll play it cool, too.

89
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,166
All the residents are sowing potatoes
together today.

90
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,733
So my fashion look for today is...

91
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,900
a young farmer.

92
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,333
I'm late. I shall get going.

93
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,633
Follow me!

94
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,366
Hello.

95
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,733
He supports the lives of the villagers.

96
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,966
He works for the center.

97
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:24,666
Salute!

98
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,900
Are you on the way to the farm?

99
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,233
Yes. Aren't you coming?

100
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:29,900
I'll be bringing the plant bed.

101
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:33,933
Woo Bin, this is heavy! Help me!

102
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,333
Okay, I'll help you.

103
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:37,366
I'll get going first.

104
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:38,100
Take your time.

105
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,400
Yes, see you later.

106
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:48,500
Hold that side.

107
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,400
Let's go to that side.

108
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:56,266
(Health Clinic)

109
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:58,333
Hello!

110
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:01,100
- Hello.
- Hello.

111
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:05,233
My goodness.

112
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:06,300
Please say hello.

113
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,533
My goodness.

114
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:11,033
Wait a minute.

115
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:12,700
Go to the side a little.

116
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:15,566
You look so good.

117
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,466
What's wrong with her?

118
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,766
Mister!

119
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,500
Teach me how to plant the potatoes.

120
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,400
Okay.

121
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,800
How can she be so nonchalant?

122
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,766
No, you crazy guy.

123
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,866
Get a grip.

124
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:17,900
But maybe she really doesn't remember.

125
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,566
There's no way she can't remember
sleeping with me.

126
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:22,933
It's me, Lim Joo Hyung.

127
00:12:24,766 --> 00:12:25,733
There's no way.

128
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:40,600
No, that's too shallow.
The seeds will rot that way.

129
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,333
Sow it deeper.

130
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,500
Deep like this.

131
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,433
You have to step on it.

132
00:12:50,966 --> 00:12:53,000
So that's how you sow potatoes.
How fascinating.

133
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,266
Mister, you're so good.

134
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,300
I was a farming prodigy since ten.

135
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,700
You're gentle, buff,

136
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,366
and a farming prodigy.

137
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,133
You don't have to be...

138
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:10,600
so accurate.

139
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,600
Mister, to sow the seeds until the end,

140
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,033
would it take about an hour?

141
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,633
It won't take an hour.

142
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,233
Really?

143
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't think so.

144
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,500
Seriously? Watch me.

145
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,766
Mister, you can do it!

146
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:58,966
You can do it!

147
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:00,566
Nice job.

148
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,866
(Father)

149
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,200
(Father)

150
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,133
(Na Gyeong's home in Pyeongyang)

151
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,566
(One unread message
Na Gyeong)

152
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,566
I'm doing well.

153
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:13,100
Father, please don't drink too much.

154
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,533
Auntie will worry.

155
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,366
Let's see.

156
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:45,466
Here I go.

157
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:48,233
Follow me!

158
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:49,100
See you later.

159
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,000
Hello!

160
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:10,100
- Hello.
- Hello.

161
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,300
He's pretty charming.

162
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,333
Doctor!

163
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,533
Please say hello.

164
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,733
Go to the side a little.

165
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:30,566
Isn't it better if she doesn't remember?

166
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:32,100
I'm not losing anything.

167
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:37,133
She wouldn't get attached or anything.

168
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,100
But how can she not remember?

169
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,300
I just can't understand it.

170
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:51,333
Wait a minute.

171
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,166
If she doesn't remember,
I can just refresh her memory.

172
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:09,666
What?

173
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,966
She could have acknowledged me cleaning
and said "Good job" or something.

174
00:17:16,966 --> 00:17:19,166
She has absolutely
zero ounce of sweetness.

175
00:18:58,833 --> 00:18:59,766
Let's eat.

176
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,033
It's wine and pasta with truffle oil...

177
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:04,433
No thanks.

178
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,000
That personality of hers is so tough.

179
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:26,666
<i>After sending you this morning</i>

180
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:33,600
<i>I keep thinking about you</i>

181
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:42,933
<i>I tried to calm my heating heart all day</i>

182
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:49,966
<i>But I can't get you out of my sight</i>

183
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:57,333
<i>It makes me cry, I cry inside</i>

184
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:04,700
<i>Your letter filled with your heart</i>

185
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:13,000
<i>It makes me cry, and even if I cry</i>

186
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:28,900
<i>It makes me cry, and even if I cry</i>

187
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:35,333
<i>I have all my love for you</i>

188
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:42,833
<i>I want to see you more
I want to see you all the time</i>

189
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:46,233
<i>I want to give you everything</i>

190
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:57,733
<i>It makes me cry,
and even if my heart breaks</i>

191
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:05,133
<i>My love for you makes me tremble</i>

192
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:13,633
<i>It makes me cry,
and even if my heart breaks</i>

193
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:18,333
<i>I have all my love for you</i>

194
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,200
<i>I have all my love for you</i>

195
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:46,200
Who is banging the piano so late?

196
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,966
Let me sleep!

197
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:15,166
Is she ignoring me?

198
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:27,466
So I'm invisible to her now.

199
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,800
Hydroponics uses water
mixed with fertilizer...

200
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,866
to grow crops and plants.

201
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,033
You have to be extra mindful
of oxygen levels.

202
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:47,033
Because crops and plants grow
in water and not in dirt,

203
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:48,600
they're sensitive to temperature.

204
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,933
Please take special care.

205
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:52,500
- Okay.
- Yes, Comrade Na Gyeong.

206
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:14,833
I plucked a lot of them.

207
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:15,900
Okay.

208
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,733
This one is a big one.

209
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:22,566
Good job.

210
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,500
(Two months later)

211
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,100
What about the lights?

212
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:05,500
(Plant Observation Journal)

213
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:25,400
(Kiwi, every hour
Shine Muscat, every 30 minutes)

214
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,133
That's cold!

215
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,333
What's wrong with this?

216
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,333
Left one for kiwis
and right one for Shine Muscat!

217
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,400
How many times did I tell you?

218
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,966
It's just...

219
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,566
- Isn't it good?
- It's so good.

220
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:56,300
Come and have a cool slice of watermelon.

221
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,800
Join us.

222
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,333
No thanks. Please enjoy.

223
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:03,166
It's hot today. Have a slice.

224
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:04,666
- Yes, have a seat.
- Sit down.

225
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:05,266
It's really good.

226
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,366
- It's really good.
- Seriously.

227
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:07,933
- Here you go.
- It's really good.

228
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:10,300
Thank you.

229
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,266
Look at this precious watermelon.

230
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:16,600
Mister, have this one.

231
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,733
Have the big one.

232
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,233
I think this is even bigger.

233
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,433
- It's so good.
- I know.

234
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:30,466
It's so sweet, right?

235
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,233
The day is so long.

236
00:29:21,266 --> 00:29:22,266
Excuse me!

237
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,433
Why are you calling me?

238
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,866
You really don't remember?

239
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,433
Remember what?

240
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,733
That night.

241
00:29:34,366 --> 00:29:36,666
What do you mean by "That night?"

242
00:29:37,633 --> 00:29:39,400
What I'm saying is...

243
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,033
that night...

244
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,900
When was that night?

245
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,033
That night we had wine.

246
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:51,533
What are you talking about?

247
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:52,733
Tell me so I understand.

248
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:55,433
Should I refresh your memory?

249
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,733
You boneheaded jerk!

250
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:25,466
What was that?

251
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:43,366
Do you think I'm a joke?

252
00:30:47,366 --> 00:30:48,500
What's going on again?

253
00:30:49,466 --> 00:30:51,133
Let's talk it out.

254
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:53,566
We should talk it out.
Why do you keep using violence?

255
00:30:53,566 --> 00:30:55,733
Why would you do something
that deserves a beating?

256
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,533
This is a big scoop.

257
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,400
Hey, let's talk.

258
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,833
Talk about what?

259
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:41,133
I hate messy drama with a girl.

260
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,366
I like things to be simple and neat.
We should settle things between us.

261
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:45,466
And?

262
00:31:45,466 --> 00:31:47,800
Is something messy between us?

263
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:49,900
You really don't remember?

264
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,933
We drank a whole lot of wine and soju
that night.

265
00:31:54,266 --> 00:31:55,066
And...

266
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,666
We played the piano together.

267
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,100
Then we kissed.

268
00:32:04,566 --> 00:32:06,366
And then what happened...

269
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:07,366
Kiss?

270
00:32:08,533 --> 00:32:10,033
Yes, we kissed.

271
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:11,500
It was really long.

272
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:14,266
Kiss? So what?

273
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,733
It could happen.

274
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:16,466
We were tipsy.

275
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,933
What?

276
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:20,700
Did you create all this drama for a kiss?

277
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:23,233
Do you like me?

278
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,266
What are you talking about?

279
00:32:25,266 --> 00:32:27,300
I worried about hurting you.

280
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,233
I was going to own up like a man,

281
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:31,600
thinking we should
straighten things out, so...

282
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,533
Do men own up to things
over a drunk kiss in South Korea?

283
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:38,733
In our people's republic,
men don't do that over one kiss.

284
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,233
Also, I don't want to talk long
about something I don't remember.

285
00:32:43,866 --> 00:32:45,000
You don't remember...

286
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,266
Don't talk about it anymore.

287
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:48,266
It's nothing anyway.

288
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:50,466
Nothing?

289
00:32:54,366 --> 00:32:55,466
Nothing...

290
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,800
Kiss?

291
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,366
Kiss?

292
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:12,800
I must be crazy!

293
00:33:17,633 --> 00:33:20,033
I don't know if she remembers or not.

294
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,133
It's better for me.
I can stop worrying about it.

295
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:24,933
That hurts.

296
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:31,300
What woman kicks without warning?

297
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,400
I'm worried for her future husband.

298
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
We do not get along at all.

299
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,600
You must be off to work.

300
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,200
Here in Peace Village,

301
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,166
beautiful flowers have fully bloomed.

302
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:55,166
They're rarely seen in the city.

303
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:58,266
I see many flowers
that I don't know the names of.

304
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:02,333
Here, we have goldenrods.

305
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,133
And the flower on this side is...

306
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,633
You scared me!

307
00:36:11,566 --> 00:36:13,500
Hi, muscle man.

308
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:17,133
Give me that.

309
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:19,266
Excuse me? Give you what?

310
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,533
My phone?

311
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,166
Yes.

312
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:26,433
Why?

313
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,866
Just give it to me.

314
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:32,133
I just need to check something.

315
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:35,366
I don't want to.

316
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:41,100
It'll only take a second.

317
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:45,033
Why? What is this about?

318
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,066
I want to check what you filmed yesterday.

319
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,766
What are you two doing?

320
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:26,000
Miss Ju Hui.

321
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,866
Be careful.

322
00:37:28,866 --> 00:37:30,533
As if he didn't make me fall.

323
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,600
It's time to go to work.

324
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,366
Why do you look flustered to me?

325
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,033
No, I'm not.

326
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:53,766
Comrade Na Gyeong, you shouldn't
hit people in random places.

327
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,866
What do you mean?

328
00:37:57,266 --> 00:37:58,533
I saw everything.

329
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,300
With Mr. Piano,

330
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,066
why do you two fight like children?

331
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,466
Don't do something
South Koreans would point fingers at.

332
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,700
I got it, so let's go.

333
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,066
(Health Clinic)

334
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,666
Dr. Gu, what are you doing?

335
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,066
It felt a bit empty here,

336
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:28,166
so I thought I might make
a small flower garden.

337
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,700
- A flower garden?
- Yes.

338
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,033
That would be lovely.

339
00:38:33,033 --> 00:38:35,200
You must be good with your hands.

340
00:38:36,633 --> 00:38:38,533
I'm not really,

341
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:40,333
but I do like making things.

342
00:38:40,866 --> 00:38:42,700
Can I help you with anything?

343
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,000
No, I'm fine for now.

344
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,666
After I'm done,
you can pick the flower to plant.

345
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,166
Okay, then do you want morning coffee?

346
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,466
Morning coffee sounds good.
I'd love the instant coffee.

347
00:38:56,266 --> 00:38:57,133
Sure.

348
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:05,300
It's hot.

349
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,566
Mr. Lim Joo Hyung.

350
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:09,266
Mr. Lim Joo Hyung, are you in?

351
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:11,733
Mr. Lim Joo Hyung?

352
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:14,733
Is he out?

353
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:15,866
Mr. Lim.

354
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:18,966
Mr. Lim.

355
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:23,033
So you're home. Come on out.

356
00:39:23,033 --> 00:39:23,666
Why?

357
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,933
Just come on out. Let's go somewhere.

358
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:27,900
Go where?

359
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,766
You'll know when you're there.
Come on out.

360
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:33,400
It's hot. I don't want to.

361
00:39:33,966 --> 00:39:37,066
Getting the sun will make
your bones healthier.

362
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:38,033
Come on out.

363
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,633
I don't like these kinds of things.

364
00:39:40,133 --> 00:39:41,400
Hurry and come on out.

365
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,533
Hey.

366
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,033
Come on out.

367
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:50,066
You're very stubborn.

368
00:39:51,366 --> 00:39:52,566
(Recycling center)

369
00:39:52,566 --> 00:39:55,100
Make sure to drain it fully.

370
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,300
Sure.

371
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,733
But it's fascinating that this cap
is made from vegetables.

372
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,666
You can make anything with vegetables.

373
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:09,966
Then can you make caps with sugar cane?

374
00:40:09,966 --> 00:40:11,200
It's not sweet.

375
00:40:14,066 --> 00:40:16,333
- Mr. Jun Mo.
- I see you're working hard.

376
00:40:17,566 --> 00:40:18,800
Yes.

377
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,933
I brought Mr. Lim Joo Hyung here.

378
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:23,900
Show him how to recycle.

379
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,066
- Yes, sir.
- Sure.

380
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:26,366
What am I doing?

381
00:40:26,366 --> 00:40:30,033
You'll be removing the caps
from the water packs. It's simple.

382
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:34,666
But if I break a nail while doing this,
I can't play the piano.

383
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:35,866
What?

384
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:38,033
I'll be leaving. Keep up the good work.

385
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:39,333
Wait, Mr. Lim!

386
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,733
Then let's go somewhere else!

387
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,033
Why would he break a nail from doing this?

388
00:40:46,033 --> 00:40:47,466
That's what I'm saying.

389
00:40:47,466 --> 00:40:49,066
To break his nail...

390
00:40:50,133 --> 00:40:51,966
Isn't he making an excuse
since he doesn't want to do this?

391
00:40:51,966 --> 00:40:53,166
You're right.

392
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:55,500
He was raised as a precious prince.

393
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,866
Let's just finish this.

394
00:40:56,866 --> 00:40:59,300
I was raised like a prince
in the North, too.

395
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,633
Okay, fine.

396
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,533
What now? Where are we going?

397
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:08,600
We're almost there. It's over there.

398
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,833
Where is it?

399
00:41:14,233 --> 00:41:15,200
What?

400
00:41:35,766 --> 00:41:37,166
Mr. Park, you're here.

401
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:41,466
I see the honeybees are so excited.

402
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,566
Come this way. What's wrong?

403
00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:46,100
- No!
- Why not?

404
00:41:46,566 --> 00:41:48,100
It's okay.

405
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,433
You're safe
with the safety cap and gloves.

406
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:53,566
You won't hurt your hands. It's okay.

407
00:41:53,566 --> 00:41:54,666
- No, it's not.
- But...

408
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:55,900
I'm allergic to bees.

409
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,566
My eyeballs swell
just by standing beside bees.

410
00:41:58,566 --> 00:42:00,200
- It's okay.
- It started already.

411
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,933
I said it's okay.

412
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:05,300
Hold on. Wait.

413
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,066
- It's okay.
- Comrade Piano, come this way.

414
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:14,900
Wait!

415
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,700
Hey, Mr. Lim!

416
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,333
What am I going to do with him?

417
00:42:25,366 --> 00:42:26,033
Hey.

418
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,100
My goodness.

419
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,766
Should I refresh your memory?

420
00:43:08,366 --> 00:43:10,266
No, it never happened!

421
00:43:16,566 --> 00:43:18,300
What am I thinking?

422
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,300
Seriously!

423
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,300
What can I do in a greenhouse?

424
00:43:51,266 --> 00:43:53,133
We all need helping hands.

425
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:56,000
You're the only one slacking like a sloth.

426
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,600
Do something.

427
00:43:59,033 --> 00:44:01,033
I said I can't do things like this.

428
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,700
I mean...

429
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,333
What can pianist Lim Joo Hyung do here?

430
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:11,066
Tell me.

431
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,133
But I can't do anything with my hands.

432
00:44:14,933 --> 00:44:17,233
If you can't use your hands,
you can use your feet.

433
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,100
So what is that? What should I do?

434
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,433
I'll teach you.

435
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,233
Comrade Gyeong Ho,
check the humidity of House B.

436
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,366
Mr. Joo Hyung, come this way.

437
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,000
You can't pluck that!

438
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,866
Plant it again.

439
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:13,100
Pluck all the weeds in the back, too.

440
00:45:52,766 --> 00:45:53,833
My back hurts.

441
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,833
My back hurts.

442
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,666
You might have killed Mr. Piano.

443
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,866
Look how weak he is.

444
00:46:45,266 --> 00:46:47,166
He can barely be a man.

445
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,600
It's probably because it's his first day.

446
00:46:52,566 --> 00:46:54,233
I don't think he can make it tomorrow.

447
00:46:58,466 --> 00:47:00,900
I have to stop by the shop.

448
00:47:01,766 --> 00:47:02,633
Go ahead.

449
00:47:31,366 --> 00:47:34,200
(Epilogue)

450
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:52,833
Comrade Na Gyeong!

451
00:49:56,633 --> 00:49:57,800
Comrade Na Gyeong!

452
00:50:55,312 --> 00:50:57,312
