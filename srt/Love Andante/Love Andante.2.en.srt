1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
(This series was produced
with the support of MCST, KOCCA,)

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,966
(Gangwon-do Province,
and Goseong-gun County.)

3
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:18,966
Mr. Park.

4
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:21,466
What are you doing?

5
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:24,066
You didn't discuss the party with me.

6
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,600
Why did you announce that
I'll play the piano?

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,733
Are we in a communist country here?

8
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:30,033
No, it's not that...

9
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,800
Our people's republic
doesn't do things this way.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,466
Is this how things are handled
in the South?

11
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:40,300
You don't discuss anything
or ask for an opinion.

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,066
This one-way announcement...

13
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:43,900
is unethical! Don't you think?

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,733
She's right. This is unethical.

15
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:58,233
You know...

16
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:01,533
my mother is way over 80 years old.

17
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:06,433
I don't know much
about grand ideas like peace,

18
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,800
but my mother left...

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,633
her father in her hometown in North Korea.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,766
That would be my grandfather.

21
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:26,400
When my mother thought of him,

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,866
she would look outside the window...

23
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:32,933
and tear up for a long time.

24
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:47,766
When I told her I was coming here,

25
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,433
she was so happy.

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,066
On the day I left,

27
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:59,433
she held my hand tightly...

28
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,933
and told me this.

29
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:09,900
"Everyone should share a meal together
at least once."

30
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:15,166
"We used to eat together..."

31
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,900
"and live as neighbors."

32
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:23,133
It took so much work to be together.

33
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:26,266
If we can't even share a meal,

34
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:28,666
I don't think I can face my mother.

35
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,500
I'm sorry about organizing the party
without consulting you.

36
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:41,600
But please hear my request.

37
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:02,300
Mr. Pianist.

38
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,133
Comrade Na Gyeong here was...

39
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:11,000
Pyeongyang's violin prodigy.

40
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,233
If you two could play together...

41
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:17,166
and warm up the hearts
of the Peace Village residents,

42
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,700
wouldn't it be great?

43
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,866
Don't you think so?

44
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,566
Comrade Jun Mo.

45
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:42,666
I mean, my brother.

46
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:45,200
Your story about your mother
and grandfather...

47
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,166
was so deeply touching and tear-jerking.

48
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,233
Where is your mother's hometown?

49
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:55,733
Busan.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,900
<i>Busan seagull, Busan seagull</i>

51
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,533
<i>Did you forget all about me?</i>

52
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:30,066
(Love Andante Episode 2)

53
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,200
The lower light?

54
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
It's totally different.

55
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:55,200
- The fire is good.
- Yes.

56
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:57,533
Give me that.

57
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:02,300
Do you think it's enough meat?

58
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,833
Yes. We have sausages, too.
It should be fine.

59
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,433
This is nice.

60
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,766
But how come no one is showing up?

61
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't worry.

62
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,866
No one can resist this smell.

63
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:41,100
People will appear one by one.

64
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,133
It's someone.

65
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,066
Hello.

66
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:47,333
My goodness, hello.

67
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,066
You look so fair today.

68
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,433
Thank you.

69
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:55,633
This is the handsome general manager
of Peace Village.

70
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:58,566
I'm not handsome.

71
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,066
Excuse me, Ms. Ju Hui.

72
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:03,166
You know that whatever you filmed here...

73
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,733
cannot be shared outside, right?

74
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,733
Of course, I do.

75
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:12,300
I'll upload the videos
on my social media account a year later.

76
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,500
You cannot share...

77
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,866
Okay, that should be fine then.

78
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:18,633
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

79
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,133
Hello.

80
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:27,866
Welcome. Sit wherever you like.

81
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,233
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

82
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:40,100
It's a pretty big housewarming party.

83
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,433
What are you talking about?

84
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,000
Isn't this the newlyweds' home?

85
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,666
Shut that mouth of yours.

86
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:48,666
My gosh.

87
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:59,033
Hello.

88
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:00,666
Please sit this way.

89
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,933
- Hello.
- Sit here.

90
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,533
Hello. Nice to meet you.

91
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:18,933
Sit wherever you like.
You didn't have to bring anything.

92
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:22,433
Here comes the meat.

93
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:51,233
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

94
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:54,333
<i>I like to kiss
My daddy likes to kiss</i>

95
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:59,666
<i>I love my daddy's peck the best</i>

96
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:04,466
<i>I like to kiss
My mommy likes to kiss</i>

97
00:08:04,466 --> 00:08:10,100
<i>I love my mommy's peck the best</i>

98
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,700
<i>A peck for my daddy
A peck for my mommy</i>

99
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:22,233
<i>I love my daddy and my mommy the best</i>

100
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,233
I came with my husband to learn
about eco-friendly hydroponics.

101
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:32,533
We're from the North.

102
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,600
We'll study hard
for our family back at home.

103
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,666
It's our dream to live happily with them.

104
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:43,733
We're having a baby in six months.

105
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,866
I majored in internal medicine
at Pyeongyang Medical School.

106
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,733
I'm Dr. Gu Jin Sang, the clinic doctor.

107
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:58,133
I'm Park Dam So.

108
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:00,100
I'm also a doctor at the clinic.

109
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,700
If you don't feel well,
don't hesitate to visit the clinic.

110
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:05,666
I'm Ha Na Gyeong.

111
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,500
I work for
the Joint Crop Research Center.

112
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,900
I'm Nam Gyeong Ho.

113
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,833
If you need a strong helping hand,
call me.

114
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,933
I'm Ju Hui.

115
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:18,533
I'm a life hack content creator
on social media...

116
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:19,933
and a webtoon artist.

117
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:23,000
Also, I'm still single.

118
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,466
Applause!

119
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,833
I came to keep the bees.

120
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,233
I'm Han Myeong Jun.

121
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,866
Where's that piano man?

122
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:51,566
He's probably somewhere.

123
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,366
Nice to meet you.

124
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:59,133
We have plenty of food. Help yourselves.

125
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,266
We have a lot left.

126
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,333
- Thank you.
- Enjoy the food.

127
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:05,366
We also have plenty of drinks and beer,
so help yourselves.

128
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:10,533
- Hey, Jang Su.
- Yes?

129
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:12,466
Let me taste the Taedonggang Beer, too.

130
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:14,566
- Sure.
- Okay.

131
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:15,866
Here you go.

132
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,400
That's good. That's enough.

133
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,433
Let's see.

134
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:23,400
Have this first.

135
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,333
That's sweet.

136
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,533
Have more of this.

137
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:28,466
Is it good?

138
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:32,766
- Is it good?
- It's good.

139
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,900
- Hey, Jang Su.
- Yes?

140
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,633
This is reunification. Isn't that right?

141
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:41,933
I'm touched.

142
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,500
Comrade!

143
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,733
Go away.

144
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:48,833
Come here.

145
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,100
- Hey, Jang Su.
- Yes?

146
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,766
Haven't you seen the piano guy?
We should start the performance soon.

147
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,166
I haven't seen him.

148
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,033
Wouldn't he be at home?

149
00:11:33,866 --> 00:11:36,100
You should stop drinking.

150
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:39,333
What's taking him so long
that he's still not out?

151
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,733
Mr. Lim.

152
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:46,400
It's about time, Mr. Lim...

153
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:49,833
My goodness.

154
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,466
You look so dashing today.

155
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,100
I can't play today.

156
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:57,866
What? Why not?

157
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
Didn't you agree to play?

158
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,966
I changed my mind.

159
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,900
In that kind of environment,

160
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,933
how can I play the piano?

161
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,233
Those crazy...

162
00:12:19,466 --> 00:12:21,233
I'll go and set the mood right now.

163
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:23,733
People are so excited
to see you play, too.

164
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:25,466
If you cancel all of a sudden,

165
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:27,733
I don't even want to imagine...

166
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:29,333
It'll ruin the mood.

167
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,833
I know you're not the type
to play in a setting like this.

168
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,566
Please make an exception just for today.

169
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:38,766
Just this once, please.

170
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,666
Will you?

171
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,733
Then just this once.

172
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,600
I'm not doing it again.

173
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,966
Of course! I swear
on my mother in Busan...

174
00:12:50,966 --> 00:12:54,466
No, I swear under my mother's name.

175
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:56,900
Ms. Ha is waiting, too.

176
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:06,300
Attention, everyone.

177
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,533
Let's hear it for pianist Lim Joo Hyung,
representing South Korea,

178
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:16,233
and Ms. Ha Na Gyeong,
the violinist from North Korea.

179
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:20,466
A round of applause!

180
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,733
Applause!

181
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:25,733
My goodness.

182
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:29,733
Please give them
another big round of applause.

183
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,200
Then who is going first...

184
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:42,300
You can play anything.

185
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,466
Once you start, I'll play along.

186
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,366
Don't worry about making mistakes.
Just relax and play.

187
00:14:57,266 --> 00:15:01,066
<i>We're gathered here today</i>

188
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:05,300
<i>Spending a day in Peace Village</i>

189
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,033
<i>It's a jolly day setting us up for a year</i>

190
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:13,066
<i>Let's get along together</i>

191
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:16,633
<i>Comrade Na Gyeong and Comrade Joo Hyung</i>

192
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:20,266
<i>Are making us happy
with their performance</i>

193
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:24,066
- <i>Let's gulp down our drinks</i>
- Nice!

194
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:26,933
<i>It's nice to be together</i>

195
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,166
Let's all have a drink!

196
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,800
<i>We're gathered here today</i>

197
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,066
<i>Spending a day in Peace Village</i>

198
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:51,200
<i>It's a jolly day
setting us up for a year</i>

199
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,300
<i>Let's get along together</i>

200
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,733
- Comrade Na Gyeong!
<i>- Comrade Na Gyeong</i>

201
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:57,800
- And Comrade Joo Hyung!
<i>- And Comrade Joo Hyung</i>

202
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,966
<i>Are making us happy
with their performance</i>

203
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:04,500
- <i>Let's gulp down our drinks</i>
- Nice!

204
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,800
<i>It's nice to be together</i>

205
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,500
What?

206
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,800
What's going on?

207
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,566
Stay still.

208
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,566
What's going on?

209
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,100
What is it?

210
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,500
What's going on?

211
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,566
- I'm scared.
- Stay still.

212
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:26,500
What's going on?

213
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
- Call the office now.
- Yes.

214
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,400
Ki Nam, give them a call right now!

215
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,200
Yes, sir.

216
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,566
Isn't this a war breaking out?

217
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:45,533
- What?
- A war?

218
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:55,833
A war...

219
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:56,766
A war?

220
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:04,366
Everyone, that will not happen.
Let's all calm down.

221
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:07,166
I hope nothing is happening.

222
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:11,033
It's probably nothing. Let's wait.

223
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,666
It's a water deer.

224
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:19,966
What?

225
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:23,866
A water deer got trapped
in the border net on the north side.

226
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:26,066
It blew the main fuse of a transformer.

227
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:27,400
It's nothing.

228
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:34,866
Okay, you all heard that, right?

229
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:36,400
It's nothing.

230
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:40,866
It's all because of that water deer.

231
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:43,166
The mood is a mess now.

232
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:47,800
It'll take some time
to fix the transformer.

233
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,166
You can all go back home.

234
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,566
We'll wrap up the dinner here.

235
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:57,633
You can go home now.

236
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:59,366
You can go home.

237
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:00,333
Bye.

238
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,300
See you later.

239
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,500
Take care.

240
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:06,600
Bye, everyone.

241
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,900
- Hey, Jang Su.
- Yes?

242
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,166
Don't we have emergency power devices?

243
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:19,766
We do, but it's a bit old.

244
00:19:36,366 --> 00:19:38,233
What about this mess?

245
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,566
For a muscular man, you have good manners.

246
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:47,333
This is basic human decency.

247
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:52,600
But about that woman Na Gyeong
and Joo Hyung,

248
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,933
why are they living together?

249
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,733
It was due to a system error.

250
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,666
Will they keep living together then?

251
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,533
I don't know about that.

252
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,733
At this rate, they might end up together!

253
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:05,933
Just like "Crash Landing on You!"

254
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:07,233
What nonsense is that?

255
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:08,566
That won't happen.

256
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:11,866
Why are you being mad?

257
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:15,433
You're acting weird.

258
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:18,466
What do you mean by acting weird?

259
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:21,733
You're weirder for making something
out of nothing between those two.

260
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,233
Take care now.

261
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,833
Bye, weird muscle man!

262
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,200
Be careful with the candle.

263
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,300
You don't want anything to catch fire.

264
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:16,700
Don't worry.

265
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:20,466
How long have you been
learning the violin?

266
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:23,100
It didn't sound like just a hobby.

267
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:27,833
I played for about ten years.

268
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,533
You weren't bad at all.

269
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:37,100
But in the eyes of
a trained professional like me,

270
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,433
you're just a little better
than regular people.

271
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:42,466
Why did you quit?
You should have continued.

272
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:50,100
Do we know each other well enough
to have a private conversation like that?

273
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:53,300
Is that so?

274
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,733
I guess we're not close.

275
00:21:58,433 --> 00:21:59,900
You can take that.

276
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,833
I'm used to darkness, so I don't need it.

277
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,800
What is this?

278
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,766
It's my favorite saucer
from the UK's Royal Albert!

279
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,366
You can't light a candle on it!

280
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,500
Do you know how much this is?

281
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:21,833
That's hot!

282
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,166
You have to cool it down first.

283
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,766
Did you have to go "michugai" like that?

284
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:33,833
(Michugai, A North Korean expression
for overreacting immaturely)

285
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,066
Keep it under cold water a bit more.

286
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,700
You're a pianist.
Be careful with your hand.

287
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,866
The saucer is not even worth it.

288
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:15,200
But it's Royal Albert.

289
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
I guess that will do.

290
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,700
Yes.

291
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,866
Thanks.

292
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:39,633
Gu Min, do you think the water deer
has been taken care of?

293
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:41,766
It probably is being cared for.

294
00:23:41,766 --> 00:23:43,866
Poor water deer.

295
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,533
I hope they didn't eat it.

296
00:23:47,566 --> 00:23:49,566
No way.

297
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,866
Watch your step.

298
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,833
The water deer is such a waste.

299
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,566
It would been a week's worth of food
in North Korea.

300
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:05,233
People would happily
fill their stomachs with it.

301
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:06,266
That's right.

302
00:24:06,966 --> 00:24:08,833
Should we go back and dig it out?

303
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,800
Forget it.

304
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,166
We can't do that here.

305
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:16,300
What will the South Koreans think of us?

306
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,700
The South Koreans...

307
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,166
- You're right.
- That's right.

308
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,366
But it's still such a waste.

309
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,500
Yes?

310
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,433
We just buried the water deer.
We're on our way back.

311
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:33,300
Yes.

312
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,700
The village
has totally lightened up again.

313
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:39,733
We did it.

314
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:46,500
How will we be able to clean all this?

315
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,233
That's what I'm saying.

316
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:52,233
It'll take all night to clean this.

317
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,633
Why would we be cleaning all night?

318
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:56,966
It's the three of us. It'll be quick.

319
00:24:56,966 --> 00:24:58,333
Let's hurry and clean.

320
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:02,766
Three is a crowd. Let's move it.

321
00:25:04,266 --> 00:25:05,866
Aren't the others coming?

322
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:07,266
Excuse me. Are you going to take long?

323
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,366
It's going to take a while.

324
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:13,500
Try to make it quick.

325
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,500
Jun Mo!

326
00:26:56,766 --> 00:26:58,033
Jun Mo!

327
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,233
Mr. Piano is looking angry.

328
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,766
But why this early in the morning?

329
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:10,933
Where's the bathroom?

330
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,433
- That way.
- That way.

331
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:46,300
The fragrance is enticing.

332
00:27:54,066 --> 00:27:56,200
But why did you come all the way here?

333
00:27:57,466 --> 00:28:00,333
Once a woman goes in the bathroom,
she never comes out.

334
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,433
If there's only one bathroom,
you have to be reasonable, right?

335
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,333
You're right.

336
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:10,033
You could talk to each other about it.

337
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:13,266
I know it's impossible now,

338
00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:16,000
but you promised that I could move.

339
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,866
Just tell me how many days I need to wait.

340
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:20,666
Well, give us a moment because...

341
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:24,133
we have to report it...

342
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:26,800
and get it approved by the higher-ups.

343
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,833
Also, it has to be approved by both sides.

344
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:33,100
Plus, we haven't finished
building another house.

345
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,566
That's right.

346
00:28:34,566 --> 00:28:37,400
So it will take some time...

347
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,200
If so,

348
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,366
I can't even go to the bathroom
in the morning?

349
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:44,500
You can come here.

350
00:28:45,066 --> 00:28:46,733
Our office is always available.

351
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,833
Feel free to use it.

352
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,466
- Please feel free.
- Yes.

353
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,333
So there really is no solution.

354
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,933
You can head back now.

355
00:28:59,466 --> 00:29:01,700
Take care.

356
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,933
Hurry and clean my front yard.

357
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:07,500
Move my piano back inside, too.

358
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:10,300
We're about to get that done.

359
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,566
- Let's go.
- Yes, hurry and go.

360
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:17,533
Ki Nam, Woo Bin, let's go!

361
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,833
What's wrong with this woman?

362
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,733
Mr. Piano!

363
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:46,266
Do you want the piano inside now?

364
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:48,033
Yes.

365
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:05,133
Excuse me. The angle is slightly off.

366
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:06,900
We're busy, so goodbye.

367
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,700
I said the angle here is off.

368
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:18,766
Let's just clean.

369
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:31,933
(Pyeongyang)

370
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,800
(Pyeongyang
Na Gyeong's home)

371
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,766
Eat before you go.

372
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,466
I'm fine.

373
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:55,866
Hey.

374
00:31:55,866 --> 00:31:58,900
I work the night shift,
so I'll be home in the morning.

375
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,333
Make sure to eat your meal.

376
00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:02,333
I got it. You go on now.

377
00:32:35,766 --> 00:32:39,500
I'll just have one drink.

378
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:51,466
I'll be back after I move this.

379
00:32:51,466 --> 00:32:52,566
Go ahead.

380
00:32:56,866 --> 00:32:58,200
(Aunt)

381
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,800
Auntie.

382
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,566
Na Gyeong, how are you?

383
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,433
Is Peace Village livable?

384
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,366
It's not bad.

385
00:33:09,366 --> 00:33:10,666
How are you?

386
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,166
It's the same old for me.

387
00:33:13,966 --> 00:33:17,200
Have you called your father to say hello?

388
00:33:18,033 --> 00:33:19,800
No.

389
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,866
Your mom's death anniversary is coming.

390
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,266
He's been drinking a lot again.

391
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:29,433
I see. It must be hard for you to watch.

392
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:31,100
It's not hard for me.

393
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,133
Please make time to call your father.

394
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:36,900
Yes, Auntie.

395
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:40,700
Na Gyeong, look after yourself.

396
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,633
Don't worry.

397
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:48,633
(Mother's death anniversary)

398
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,700
(CEO Choi Si Mon)

399
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:11,766
Hello? It's me.

400
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:14,533
Joo Hyung, you're doing well, right?

401
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:15,866
How can I be?

402
00:34:15,866 --> 00:34:17,566
I can't live here.

403
00:34:17,566 --> 00:34:20,433
But it's only been a few days.

404
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,833
You have to stay there for a year.

405
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:27,400
I begged you to stay
but you insisted on going.

406
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,233
Didn't you?

407
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:31,600
Thanks to you, I'm running around
canceling your shows...

408
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,066
and it's making me completely anxious.

409
00:34:34,066 --> 00:34:36,466
All that effort, all that damage,

410
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:39,400
I'm handling them all despite the loss.

411
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,600
But now you want to be like this?

412
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,100
The woman I'm staying with is reckless.

413
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,166
What? A woman?

414
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:48,533
You're still out of your mind.

415
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:49,633
You have a woman there, too?

416
00:34:50,433 --> 00:34:52,833
If you have woman problems there, too,

417
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:54,166
you're seriously done for.

418
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:58,466
No, it's not that.
It was a system error...

419
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,033
No, never mind.

420
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:10,333
Anyway, I told the media
you're taking a year off.

421
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:12,866
I'll clean up your image in the meantime.

422
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:16,200
You just stay quietly under the radar.

423
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,666
And don't just rest.
Play the piano from time to time.

424
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:23,200
Your fingers will stiffen. Got it?

425
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,100
Okay.

426
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:26,633
Don't go near any women.

427
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:40,100
Hello.

428
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:44,566
This is Peace Village General Manager
Park Jun Mo.

429
00:35:44,566 --> 00:35:48,233
At 7 p.m. tonight
at the management center boardroom,

430
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:50,833
the village hall meeting will be held.

431
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:55,400
We would like every one of you to come.

432
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,600
Let me repeat.

433
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,300
At 7 p.m. tonight
at the management center boardroom,

434
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,600
the village hall meeting will be held.

435
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,266
We would like every one of you to come.

436
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,733
Thank you.

437
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,200
You're all here, right?

438
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,433
- Yes.
- Yes.

439
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:34,933
You'll understand the agenda quickly
if you read the printout you received.

440
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,033
After deciding to accept residents
here at Peace Village,

441
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:41,233
you've all probably received the notice,

442
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:44,500
but one of our most important projects...

443
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,966
is running a farm jointly managed
by South and North Koreans.

444
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,233
So if you could choose
either the crop farm, the barn,

445
00:36:53,233 --> 00:36:56,400
or the fruit farm to work in,

446
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,033
we'll actively reflect your wish.

447
00:36:59,966 --> 00:37:01,200
Count me out.

448
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:05,433
There can't be any exceptions.

449
00:37:06,966 --> 00:37:10,966
A pianist's life depends on his hands.
How can I be farming?

450
00:37:10,966 --> 00:37:12,733
It should be fun.

451
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:14,800
It's like that show "Three Meals a Day."

452
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:19,366
What is "Three Meals a Day?"

453
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,366
There is a TV show...

454
00:37:25,366 --> 00:37:28,566
about farming, fishing,
and providing for oneself...

455
00:37:28,566 --> 00:37:30,600
to cook three square meals a day.

456
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,100
This feels similar to that.

457
00:37:32,466 --> 00:37:33,733
That's right.

458
00:37:33,733 --> 00:37:36,200
We can gather our hands...

459
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,500
and have three square meals
with produce from our land!

460
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,300
What's so fun
about cooking three square meals?

461
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,966
Why is that on TV?

462
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,900
Also, what is an eco-friendly ESG Village?

463
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,100
We're recycling the village waste,

464
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:02,100
but it's sometimes hard to categorize it.

465
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,233
We're not sure about recycling.

466
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:07,966
You wonder whether the waste belongs
in a trash can or in a recycling bin.

467
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:12,266
Good categorization
can help the environment.

468
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:16,600
So we invited an expert who can help us.

469
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,233
A "berri-star" will come.

470
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:21,000
A barista?

471
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,933
No, it's "berri-star."

472
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:26,366
It's a nickname for recycling experts.

473
00:38:29,233 --> 00:38:31,600
The South has many strange words.

474
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,800
We should learn as much as we can.

475
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,100
If you don't understand anything, tell me.

476
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,333
I'll teach you.

477
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,533
Let's work together.

478
00:38:42,566 --> 00:38:45,066
I will excuse myself first.

479
00:38:47,266 --> 00:38:49,433
The meeting's not over yet.

480
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,766
What's with him?

481
00:39:16,633 --> 00:39:18,333
Is something wrong?

482
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:20,466
You didn't look well all evening.

483
00:39:20,466 --> 00:39:21,566
It's nothing.

484
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,433
As expected, that piano man's head...

485
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:26,966
is completely filled
with capitalistic ideas.

486
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:29,000
It'll be hard to fix his mentality.

487
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,900
He won't lift a finger,
worrying about hurting his hand.

488
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,566
I bet he'll idle to his heart's content.

489
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,433
You worry about your business.

490
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:38,000
Don't ruin the vibe,
talking behind a comrade.

491
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:40,733
I'm keeping this between us.

492
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:42,700
I don't say a word to others.

493
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,633
I'll head out first.

494
00:39:54,466 --> 00:39:56,633
Do we need to farm, too?

495
00:39:58,366 --> 00:40:00,333
We can't leave the clinic unattended.

496
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:02,100
We should take turns.

497
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,366
In our people's republic,
it's a job only for farmers.

498
00:40:05,366 --> 00:40:07,300
I come from a farming family.

499
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,866
You must be good at farming then.

500
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:12,166
No, I only studied.

501
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:13,900
My father wanted me to.

502
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,933
Since we have to decide what we're doing,

503
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:19,233
let's take our time.

504
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:20,466
Yes, let's do that.

505
00:40:22,966 --> 00:40:27,466
<i>This is a promise only for you</i>

506
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:30,800
<i>I'll only be available to you</i>

507
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,433
What's that song? It sounds nice.

508
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:34,500
What? A song?

509
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,300
The one you just hummed.

510
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:40,100
This song? It's "All For You."
It's nice, right?

511
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:40,933
It's nice.

512
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:42,700
Want me to teach you?

513
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,300
- No, it's fine.
- I'll teach you.

514
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:46,900
It's okay.

515
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,533
Dr. Gu, just follow me. It's really easy.

516
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:50,466
No, it's okay.

517
00:40:50,466 --> 00:40:53,866
<i>This is a promise only for you</i>

518
00:41:20,533 --> 00:41:21,966
Get me one, too.

519
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:24,200
Have a seat.

520
00:41:46,366 --> 00:41:48,533
That's not how you drink wine.

521
00:41:48,533 --> 00:41:50,500
You roll it around with your tongue,

522
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,400
appreciating the aroma and flavor.

523
00:42:01,066 --> 00:42:02,900
Whether you drink it that way or this way,

524
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,000
it's all the same in our stomachs.

525
00:42:05,366 --> 00:42:08,300
This is a very expensive wine.
You can't drink it like soju.

526
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,000
Then I'll drink soju.

527
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,966
Just drink it.

528
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,800
It's not bad.

529
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,200
This was made with special truffle oil.

530
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,633
The aroma's amazing.

531
00:42:43,066 --> 00:42:45,500
Have you always been this fancy?

532
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:49,766
The wine is expensive
and the pasta has fancy truffle oil.

533
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:52,233
I can't talk to you
since I'm not at your level.

534
00:42:52,966 --> 00:42:54,866
I lived abroad for a long while.

535
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,000
Since we're here sitting down together,

536
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,533
how about we come to an agreement?

537
00:43:01,633 --> 00:43:03,300
What agreement?

538
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,933
We have to live together,

539
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:06,733
so before we move out,

540
00:43:06,733 --> 00:43:08,666
let's stick to a set of rules.

541
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,733
Keep talking.

542
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:18,866
Hold on. I'll fetch some pen and paper.

543
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:37,866
Number one.

544
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:40,466
We can't use the bathroom
for more than 15 minutes.

545
00:43:41,266 --> 00:43:42,800
I said 30 minutes earlier.

546
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:44,033
Then we'll make it 20 minutes.

547
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,266
Agreed.

548
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:52,100
Number two, after using the bathroom,
we clean up our leftover hair and water.

549
00:43:53,033 --> 00:43:55,533
We take turns to clean the toilet.

550
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,333
Agreed.

551
00:43:57,666 --> 00:43:58,933
Number three.

552
00:43:58,933 --> 00:44:01,200
- Just a moment.
- What?

553
00:44:03,133 --> 00:44:04,033
We're out of wine.

554
00:44:04,766 --> 00:44:06,933
We can stop drinking.

555
00:44:06,933 --> 00:44:09,200
We just started.
What are you talking about?

556
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,300
You're tougher than I thought.

557
00:44:27,266 --> 00:44:28,266
Give me some, too.

558
00:44:31,433 --> 00:44:33,833
You've been "lowering" your sentences.

559
00:44:34,866 --> 00:44:35,700
"Lowering" my sentences?

560
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,366
As South Koreans say,
you're speaking informally.

561
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,766
Don't you know?

562
00:44:39,766 --> 00:44:40,933
Sorry.

563
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,400
Read out number three.

564
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,700
Let's see.

565
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,766
What was number three?

566
00:44:51,933 --> 00:44:55,466
Except for the master room,
the living room and kitchen are...

567
00:44:55,466 --> 00:44:57,500
cleaned by me, Lim Joo Hyung?

568
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:00,300
What's this?

569
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,566
Why do I clean them all?

570
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:05,233
That's what you wrote.
Why do you have a problem?

571
00:45:05,233 --> 00:45:06,233
I wrote it?

572
00:45:06,233 --> 00:45:08,500
I, Lim Joo Hyung, must clean all of them?

573
00:45:08,766 --> 00:45:10,833
Someone who is good at cleaning
should do it, right?

574
00:45:15,266 --> 00:45:18,033
Someone who is good should do it.
That's right.

575
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,766
Let's clash them.

576
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:22,800
Cheers.

577
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,766
And number four.

578
00:45:42,766 --> 00:45:45,066
Let's not touch each other's stuff.

579
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,033
My coffee and Royal Albert teacups.

580
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,200
Don't touch those.

581
00:45:53,566 --> 00:45:55,066
I won't touch them.

582
00:45:55,066 --> 00:45:57,200
I won't touch them
since it's so petty and trifling.

583
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:00,500
You're shortening your sentences.

584
00:46:02,133 --> 00:46:03,133
Agreed.

585
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,766
Agreed.

586
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:07,700
We're out of wine.

587
00:46:25,766 --> 00:46:26,766
Mister!

588
00:46:29,033 --> 00:46:30,266
Hello.

589
00:46:31,066 --> 00:46:34,300
Muscle man is serious
about working out again today.

590
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,900
But you're alone today.

591
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:41,266
I'm on my way to pick her up.

592
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,900
I'll see you later.

593
00:46:45,533 --> 00:46:48,000
Let's have tea at my place later.

594
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,166
Comrade Na Gyeong.

595
00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:14,933
Comrade Na Gyeong.

596
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:20,100
Comrade Na Gyeong.

597
00:47:51,693 --> 00:47:53,693
