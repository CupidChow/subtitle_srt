00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Do you think that our current emperor

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
is really a Duan Xiao?

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This man is already in the old palace.

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Isn't this absurd?

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The previous dynasty's favorite style,

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
will he still be able to get it back?

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can't stand it.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Please calm down.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Please enjoy.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You must be mistaken.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We didn't order this.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This is the salary for you two.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What you two are saying

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
is about adding dignity.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You better not forget it.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If you don't know,

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
you'll think that the prime minister is your father.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It has nothing to do with you.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Minister Wei.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Minister Wei.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Crown Prince,

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
are you willing to let me in?

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I rarely walk in the inner court.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
How do you know me?

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Crown Prince has been in the court for many days.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If he doesn't even recognize you,

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
how can I still have the honor to assist His Majesty?

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Minister Wei, for the country and the people,

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
you are really a person who is willing to do anything.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We came at the right time today.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The end of the court,

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the marriage of the Crown Prince,

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
has just begun.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The marriage of the Crown Prince?

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't you know?

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This is about the previous dynasty's Crown Prince,

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Dai Jie Yuanjia.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He was supposed to be dead,

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
but he didn't think of it.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That Rouran King,

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
was actually a broken-hearted person.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He was wronged,

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and became a musician.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Li's fall is a bad omen.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Li Jin betrayed the throne.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If you listen to this drama now,

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
you won't feel anything.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The Emperor is a wise man.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If he does something wrong,

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
it's not a good thing for the people.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
One is the current Emperor,

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
the other is the country's movement.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's true that it's about the fate of the country.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But how can the official of the Great People's Court

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
hold the Emperor's path?

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Even if we want to get rid of this fate,

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
we have to say what we should say.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's a pity.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Last time, Lord Ouyang said

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
that Prime Minister Yue was hiding the previous dynasty's princess.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He didn't talk about it in the end.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Ouyang Wen didn't see a good person either.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He had a personal grudge with Yue Zhi.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He just wanted to take revenge.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But this is Yue Zhi's fault.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
His Majesty is biased.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He's really unkind.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Lord, you're right.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He's a man of his word.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The Crown Prince is not from my dynasty.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He knows how to protect the family of the Heavens.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But His Majesty...

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
His Majesty...

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Maybe there's some other reason.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What reason?

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's just Yue Xiang.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He wants to be the last one in the court.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He's so ashamed.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I like this play very much.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're too kind.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Come again if you like it.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We have a play every day.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He's really angry.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Isn't it good?

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You're almost shocked.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Tomorrow will be a good day.

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You need to find someone else.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Who?

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Consort Hui.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Your Majesty, I have a memorial.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Speak.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I want to take Yue Xiang's place.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He's so unkind.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He's a bad guy.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Why do you say that?

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yue Xiang is a man.

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He's a woman.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He's deceived the King.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
He's a man who sneaked into the harem and caused trouble.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Those two crimes.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He deserves 800 times.

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Do you want to continue?

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes.

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Third.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yue Xiang is a man.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But he did such a bad thing.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If someone is a bad guy,

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
it's the way of the kingdom.

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Please investigate this.

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll take the responsibility.

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll take the throne.

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're a man.

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You've taken the human and material evidence to the imperial jade.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Since there are no evidence,

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
please ask for the evidence first.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Then we'll listen to Yue Xiang.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How many people did I offend?

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We've discussed it.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm going to be sentenced to death.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yue Xiang.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Do you dare to let me take the throne?

124
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's interesting.

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If I don't dare,

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
will you not take the throne?

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's about the country.

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll never die.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yue Xiang.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What is this?

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
A tribute to the priest.

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yue Xiang doesn't just think it's a tribute.

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's just a woman's chest.

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's not.

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
How did you know

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
it is useful?

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Have you used it?

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yue Xiang, don't argue.

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's not used by Yue Fei.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The size of the horse

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
should be the same as Yue Xiang's.

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
There are different faces and people.

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yue Fei has been practicing martial arts since childhood.

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The horse is bigger than a normal woman.

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's not strange.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I can wear these.

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Others can.

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Why don't you try it on the spot?

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Maybe you can wear it.

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You're being unreasonable.

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I forgot to ask.

152
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Lord Wei,

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
are you sure this is Yue Fei's?

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes.

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The harem is not a peaceful place.

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Where did you get it?

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Who is the one who caused the chaos in the harem?

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You...

159
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Enough.

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What Yue Xiang said

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
is unreasonable.

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Maybe someone is

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
misguiding Lord Wei.

164
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But Yue Xiang is dressed as a woman

165
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and pretending to be a palace concubine.

166
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You're on the spot.

167
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes.

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If it's not seen by the eyes,

169
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
it's a trap.

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Your Majesty.

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yue Xiang,

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I only ask you one question.

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you admit that

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
you're dressed as a woman and a palace concubine?

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I've never done it.

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Your Majesty, I have a witness.

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I have a witness too.

178
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Please show mercy.

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
As ordered by the palace concubine,

180
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll be cleared.

181
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay.

182
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Show me.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The harem is not a peaceful place.

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Where did you get it?

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're on the spot.

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Where did you get it?

187
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I only ask you one question.

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Do you admit that

189
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you're dressed as a woman and a palace concubine?

190
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I have a witness.

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I have a witness.

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I have a witness.

193
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I have a witness.

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I have a witness.

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I have a witness.

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I have a witness.

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I have a witness.

198
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
How could you not change your mind?

199
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Sir Wei, do you have anything to say?

200
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Where is your witness?

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Bring it here.

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I am your witness.

203
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But no matter what,

204
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
when and where,

205
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I and Prime Minister

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
will never be a family.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's too late.

208
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I am late.

209
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Please forgive me.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You and the Yue family

211
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
have always been incompatible.

212
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
How can you make people believe you?

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Because of this,

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
people will be more interested in you.

215
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
They will observe his mistakes

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
more carefully than others.

217
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Your Highness,

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
you should be careful when you speak.

219
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I only speak what I see.

220
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I know

221
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yue Xiang

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I and Prime Minister

223
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
will never be a family.

224
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I have never disguised as Consort Yue.

225
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm made by Lin Ice.

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
My mother has fallen into a predicament

227
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
from her cakes.

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,760
Kas remember this sign

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and she never will.

230
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,800
Please let your

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Min See letting his�

232
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,980
It might be a всем Spanish

233
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,460
Please forgive her

234
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,460
Clem

235
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,440
No need to say all that

236
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,380
Then I won't plead

237
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,200
filming

238
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,340
Clique

239
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,660
Stop. Stop.

240
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,440
His Majesty has to get back inside.

241
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,680
No more knock on doors.

242
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,840
I have already told Lin'er.

243
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,820
You made the decision of taking him out.

244
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,800
I definitely will not take this audience for you.

245
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,180
Tributary Wintervenir Corps

246
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,580
Let alone

247
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,540
I need my pulse

248
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,840
Mr Y Australians

249
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,760
Yes

250
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,540
Send an edict

251
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,760
Not for a year

252
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,000
One year

253
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,960
The frontline is sacrifice for the

254
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,720
For the highlight of the abundant

255
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,540
Yes

256
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,160
Walk

257
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,760
Let's go.

258
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,160
This white snow peony is a famous species.

259
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Your Majesty, please be merciful. Don't ruin my flower.

260
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Today, I passed by the Phoenix Palace and saw a grudge.

261
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,160
What's wrong with you today?

262
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,960
You don't like the moon.

263
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,560
Why are you helping me today?

264
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,560
What do you think?

265
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,560
It can't be for me.

266
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,960
If it's not for you, you can't say that.

267
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,560
But more for Ling'er.

268
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,760
I can't see that you're so meticulous.

269
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,960
I used to be a hot-blooded person.

270
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,160
I didn't care about people around me.

271
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Now, I don't have much.

272
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,360
That's why I value you more.

273
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,960
Your Majesty, some people and things

274
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,160
are forgotten for a long time and your heart feels cold.

275
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,760
Don't value them until they're lost.

276
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,160
This warm and warm thing needs to be practical.

277
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,360
I'm just afraid that I might say something wrong.

278
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,960
So what? If you say something wrong, explain it.

279
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,360
If you don't, explain it.

280
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,360
If you do something wrong, apologize.

281
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,960
If you say something wrong, you can't say anything.

282
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Ling Xia, go.

283
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,360
Ling Xia.

284
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,560
I'm sorry.

285
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,920
stubble has aame

286
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,760
하는

287
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,560
Your Majesty.

288
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Your Majesty, have a seat.

289
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,680
rop

290
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,560
You're taller than me.

291
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,960
You don't know what you are doing.

292
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,680
Your Majesty.

293
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,280
Get up.

294
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,040
Your Majesty.

295
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,360
I got you a couple.

296
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,840
I hurt you by accident today.

297
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,160
It's my fault.

298
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,000
But Your Majesty.

299
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,640
You sent someone to knock me out.

300
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,800
And you tied me up.

301
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,000
It's even worse.

302
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,880
Today we are forced to draw a draw.

303
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,640
I had no other choice.

304
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,760
Who told you to be so stubborn?

305
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,640
Your Majesty, you can be frank with me.

306
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,200
Are you here to make me

307
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,800
roll the roll?

308
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,400
What are you talking about, Ling'er?

309
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,680
Your brother and I

310
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,280
are really worried about you.

311
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,840
So what?

312
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,440
Did you and your brother

313
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,200
handle this matter well?

314
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,000
Your Majesty.

315
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,400
You always think

316
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,000
men are born to

317
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,600
solve more problems.

318
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,880
They should solve more problems.

319
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,640
But how did you

320
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,240
solve this time?

321
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,880
Have you ever thought about it?

322
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Don't panic.

323
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,240
Even if I made a mistake today,

324
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,360
His Majesty wouldn't punish you.

325
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,480
Your Majesty, I'm sorry.

326
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,560
You may leave.

327
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,560
Yes.

328
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,560
This time,

329
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,880
you solved the problem.

330
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,480
Thanks to the women in the palace.

331
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,640
And thanks to your kindness.

332
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
Thank you.

333
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,440
But more for Ling'er.

334
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,760
She sent a letter

335
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,440
and a big box.

336
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
It's a gift.

337
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,080
It's a stone tomb.

338
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,920
Who?

339
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,640
It's a stone tomb.

340
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,080
It's something that

341
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,440
Prime Minister Yue wanted to do

342
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,200
but failed to do.

343
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,640
And there's something

344
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,400
that His Majesty wanted to do

345
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
but he wrote down.

346
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,880
It's a box full of

347
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,480
the treatment of the soldiers

348
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,720
in front of the front line.

349
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,720
The medical products

350
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,000
should be divided into three seasons

351
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,280
instead of two seasons.

352
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,440
The private items of the female palace

353
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,560
should be managed by the Ministry of Health

354
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,000
and the Imperial Medical Academy.

355
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,160
It also concerns

356
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,300
the

357
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,760
and the

358
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,320
military preparation of the disaster.

359
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,560
There are too many.

360
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,160
I can't turn them over.

361
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,440
So you think he's a good official

362
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,440
and changed his mind?

363
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,200
Yes.

364
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,160
But the most important thing is

365
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,920
that Ling'er is my friend.

366
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,600
I was

367
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,520
rude to you just now.

368
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,120
Please punish me.

369
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,720
Get up.

370
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,640
As long as you're right,

371
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,840
I won't mind your attitude.

372
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,280
I can tolerate Wei Zi Hang.

373
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,080
I won't punish you.

374
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,840
Someone told me

375
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,600
that life is like a mouth

376
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,000
that explains

377
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,880
all the unhappy things.

378
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,120
So I'm here today

379
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,760
to explain and apologize to you.

380
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,880
I underestimated you before

381
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,160
and over-reacted to protect your safety.

382
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,680
I neglected

383
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,360
your concern

384
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,840
and your idea of protecting others.

385
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,240
I

386
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,000
want to say

387
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,240
I like you

388
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,200
and I like you.

389
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,400
I don't want Ling'er to leave today.

390
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,960
I hope you can stay with me

391
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
every day in the future

392
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,480
and help me

393
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,640
and accompany me.

394
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,400
Not only the emperor,

395
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,800
but also the man in front of you.

396
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,720
Ling'er,

397
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,680
will you?

398
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,560
Yes.

399
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,240
This is a Cent computational test.

400
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,720
Your Majesty.

401
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,780
I...

402
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,340
I may have to interrupt this.

403
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:48,160
If I hadn't let go of your hand at that time,

404
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:54,160
would I no longer look back in sorrow?

405
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:01,160
If I could have a glass of wine with you in the twilight,

406
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:08,160
I would stay with you longer when the rain stops.

407
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:18,160
The Long Ballad

408
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
Greetings, Your Majesty.

409
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,160
Sit down.

410
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,160
Tell me what you found.

411
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,160
Yes. I followed the location of Princess Wen Rong's words.

412
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,160
But I didn't find the person.

413
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Instead, two years ago, a spy reported that

414
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,160
Princess Wen Rong once entered the Man Ou's mansion.

415
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,160
That means she and Prince Man have been dead for a long time.

416
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Without any solid evidence, this conclusion cannot be made.

417
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,160
But she was determined to deal with me and Ling Er.

418
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:07,160
I made four sword pieces for the four princes on that year's enthronement.

419
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,160
They all had jewels on them.

420
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Green pine, gold, fox eyes, and bixi.

421
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,160
These are Cao Meng's.

422
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,160
You may leave.

423
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,160
That means they may be in love.

424
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,160
So, when Wen Rong came to the palace,

425
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,160
you wanted to assassinate her and help her to take the throne.

426
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,160
As long as Wen Rong is here, I'm not afraid of her arrest.

427
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
You mean...

428
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,160
I'll act a play for her.

429
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,160
I'm afraid that the war will be in front of us.

430
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:58,160
I just want to be with her.

431
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,160
It's a bit dangerous. Aren't you afraid that she'll bite you?

432
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:09,160
I ascended the throne to give the people a way out.

433
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,160
If I can put an end to the war,

434
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,160
I'll let the people have a home and a home.

435
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:21,160
No matter what kind of effort I make, I'm willing to do it.

436
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,160
If you're willing to do it, I'll do it.

437
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,160
It's already morning. Where is he?

438
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Did you send Xiao Qi out?

439
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,160
I told the people about your whereabouts.

440
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,160
I just told the people about your whereabouts.

441
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,160
Could it be that she doesn't like you?

442
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,160
No.

443
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Her Majesty is a man of love.

444
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,160
As long as she's not blind, she'll definitely raise a daughter.

445
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,160
Shut up.

446
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
You...

447
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,160
The most expensive concubine in the palace is very beautiful.

448
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,160
Look at this flower. It's a bit low.

449
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,160
It's very elegant.

450
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,160
You like it?

451
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,160
I didn't know that Your Majesty is here.

452
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,160
You're being too gentle.

453
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,160
Don't be so polite. I'm being too gentle.

454
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,160
I'm disturbing your mood.

455
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:40,160
The most expensive concubine is more beautiful now that you're here.

456
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,160
Flowers are beautiful.

457
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,160
People are beautiful too.

458
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,160
Everyone, be careful.

459
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Be careful.

460
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,160
Your Highness.

461
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,160
Eunuch Gui, what's going on?

462
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,160
Your Highness, this is His Majesty's reward for you.

463
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Look. These are all top-quality products.

464
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
These are all over the place.

465
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,160
Why would His Majesty be so concerned about collecting them?

466
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,160
His Majesty is not just concerned about you.

467
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,160
He gave a decree.

468
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:31,160
He ordered the state of Gezhou to send over 800 li of extra money overnight.

469
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,160
Look.

470
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,160
His Majesty treats me like this.

471
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,160
Wouldn't he let everyone know?

472
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
That's right.

473
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,160
Your Highnesses, you're so lucky to praise Her Highness.

474
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,160
Look.

475
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,160
His Majesty's favor is coming too fast.

476
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
I can't believe it.

477
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,160
That's right. Who knows what he's up to?

478
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
Your Majesty.

479
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Why are you here?

480
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,160
I don't know what he's up to.

481
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,160
I just wanted to come and have a look.

482
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,160
It's so beautiful.

483
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,160
It's not as beautiful as the most expensive concubine in the green garden.

484
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,160
Your Majesty, you gave me all the best things.

485
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,160
I like them all.

486
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,160
But why did you treat me so well?

487
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,160
Since you came to the palace,

488
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,160
you've been saving me from the fire.

489
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,160
I remember all of it.

490
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,160
I'm good to you because I love you.

491
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,160
I want to share your burden.

492
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,160
But...

493
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,160
I think you've misunderstood me.

494
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,160
I'm glad to know your feelings.

495
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,160
Here.

496
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,160
This is a pair of gold phoenix hairpins

497
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:15,160
I made according to the order of the previous Empress.

498
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,160
Do you like it?

499
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,160
If I take the Empress's things,

500
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,160
wouldn't it be a shame?

501
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,160
Your Majesty, please take it back.

502
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
I'm sorry.

503
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
I'm sorry.

504
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
I'm sorry.

505
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
I'm sorry.

506
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
I'm sorry.

507
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
I'm sorry.

508
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
I'm sorry.

509
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
I'm sorry.

510
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
I'm sorry.

511
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm sorry.

512
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,160
I'm sorry.

513
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
I'm sorry.

514
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,160
I'm sorry.

515
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
I'm sorry.

516
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,160
I'll wait for you to come back.

517
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,160
I won't mind your identity.

518
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,160
You're too plain.

519
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,160
This pair of hairpins suits you.

520
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
What are you thinking about?

521
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
You're so serious.

522
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Don't pretend to be confused.

523
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,160
It's not a coincidence.

524
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
It was given to me by the monk in the temple.

525
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
He said it was very effective.

526
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,160
Since Your Majesty has a problem,

527
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
I'll be generous.

528
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,160
I'll leave it to you.

529
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,160
God bless.

530
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,160
Don't be angry.

531
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,160
I'm willing to exchange my marriage with Yue Xiang's.

532
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,160
It's none of my business.

533
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
I'm not angry.

534
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
I didn't tell Ling'er in advance.

535
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,160
If she knows,

536
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,160
she'll be angry.

537
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
Think of a way.

538
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,160
Why should I think?

539
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
I'm the emperor.

540
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
I don't care.

541
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
I don't care.

542
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
I don't just care.

543
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
I also want to see the fun.

544
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
I order you.

545
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Then I'll go to Ling'er.

546
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Yue Chi.

547
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,160
You have a conscience.

548
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,160
Brother-in-law.

549
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,160
It's a price to pay to see a thread.

550
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,160
Your Majesty.

551
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,160
How?

552
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,160
Your Majesty.

553
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,160
How can you not like me?

554
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,160
Your Majesty.

555
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,160
Your Majesty.

556
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
Your Majesty.

557
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,160
Your Majesty.

558
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
Your Majesty admires Princess Wen Rou so much.

559
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Is she going to lose favor?

560
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
I'm the flower, the sun, the sun and the sun.

561
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Go, go, go.

562
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
What's your heart?

563
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,820
The new calculation porposed to palace Africa

564
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,120
The elaboration process

565
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,060
He went to serve the concubines

566
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,340
For the ganoderma

567
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,740
What

568
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,900
The suitor started to arrange everything yesterday

569
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,940
The majesty said

570
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,020
Most important llegóes

571
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,260
Niu

572
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,680
What are you doing

573
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,480
Greetings, Your Highness.

574
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,280
Why is Laurel Laurel here?

575
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,480
His Majesty sent you some things.

576
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,880
Where is he?

577
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,480
He is...

578
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,880
He is in the Pavilion of Peace.

579
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
You want to give me a box of snacks?

580
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,680
I don't want to eat. Take it to feed the cat.

581
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,880
No, Your Highness.

582
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,880
His Majesty especially asked you to look at it carefully.

583
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,880
Look at it carefully.

584
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,280
This is...

585
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,080
His Majesty said that this is called external and internal softness.

586
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,080
It is different from external.

587
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:36,480
How did His Majesty have to avoid doing such a kind thing?

588
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,680
달 molt is a kind of written colon tone

589
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,680
I should not be doing such thing.

590
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,680
I am Kurere.

591
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,680
Now that Your Highness prepared your craft in the last night,

592
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,480
there will be fear from outside of this pavilion now.

593
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,680
That really 있 윗the Care.

594
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,960
Yue Ling'er's brother?

595
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,880
You're hosting his ceremony?

596
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
It's the emperor's order.

597
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,960
Do I have to disobey?

598
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,600
You won't push me,

599
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,680
and you won't pretend to be sick.

600
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,880
You're usually a bad person.

601
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,240
You're the bad person.

602
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,440
Now the palace is saying that Ling'er is spoiled.

603
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,320
Aren't you worried?

604
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,760
No.

605
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,800
As long as I'm not spoiled,

606
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,400
the Yue family can still stand.

607
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,480
You're heartless.

608
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,960
You're leaving now?

609
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,560
If I don't leave, I'll drink with you.

610
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,000
If you really don't want to leave,

611
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,040
tell the emperor.

612
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,880
If I want to find him,

613
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,840
why should I find you?

614
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,120
The melon is not sweet.

615
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,000
Go with him.

616
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,960
Yue Chi.

617
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,560
For the official position,

618
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,440
you don't even care about your sister.

619
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,240
Your Highness.

620
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,720
Where's Lan Wang?

621
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,000
Your Highness.

622
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,280
I heard that Miss Wen Rong was promoted.

623
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,640
She's been very angry.

624
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,080
She went out just now.

625
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,000
Who told her about it?

626
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,240
No one.

627
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,680
But Du Wujiu

628
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,440
made a scene in the palace and the palace of Prince Anle.

629
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,840
It's all spread.

630
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:18,920
Your Highness.

631
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,480
Where are you going?

632
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,440
I'm here today.

633
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,560
Don't think about going to the palace.

634
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,560
Wen Rong is about to become

635
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,000
the consort of Huo Jingheng.

636
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,680
Only in this way

637
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,600
can you attack Huo Jingheng.

638
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,800
He's mine.

639
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,280
He has hatred in his heart.

640
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,080
If you stop him,

641
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,280
he'll hate you.

642
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,960
He must leave the palace tonight.

643
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,400
I'll go with you.

644
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,280
I'll go with you.

645
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,080
I'll go with you.

646
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,080
I'll go with you.

647
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
I'll go with you.

648
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
I'll go with you.

649
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,080
I'll go with you.

650
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,120
Let me go.

651
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,840
What do you want?

652
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,080
No one has ever stopped Wen Rong from going out.

653
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,240
Now she has to choose her own path.

654
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,960
She can't do that.

655
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,640
Then who did this to her?

656
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,080
It's not the palace that deceived her.

657
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,160
Who wrote the love letter?

658
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,960
Leave it to the wind to tell tomorrow.

659
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,840
I'm willing to sacrifice myself

660
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,720
to find the truth.

661
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,040
If I can't get what I want,

662
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,200
I'll go through all the hardships.

663
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
I'll go through all the hardships.

664
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,600
I'll go through all the hardships.

665
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,120
I'll go through all the hardships.

666
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,360
I'll go through all the hardships.

667
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Love is hot blood, cold blood.

668
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,880
My soul is bright.

669
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,960
I know it all.

670
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,520
I'll go through all hardships

671
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,520
and hold onto my dream.

672
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
Let's go.

673
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,040
The north嶼天橋

674
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,040
is turned into such a beautiful place.

675
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,480
Two pigs, three grapes

676
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
Two gcontras, four fields

677
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,520
Our first day of the year
