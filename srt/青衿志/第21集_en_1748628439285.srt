1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If victory is not decided, let me fight

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The wind and moon are in the human world

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The youth is known as the old youth

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The past is the spring, the past is the spring

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The trees and trees are in front of me

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The sword flies after the wind

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The spring breeze is like a fan, it's going to bloom

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,260
The

9
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,000
Legend of Xiao Chuan

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're awake.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Crown Prince, are you surprised?

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not surprised.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm just a little surprised.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm just a little surprised.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm just a little surprised.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Are you surprised?

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Why didn't you kill me?

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If you die,

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
the two countries will meet each other.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm not doing this for you,

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
but for the people.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I won't thank you.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You just got hurt yesterday.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Eat something.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm not going to eat.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't worry.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's not poisonous.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You...

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Forget it.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let him go.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
How's your leg?

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Does it still hurt?

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The wound is getting worse.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll apply the herbal medicine I just took.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It should be better.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
His wound can't be healed.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
In the ginseng bag,

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
give him the black herbal cream.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What is it?

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's precious.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's precious.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But the flesh is still alive.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's broken.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Then I won't owe you anything.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
See you next time.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I won't die.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Come and eat something.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Or you won't be able to stand it.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I drank too much herbal medicine.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I've already lost my stomach.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,560
Now that I've been sent to the

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You just got bitten by a snake.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and got a cut in the back.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I also treated your internal organs.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yue Xiang also applied the herbal medicine for you.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
How does it work?

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Why is your pulse still so slow?

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Your Majesty is strong.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
My body is a body that is about to be broken.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't care how I look at it.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll just take care of those

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
who are in the forbidden area.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll just eat them.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You're the last winner.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's not good for Li State.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What's the good of it?

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Your Majesty is saying that

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I have no more days.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But I still caused the blood of Li State to be ruined.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You have no children.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Li State will definitely start a war.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm a man of my word.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But I'm not a narrow-minded person.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's okay to tell you now.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
My nephew is as calm as a bird.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He will succeed.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yi Xin?

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why didn't I hear about this prince before?

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Because he is the most annoying son of the former Crown Prince.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He is not like his cruel father.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Then why don't you serve him directly?

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why do you still come to provoke me?

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The king is difficult to sit on.

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The king of Ning should have a deep feeling.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm not a good person.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I have no more days.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If I help Yi Xin,

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I will attract people to criticize me.

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I will make the country more powerful.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I might as well take care of everything.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I can also be at ease.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The ten cities in Ning State

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
are the last places I leave to Yi Xin.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The war is cruel.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What kind of people are they?

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You said that I took your ten cities.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But after all these years,

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
why didn't Li State take our city?

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If every generation of the country

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
is like you,

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
what do you want to take back?

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Can you still fight?

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You don't have to tell me these.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The king of Ning and the Prime Minister are kind.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Why don't you just return the ten cities in Ning State?

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I will ask someone to return them immediately.

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I think it's a coincidence.

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I think it's more convenient

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
to kill you.

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
At this time,

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
whether we withdraw the troops or not

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
is not something

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
that the Crown Prince can decide.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This is what I'm going to do.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You've been using him, right?

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
When did you start?

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You said you would help him to restore the country.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Restore the country?

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Do you really believe his words?

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
He was willing to help

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
because he was poisoned.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If he doesn't want to endure the pain of his heart,

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
he can only return to the country

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and die.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You...

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It seems that love can really blind people.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Lian Yuechi is also like this.

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He is not a person.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I can't see that he is a white-haired man.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I just returned to Li State.

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I heard that the princess

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
that the late Empress gave birth to was found.

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What did you say?

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The new princess of Ning State, Changping,

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
is the princess of the late Empress?

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
She is the princess of the late Empress?

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
She is the princess of the late Empress?

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
She is the princess of the late Empress?

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The new princess of the late Empress?

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
She is the princess of the late Empress?

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
She is the princess of the late Empress?

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
How is that possible?

144
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
How is that possible?

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
When father ordered people to stay at Chang'an Temple at night,

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
he wanted to capture the princess and the Empress alive.

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
he wanted to capture the princess and the Empress alive.

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But he only found their bodies.

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Now that the bodies are safe,

150
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
the people are still alive.

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What is the reason?

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What a useful trick.

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
My old grudge

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
has finally been used.

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Please.

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Princess Changping.

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What is it?

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't be so cold.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I especially thought that you

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
were the fake princess of Ning State.

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I especially thought that you

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
were the fake princess of Ning State.

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I think a fake princess

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
needs something real to keep her body.

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I think a fake princess needs something real to keep her body.

166
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
For example,

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
my bone poison.

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You mean,

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Jiang Yunqing...

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
No.

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's Xue Jingguan?

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yuexian doesn't need to be angry with me

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
for this matter.

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I did it on purpose,

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
but I still didn't get hold of it.

176
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Xue Jingguan is never a simple person.

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Xue Jingguan is never a simple person.

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
She's so pedantic.

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yet Gu transparent

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
will only spoile her Position.

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
She even would

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
donate her own life.

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,500
This female is so inc mariable

184
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,500
that it's inevitable that ,

185
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
for her great numbers,

186
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
she would give me

187
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,000
army money

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and take away my life.

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
She was born from a family Professor.

190
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
She indicated She or find out.

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,800
If it wasn't for the ability of Qian Ning State to break through,

192
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,200
and her ability to turn the clouds into rain,

193
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,400
the future wouldn't be like this.

194
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,400
This woman's ability is rare in this world.

195
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,000
To be honest, I have a few things to admire about her.

196
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,400
Yue Chi, Yue Chi.

197
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,000
If you didn't break off your marriage with her,

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,800
otherwise, I wouldn't have seen what you would have ended up like.

199
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,000
Your Highness, you are too polite.

200
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,200
I think you have never seen her real face.

201
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:24,400
She is no different from the person you described.

202
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,200
I know her.

203
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,800
She is very emotional and bold.

204
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,600
She is independent and strong.

205
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,800
She can handle all the hardships on her own.

206
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,600
She can handle all the hardships on her own.

207
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,600
Back then, the princess stayed in Changmen Forest.

208
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,000
But you died.

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,600
For the rest of your life, you have to atone for your sins.

210
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,800
That's why, I want to protect her for the rest of my life.

211
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,000
I care about her and admire her.

212
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,600
I am never her identity or bloodline.

213
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,000
Your Majesty, if everything is fine, I will put down two books of fireworks.

214
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,600
Your Highness, when you go out,

215
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,200
I will arrange someone to send you back to Li State.

216
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Before this, I have one more thing to ask of you.

217
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,200
She doesn't even want her own life.

218
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,400
I don't have the heart to control her with poison.

219
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,400
I will send you a favor.

220
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,600
After Ping'an leaves, I will give her to you.

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,800
I will give her the antidote.

222
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,800
It seems that I must guarantee that you can leave safely.

223
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Your Majesty, we are late.

224
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
The bandits have been arrested and taken away.

225
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,000
We have already sent the princesses and the Crown Prince to escape.

226
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,400
Please punish us, Your Majesty.

227
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,600
It happened so suddenly. You have done a good job.

228
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,400
Get up.

229
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,200
Your Highness.

230
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,000
I told you that I will guarantee that you can leave safely.

231
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,600
Wei Zhang.

232
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,920
Do you think that I would be willing to let you go on looking elsewhere?

233
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,360
Let us pay respect to the princess.

234
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,200
Your Highness.

235
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,840
Chief General, how are you?

236
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,640
I'm fine.

237
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:46,220
Just small

238
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,200
Chief,

239
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,700
are you alright?

240
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,760
Not at all.

241
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
Just small.....

242
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
What are you thinking?

243
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
What Ning and Yuechi said

244
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
is not entirely wrong.

245
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
That day in the cave,

246
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
he could have easily killed me.

247
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
But when Li was in chaos,

248
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Ning could have made a big attack.

249
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Even when they took Li,

250
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
they could have taken Hua Ye,

251
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
and the east coast of Qin,

252
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
and spread the map to the biggest.

253
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
But he didn't do that.

254
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
What he cherished

255
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
is the current peace

256
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
in Ning.

257
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
But...

258
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
But...

259
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
But when the re-administration of the stone scrolls

260
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
is back in the court,

261
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
it's still not as good as the Crown Prince.

262
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
The position of the stone scroll in Qiongzhou

263
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
is special.

264
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
It's the place where Li's natural disasters

265
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
and insects are the least.

266
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Now, the jade insects are not out for a day.

267
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
The stone scroll is out.

268
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
It means

269
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Li can't even

270
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
harvest a grain of grain.

271
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
I wonder if Li has enough grain.

272
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Huo Jing Heng has said so many big things.

273
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Can he solve

274
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
the actual problem of Li?

275
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Officer Xue,

276
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
you're too reckless.

277
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
But do you remember

278
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
who you were killed by?

279
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
I haven't

280
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
told you about the West Gu Bridge yet.

281
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
How could there be three generals?

282
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
I advise the Crown Prince

283
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
not to act rashly.

284
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Otherwise, the Crown Prince

285
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
will be killed.

286
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
It's not wrong

287
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
to do so.

288
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I forgot who

289
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
brought you back from the battlefield.

290
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Without me,

291
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
there would be no retrograde.

292
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
That's ridiculous.

293
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
This is the people of Da Ning.

294
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
They are all from the Ming Dynasty.

295
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Do you want to

296
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
listen to the call of the Crown Prince of Li?

297
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
The Crown Prince

298
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
probably doesn't want to

299
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
join the Ming Dynasty

300
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
to attack the Li Dynasty.

301
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Officer Xue,

302
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
I really want to see you.

303
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
When I return to Li,

304
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
I'll gather the army

305
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
and start the war.

306
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Very good.

307
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
I'll bring people

308
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
to meet you in ten days.

309
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
The people of Li will thank you

310
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
for choosing the right path.

311
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Officer Xue,

312
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
before the moon was gone,

313
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
the Prime Minister asked me for your antidote.

314
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
To me,

315
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
the pity of men

316
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
is the most useless thing.

317
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Please remember,

318
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
from now on,

319
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
we only have the cooperation.

320
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
There is no more separation.

321
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,600
Your Majesty,

322
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
the army has passed the gate of the imperial gate.

323
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Now, the east and south sides

324
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
are moving in a hurry.

325
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
It's urgent to send the troops now.

326
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Your Majesty,

327
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
the Ministry of War asked for an urgent report.

328
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Please issue an order

329
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
to withdraw 20,000 gold from the North.

330
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
In addition,

331
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
we are fighting for five years

332
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
to get the army back.

333
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Your Majesty,

334
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
the army has been sent to the north.

335
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
In addition, we are fighting for five thousand soldiers

336
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
to suppress the rebels.

337
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
The assassins are fighting for the army.

338
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
I'm afraid they're not enough.

339
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Your Majesty,

340
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
the battle at the west bridge

341
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
is not for the Qilin soldiers to save the army.

342
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
The assassins are using their time.

343
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
No.

344
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
The moon is the only one who raises the army.

345
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
How can they use the Qilin army again?

346
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
These people must be punished.

347
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Your Majesty,

348
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
I agree.

349
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
The Qilin soldiers

350
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,600
who killed Chen Shou

351
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
have already left the military base and scattered in the city.

352
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
It's not a military city.

353
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
The Qilin army

354
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
is a former dynasty.

355
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Yes.

356
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Who doesn't have a few personal guards in the court?

357
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Yue family has been a family of three generations.

358
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
The military city that once belonged to his family

359
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
is naturally not counted.

360
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
How can this be considered as evidence of rebellion?

361
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Zuo Xia,

362
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
the Qilin army was in a battle.

363
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
When the rebellion was in full swing,

364
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
it was still fighting against your army.

365
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
You tell me

366
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
that's just a guard.

367
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Your Majesty, the military situation is urgent.

368
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
I request Your Majesty to immediately issue an order

369
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
to send troops to the north to fight against the enemy. Your Majesty.

370
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
I think Yue Chi

371
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
should be punished for hiding the army

372
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
and a large number of military weapons.

373
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
In addition, the previous dynasty's Yue family

374
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
was a crime.

375
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
The Qilin army should be killed immediately.

376
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Yes.

377
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
We also need to collect all the private property of the Yue family

378
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
and charge the military.

379
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Guards.

380
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Abolish the position of Yue Chi as the general

381
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
and put him in prison.

382
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Yes.

383
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Your Majesty, the military situation is urgent.

384
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Guards.

385
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Guards.

386
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
This is bad.

387
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
I overheard the conversation between the two officers.

388
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
The officials reported that

389
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
His Majesty was killed by the young master, Su Qin, the Qilin army.

390
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
His Majesty seems to be in a state of shock.

391
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
The commander-in-chief is helping him to get the goods

392
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
and the gold.

393
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
This ungrateful villain.

394
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
Guards.

395
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
He tried to kill the official of the court.

396
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Yue Chi is going to rebel.

397
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Now, both Wang and Qian are injured.

398
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
I am here.

399
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Please punish him quickly.

400
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Please punish Yue Chi.

401
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
He is suspended.

402
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Your Majesty.

403
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
The Qilin army is in prison.

404
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Guards.

405
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
What are you doing?

406
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,600
His Majesty wants to kill you.

407
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Hurry up.

408
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
It's too late to explain.

409
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
His Majesty is here.

410
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Yue Chi.

411
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
You are using the Qilin army to escape.

412
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Guards.

413
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Yue Chi has been keeping a low profile in prison.

414
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
They must have heard the rumors

415
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
from the traitors.

416
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Please investigate it.

417
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Your Majesty.

418
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
Now the evidence is clear.

419
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
The truth is right in front of us.

420
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Can you still believe Yue Chi's rumors?

421
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Don't force me.

422
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Please eliminate the evil party.

423
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Please eliminate the evil party.

424
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
Yue Chi.

425
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
You said in court that

426
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
you will never use the Qilin army.

427
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
Are you going to rebel?

428
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
The Qilin army is not a traitor.

429
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,600
I am the one who started this.

430
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
I will take the responsibility.

431
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
I will take the blame.

432
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Kill all the Qilin army.

433
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Kill them all.

434
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Huang Ying Heng.

435
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
I believe you, Yue Chi.

436
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
You never trusted me.

437
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
But now I am the emperor of Dining.

438
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
I have to kill my right-hand man.

439
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Kill them.

440
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
Go.

441
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Commander.

442
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
The emperor is a traitor.

443
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
He doesn't deserve your trust.

444
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
There are many brothers outside.

445
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Commander, you go first.

446
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Take him away.

447
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
No.

448
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Kill them.

449
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Kill them.

450
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Commander.

451
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Go.

452
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
Go.

453
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
Go.

454
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
Yu Yu.

455
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
You didn't leave.

456
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
I am waiting for you.

457
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Yue Chi.

458
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
If I didn't arrive in time,

459
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
the farmer's family

460
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
will go to receive the reward.

461
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
How is my brother?

462
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Did the emperor hurt him?

463
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
The emperor is not hurt.

464
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
He is not hurt.

465
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Did the emperor hurt him?

466
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
The emperor was badly injured

467
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
when he was fighting against Yue Chi.

468
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
He is not awake yet.

469
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Your Highness.

470
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
It's no use being anxious.

471
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
You should go back.

472
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
My brother is not a traitor.

473
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
Eunuch Gui.

474
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Let me take a look.

475
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
I can rest assured after I take a look at the emperor.

476
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Your Highness.

477
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
I dare not let you in without permission.

478
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
If the emperor sees you

479
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
and gets angry,

480
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
I can't afford to take the responsibility.

481
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Don't make it hard for me.

482
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
I'll help you.

483
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
No.

484
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
Don't move.

485
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
I'm not afraid.

486
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
I'm not afraid.

487
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,600
I'm not afraid.

488
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
I'm not afraid.

489
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Don't move.

490
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
The imperial physician said you can sit up.

491
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
I'm here to see you.

492
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

493
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
I've said

494
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
you'll be separated from Huo Jing Heng sooner or later.

495
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,600
I should have listened to your advice.

496
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
Your Highness saved my life.

497
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
I have nothing to repay you.

498
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
How can you have nothing to repay me?

499
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
I have nothing to repay you.

500
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Yue Chi.

501
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
You're a rare talent.

502
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
Huo Jing Heng treats you like this.

503
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
You don't want to doubt him.

504
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
But Ling Er is still in the palace.

505
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
I have a way to send Wen Rou into the palace.

506
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
I have a way to get my sister out.

507
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
But I'm from Da Ning.

508
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Da Ning.

509
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
The Da Ning you've been filial to

510
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
has taken everything away from you.

511
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Your family's reputation,

512
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
your brother's life,

513
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
your sister's freedom,

514
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
all of these are given by Huo Jing Heng.

515
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Yue Chi.

516
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
I promise you.

517
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Once we take back 10 pieces of Qiongzhou,

518
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,600
we'll withdraw our troops.

519
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
We'll never kill the people.

520
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
Really?

521
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,600
I promise you as the Crown Prince of Li State.

522
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
But I have one more request.

523
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
When you and I get Huo Jing Heng out,

524
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
I'll personally deal with him.

525
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,600
I want to avenge my Qin's soldiers.

526
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Okay.

527
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
You're a skilled warrior.

528
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
Not only are you the master of Da Ning,

529
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
the people of Li State

530
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
will also love you.

531
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Once you're recovered,

532
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
I'll appoint you as the Crown Prince.

533
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
My country is your world.

534
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

535
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
The army of the imperial army

536
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
has taken over the valley

537
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
and occupied the highlands.

538
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
When the Ning Army moves forward

539
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
and digs here,

540
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
we can ambush them.

541
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,600
One, two, three, four.

542
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
One, two, three, four.

543
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
One, two, three, four.

544
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
One, two, three, four.

545
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,600
One, two, three, four.

546
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,600
One, two, three, four.

547
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
One, two, three, four.

548
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
One, two, three, four.

549
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
One, two, three, four.

550
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
One, two, three, four.

551
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
We can also arrange a troop to advance

552
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
and occupy this military formation.

553
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
The imperial army can support us anytime.

554
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
What do you think?

555
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,600
Okay.

556
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Master, slow down. Don't fall.

557
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Consort Yue, where are you in such a hurry?

558
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,600
I'm going to beg Empress Dowager.

559
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
What are you going to do?

560
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
About my brother's mistake.

561
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Just send him here. Go back to work.

562
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,600
I just came out of Empress Dowager's palace.

563
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,600
Empress Dowager's message said

564
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
your brother escaped from the imperial city and went north.

565
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Now he has returned to Dali.

566
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,600
He is about to attack Dining with Yi Junyun.

567
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
Nonsense.

568
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,600
My brother won't do that.

569
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,600
Your brother won't.

570
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
But we are now in the trap of others.

571
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
Trap? What trap?

572
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,600
The Qilin Army's identity was exposed.

573
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
It was a real disaster.

574
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,600
The Qilin Army was caught in a trap.

575
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
The Qilin Army was caught in a trap.

576
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
They were provoked.

577
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
These are all traps.

578
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
They are to make your brother be forced to a deadlock.

579
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
It was Yi Qingyun?

580
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Yes.

581
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
But it wasn't her.

582
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Don't be a fool.

583
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,600
Tell me who it was.

584
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
It was the fake princess.

585
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Your brother's fiancee, Jiang Yunqing.

586
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
Jiang Yunqing.

587
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
How is that possible?

588
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
The Qilin Army's reaction was strange.

589
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Empress Dowager immediately sent someone to investigate.

590
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
Then she found out that your sister Yunqing

591
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,600
was a fake.

592
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
And the news that Yuechi was going to be executed

593
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
was also released on purpose.

594
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
No way.

595
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,600
My brother and sister Yunqing

596
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
have such a deep relationship.

597
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
He won't make my brother die.

598
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
I think he must have some reasons.

599
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
And last time,

600
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,600
he took me away for the sake of hurting me.

601
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
He's not that kind of person.

602
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,600
No matter what he has to suffer,

603
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
he shouldn't have done such a treacherous act

604
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
to betray his country.

605
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,600
Empress Dowager has sent someone to pursue this woman.

606
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
She has already found traces.

607
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
She's not willing to let it go.

608
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
I don't believe he would do that.

609
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
I want to ask him clearly.

610
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
Just a few words from you

611
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
can make him a death sentence?

612
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Don't be impulsive.

613
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
This person is very powerful.

614
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,600
What if he hurts you?

615
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,600
He won't hurt me.

616
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,600
But without the permission of the Emperor and Empress Dowager,

617
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
you can't leave the palace.

618
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,600
I can beg Empress Dowager

619
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
to let me go to the Chouan Temple

620
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
to pray for my husband

621
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
and repent for my brother.

622
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,600
If you insist on going,

623
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
I'll accompany you

624
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
to the southwest.

625
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
What's wrong?

626
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
Where's the place we're looking for?

627
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
I know a place.

628
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,600
I think he's hiding there.

629
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Okay, I'll listen to you.

630
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
You don't know how to ride a horse.

631
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
You're still using it.

632
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,600
I'm fine.

633
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,600
I found the thing that's important to me.

634
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
Find Sister Qing'er.

635
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,600
Go!

636
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Go!

637
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,600
There's a book?

638
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,600
Why is he here?

639
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
What's wrong, Ling'er?

640
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Sister Qing'er.

641
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
It's quite dark here.

642
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Sister Qing'er, the Empress Dowager ordered

643
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
to capture you everywhere.

644
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,600
So I was wondering if you were here.

645
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
So I came to see you.

646
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
You shouldn't have come.

647
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,600
The other day, the Qi Lin Army

648
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,600
was being controlled by someone

649
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,600
and the other day, the Qi Lin Army

650
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,600
was being controlled by someone

651
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
and the Qi Lin Army

652
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,600
was being controlled by someone

653
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,600
and the Qi Lin Army

654
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,600
was being controlled by someone

655
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,600
and Brother Ling'er was going to be executed.

656
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,600
They...

657
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,600
They said you were the one who sent the message.

658
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,600
It was me.

659
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
Do you know that

660
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Yue Chi was caught?

661
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Yue Chi?

662
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
That Yue Chi?

663
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,600
He was caught?

664
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
He was caught at last.

665
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
Yue Chi should be caught.

666
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
Sister Qing'er.

667
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,600
Why?

668
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Did Brother Ling'er help you

669
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,600
or was someone forcing you?

670
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Sister Qing'er, it's fine.

671
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,600
You can tell me

672
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
whatever you want.

673
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,600
I'm now Consort Yue.

674
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
I have the ability to help you.

675
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
Ling'er.

676
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,600
I've broken off my friendship with Yue Chi.

677
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,600
You're so considerate.

678
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,600
You're so considerate.

679
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
You're so considerate.

680
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,600
You have a long-standing friendship with Brother Ling'er.

681
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,600
I can be considerate of myself.

682
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Not to mention him.

683
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,600
As a citizen of Daning,

684
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,600
I've helped the country catch you

685
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
and betrayed your country.

686
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
But now,

687
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
I'm letting you go for Ling'er's sake.

688
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
But from now on,

689
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,600
if you dare to do anything

690
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
to hurt Yue Chi and Ling'er,

691
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,600
I won't let you off.

692
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Jiang Yuqing, go!

693
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,600
No!

694
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
I'm the state uncle.

695
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Consort Yue and I are here.

696
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Who dares to do anything?

697
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
Put them down!

698
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,600
Sister Qing'er.

699
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,600
Go.

700
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
Let's go, Ling'er.

701
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Let's go back to the palace.

702
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
No.

703
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
Where are you going?

704
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
You're going to find her?

705
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,600
Yes.

706
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Now, I've found

707
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
the only clue of Brother Ling'er.

708
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
You didn't chase her just now?

709
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
If I chased her just now,

710
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,600
would she let me chase her?

711
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
I was wondering

712
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
why you let her go just now.

713
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
I really couldn't

714
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
see Sister Qing'er in person.

715
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
I was wondering

716
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,600
why you let her go just now.

717
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
I couldn't see Sister Qing'er

718
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
die in front of me.

719
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
But

720
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Yue Chi cooperates with Yi Qingyun.

721
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
She's likely to appear

722
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
at the border of Linning.

723
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Do you know

724
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
how to go to the border?

725
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
How deep the mountain

726
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
should be?

727
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
Just you and me.

728
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
No matter what,

729
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
I must find my brother.

730
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Wait.

731
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
I'll go to ride the horse.

732
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,600
Is that okay?

733
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
I don't know anything.

734
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,600
I want to go by myself.

735
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
You all go back first.

736
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,600
I'll report this

737
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
to His Majesty and the Empress Dowager.

738
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Yes.

739
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
Look.

740
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
She's following us.

741
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,600
She finally caught up

742
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
before we told her.

743
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
How about we take a break?

744
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,600
I really can't stand it.

745
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,600
Sister Qing'er is standing up.

746
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Is she about to set off?

747
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
No.

748
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
I'll have a sip of water.

749
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
You don't have time to drink water.

750
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
Stop drinking.

751
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
You don't have time.

752
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
Follow her.

753
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Go.

754
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,600
Go.

755
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,600
This witch.

756
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
Song Qingzhou.

757
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
Stupid.

758
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
Sister Qing'er is far away.

759
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
Hurry up.

760
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
We should follow her.

761
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Go.

762
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
