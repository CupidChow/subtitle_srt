The Story of the Phoenix

2
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Episode 1

3
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,200
Sister Qu.

4
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Sister Qu.

5
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Ying Ying.

6
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Ying Ying.

7
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,600
Sister Qu.

8
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,400
You're awake.

9
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,500
Sister Qu, you're finally awake.

10
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,600
But you've ruined us.

11
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,800
Where am I?

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,200
Sister Qu.

13
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,400
Yufei is not Yufei...

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,900
Yufei is not Yufei.

15
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,700
Right now?

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,900
He's not Yufei.

17
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,600
But he saved us.

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,600
But he saved you.

19
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:46,700
No.

20
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,400
I have to go widow him.

21
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,000
Go by yourself.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,700
He saved me not only.

23
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,300
But also he made plans for me while I was working in the sont.

24
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,800
From the beginning, I was willing to do whatever he wanted to.

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,200
I can do it now.

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,800
I like Yue Fei now.

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,120
You guys are all so small.

28
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,440
Miss Xu, you should rest.

29
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,840
I'll come back to see you.

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,760
Your Highness.

31
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,320
Your Highness.

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
You...

33
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,440
I heard that

34
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,120
two days ago, Zhao Jie Yu got hurt

35
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,720
and he had a fight with someone.

36
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,320
We didn't mean it.

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,000
No one was hurt.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,240
Don't chase after him.

39
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,280
I won't chase after him.

40
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,120
But you should protect yourself.

41
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,520
I'm not going to chase after him.

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,920
I'm not going to chase after him.

43
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,080
I'm not going to chase after him.

44
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
I'm not going to chase after him.

45
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
I'm not going to chase after him.

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,520
Mr. Zheng,

47
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,560
you're going to save him later.

48
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,560
If something bad happens,

49
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,680
your brother will have to be treated like a real man.

50
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,880
I know.

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,680
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,080
This trust is in the future.

53
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,600
I'll show you my skills.

54
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,600
Take your blankets.

55
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,520
Hello, Mr. Zheng.

56
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,640
This Chief Xie Qing

57
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,280
of the Cем 난忙's band is under her warrant.

58
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,320
She's not Olga.

59
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,520
It's the sender flag.

60
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,480
For my opinion,

61
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,240
she doesn't need my help.

62
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,680
Your Highness.

63
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,320
This is the letter published by Yan and Nian.

64
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,200
Betrayal.

65
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,080
Your Majesty, we have to catch him.

66
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,080
I have a plan to make Hui Fei open the gate.

67
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,080
Wei Zhang, it seems that you are really a commander of the guards.

68
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
You really are a real criminal.

69
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,080
I should arrange a Eastern-style commander for you.

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
Why don't you leave?

71
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
Yes.

72
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Yes.

73
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,080
It's true that this person is not as simple as we thought.

74
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
You should observe him for a while.

75
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,080
Luckily, I got this note.

76
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,080
Otherwise, it would be a big mess.

77
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,080
But how did Hui Fei know Ling Er?

78
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,080
Brother.

79
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Ling Er.

80
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
What are you two talking about?

81
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
Nothing.

82
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Just chatting.

83
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
What are you wearing?

84
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,080
This is a new plum wine. Try it.

85
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Here.

86
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
Try it.

87
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
It's very clear and delicious.

88
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,080
I think you will like it.

89
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Tomorrow, you can give me some to the mother's factory.

90
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Okay.

91
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Ling Er, you are so polite.

92
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Why do you still come back to work?

93
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Brother, I like it.

94
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
The quality of the harem is good.

95
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,080
I have received the ancient dance and rice.

96
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,080
I will give you the wine.

97
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
Okay.

98
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,080
It's not a good thing to be a dog.

99
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
Ling Er likes the wine.

100
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Ling Er.

101
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Your Majesty.

102
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,080
This is my new plum wine.

103
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
Try it.

104
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,080
When can I take off the veil?

105
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
I have a lot of face.

106
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,080
But I don't know what I did wrong today.

107
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
And I have redness.

108
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Really?

109
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Let me see.

110
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,080
What are you hiding?

111
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,080
It seems that the color of the veil is almost good.

112
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
I have a bad color.

113
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
I have been drinking with the Empress Dowager for a long time.

114
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
I will leave first.

115
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
Don't be afraid.

116
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
No matter what,

117
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,080
you will always be our Yue Fei.

118
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,080
The wine is really clear and pure.

119
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,080
It's not poor to be dry.

120
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,080
Why does the word like the word of your son?

121
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
He has left.

122
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Sit down.

123
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,080
It's awkward to stand here.

124
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
No.

125
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,080
It's not the point.

126
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,080
The point is that the Empress Dowager is too calm to react to me.

127
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,080
If the Empress Dowager likes it,

128
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,080
I will bring it to you later.

129
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Okay.

130
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,080
Don't just let me drink alone.

131
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
You can drink too.

132
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
The best wine is the best.

133
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
Isn't it?

134
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,080
I...

135
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,080
I am pregnant.

136
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,080
I didn't see you drink less last time.

137
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
That's it.

138
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Since you have been the head of the harem,

139
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,080
you have been playing with flowers and playing with them.

140
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
Isn't that great?

141
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,080
Women,

142
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,080
don't look at me with two eyes.

143
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,080
You are always staring at men.

144
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
What's the point?

145
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,080
You don't want to look at yourself, right?

146
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,080
You look very young.

147
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,080
No, no.

148
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,080
I don't dare to compare with the Empress Dowager.

149
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
I respect you.

150
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,080
I feel that Empress Dowager is so happy.

151
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,080
I think she really likes this Consort Yu.

152
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,080
She likes it.

153
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
She likes it very much.

154
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
She is smart.

155
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
She has a small face.

156
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,080
She has a small skin.

157
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,080
If she can give her a grandson,

158
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
she will be very happy.

159
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,080
She will definitely be like the Empress Dowager.

160
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
You all don't know that Zhao Yingwan

161
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,080
took off my veil.

162
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
She said after she saw me,

163
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,080
I am the Yue Fei that they are sure to recognize.

164
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,080
I was touched at that time.

165
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,080
I think that Miss is really a good girl.

166
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Miss is really like that.

167
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,080
But this is not the point.

168
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,080
The point is the Empress Dowager.

169
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Guess what she said.

170
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
What did she say?

171
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,080
She said,

172
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,080
what is a good daughter-in-law?

173
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:20,080
As long as the emperor likes to have a good daughter-in-law with the family,

174
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
I am very nervous.

175
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
I said yes, yes, yes.

176
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
But she also said that

177
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
I have her style back then.

178
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,080
She is very good at writing.

179
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
Then?

180
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,080
I was nervous.

181
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
I drank a few more glasses.

182
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
Then I was drunk.

183
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
When I was drunk, she sent me back.

184
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
You are so careless.

185
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,080
You can drink in front of the Empress Dowager in broad daylight.

186
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
Don't look at me.

187
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,080
I am always looking at you.

188
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,080
Actually, I am like a famous woman.

189
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,080
She already knows the real identity of Yue Fei.

190
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Yes.

191
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,080
But she keeps looking at me and not saying anything.

192
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,080
It's okay to be with me.

193
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,080
Now I am most worried about Ling Er.

194
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,080
You will be too self-confident in front of other people.

195
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,080
If there are other people who ask you about the matter of appearance,

196
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,080
you can pretend to be stupid and impulsive.

197
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,080
Especially Hui Fei.

198
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,080
Don't worry. I have something to say.

199
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Let's eat.

200
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
Let's eat.

201
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Rong Yingxuan has done a good job recently.

202
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,080
This King Fan doesn't say anything.

203
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,080
It's not like before.

204
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,080
The old master's house was broken for a week.

205
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,080
I was so worried about the future.

206
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,080
But I will keep it.

207
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
I will use it in the future.

208
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,080
Now there are more people who ask me to be a favor.

209
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,080
Where are you looking at?

210
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,080
You think the moon should be bright?

211
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
It's okay.

212
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,080
I will make Ling Er wear a pillow.

213
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,080
But after May,

214
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,080
where can we get a pillow?

215
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,080
Then Ling Er will say he was careless.

216
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
No.

217
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
The royal family is important.

218
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
If there is an accident,

219
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,080
the court will be responsible for it.

220
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Then put your head on the pillow first.

221
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,080
When it's time to be born,

222
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
find another one for Ling Er.

223
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,080
I don't want to say that Ling Er is a crybaby.

224
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,080
How can we bring Ling Er into the palace?

225
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
Ling Wei.

226
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,080
Where can we find a baby?

227
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
Steal.

228
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
Grab.

229
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Buy.

230
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
It's not suitable, right?

231
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,080
It's the baby.

232
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,080
We are between seven and eight years old.

233
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,080
We have eight months to sonrax.

234
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,080
Who are you?

235
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Xiaoshun.

236
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
It's me.

237
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Big Brother.

238
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,080
Why are you here?

239
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,080
I am still worried about you.

240
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,080
Worried about what?

241
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,880
I thought you would be able to put your mouth on the court

242
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,080
and scare me.

243
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
You are just a dream.

244
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,080
What's the point of coming here?

245
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,080
I want you to think of a way to make Yue Fei disappear.

246
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,080
To cut off the bloodline.

247
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,280
But he saved you.

248
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,880
I've always wanted to do things that I couldn't.

249
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,480
I can do it now.

250
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,480
I don't like Yue Fei now.

251
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,680
You guys...

252
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,480
You guys are all thinking the same.

253
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
What?

254
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,480
Did you forget the bloodline of the family?

255
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Yue Fei is indeed a good man.

256
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,080
Only in a few days,

257
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,080
will you be able to move the demon.

258
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,280
Can you do it?

259
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Are you the family that you lost?

260
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,280
Don't worry, Brother Yi.

261
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,680
I won't forget the bloodline.

262
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,680
This is the medicine for the flower.

263
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,080
It's a blood-dry medicine.

264
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
Wei Zhang.

265
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,680
Do you hear me?

266
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
Yes, I do.

267
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,480
I've given Yue Fei a bottle of flower medicine.

268
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,080
Let her take the bloodline and cut off the bloodline.

269
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Wei Zhang.

270
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,280
You must keep an eye on Yue Fei at all times.

271
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,680
Let's report it to the police.

272
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,080
Let's just catch him.

273
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,080
Go.

274
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
I'll go with you.

275
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
I'll go with you.

276
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
I'll go with you.

277
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,080
I'll go with you.

278
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
I'll go with you.

279
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
I'll go with you.

280
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
I'll go with you.

281
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
God.

282
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,280
The Did Die have got taken?

283
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
My late guest.

284
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,520
Nope...

285
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,440
for the winner's part.

286
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,760
Empress Dowager,

287
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,600
what is the next plan?

288
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,800
A fame-ücken dove map.

289
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,080
MingyiWang must professional turn

290
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,360
the š harvest in advance.

291
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,760
As for

292
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,760
the changing of

293
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,760
forwarder double identifying

294
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,200
the number of imports

295
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
that will save our country,

296
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,840
he said the choice

297
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,360
was necessary.

298
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,320
Your Majesty, you're miss the real pattern.

299
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,240
citizen Wang,

300
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
Okay.

301
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,040
The last one.

302
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,240
The door is open.

303
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,440
Are those the same sound again?

304
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,240
No, they aren't.

305
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,440
I'm so angry.

306
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
This is so good.

307
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,640
I'll play the game later.

308
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,640
I'll play the game later.

309
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,240
Feng Feng.

310
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,440
I'm so angry.

311
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,640
I'm so angry.

312
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,240
Sister, why didn't you go in after the game?

313
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,840
Sister, don't worry.

314
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,840
We also got the imperial decree

315
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,440
to come to the palace to pay the money.

316
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,040
To protect Sister and Long Tai's safety.

317
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,240
But...

318
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,440
Sister, you went in and tried.

319
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,640
Don't be so careless.

320
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,840
Besides, we don't need to be so angry.

321
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
Right?

322
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,240
It's your turn.

323
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,440
I'm so angry.

324
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,240
Xiao Wu, come here again.

325
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,840
Where can I go?

326
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,840
It seems like I have to think of some other ways.

327
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,840
What should I do?

328
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,840
The Empress Dowager

329
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,240
has put Feng Luan Palace as a water leak.

330
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,040
She knows it's protecting her.

331
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,240
She doesn't know it's for the criminal.

332
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,840
The Empress Dowager suddenly noticed

333
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,840
that not only Wei Na's concubines and Cao Meng,

334
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,840
but also Wei Na's concubines.

335
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,840
Do you think the Empress Dowager knows

336
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840
that Yue Fei is not pregnant?

337
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,840
You can't tell.

338
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,840
Mother is not pregnant

339
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,840
no matter how pregnant she is.

340
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,840
Mother is determined to have a grandchild.

341
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,840
Then...

342
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
What should we do now?

343
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,840
Let's go out first.

344
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,840
Where is the Emperor and Yue Fei going?

345
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,840
Why are you here, Mother?

346
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,840
You are also the Empress Dowager.

347
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Your Majesty.

348
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
Why am I here?

349
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,840
I'm here to see my daughter-in-law,

350
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840
and grandchild.

351
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
Yue Fei is not going.

352
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
It's dangerous out there.

353
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,840
Besides, this is the head of our harem.

354
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,840
It must be protected.

355
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,840
Right, Eunuch Wang?

356
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,840
Of course, we should be careful.

357
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,840
I'll take you to practice a magic trick.

358
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840
Let's go practice.

359
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,840
You didn't say you were a genius.

360
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
You are so funny.

361
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840
My grandchild is determined.

362
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840
He has to be born with a condition.

363
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
He has to be born without a condition.

364
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
You can't take it.

365
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,840
It's hard to say.

366
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
I told Ling'er that I wanted to eat sour food.

367
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
Especially, I wanted to eat the sour tea

368
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,840
which was so delicious.

369
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
Yue went out to buy it.

370
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
She told Eunuch Wang to report to the Empress Dowager.

371
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,840
Empress Dowager has always wanted to eat sour food.

372
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
She is not interested in eating.

373
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
She is a lazy girl.

374
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
Don't say that.

375
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
The same as the boys and girls.

376
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
There's no such thing as a pre-debate.

377
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,840
I don't have any.

378
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
That's not important.

379
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,840
The important thing is, I asked Xiao Yue to go to Yanling Palace

380
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
and put the stone box at the door.

381
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
I installed it in the long room and didn't lose it.

382
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,840
And sent someone to monitor it.

383
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,840
The man just told me that

384
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,840
he saw the concubine taking medicine inside.

385
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
That's great.

386
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
Xiao Yue.

387
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
Okay.

388
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Has the concubine taken the medicine?

389
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,840
Yes.

390
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
All of this can finally end.

391
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,840
The Empress Dowager has arrived.

392
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,840
I welcome the Empress Dowager.

393
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,840
What brings you here, Empress Dowager?

394
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,840
Yue Fei.

395
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,840
I heard that you like to eat sour and sweet cakes.

396
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
I'm happy.

397
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,840
This means that you're going to take the son-in-law's photo.

398
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,840
It's not that I'm a boy and a girl.

399
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,840
I'm really happy.

400
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,840
So I called the face of the dragon and the couple

401
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,840
to ask the master to make us the freshest sour and sweet cakes.

402
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,840
Look.

403
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,840
We can't eat the freshest things in the future.

404
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Take it.

405
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,840
What are you waiting for?

406
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,840
It's too cold.

407
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Look at the taste.

408
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,840
Try it.

409
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,840
It's delicious.

410
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
Right?

411
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,840
She's the first person to come here.

412
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
Look at Yue Fei's face.

413
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
She's so soft.

414
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,840
It's different from what I'm doing now.

415
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,840
Her sister-in-law is too sweet.

416
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,840
Yulin, it's not a big deal.

417
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,840
What are you doing?

418
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,840
She must be so cute.

419
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,840
Right?

420
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,840
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

421
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,840
Feng Lan Gong can't get into those mosquitoes' hiding place.

422
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,840
And those things that are not dry,

423
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
food,

424
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,840
you have to check the information.

425
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,840
What's that?

426
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,840
Don't let her come here.

427
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,840
Follow me.

428
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,840
You have to check it carefully.

429
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,840
Is it delicious?

430
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,840
She's out again.

431
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,840
There's no way.

432
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,840
Let's check

433
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,840
how Hui Fei and the next plan

434
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,840
will be discussed.

435
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
How will we do it?

436
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,840
But where do we know about her next plan?

437
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,840
What?

438
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,840
No one reviewed our plan.

439
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,040
I think

440
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,040
we need to think carefully about how this plan would end.

441
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
From now on,

442
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,840
no one will cook us cooked dishes

443
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,840
that could use them in great danger.

444
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,840
All that's left to be done is

445
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,840
to pay a connect ،

446
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,440
since we don't want to ruin your plan.

447
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,840
You can start over with your hunting plan.

448
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
However,

449
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,240
if you let Yulin go and

450
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,840
you announce the end of the plan,

451
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,040
I thought of a way.

452
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,800
How about I get in?

453
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,160
I don't need Yue Fei's identity.

454
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,680
I put on a black face

455
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,840
and pretend to be a beautiful maid.

456
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,840
Anyway, I don't know

457
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,400
what the beauty of the palace looks like.

458
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,280
I just approached her.

459
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,360
She said that because of the left-hand thing,

460
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,800
Yue Fei was punished.

461
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,360
I regretted it and wanted to take revenge on her.

462
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,760
In this way,

463
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,080
we'll know

464
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,920
what she's going to do next.

465
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,480
No.

466
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,040
You're too dangerous.

467
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,560
Brother.

468
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,680
I know this Hui Fei very well.

469
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,160
I was the one who asked her to take charge of the house.

470
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,600
Actually, she's not bad.

471
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,680
So I think

472
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,880
if something goes wrong,

473
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,520
there's no big deal.

474
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,760
You're so naive.

475
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,960
If she's not that good to us,

476
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,800
how can she take the risk

477
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,960
of harming Huang Si's mouth to help Cao Meng?

478
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,240
Fine.

479
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,960
I'll do as you say.

480
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,880
Nicely said,

481
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,240
celebrating her childhood.

482
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,280
Class Roberts.

483
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:55,960
Aunt.

484
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,020
Aunt.

485
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,800
Aunt.

486
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,000
Aunt.

487
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,440
I'm not your stores'ringer.

488
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,360
What are you doing?

489
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,540
Your aunt.

490
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,740
Aunt.

491
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,980
Aunt.

492
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,820
Aunt.

493
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
Aunt.

494
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,820
Aunt.

495
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,820
Aunt.

496
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,420
Why are you so clumsy?

497
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,060
I suspect that someone has revealed the seal to the Empress Dowager.

498
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,980
Although the Imperial Concubines of Feng Lan Palace have withdrawn the evidence,

499
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,460
it's still the first time I know the news about Feng Lan Palace.

500
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,180
It's hard to find out.

501
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,460
Reveal the seal?

502
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,860
Who?

503
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,860
Oh no.

504
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,020
I was starving when I left the front door.

505
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,420
I was full of energy.

506
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,540
I was starving when I left the front door.

507
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,940
I was full of energy.

508
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,340
I was full of energy.

509
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,540
I was full of energy.

510
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,940
I was full of energy.

511
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,540
I was full of energy.

512
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,940
I was full of energy.

513
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,340
I was full of energy.

514
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,540
I was full of energy.

515
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,940
I was full of energy.

516
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,540
I was full of energy.

517
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,940
I was full of energy.

518
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,340
I was full of energy.

519
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,940
I was full of energy.

520
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,340
I was full of energy.

521
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,940
I was full of energy.

522
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,540
I was full of energy.

523
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,940
I was full of energy.

524
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,340
I was full of energy.

525
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,940
I was full of energy.

526
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,140
I was full of energy.

527
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,140
I was full of energy.

528
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,140
The ceremony for Feng Lan Palace

529
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,840
Head of the Empress can lead to the imperial palace's breach.

530
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,840
They, Feng Lan Palace,

531
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,740
can have thehora of translation to promote actor一下出 breeze.

532
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,140
That's it!

533
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,340
Let's have a look later.

534
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,140
It's on the walls,

535
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,940
there's also a screen.

536
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,740
I didn't see OH patterns in the weakness.

537
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,740
The panoramic gaze and womangery,

538
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,740
The palace is full of people. We are still young.

539
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,740
Are you going to be born soon?

540
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,740
What do you mean?

541
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,740
There must be someone inside the wall of Tongqiang.

542
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,740
You must succeed.

543
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,740
The hat is gone.

544
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,740
It's gone.

545
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,740
Did you hear them plan just now?

546
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,740
They seem to be doing something to me.

547
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,740
Are you still afraid?

548
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,740
Qiyin is not bad. She won't hurt my heart.

549
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,740
I'm sorry.

550
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,740
They are going to hurt you.

551
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,740
You should help them talk.

552
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,740
They seem to be more hurt than you.

553
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,740
Are you confused?

554
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,740
Don't move.

555
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,740
The Empress of the Palace

556
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,740
Episode 1

557
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,740
I'm pissed off.

558
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,740
Don't you know what she's done?

559
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,740
What can she do?

560
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,740
She's asking for someone else's birthday party.

561
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,740
Don't you want to ask for Yue Fei?

562
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,740
What happened?

563
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,740
She's fighting.

564
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,740
I can tell.

565
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,740
What am I ugly for?

566
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,740
What are you talking about?

567
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,740
Can't the Empress know anything?

568
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,740
She can.

569
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,740
But she's so young.

570
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,740
Why is she so angry?

571
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,740
I'm pissed off.

572
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,740
I asked you if she would send you a post

573
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,740
to let you attend her birthday party.

574
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,740
Is that true?

575
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,740
I just found out.

576
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,740
I can't go.

577
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,740
I want to go.

578
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,740
Why?

579
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,740
What if something happens?

580
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,740
Will His Majesty protect me?

581
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,740
Really?

582
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,740
Yes.

583
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,740
I will protect Ling'er.

584
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,740
Then you can't.

585
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,740
I'm not ugly.

586
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,740
I'm the criminal who is

587
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,740
in the court.

588
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,740
Enough.

589
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,740
You can do it.

590
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,740
But you can't eat.

591
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,740
You can't fool around.

592
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,740
If you lose,

593
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,740
I will definitely lose.

594
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,740
Did you get it?

595
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,740
I got it.

596
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,740
I got it.

597
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,740
Isn't this the famous class of Huang Chen?

598
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,740
Isn't this class

599
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,740
a class that can be played with when you're invited?

600
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,740
It's still your strength.

601
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
Enjoy yourselves.

602
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,740
Enjoy yourselves.

603
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,740
Eat and drink.

604
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
Thank you.

605
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,740
Thank you.

606
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,740
It's so beautiful.

607
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,740
I've put too much medicine in every dish.

608
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,740
I don't believe it.

609
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,740
Or I'll die.

610
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,740
His Majesty is here.

611
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,740
Greetings, Your Majesty.

612
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,740
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

613
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,740
Your Majesty.

614
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,740
Come on.

615
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,740
This way.

616
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,740
Empress Dowager.

617
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,740
Okay.

618
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,740
Okay.

619
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,740
Come on.

620
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,740
Be careful.

621
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,740
Sister Yuehui.

622
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,740
You're here.

623
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,740
Look.

624
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,740
This is the osmanthus cake I made myself.

625
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,740
Try it.

626
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,740
It's delicious.

627
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,740
Thank you, Sister Qu.

628
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,740
Happy birthday.

629
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,740
I haven't had a good time.

630
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,740
I've been walking around.

631
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,740
It's okay.

632
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,740
It's good.

633
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,740
Yuehui.

634
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,740
It's not arranged like this.

635
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,740
Yuehui.

636
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,740
Where are you going?

637
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,740
Come back.

638
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,740
Why is the girl gone?

639
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,740
Empress Dowager.

640
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,740
Look.

641
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,740
Why is the girl so dark?

642
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,740
Yuehui.

643
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,740
Yuehui.

644
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,740
Wait.

645
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,740
What's wrong?

646
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,740
Hua.

647
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,740
Hua.

648
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,740
Sister Yuehui.

649
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,740
Let's go back and eat.

650
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,740
Dad.

651
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
No need.

652
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,740
Go back.

653
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,740
You're a liar.

654
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,740
It's not me.

655
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,740
It's not good.

656
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,740
Her Highness Yuehui was taken to the water by Her Highness Hui.

657
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,740
It's not me.

658
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,740
Don't repeat it.

659
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,740
It's not me.

660
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,740
Where's the savior?

661
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,740
Ling'er.

662
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,740
Ling'er.

663
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,740
Ling'er.

664
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,740
Ling'er.

665
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,740
She's here.

666
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,740
Your Highness.

667
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,740
I'm here.

668
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,740
Your Highness.

669
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,740
What's going on?

670
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,740
Yuehui.

671
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,740
Your Highness.

672
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,740
She's taken to the water by Her Highness Hui.

673
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,740
Yuehui.

674
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,740
How dare you!

675
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,740
Come here.

676
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,740
Catch her.

677
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,740
It's not me.

678
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,740
It's not me.

679
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,740
It's not me.

680
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,740
It's not me.

681
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,740
Let me go.

682
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,740
It's not me.

683
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,740
Let me go.

684
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,740
It's not me.

685
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,740
It's not me.

686
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,740
역.

687
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,740
儿媳妇

688
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,740
A news day has come.

689
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,740
12th April.

690
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,740
Happy New Year.

691
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,740
Thank you for the birthday present.

692
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,740
I have so much to do with you.

693
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,740
Theubso,

694
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,740
it's Your Highness' birthday.

695
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,740
Why does she look at me in this hour?

696
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,740
It is my birthday.

697
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,740
You're going to wish me good luck?

698
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,360
I calculated carefully not to expect these trips to intercede.

699
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,980
My Lord, were There any sequencing program channels when nighttime was on?

700
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,060
No one was watching.

701
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,740
Ya steam!

702
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,740
Not only their grille,

703
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:44,040
but these private records saved us.

704
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,560
I will not let her go.

705
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,120
Your Majesty.

706
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,360
Mother, please restrain yourself.

707
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,960
Your Majesty,

708
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,640
this may not be the case.

709
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,640
Your child...

710
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,160
The child is no longer here.

711
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,280
Just let her go.

712
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,400
I and Yue Fei

713
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,200
will be safe.

714
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,680
Okay.

715
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,280
The emperor and Yue Fei are so close.

716
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,480
I will be so happy today.

717
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,600
Let's go back to the palace.

718
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,800
Your Majesty,

719
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,280
I must be

720
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,360
so worried today.

721
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,760
I can go back this time

722
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,160
and rest in peace.

723
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,000
Thank you.

724
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,720
Sister Deng.

725
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,400
You have been with me since I met you today.

726
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,000
I'm glad that Jun Yujing

727
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,760
and his grandmother standing here

728
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,640
are not happy with you.

729
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,240
Me?

730
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,600
All right,

731
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,520
Just find my son now.

732
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,480
я

733
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,280
I saw him happy to die.

734
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,280
He and Yue Fei are in a trance.

735
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
Could it be...

736
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,080
Let's do it this way first.

737
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,080
What if there's a chance?

738
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,680
There might be a grandson in the future.

739
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,680
A grandson?

740
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,080
Empress Dowager, you're right.

741
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,680
I'm so angry.

742
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,880
Your Majesty.

743
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,480
You really are a traitor to your brother.

744
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,880
Hui Fei, what else do you have to say?

745
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,880
The decree of the imperial court has been issued today.

746
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,480
Ye Ning Palace is closed.

747
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,280
No one can visit it without a decree.

748
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,280
Yes.

749
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Your Majesty.
