1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If victory is not decided, let me fight

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The wind and moon are in the human world

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The youth is known as the old youth

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The past is the past, the past is the past

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
A sword flies after falling

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Spring breeze is like a leaf

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,260
The

8
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,200
Legend of Qingchuan

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Episode 16

10
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,000
The old general led the northwest army to the city of Guazhou

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and retreated to the mountain of Fengyuan

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The old general led the northwest army to the mountain of Fengyuan

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and retreated to the mountain of Fengyuan

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You can just say it

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How many hours do I have left?

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
As long as one month

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Doctor, think again

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Forget it, you didn't make it difficult for him

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Leave

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Your Majesty, you don't need to believe this doctor

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I have already seen through life and death

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I just didn't expect this day to come so fast

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yang, do you think this battle is still not over?

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Your Majesty, why do you say that?

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No matter when the battle begins, the two countries will be at war

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The world will be full of war

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The world will be full of war

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The Great Wall is coming, I can't help Yixin

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yixin is young, even if he is not in the throne

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
How can he face such a disaster?

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Can he sit still in this country?

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But at this point, do we still have a way out?

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yin is right

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Your Highness, do you still have a way out?

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't know what kind of medicine Huo Jingheng gave you

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Since the last time you came out, you have been swaying and raising your flag

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But no matter what, please don't hesitate

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yixin is in my hands

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If you don't help me and let Li Jun listen to me

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I will let him die in front of you

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
At this time, you don't have to worry about

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
whether he can sit still in this country

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Officer Xue

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Your Highness

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Give me the flute

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I want to kill you

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Your Highness

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Are you looking for this?

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Choose whatever you want

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I have lost my sense of sense of loss

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You can blow the flute and let me die here

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
As long as you want Yixin to die with me

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Worry about yourself

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Father

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Li Jun and Fu Guohui have taken power

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and the next is Xiong Xiong.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It seems that we can't avoid a fierce battle.

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
How about sending the emissaries to test Shang Quan?

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If they are smart enough,

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
they won't be defeated.

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm afraid they are already in a state of dismay.

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If we want to make peace,

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
we must return to Ning.

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Since ancient times, the winner is the king and the loser is the king.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's right.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
They are still not convinced.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
They are still thinking about it.

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
According to what the previous king said,

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's okay to say it alone.

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He asked to restore the Jiang family.

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The Jiang family's dynasty.

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Leave.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This is a provocation.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's okay.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I didn't expect them.

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This is a big battle.

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But I don't know...

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The girl from the Yue family is still in their hands.

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll go find Officer Xue.

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You still dream of them missing their old love.

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The Green Gorge was counter 초� NI.

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We said it too late.

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Seems long ago we were already allowed to use the morale of the truth.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
When I took part in the battle against you

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
When I joined the en route force,

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I caused no damage to the people.

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No, that's what you said?

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No, that was like Qiao Wenpei?

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
As yollinan called in 683 pory.

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Having been called in this way for 6 years,

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,400
You chose it yourself.

93
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,480
You're the most loyal person.

94
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,000
Even if you have the assistant of Li State,

95
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,240
Yi Qingyun is not a good person.

96
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,880
She's half-wit and half-naked.

97
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,880
She's the one who's to blame.

98
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,680
She's just a sick cat.

99
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,600
You don't have to worry about me.

100
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,560
But,

101
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,920
Prime Minister Yue is loyal to you.

102
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,840
If you really care about the people,

103
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,720
you can persuade Huo Jingheng to go back to Shunning.

104
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,400
Let her keep the story

105
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,880
in her memory.

106
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,880
I don't have any meaning to keep this gushan.

107
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
I'll give it to you.

108
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,480
No need.

109
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,440
I couldn't give you anything back then.

110
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,200
Now, I don't need to give you anything.

111
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,840
As for this gushan,

112
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,240
or the gushan's blessing,

113
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,840
I can never give you a single cent.

114
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,640
How is it?

115
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,160
The person who gave the gushan the gushan

116
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,160
seems to have sneaked into the military town.

117
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,560
I hope everything goes well.

118
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,920
I'm tired.

119
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,680
Ah.

120
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,880
Why are you asking me for help?

121
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,320
Why is it so dark?

122
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm fine.

123
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,560
How about you?

124
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,300
How did you sneak in?

125
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
Your brother told Jiang Yunqing outside.

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,040
After I came in,

127
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,200
I met Doublet.

128
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,160
She tried to

129
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,360
Don't move.

130
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,960
This way.

131
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Go.

132
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
No.

133
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,560
Did they find you?

134
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,160
Maybe because of this.

135
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,560
I didn't expect they would find us so quickly.

136
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,960
I'll lead them away.

137
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,360
You take Shuai Yin away.

138
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,960
Who told you to steal Shuai Yin?

139
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,760
I don't want to see the blood flow.

140
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,360
On the battlefield, soldiers are led by the general.

141
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,960
Who will watch your Shuai Yin?

142
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,760
But someone will listen.

143
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,160
As long as someone is willing to surrender and stop,

144
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,160
it can reduce the casualties.

145
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,360
Sorry.

146
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,760
The war is not as simple as you think.

147
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,760
Okay, okay.

148
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,960
Let's not discuss the big picture here.

149
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,160
Think about what to do now.

150
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
There is a small road behind the military house.

151
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
I'll take you there when it gets dark.

152
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,160
No.

153
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
It's too dangerous to follow us.

154
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,960
I'm the only one who knows this road.

155
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,160
I'll just take you out.

156
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,760
It's okay.

157
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,760
Hurry up.

158
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
The princess said

159
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,360
we have to find them no matter what.

160
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,560
What are you doing?

161
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,360
You dare to break into the army camp

162
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
and even want to take away Lin Er and Xiao Shu?

163
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
I won't let you go.

164
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,360
I beg you, Sister.

165
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,160
Stop it.

166
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,360
The people are at peace.

167
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,160
You don't have to fight against the enemy.

168
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,360
Shut up.

169
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,760
Arrest them.

170
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,560
Xiao Shu, take Xiao Shu away first.

171
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,760
Okay.

172
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,560
Wu Xie.

173
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,560
Xiao Shu.

174
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,960
Xiao Shu.

175
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,160
Xiao Shu.

176
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,560
Xiao Shu.

177
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,160
Go.

178
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,360
Go.

179
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Xiao Shu.

180
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,160
Stop.

181
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,560
Xiao Shu.

182
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,360
It's okay.

183
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,560
Eat the eggplant.

184
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,160
It's okay.

185
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,360
Xiyu.

186
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,560
Sister.

187
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,360
Please go.

188
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,560
It's gone.

189
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,560
It's okay.

190
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
Sister Zhang is here.

191
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,360
It's okay.

192
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,760
Let go.

193
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Sister.

194
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,960
Sister.

195
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,960
Sister.

196
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,760
Sister.

197
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,360
Xiao Shu.

198
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,960
Look at Sister Zhang.

199
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,360
Xiao Shu.

200
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,560
Xiao Shu.

201
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,760
Everything will be fine.

202
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,560
I promise.

203
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,760
Listen to my order.

204
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,360
Kill Wu Sha.

205
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,560
Yes.

206
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,160
Okay.

207
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,760
Wu Xie, go.

208
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,360
Ling Er.

209
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,960
Ling Er.

210
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,560
Ling Er.

211
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,560
Ling Er.

212
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,960
Ling Er.

213
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,760
Ling Er.

214
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,160
How is Ling Er?

215
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
There is a farmhouse at the corner of the cliff.

216
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,360
They have sent people to search.

217
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,160
How is Li State doing?

218
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,560
Li State has buried the former emperor.

219
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,760
Is there anything else?

220
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
There is...

221
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,560
silence.

222
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,560
Princess, have you decided?

223
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,360
Are you afraid?

224
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,360
The gods will always follow the princess.

225
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,360
Everything will end.

226
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,360
Children.

227
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,360
You are all my closest people.

228
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,560
Before the country, after the family.

229
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,160
I am willing to

230
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,760
be a god and kill enemies.

231
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,960
I will take care of the country.

232
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,360
Yes.

233
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,160
Come out.

234
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,960
Kill enemies and take care of the country.

235
00:15:48,960 --> 00:16:04,560
Kill enemies and take care of the country.

236
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,840
What a strange man had this way of fighting close to his master?

237
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,680
He does not even serve the service title of patrician

238
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,160
Qin Zijun

239
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,280
Qin Zijun

240
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,680
Isn't this why I wanted you to be the flipswift?

241
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,920

242
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,560

Those heading to Nee-Zoi Generally disguise themselves as Our Animals.

247
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,520
They've finally come...

248
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,960
Perseverance father's son, Shuntian.

249
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Today is the day you all die.

250
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960

The meal is not enough.

276
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,960
You should take good care of Miss.

277
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960

Hold on. Weiqiang.

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,960
Hold on.

305
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,400
Weiqiang.

306
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,600
Weiqiang.

307
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,600
Let me see your belly.

308
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,880
Next, you'll punch.

00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,120
Thank you.

310
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,000
Weiqiang.

311
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
After you.

312
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,000
μαestä, what's wrong?

313
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,120
I just opened my mouth.

314
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,440
I have more energy.

315
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,220
plus.

316
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,800
Plus.

317
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,680
Professor.

318
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,520
Team B, raise to your مي ت combinations

319
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,560

320
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,380
Don't shoot

321
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,580
We will all die

322
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,520
Stop don't shoot

323
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,940
Don't shoot

War CT

325
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,760
Give me some developed drugs

326
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,680
I just chose a path that I think is right.

327
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
Stop struggling.

328
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,080
The entire Fengming Army has already become an explosive warehouse.

329
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,280
Whether it's Ning City, Li City, or everyone on the border,

330
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,880
I want them to be buried with Xiao Shu.

331
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,680
Officer Xue, you're really crazy.

332
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,080
The soldiers I left the army can go to the country for the sake of the country.

333
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,680
I don't want to be buried with Xiao Shu.

334
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,880
The soldiers of the army can go to the country for the sake of the country.

335
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,080
They will never become your funeral.

336
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,280
Soldiers of the army, listen to my order!

337
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,880
All of you, stop!

338
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,080
If you want your Crown Prince to be buried in a foreign land,

339
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,480
and die on this tower, you can stop.

340
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,480
If you continue to follow this kind of commander,

341
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,280
you will become obsessed with the army.

342
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,480
Soldiers of the Reunification Committee,

343
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,880
if you are willing to give up your own life,

344
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,880
I will not hesitate to do so.

345
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,680
For the sake of the Li State, for the sake of the Crown Prince,

346
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,280
kill!

347
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,680

and people!

352
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,280
You are really dirty!

353
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,680
I will never let you get away with this!

354
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,880
What kind of land is this?

355
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,280
No matter the court is the foundation,

356
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,480
or whoever is in charge of the palace,

357
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,880
the people on this land

358
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,880
must continue to live well!

359
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,480
Kill!

360
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,680
Kill!

361
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,280
You wanted to burn all of my life, right?

362
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:39,680
Did you not hear the last words of Yushuo's death?

363
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,480
That was what she said to you.

364
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,480
You are the one who is not qualified to talk about Xiao Shuo with me.

365

Designated Master of the Duke of the고

What's going on?

373
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,540
Dad.

374
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,540
Dad!

375
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,540
Kill them all!

Kill them!

377
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,540
Kill them!

378
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,540
Don't think about changing your mind.

379
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,540
Yes.

380
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,540
I wanted to change you countless times.

381
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,540
I wanted to prove to you that we can start a new life.

382
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,540
But now,

383
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,540
I've found out your fault.

384
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,540
So I came

385
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,540
to tell you

386
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,540
I can be with you

387
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,540
in the other world.

388
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,540
All the people you care about,

389
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,540
will be with you.

390
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,540
Queen.

391
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,540
Princess.

392
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,540
Uncle.

393
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,540
And me.

394
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,540
I've been waiting for too long

395
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,540
for the day

396
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,540
I can be with you.

397
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,540
Up the ball, it's a goal.

398
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,540
Down the net,

399
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,540
I can be with you in this life.

400
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,540
I'm lucky in three lives.

401
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,540
Shut up!

402
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,540
You know?

403
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,540
Don't think about it

404
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,540
in your mind

405
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,540
and think about those false images.

406
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,540
You'll die anyway.

407
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,540
You'll have nothing.

408
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,540
What?

409
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,540
You're a man of your own.

410
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,540
You're not willing to be in the world

411
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,540
because of your life, right?

412
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,540
What about us?

413
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,540
I don't want to see you.

414
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,540
If you want to live like Yi Qing

415
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,540
and those who are in the world,

416
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,540
like Huo Jinghang

417
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,540
and those who are in the country,

418
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,540
like you,

419
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,540
those who care about you

420
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
and are loyal to you,

421
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,540
you can live.

422
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,540
What about the queen and Xiao Shuang?

423
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,540
What did they do?

424
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,540
Tell me.

425
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,540
They're not

426
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,540
the only ones working together.

427
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,540
Then you'd better die yourself.

428
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,540
Why do you want the people of the world

429
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,540
to die with you?

430
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,540
Yi Qingyun is fighting for the country,

431
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,540
for the people, for the way to survive.

432
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,540
What's wrong with that?

433
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,540
Yuechi, Jingge, Iron Horse,

434
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,540
for the country, for the people, for the way to survive.

435
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,540
What's wrong with that?

436
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,540
As for me,

437
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,540
what I want is the people to live and work in peace.

438
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,540
What's wrong with that?

439
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,540
You have the hatred of China.

440
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,540
I don't want to kill you.

441
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,540
But only if you die,

442
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,540
will the people of the world live.

443
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,540
Yes.

444
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,540
I should have died long ago.

445
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,540
The queen used the life of the little princess

446
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,540
to exchange for my life.

447
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,540
I'm fighting for the crown prince's life

448
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,540
and protecting you for the rest of your life.

449
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,540
But in the end,

450
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,540
I'll let everything

451
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,540
end here.

452
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,540
I'm sorry.

453
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,540
I'm sorry.

454
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,540
I'm sorry.

455
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,540
I'm sorry.

456
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,540
I'm sorry.

457
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,540
I'm sorry.

458
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,540
I'm sorry.

459
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,540
I'm sorry.

460
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,540
I'm sorry.

461
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,540
I'm sorry.

462
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,540
I'm sorry.

463
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,540
I'm sorry.

464
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,540
I'm sorry.

465
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,540
I'm sorry.

466
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,540
I'm sorry.

467
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,540
I'm sorry.

468
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,540
I'm sorry.

469
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,540
I'm sorry.

470
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,540
I'm sorry.

471
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,540
I'm sorry.

472
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,540
I'm sorry.

473
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,540
I'm sorry.

474
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,540
I'm sorry.

475
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,540
I'm sorry.

476
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,540
I'm sorry.

477
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,540
I'm sorry.

478
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,540
I'm sorry.

479
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,540
I'm sorry.

480
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,540
I'm sorry.

481
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,540
I was greedy.

482
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,540
She was spells,

483
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,780
Yang,clouds, wheel,

484
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,540
and pearls.

485
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,580
She has no right

486
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,180
to challenge me.

487
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,220
This burden lake

488
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,060
is not proper toball.

489
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,260
You don't know

490
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,460
but I pestered for three inches each.

491
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,460
I'll see you off the way.

492
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,140
Anything book?

493
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,340
There's something you want to tell me.

494
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,660
I don't want to hear it.

495
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,220
I wanted to play a game with you.

496
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,620
I'm a member of the Song group.

497
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,540
I would definitely help you.

498
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,380
Brilliant!

499
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

500
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

501
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

502
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

503
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

504
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

505
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

506
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

507
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

508
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

509
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

510
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

511
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

512
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

513
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

514
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

515
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

516
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,380
I am not a good person, I am not a good person

517
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,420
I flunked the stage

518
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,580
So I can barely practice

519
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:52,960
Right now, if you can stand against the

520
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,380
What's your problem?

521
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,380
I came to tell you

522
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,820
You're the one who brought the poisonous insects to the forest.

523
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,660
You should be punished.

524
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,860
You've worked so hard

525
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,820
to cultivate the poisonous insects

526
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,260
that can control the insects.

527
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,780
If you hadn't tried it several times,

528
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,460
how could your body have fallen to this point?

529
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,260
Do as I said.

530
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,420
Yes.

531
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,220
Your Highness,

532
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,500
your face is so beautiful.

533
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,860
Your Highness,

534
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,980
your face is so beautiful.

535
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,500
You're really hardworking.

536
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,700
I'm still trapped in the old age.

537
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,780
Actually, my wish

538
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,380
is the same as His Majesty's.

539
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,180
If we're not on different sides,

540
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,380
maybe we can be

541
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,660
the only ones who know each other.

542
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,180
Why not?

543
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,380
There's a jade seal that can draw the dry flowers.

544
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,980
There's also a jade seal that can draw the dry flowers.

545
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,980
The two countries are at war with each other.

546
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,780
At this time,

547
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,700
the trade between the two countries is in full swing.

548
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,580
The holy world is in full swing.

549
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,780
It sounds like

550
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,860
it's a holy world that I'm looking forward to.

551
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,180
The most vivid color turns into your eyes

552
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,820
How naive

553
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,500
Stop singing.

554
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,700
Have a sip.

555
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,980
How naive

556
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:18,460
I can't bear to turn around

557
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:28,740
Come,

558
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:41,620
talk about your last name again.

559
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,460
rine

560
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,140
Nonsense

561
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,500
Then you say

562
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,980
I wish we can be happy and joyful

563
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,980
year after year

564
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,380
and year after year

565
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,820
Happy engaged intrusion

566
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,480
The emperor's high pleasure

567
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,920
is not necessarily mine

568
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,140
I know you are not right

569
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,500
I wanna resign

570
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,400
listen to me

571
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,300
Because of perjure

572
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,700
I was in the court for a day

573
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,420
Zhong Zhang is the emperor's shadow

574
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,020
I was the prime minister of loyalty and loyalty

575
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,780
Just don't care about others' views

576
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,700
We have experienced so many things

577
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,060
You are always the closest and most reliable person to me

578
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,380
Qian'er

579
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,620
For myself too

580
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:21,380
You, you can only get away from me

581
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,820
It doesn't?

582
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,300
I just need a break

583
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,300
It's not right.

584
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,700
Yue Zhi.

585
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,180
It's not your fault.

586
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,180
But she's dead.

587
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,300
I'm the one who's alive.

588
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,580
Just take it as a vacation for myself.

589
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,300
I'm sorry.

590
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,420
Will we meet again?

591
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,620
We will, Huo Jin He.

592
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,740
We will meet again.

593
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,340
Alright

594
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,340
Can I have another one?

595
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,220
Excuse me, Elder.

596
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,580
Go and request guys to come in.

597
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,660
This is...

598
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,220
Mr. Xue's Guest sent this to me before.

599
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,700
He 싶ited me to keep it to myself.

600
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,900
If someone comes to worship him,

601
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,540
I'll hand it over to him.

602
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,100
Sorry.

603
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,980
For the gifts I am too good for you,

604
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,820
I had no choice but to take them up.

605
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,300
I'm the one who helped you in that moment.

606
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,300
What should I do?

607
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,300
Your Highness!

608
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,300
Your Highness!

609
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,300
Your Highness!

610
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,300
Your Highness!

611
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,300
Your Highness!

612
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,300

00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,300

615
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,300
Your Highness!

616
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,300
Slowly!

617
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,300
I believe you.

618
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,300
I like you.

619
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,300
Not only today, but also tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

620
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,300
I hope you can stay by my side every day in the future.

621
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,300
Help me, accompany me.

622
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,300
Not only the emperor's life,

623
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,300
but also the life of the man in front of you.
