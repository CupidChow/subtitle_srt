1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Love with Princess

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm so happy that I don't know what to say.

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Whoever loses today will treat us to a meal.

5
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Okay. I will definitely let you three win.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You sound like you can win me.

7
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's right.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's a must.

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Come on.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let me win all your gold coins today.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you for coming with me today.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You're welcome.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We're sisters.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You're really bad at winning.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Next time, I must win.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Of course.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You want to win my gold coins?

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No way.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's getting late.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We should go home early.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Get some rest.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm leaving.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's go home.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's go home.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm going to sleep.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Your Highness, are you waiting for His Majesty?

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Your Majesty.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes?

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Aren't we going to visit Consort Yue?

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We'll go after this.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Your Majesty.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Jiang Yunqing has been arrested.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
When?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's said that the day before yesterday,

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Empress Dowager was punished by Consort Yue.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
She was punished by Consort Yue.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What about her?

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
She was punished by Consort Yue.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
How did she get punished?

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
She was punished.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
She was punished by Consort Yue.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
How did she get punished?

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
She was punished by Consort Yue.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
After Empress Dowager found out that Consort Yue was punished,

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
she sent the guards to search the whole city.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They caught her at the port this morning.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Where is she now?

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I saw her.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Can you let her go?

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You go there yourself.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's hard.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Empress Dowager has arranged someone to guard her.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Go.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Go to the imperial prison and attack her.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Zhao Yulixin has been imprisoned.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Jiang Yunqing has been arrested.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
She can't be released.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Someone is watching her.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Your Majesty, please punish her with death penalty.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
She will be released in peace.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yuechi.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Don't let me hear you say such words again.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Your Majesty, you may leave.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Go.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Follow Yuechi.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't let anything happen to her.

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Your Majesty, this place is quite nice.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Come on.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's have a drink first.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Princess Changping is the princess of the previous dynasty.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Isn't she a good friend?

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
She didn't die.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
She has been living in Prince Anle's mansion.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Isn't that the right-hand man's mansion?

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How could she live there?

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yuechi and the princess of the previous dynasty are married.

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They are royal parents.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
They must have had a love affair.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Such a good opportunity.

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You still don't get rid of Yuechi?

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
How is it going?

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Very smooth.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Although this tea is not precious,

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
it's still good.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Everyone.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We once persuaded His Majesty

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
to let Yuechi stay in his heart.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But he didn't believe us.

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
His Majesty just didn't listen.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I sent someone to the street to keep a secret.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Now someone has reported to the government office.

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Jiang Yunqing did live in Prince Anle's mansion.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I think His Majesty should believe us.

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You are so smart.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yuechi has a new dynasty.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And he has a secret relationship with the previous dynasty.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't support it.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We can't get rid of the traitor.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He is a man of his word.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We must do our best

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
to get rid of Yuechi for His Majesty and for Dining.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's right.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Lord Ouyang is a good man.

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Eunuch Gui is here.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Lord Ouyang, is there anything wrong?

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Where is His Majesty?

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I have to report to His Majesty.

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
His Majesty is not in good health today.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He doesn't go to the court.

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Please go back to your mansion.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Is His Majesty in good health

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
or unwilling to let Yuechi stay?

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Your Majesty.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yuechi is dead.

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Your Majesty.

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yuechi has the secret relationship with the previous dynasty.

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He is a man of his word.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He is so loyal to you.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You can't let him go.

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Lord Ouyang.

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Eunuch Gui.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Did His Majesty tell you about Yuechi?

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
His Majesty said he cares about it.

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He...

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Go to see the Empress Dowager.

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Take a look.

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
No need.

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I know what's written inside.

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's just that

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't take the position. Yuechi doesn't take the position.

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I killed Jiang Yunqing.

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm the Prime Minister of Yue.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What is His Majesty going to do?

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What else?

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
They have already forced the emperor to take the position.

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
His Majesty doesn't say anything. Jiang Shan says something.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't want to interfere in your affairs.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But this time I want to advise you

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
to deal with Jiang Yunqing.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's best to let Yuechi stay for the time being.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I know.

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
One.

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Two.

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Three.

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You're here.

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're here.

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Come with me to a place.

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Where?

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What are you going to do?

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I know it's weird.

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
No.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This is your second time to resist me.

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's different.

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is definitely not allowed.

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Nothing is not allowed.

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I said it's allowed.

161
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's allowed.

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Your Majesty.

163
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Right.

164
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Open the door.

165
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Open the door?

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But His Majesty said...

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I said open the door. Do you want to resist?

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Your Majesty, please forgive me. I dare not.

169
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Open the door.

170
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Qing.

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll take you away.

172
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll take you away.

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You go first.

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What should I say?

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What shouldn't I say?

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Clear?

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes.

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Hurry.

179
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Go back to the back of the bed.

180
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
There's food and medicine inside.

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You can't stay in the imperial city.

182
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Leave here now.

183
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'll go with you.

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Go.

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Go.

186
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Go.

187
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Go.

188
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Go.

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Go.

190
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes.

191
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But you're standing on my side.

192
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You didn't stand by my side

193
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
to protect my general.

194
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Now I'm standing by your side

195
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
to protect my son.

196
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You're right.

197
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's just a personal matter.

198
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's not a personal matter.

199
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's a human scene.

200
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
For me?

201
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Not for me.

202
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You're the emperor.

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're the king.

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So many ways.

205
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You're crazy.

206
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You don't need to

207
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
fake death, disguise, or break the prison.

208
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What are you going to do next?

209
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll take the blame

210
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and make a big bet.

211
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
His Majesty is here.

212
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Go.

213
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Your Majesty.

214
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Your Majesty.

215
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Master.

216
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Jiang Yunqing escaped from prison.

217
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I was wrong.

218
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
If I wasn't so anxious,

219
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I wouldn't ask about him alone.

220
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I wouldn't let him run away that easily.

221
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's my fault for the country.

222
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Your Majesty.

223
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,400
Your Majesty, please forgive us

224
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,360
I

225
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,800
I also failed to trust my beloved ones

226
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,000
I want to apologize to you

227
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,880
Yes

228
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,840
I dare not

229
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,920
Your Majesty, you can't stand it

230
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,720
Then you don't want my apology

231
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,680
I dare not

232
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,960
I dare not

233
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,800
I understand

234
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,040
I should apologize to you with my life

235
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,320
Father

236
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,440
I'm here to accompany you

237
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,400
Your Majesty

238
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,880
Your Majesty, please forgive us

239
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,360
Your Majesty

240
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,080
Your Majesty, please forgive us

241
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,000
Your Majesty

242
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,560
Then you don't want my apology

243
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,680
to forgive me

244
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,560
Your Majesty

245
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,200
The criminal has escaped

246
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,920
Your Majesty

247
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,160
You are overestimating the country

248
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,800
Your Majesty, what crime do you know?

249
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,240
I think

250
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,680
The most important thing now is

251
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,200
to catch the criminal

252
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,400
Yes

253
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,600
What Ouyang said makes sense

254
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,600
What about you?

255
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,720
Your Majesty

256
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,040
Do you think so?

257
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,720
I disagree

258
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,360
Since Zhong Qing

259
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,880
thinks so

260
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,000
just delivery

261
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,840
Nothing

262
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:23,820
There is a

263
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,140
It's a useless haste to show me some respect.

264
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,640
Move aside.

265
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,280
Move!

266
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,360
flower

267
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:56,960
what

268
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,440
my girl

269
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,480
Allen deduction

270
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,580
Allen deduction

271
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:27,980
Allen deduction

272
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,120
Allen deduction

273
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,000
Allen deduction

274
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,680
Now, I'm next to you

275
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,240
is to help make your family happy

276
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,840
Pains in your voice

277
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,560
EssaLEX channel

278
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,340
Liu Shu, don't come here again.

279
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,760
I am dead.

280
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,500
I will not turn up to your bureau for anything.

281
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,180
He died?

282
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,900
But uever.

283
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,340
So amazing.

284
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,240
Majesty, what are you doing?

285
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,160
Mind your own business.

286
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Stomach rash

287
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,160
To serve your grandma

288
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,100
Map!

289
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,180
No, Sir!

290
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,960
I'm not so awful, why are you不對勁也 With tide of dogs you and I

291
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,960
He is the emperor, he won't let me

292
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
I found the voice

293
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,960
The distance is a little bit closer

294
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
Pull it a little bit further

295
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
Raise your arms

296
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,960
The stone will fall down in the air

297
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,960
The place you aim at should be a little higher than the pear

298
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
Shoot

299
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
Look, right?

300
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
I hit it

301
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,960
Brother Yue, you see I hit it

302
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
Awesome

303
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,960
Xiao Shou, you go back to your room first

304
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,960
I have something to talk to you

305
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Go

306
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,960
He is very smart and sensible

307
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Why are you here?

308
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Why are you here?

309
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Not busy today?

310
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
Come to see me

311
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Sick

312
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
And can drink and think

313
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
Your Majesty is too much

314
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
I finally found this opportunity to rest

315
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
You also came to train me

316
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Yuechi

317
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
Escaping is the most useless

318
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
The thing is done

319
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
The result is already

320
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Too much

321
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,960
It's not that escaping can be avoided

322
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,960
I didn't escape

323
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Then why don't you come to the court?

324
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
I'm sick

325
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
Yuechi

326
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
Okay

327
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,960
I just feel a little guilty

328
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
Since you feel guilty

329
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
Then stay with me to guard the Ming Dynasty

330
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
I'm not a good Prime Minister

331
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
I'm not a good emperor either

332
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Then try to be a good minister with your left hand and your right hand

333
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
What should I do if I can't?

334
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Let's talk about Chaogao together

335
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Retreat

336
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
Good

337
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,960
See you, Your Majesty

338
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
Prime Minister

339
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
Finally came to the court

340
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
I have something to do

341
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
Greetings to Your Majesty

342
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
What's wrong today?

343
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
Uncle Li is so thorough

344
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
I'm worried about you

345
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
I came to see you

346
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
When you went to the court

347
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
I saw you in a daze

348
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,960
The minister talked

349
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
You always leave

350
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,960
I had a dream yesterday

351
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Dreamed all night

352
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,960
I dreamed of Ling'er

353
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
Dreaming of Ling'er

354
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
What are you doing in your dream?

355
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
Shameless

356
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
Can you stop being so mean?

357
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
I dreamed of Ling'er

358
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
In a big fog

359
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
I can't see her

360
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,960
But I just feel that she is in danger

361
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,960
This dream and reality are opposite

362
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
You are the emperor and still believe this

363
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
No

364
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
This dream

365
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
I have a dream

366
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
This dream

367
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
It's being reminded by me

368
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Think about it

369
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
This Li Chao's crown prince, Yi Qingyun

370
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
If not only bribed Cao Meng

371
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,960
Also turned Jiang Yunqing into your wife

372
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Let you think about her

373
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,960
How big is the net worth?

374
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
Is there anyone in the court like her?

375
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
There is no one like her

376
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
That must be

377
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
So

378
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
The most important thing is to let Ling'er go out

379
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
You mean

380
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,960
Let the queen go out and temporarily make a bet?

381
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
No

382
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
It's easy to do

383
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
Of course it's fake

384
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,960
You pretend to be the moon and the moon attack

385
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
It's not a secret anymore

386
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,960
At least Jiang Yunqing knows

387
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
So we'd better see it together

388
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
Double-edged sword

389
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Since the identity of the moon is gone

390
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Ling'er can also safely go out

391
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
You don't have to be afraid of those things

392
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
That happened before

393
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,960
Wise

394
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
So

395
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,960
I'm going to think of a plan that the moon is a reasonable success in three days

396
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Me

397
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
Three days

398
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,960
I wouldn't have gone to court if I had known

399
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Three days

400
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Two plans

401
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
I have another headache

402
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,960
You said

403
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
At least Ling'er is out of the palace

404
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
Is she willing?

405
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
I'm not going out of the palace

406
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
You just finished saying you were sensible

407
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,960
I don't want to go out of the palace

408
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,960
But you are the emperor

409
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
I can only obey

410
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
What you said

411
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,960
It's like I'm forcing you

412
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Actually I want to say

413
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
I don't have to hide behind you forever

414
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,960
At least I can watch you in this palace

415
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
Ling'er

416
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Ling'er

417
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,960
You can watch us in the palace

418
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,960
But everyone is watching you

419
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Even through you

420
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
To see your brother's weakness

421
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,960
You said your brother pretended to be a moon

422
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
If it's a crowd, everyone knows

423
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
Then punish him

424
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
A crime of causing chaos in the harem

425
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
Then punish me

426
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
A yellow shadow without a belly

427
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,960
Then at that time

428
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,960
I can't do anything

429
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Ok, I promise to go out of the palace

430
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
But your Majesty, you have to promise me

431
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,960
No matter what happens

432
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
You have to tell me in real time

433
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,960
Don't let me worry

434
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
Ok

435
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
I know

436
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
I know

437
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Your Majesty

438
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
constitution imp保

439
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
What's wrong?

440
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,960
The daughter of the Prince of Beijun,

441
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
Princess Wenrou,

442
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
disappeared for many years and suddenly appeared.

443
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,960
Princess Wenrou?

444
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,960
The name sounds pretty good.

445
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,960
The Huo family and the Prince of Beijun are friends.

446
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,960
The Prince of Beijun is also an open-bred official who died in battle.

447
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,960
But his life is not good.

448
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,960
The family is dying and disbanding,

449
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,960
but there is only one single seed left.

450
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,960
It's not appropriate to pick it up and think about it in the imperial city.

451
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,960
But it's been so many years that there's no news.

452
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,960
Why did you suddenly come from Qicheng?

453
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,960
The Mingyang County Magistrate said that it was just rescued from the mountain.

454
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,960
But this princess really wants to come to the palace to greet the Empress Dowager.

455
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
Then let the Mingyang County Magistrate escort you.

456
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,960
This girl must have suffered a lot.

457
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Yes.

458
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Greetings to Your Majesty and Empress Dowager.

459
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,960
Get up quickly. Sit.

460
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,960
Princess, you haven't been home for a long time.

461
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
Why did you go to Qicheng?

462
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,960
I didn't come early to greet the Empress Dowager.

463
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,960
Please forgive me.

464
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
I...

465
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,960
I...

466
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,960
Don't worry.

467
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,960
What have you been through these years?

468
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,960
Empress Dowager and I will definitely uphold justice with you.

469
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,960
I thank Your Majesty first.

470
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,960
I thank Your Majesty first.

471
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,960
Two and a half years ago, the news of my father's death came.

472
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
My mother died of grief.

473
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
A band of bandits broke into my house.

474
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,960
I escaped in a mess, but I fell into the hands of a man.

475
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,960
My legs were broken.

476
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,960
Fortunately, an old lady saw me as a poor person and let me go quietly.

477
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
I went into the mountains with her.

478
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
I've been hiding in the mountains.

479
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,960
Until a few days ago, I got better.

480
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,960
So I came out to ask around.

481
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,960
I found out that my brother Jingheng had won.

482
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,960
I changed my new world.

483
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
I rushed to the nearest county office.

484
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,960
I found out that I had been in Qicheng Xia for the past two years.

485
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
Mi Yang County.

486
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,960
These years, the princess has suffered.

487
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
I will arrange everything for you.

488
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
I will also be your parents' saviour.

489
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
That's right.

490
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,960
Your Majesty, let him live in the imperial city.

491
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,960
It's convenient for us to take care of him.

492
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,960
Your Majesty, Empress Dowager.

493
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,960
I hope to stay in the palace and serve the Empress Dowager and Your Majesty.

494
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,960
Serve?

495
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,960
Your Majesty?

496
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Silly.

497
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,960
Silly girl.

498
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
What's so good about the palace?

499
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,960
It's freedom outside the palace.

500
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
Princess.

501
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,960
I still have a younger brother who is still unmarried.

502
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,960
If you don't mind, you can take a look.

503
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,960
He is handsome and smart.

504
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,960
I'm a man of my word.

505
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,960
I'm afraid of the dark.

506
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,960
But the only person I can trust is the Empress Dowager.

507
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,960
Please, Your Majesty.

508
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,960
Princess Wen Ru is tired.

509
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
You should go and rest.

510
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,960
I will discuss this with my mother.

511
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
That's right.

512
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,960
Please get up.

513
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
I will take my leave.

514
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
Yes.

515
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
What are you doing?

516
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,960
I was worried that my son was too shy.

517
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
I was worried.

518
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
He is good at seducing people.

519
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,960
What are you talking about?

520
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
No.

521
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
Am I wrong?

522
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,960
If you don't seduce him,

523
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,960
he will come to serve you.

524
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
You are pretty.

525
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
How do you know?

526
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,960
Have you heard?

527
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,960
The princess of the Northern Army is being treated in the Qunv Pavilion.

528
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
Really?

529
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,960
That place is big.

530
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,960
It's a little bit far from Yongqian Palace.

531
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,960
It's far away.

532
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,960
His Majesty doesn't come to the harem.

533
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,960
If he wants to come, he should come to Fenluang Palace.

534
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
Why are you all looking at me?

535
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
If you want to come,

536
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,960
you can come to Fenluang Palace.

537
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Hurry up. I smell good.

538
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
Go.

539
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Stop.

540
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,960
How is it?

541
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
Have you thought of the plan?

542
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,960
The initial plan.

543
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
It's a bad idea.

544
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,960
Tell me.

545
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,960
I haven't thought of it.

546
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,960
I have to go out and take a walk.

547
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
Look.

548
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Inspiration is coming.

549
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,960
I heard that the new daughter of the Prince of the Northern Army came to the harem.

550
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,960
She is your childhood sweetheart.

551
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
She is a married woman.

552
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,960
Nonsense.

553
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
Will you marry her?

554
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
I heard a lot about her.

555
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,960
It is even rumored that she is the future empress.

556
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
Empress?

557
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
Empress?

558
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
She can't be the empress.

559
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,960
But the Prince of the Northern Army,

560
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
who is well known for his actions,

561
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,960
is a great hero.

562
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,960
I can't treat him well.

563
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
Why do you look at me like that?

564
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
You didn't touch her in the past.

565
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,960
She is gone.

566
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Why are you talking about these things?

567
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,960
The Prince of the Northern Army died on the battlefield.

568
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,960
He is a meritorious minister.

569
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
I am following him.

570
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,960
I am kind to his daughter.

571
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,960
It is also my duty.

572
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
Then...

573
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,960
Empress...

574
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
Shut up.

575
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,960
I didn't plan to leave this gentle woman in the harem.

576
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,960
If you really don't like her,

577
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,960
just put her in the harem.

578
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,960
Anyway, the concubines you put in the harem are not that bad.

579
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,960
All the concubines are put in the harem.

580
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
You are so greedy.

581
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,960
The concubines in the harem

582
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,960
are all tools that their parents sent to the harem

583
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
to get the military's trust.

584
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,960
They are all pitiful people.

585
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Putting the gentle woman in the harem

586
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
almost ruined her life.

587
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,960
I am telling the truth.

588
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,960
Alright. It is late.

589
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,960
Go back.

590
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,960
I am going back with you?

591
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
Let's go, Prime Minister Yue.

592
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,960
We have a lot of memorials to read.

593
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
Is this plan feasible?

594
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,960
It is.

595
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
Everything is ready.

596
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,960
Your Majesty,

597
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,960
I made some snacks from the northern border.

598
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Please try it.

599
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,960
I am sorry to trouble you to come here.

600
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,960
I will just send someone to deliver it.

601
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,960
Your Majesty has granted me the chance to live in the Imperial Pavilion.

602
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,960
But I have not been there.

603
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
I also want to see you.

604
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
Your Majesty, I will take my leave.

605
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,960
You are so stubborn.

606
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
You are so stubborn.

607
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,960
The Imperial Pavilion

608
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
Prime Minister Yue, what is the matter?

609
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,960
I will carry the paper and carry it.

610
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
No need.

611
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,960
I want to see

612
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,960
if you will do something that will make my sister sorry.

613
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,960
Prime Minister Yue, please serve His Majesty.

614
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,960
No need.

615
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,960
I am sorry.

616
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
The Imperial Pavilion

617
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,960
The Imperial Pavilion

618
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,960
I have heard that His Majesty likes to collect all kinds of weapons.

619
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,960
Today, I see this small item.

620
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
I like it too.

621
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,960
I wonder if His Majesty would like to give it to me.

622
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
This dagger

623
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
is really very delicate.

624
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
No wonder you like it.

625
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,960
But I

626
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,960
don't want to cut it.

627
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,960
This is a good thing.

628
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,960
A dagger is enough for him.

629
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,960
It will only take half a day.

630
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,960
Your Majesty,

631
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,960
think about it again.

632
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
I don't want to.

633
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
You don't want to?

634
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,960
Princess,

635
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,960
go to Shoukang Palace

636
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
to see the Empress Dowager.

637
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
I am too petty.

638
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
I don't usually

639
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,960
give people a gift.

640
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,960
It really does look like a gentleman.

641
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,960
Princess,

642
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
won't you leave us?

643
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,960
The Imperial Pavilion

644
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
The Imperial Pavilion

645
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
The Imperial Pavilion
