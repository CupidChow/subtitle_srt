00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Story of the Phoenix

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 1

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Are you sure that Yue Fei found the needle?

4
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's a thousand needles.

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's weird.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It shouldn't be.

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What Your Majesty meant was

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
we should go in and take a look.

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Slow down.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
02?

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is...

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The Blue Queen.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Your Majesty, you finally came.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hurry up and sit down.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Why are you here?

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm here waiting for you to have tea.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, right. I brought a flute.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm not busy with flute.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm asking you why you're here waiting for me.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You know what?

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yue Fei sold you away.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Sold?

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He needs 50 taels of silver for dinner.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The silver is 20 taels.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Not only that,

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
he can also make a living.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Anyway, as long as he has some money,

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yue Fei can make a living.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
How much did you spend?

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I spent 10 taels of silver for tea.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And I also spent 15 taels of silver.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
15 taels of real wine?

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No, Your Majesty.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's too expensive.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You need 10 taels of silver for half an hour of tea.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's more than two hours.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You need to pay for it.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yue Fei.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Take him to get 50 taels of silver.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No, Your Majesty.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't need the silver.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I...

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I don't need it.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll give it to you.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll give it to you.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Go.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You're talking about Yue Fei.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No, I'm not lying.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm telling you it's Yue Fei.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm just saying.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Your Majesty,

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Mr. Wei is here to beg for money.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He's in Yongqian Palace.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What money?

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What do you want?

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's still the old way.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I want to persuade the town to get Yue Chi's position.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Those days,

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
when Yue Chi was promoted to Prime Minister,

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Wei Zang was gone.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He was really a man of his life.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Otherwise, how come

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
he doesn't have a house in the Fengyuan Palace?

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Go.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What's wrong?

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Why are you looking at me?

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm not looking at you.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Take a look.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's the Fifth Wind.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Wei Zang's Wan Zi Yan's book.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I want you to be a prime minister.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I want you to be a prime minister.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I want you to be a prime minister.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I want you to be a prime minister.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I want you to be a prime minister.

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I want you to be a prime minister.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's not good.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll just be a prime minister.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You're so beautiful.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm a great country.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm like a fairy.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The court is like a small country.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's not important

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
if the emperor listens to his advice.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Maybe he can take the next step.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
If he takes the next step,

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
maybe he can take the next step.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The responsibility of the people

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
must be determined.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So,

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
the right person

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
should be in the right position.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What does Wei Zang want to say?

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let him say it.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He's a prime minister.

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I won't make things difficult for him.

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But I

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
won't be taken away

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
because of him.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You don't eat and don't do housework.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Some of the things that the emperor ordered are too obvious.

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's hard for the people to do it.

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Is this

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
the discount on the court's opposition?

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The general's tax is high.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's all because of the court.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why do you oppose it?

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Because you moved the ancestral order.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
People should look forward.

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The old people's achievements

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
are in the hands of the people.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What can they do in their lives?

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I can't do it.

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So I have to wait.

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I have to have a way to adapt.

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Wait?

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Their head is in the clouds.

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I can't wait for me to get into the soil.

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I do it directly.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
If I can do it,

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
they will do it.

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Don't be late.

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I like you.

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You should do it

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
as soon as possible.

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The new policy and new method

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
no matter where the court is,

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
someone will

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
kick the court out first.

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
They should be the first to do it.

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No matter what,

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
they should do it.

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's true that the people are the fundamental of the country.

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Now the people are still the people.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I am still doing it for the people.

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's me.

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The reason for you to enter the court.

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm so important.

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So I want to reward you.

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's not good to be here.

146
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Come on.

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll take a picture.

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm going to reward you

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
to go to Yangcheng.

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
By the way,

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
help Yangcheng

152
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
to take good care of the new place.

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He is born in Hanmen.

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Don't let him

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
be bullied by those old women.

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I know you want to prepare something good.

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Who asked me to marry a good Yue Fei?

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's a good Yue Fei.

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's a good place to go to the court.

160
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You can also go to the kitchen.

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll be the only one left.

162
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Get lost.

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Get lost.

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll leave these to you.

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Do your best.

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Chen Ouyangwen.

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He is a great scholar.

168
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He is a great leader.

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He is the most important person in the world.

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Peace .

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,680
He is like an admirable emperor.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Pi up to entrance of the estate market

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
a powerful woman

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,720
official from former Tang Dynasty

175
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,000
an honor lunch secretly.

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,200
The kanji indicates...

177
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,000
You wines.

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,560
And Li Bu Hebrewlaughter,

179
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,160
Ouyangwen by eye,

180
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
is cache by the natural 증iamo

181
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
The moon is shining.

182
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
The new government is in place.

183
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Go.

184
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Go to the gate of the mansion.

185
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
The grand sound of the waves.

186
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
My reply is heard.

187
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Your Majesty, it's not worth it.

188
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
I'll come and check your seal for half a month.

189
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
Your Majesty, don't worry.

190
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
I'll definitely finish it beautifully.

191
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Little Li, little Xuan, little Rui, little Guzi.

192
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
You guys go with me.

193
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
You all go down.

194
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
I'll go.

195
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,160
What's the matter, Eunuch Gui?

196
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
I went to deliver a gift to Mr. Ouyang.

197
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
Why are you here?

198
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,160
My brother said that he was the prince of the teacher in the street today.

199
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,160
He must have been hit by a high-ranking.

200
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
I'll come and see.

201
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Why do you seem to be a little worried?

202
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,160
He's not in a hurry. I'm not in a hurry.

203
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,160
And my brother has been treated badly lately.

204
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,160
We think it must be a pain in the neck.

205
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,160
It's a good thing.

206
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,160
What about me?

207
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,160
Why don't you think I'm angry?

208
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
You're angry because of my brother.

209
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
I'm very grateful to you.

210
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
I'm talking about your selling me.

211
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,160
So you're talking about this.

212
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Don't be too happy.

213
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
What?

214
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
I've already called.

215
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,160
Although some of them are not good at making money,

216
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
but the family is still very rich.

217
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Look, they take the money every month without flowers.

218
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,160
You don't have time to do things every month.

219
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,160
You're so impulsive.

220
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Of course, I won't give up on these money.

221
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
What?

222
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,160
As the saying goes, the sheep's fur is on the sheep's body.

223
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,160
Since the palace is given a salary from the national treasury,

224
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,160
the money should be returned to the national treasury.

225
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,160
I'll give you another pocket.

226
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
How about this?

227
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
It's good.

228
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
But don't do this again.

229
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
Why?

230
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,160
I don't like it.

231
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
I don't understand you.

232
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
The King of the City

233
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
You're in the way again.

234
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Brother, great.

235
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
You won again.

236
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
The more you want to be a good man, the better.

237
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
If the emperor does something,

238
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
it's not good.

239
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
You didn't let me go just now, did you?

240
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
How could it be?

241
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,160
You didn't hesitate to do it at the beginning of the year.

242
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
You're right.

243
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
I should practice more.

244
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
It's not as good as before.

245
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,160
I'll compete with you next time.

246
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,160
I might be able to win easily.

247
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,160
I'll practice more every day.

248
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,160
The emperor should protect himself outside.

249
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
That's right.

250
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
I'll come to you next time.

251
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
I can't run away.

252
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Hello, uncle.

253
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Is there anything else?

254
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
I'm fine.

255
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
You're busy, right?

256
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,160
I'm still talking to you.

257
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Why are you crying?

258
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,160
You're so annoying.

259
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
What's wrong with you, Ling'er?

260
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
Why are you not talking?

261
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
It's about the female servant.

262
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Even if I say it,

263
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
the emperor will understand.

264
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Why don't I understand?

265
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,160
I'm the emperor of the country.

266
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,160
You're just compared to the emperor of the country.

267
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,160
The emperor of the country can't change the world.

268
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
You can't do that.

269
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Listen to me.

270
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
Maybe I can do something.

271
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,160
That's right.

272
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
After all, this brother is the emperor.

273
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
He's the one who was the emperor's concubine.

274
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
You must have a way.

275
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
I can't say that.

276
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,160
I think Ling'er makes sense.

277
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
You can't say that.

278
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Okay, let's talk about the main thing.

279
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,160
Didn't the emperor let me observe the palace?

280
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
I've been observing it for days.

281
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,160
I found that the days of the palace are very boring and boring.

282
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
I wanted to sell it through auction.

283
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
I asked everyone to take care of it.

284
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
I can make some money from it.

285
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
But he didn't let me.

286
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,160
I'm the emperor of the country.

287
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
You said it.

288
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
And not many people are interested.

289
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,160
It's like the concubines.

290
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
They're beyond my expectations.

291
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,160
I thought there were people who were full of love in the palace.

292
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,160
Everyone likes the emperor.

293
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,160
They all want to get the emperor's attention.

294
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,160
As a Prime Minister,

295
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm taking the phoenix for the emperor.

296
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
That's what the concubines are.

297
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,160
I'm taking the phoenix for the emperor.

298
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
The emperor doesn't like the emperor.

299
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,160
They all like the emperor.

300
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
They want to get the emperor's attention.

301
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,160
That's because they want to do the palace.

302
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
They want to be the imperial concubines.

303
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
The imperial concubines?

304
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,160
You're so emperor.

305
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,160
You two don't like me at all.

306
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
Lv Mao,

307
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
you want to do something for the concubines.

308
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Right?

309
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
Yes.

310
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
What are you doing?

311
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,160
I haven't thought about it.

312
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,160
But the day of the palace is so bright.

313
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,160
I'm married to a woman in the palace.

314
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,160
I'm married to a woman in the family and the backyard.

315
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
I'm married to a woman in the palace.

316
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Although she's a woman of thousands of thousands,

317
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,160
she's actually the same woman.

318
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
Sometimes,

319
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160
when I see them,

320
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,160
I feel lucky.

321
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
I've been through hardships and hardships.

322
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,160
I've been to the imperial palace and out of the palace.

323
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,160
Although I've been through many hardships,

324
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,160
I've been through many things.

325
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,160
Brother,

326
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
you've just been tired of them.

327
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,160
They're not the same.

328
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
For a long time,

329
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,160
men have more chances to choose than women.

330
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Even if you don't take the emperor's phoenix,

331
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,160
you can still take the phoenix from the Academy

332
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,160
and the phoenix from the Ninth House.

333
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,160
And your life's journey has been increasing.

334
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,160
The thickness of your life's books has been increasing.

335
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,160
Whether it's the Academy or the small academy,

336
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
the big or the small ones,

337
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,160
the things you've done will always be recognized.

338
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,160
But in this life of a woman,

339
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,160
how many things can you do

340
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,160
to increase your interests?

341
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Ying'er,

342
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
you've thought too much.

343
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,160
I've always thought that women are too small.

344
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
Your heart is good.

345
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,160
You're right to work hard for your own life.

346
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,160
But everyone can only solve the problem

347
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
in the present situation.

348
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,160
In fact, these men are all taught by the great family.

349
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,160
They know how to do things right.

350
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
Everyone has their own profession.

351
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,160
But they might not have a chance to do it.

352
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Then what do you mean?

353
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,160
You can create a department system in the harem.

354
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,160
Let the men follow their own characteristics and interests.

355
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
Help them realize their own career,

356
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,160
expand their business,

357
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,160
eat and do whatever women in the harem

358
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,160
are always the opposite of the outside world.

359
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,160
Maybe this will affect them.

360
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
It seems to be a very reasonable way.

361
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,160
Brother, you're really good at this.

362
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,160
You're indeed a person who's been favored by the emperor.

363
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Then you guys talk first.

364
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,160
I'll go to work.

365
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Hurry up.

366
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
You're really good at this.

367
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
I'm just giving him a direction.

368
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Your Highness.

369
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Your Highness, look at that person.

370
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
I think that's him.

371
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,160
I'm going to go to Fengluang Palace to go back first.

372
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,160
I heard that Yue Fei's sister is a woman of birth.

373
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,160
Only you can dance.

374
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,160
The spirit of this shoe is obviously a flat shoe.

375
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
But it's size is big.

376
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Except Yue Fei, who else can wear it?

377
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
A few days ago, there were a lot of發物.

378
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
I've been up for a while.

379
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,160
I thought that I was born to be a model.

380
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,160
I was afraid that I would be shocked by the emperor and the empress dowager.

381
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
Especially you, Prime Minister.

382
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,160
You can't even make a single big mistake in ten years.

383
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,160
Yue Fei, you're the one who made it.

384
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
The emperor is so mean.

385
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
It's true.

386
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
You're playing with the A family here.

387
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
You're a living person.

388
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
You brat.

389
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
If you don't teach him a lesson,

390
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,160
he won't know what is a ghost sword.

391
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Your Highness, please calm down.

392
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,160
Will you be leaving the capital tomorrow morning?

393
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Yes.

394
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,160
I'll see who can save me this time.

395
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
Prime Minister Yue.

396
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
Prime Minister Yue.

397
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Eunuch Wang.

398
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
We received the imperial decree from the empress dowager.

399
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
I'll send you a message.

400
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
I hope that after you get off the post,

401
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
you can come to Shoukang Palace

402
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
and come to the capital.

403
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,160
The person who comes here is not good.

404
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
No.

405
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
Huo Jing Heng is not here today.

406
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
I don't know the purpose of the empress dowager.

407
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,160
I'd better wait for Huo Jing Heng to come back.

408
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Search carefully.

409
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,160
The empress dowager has informed Prime Minister Yue.

410
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,160
Keep an eye on her.

411
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
The empress dowager's order?

412
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,160
She's still running?

413
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
That's not true.

414
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,160
She'll be back in two days.

415
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,160
It should be better to put less sugar.

416
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Your Highness, it's so chaotic outside.

417
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,160
Don't go out.

418
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,160
I heard that there's an outsider.

419
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
He's a man who's in the palace.

420
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,160
The empress dowager is afraid that he'll search everywhere.

421
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Who's so bold to be in the palace?

422
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
That's right.

423
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
An outsider?

424
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Ming Er, I have to hide here for a while.

425
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
Brother, is it too late?

426
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,160
The empress dowager is afraid that she'll search everywhere.

427
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
She sent a message today.

428
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
She even chose the day that His Majesty left the palace.

429
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,160
She won't eat well with me.

430
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,160
I can only see if I can get over it.

431
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
Du Tian Zhao.

432
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,160
I can help you.

433
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,160
Du Tian Zhao, why did you learn to turn the window?

434
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,160
I heard the wind. I came to give you a message.

435
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,160
The empress dowager has come to your palace.

436
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
She'll be here soon.

437
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Your Highness, the empress dowager is here.

438
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
You're so lucky.

439
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,160
Brother, don't worry.

440
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,160
I've figured out a way.

441
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Come out.

442
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,160
Come out.

443
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Sister, you're so shameless.

444
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,160
How could you be treated like that?

445
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Why are you here?

446
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
You're in the palace.

447
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,160
Why are you acting so weird?

448
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,160
What do you want?

449
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,160
Sister, I've made it clear today.

450
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,160
I've been in a marriage proposal.

451
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,160
I deliberately pushed it out.

452
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,160
I've already made my choice.

453
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
That's...

454
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
You're kidding.

455
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Please allow me to make it clear.

456
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
I've never seen such a thing.

457
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,160
I'm so lucky to have a beautiful heart.

458
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,160
If she dies, I won't be able to live.

459
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,160
Beautiful?

460
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,160
Then let her die.

461
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
What's your name?

462
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
Beauty.

463
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,160
People are like a name.

464
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,160
You're so nice.

465
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,160
Where's Yue Fei?

466
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,160
Yue Fei!

467
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
Your Highness,

468
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,160
my wife drank the medicine that the imperial physician prescribed.

469
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,160
She's in a good mood.

470
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Don't bother about her death.

471
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,160
If she finds out, she'll punish you.

472
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,160
But it's none of her business.

473
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,160
I'll do it myself.

474
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Your Highness is here!

475
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,160
She's so fast.

476
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,160
What are you arguing about?

477
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,160
She's so good-natured.

478
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,160
No wonder you're so noisy.

479
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,160
It's the left-hand man who's doing this.

480
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
It's a matter of merit and failure.

481
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,160
You're so annoying.

482
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,160
You're so annoying.

483
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,160
You're so good-natured.

484
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
You're so good-natured.

485
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,160
You still don't admit your crime?

486
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,160
I admit it.

487
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,160
I'll admit it if it's not beautiful.

488
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,160
Mother, you should be punished.

489
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Okay.

490
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Since you're here today,

491
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,160
you're a man.

492
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,160
I'm the one.

493
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,160
You're so fast.

494
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,160
You don't have anything to say.

495
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
I'll say it.

496
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,160
Okay.

497
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
I'll say it.

498
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
I'll say it.

499
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,160
I'll say it.

500
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Yes, Your Highness.

501
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Sister,

502
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,160
please.

503
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,160
Have a good talk.

504
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,160
Everyone plays the role of a script.

505
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,160
Only you can play the role.

506
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,160
No one will play the role for you.

507
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
Nor will you play the role.

508
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,160
You have to play the role.

509
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,160
Remember this.

510
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
You have to play it.

511
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Come on.

512
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Did something really happen to him?

513
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,160
Don't worry. He has experience.

514
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,160
Mother doesn't want to hurt his brother.

515
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,160
We can't stay here for long.

516
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,160
I'll send Wei Zhang to you later.

517
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
Okay.

518
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,160
Let's go.

519
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
Prime Minister,

520
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
the exit is ahead.

521
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,160
We'll send the back to here.

522
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
We'll go all the way.

523
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,160
You can't say it without talking.

524
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
These are eyes.

525
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,160
These are heads.

526
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,160
Hit me.

527
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Stop.

528
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,160
Raise him up.

529
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,160
Don't you want to run away?

530
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
I dare not.

531
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Your Majesty, your old man is waiting for me to run away.

532
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,160
He is competing with me.

533
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,160
Good boy.

534
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
Don't hold your neck.

535
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,160
Learn to feed the animals.

536
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
This is all military drama.

537
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
You choose.

538
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,160
You dare to go to the battlefield.

539
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,160
You dare not fight with Aijia?

540
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,160
I can't beat you.

541
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
Go home, Aijia.

542
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,160
A big party is waiting for me.

543
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
What's wrong?

544
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,160
A huge party.

545
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
I promise.

546
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,160
I'll do a big fight.

547
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Let me say it Sports.

548
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,160
Let me say it Sports.

549
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,160
It's me.

550
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,160
To me?

551
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,160
You try to say a big fight?

552
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
I want to see a big fight with Aijia.

553
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,160
He is very tired.

554
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,280
and the palace is private.

555
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,280
You can't fight with the Empress Dowager.

556
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,200
Tell me.

557
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,920
What's going on?

558
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,360
The palace is in a play.

559
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,760
Yue Fei and the Prime Minister are in the same place.

560
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,160
Are all of us Yu Huayuan's audience?

561
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,240
Is it fun?

562
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,040
Your Highness.

563
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,440
This is what I know.

564
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,960
His Majesty wanted to kill Ling'er.

565
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,160
Ling'er is innocent.

566
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,600
I'm worried that he will attack the palace without any reason.

567
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,840
I'm even more worried

568
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,840
that His Majesty had been in a difficult situation.

569
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,880
So I decided to make a woman

570
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,680
to attack him.

571
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,600
You're so stupid.

572
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,840
But after I entered the palace,

573
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,640
I found that His Majesty was a man of the word.

574
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,640
He was also a man of the word.

575
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,600
I didn't want to disturb His Majesty's affairs.

576
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,920
So I tried to be careful.

577
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,280
That's why His Majesty found out my identity.

578
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,640
You mean

579
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,440
His Majesty wants you to be the Prime Minister of Yue Fei,

580
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,600
the General of the previous dynasty,

581
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,960
and the Prime Minister of the current dynasty?

582
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,560
I'm not the Prime Minister of which dynasty.

583
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,160
I'm the only one in the world.

584
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,360
I'm not the only one who will

585
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,480
be the one to be the Prime Minister.

586
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,480
I'm not the Prime Minister of which dynasty.

587
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,360
I'm the Prime Minister of which dynasty.

588
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,600
I'm not the Prime Minister of which dynasty.

589
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,920
I'm not the Prime Minister of which dynasty.

590
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,440
I'm not the Prime Minister of which dynasty.

591
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,080
I'm not the Prime Minister of which dynasty.

592
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,920
I'm not the Prime Minister of which dynasty.

593
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,920
I'm not the Prime Minister of which dynasty.

594
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,920
I'm not the Prime Minister of which dynasty.

595
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,920
I'm not the Prime Minister of which dynasty.

596
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,920
I'm not the Prime Minister of which dynasty.

597
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,680
I've heard it and heard it.

598
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,280
You can leave now.

599
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,680
Your Majesty.

600
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,080
I'm not your son.

601
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,240
I'm my son.

602
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,160
The emperor of the dynasty

603
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,280
will not make any mistakes.

604
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

605
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,520
I'll take my leave.

606
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,120
Yueqi.

607
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,160
Do your best.

608
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
Yes.

609
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,880
The assassin must be Yu Yuefei.

610
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,640
He can't get rid of the relationship.

611
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
You really don't want to talk about it?

612
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
I don't want to talk about it.

613
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
I don't want to talk about it.

614
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,080
You really don't want to talk about it?

615
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,400
His Majesty is the emperor.

616
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,200
The Empress Dowager is the Empress Dowager.

617
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
His Majesty has a secret.

618
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,720
He doesn't want me to know

619
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,760
that I can't interfere.

620
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,440
But if I hurt the emperor

621
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,280
and the emperor,

622
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,280
I can't tolerate it.

623
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,480
Aunt Wang.

624
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,560
You can go to Yu Yuefei's place to investigate.

625
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,200
Do you have any income?

626
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,960
I'm going.

627
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,840
I brought back this.

628
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,600
A lot of people nousse

629
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,080
in the past excuse

630
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,540
You've got enough hair.

631
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,280
Drink back your water.

632
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,640
Xiao Yue.

633
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,960
Your mug's here.

634
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,620
How have you been?

635
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,960
Come on.

636
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,080
It's dark.

637
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,080
What do you mean?

638
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,080
Ling'er is always a weak-willed girl.

639
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,080
She's even more white and transparent than winter snow.

640
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,080
Du Tianzhao, why are you here again?

641
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,080
There are so many people in the palace.

642
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,080
I just want to come here.

643
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,080
That's why I, the Empress Dowager,

644
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,080
believe that I'm sincere to the beauty of the palace.

645
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,080
Ling'er, look at this.

646
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,080
Brother Tianzhao, I really like

647
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,080
the white jade pearl powder you gave me.

648
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,080
Ling'er is so beautiful and she doesn't even look at me.

649
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,080
She even got a pair of eyeshadows.

650
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Her butt is almost torn apart.

651
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,080
Brother Tianzhao, why are you still hiding?

652
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,080
Come, sit down.

653
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
Ling'er is so considerate.

654
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,080
Didn't you say that her butt hurts?

655
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,080
Did you break it?

656
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,080
It turns out that this kind of pain

657
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,080
is all made up.

658
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,080
Your Majesty, are you not going in?

659
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
Go and take care of the palace.

660
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
Yes.

661
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,080
What? Really?

662
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,080
It's a personal opinion of my servant.

663
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,080
His Majesty was angry and left.

664
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,080
But it's a coincidence.

665
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,080
His Highness was joking with you in Fengluan Palace.

666
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,080
He was so surprised that His Majesty saw it.

667
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,080
It was Ling'er Yue Fei.

668
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,080
My silly son.

669
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,080
He even started to joke.

670
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,080
He was also a joke.

671
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,080
But Du Tianzhao,

672
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,080
why did he show off Yue Fei's money?

673
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,080
I really don't know.

674
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,080
He just wanted to marry Her Highness.

675
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,080
Your Majesty, come in.

676
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,080
Why are you here?

677
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
Greetings to Mother.

678
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,080
This...

679
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,080
Mother,

680
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,080
the left side is always in Fengluan Palace.

681
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,080
It's hard to avoid the discussion.

682
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
I remember.

683
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,080
Fengluan Palace entered the free token.

684
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,080
But you gave it to him.

685
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
If you don't agree,

686
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,080
I'll take it back.

687
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,080
But the things I gave him,

688
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,080
they're so easy to get back.

689
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,080
How shameless.

690
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,080
Enough.

691
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,080
You're getting older.

692
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,080
You can't care about these.

693
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,080
Moreover,

694
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
Yue Fei is pregnant.

695
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,080
You should put your attention on Yue Fei.

696
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,080
Don't keep an eye on him.

697
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,080
My uncle.

698
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,080
I'm doing this for...

699
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,080
Enough, you big man.

700
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,080
You should love Yue Fei.

701
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,080
Yes.

702
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,080
Don't think about anything else.

703
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,080
I love Yue Fei?

704
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,080
Yue Fei?

705
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,080
Your Majesty.

706
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,080
What's wrong?

707
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
Don't ask me.

708
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,080
I just got a big trouble by Xiao Cheng.

709
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,080
It was a woman.

710
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,080
It was.

711
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Is he all right?

712
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,080
Yue Fei is a little interesting.

713
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,080
Yue Fei is planning for the day.

714
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,080
How is it?

715
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,080
When I get the new box,

716
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,080
I'll ask the lady to come over to check it.

717
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,080
I often see this fabric.

718
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,080
But the thread and the needle are precious.

719
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,080
It's hard to find someone.

720
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

721
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,080
What is she busy with lately?

722
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,080
Yue Fei said she's smart.

723
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,080
She wants to help her with the wedding.

724
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,080
Your Majesty, don't look at the back.

725
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,080
Look at us.

726
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,080
Yue Fei is so noisy.

727
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,080
He's so noisy.

728
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,080
The thread is so bad.

729
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,080
I'm not going to give Yue Fei the gift.

730
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
Don't give her.

731
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,080
And the box is in the evening.

732
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,080
Ask her if it's enough.

733
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
I'll give it to her later.

734
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,080
The flower is so beautiful.

735
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,080
It's so beautiful.

736
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,080
The box is so beautiful.

737
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,080
Thank you for giving us this kind of air-conditioner.

738
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Otherwise, there would be a private box in the palace.

739
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,080
How can we do it?

740
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,080
Thank you for giving me such a nice box.

741
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
All right.

742
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,080
I know you have a good layout.

743
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
Let's start.

744
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
Give us a look.

745
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,080
Yes.

746
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Why are you closing the window?

747
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,080
I'm afraid that the fragrance will be gone.

748
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,080
The smell of the wine will be gone.

749
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,080
The wind will come.

750
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,080
It will hurt us.

751
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,080
It's still a small note.

752
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,080
The fragrance burns.

753
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,080
The fragrance of the mountain is the essence of the wood.

754
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,080
That's why it's successful.

755
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,080
At this time, the shop can cut the fragrance.

756
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,080
It's ready to burn.

757
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
It smells so good.

758
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
It smells so good.

759
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
Really.

760
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,080
Can you teach us a little bit in the future?

761
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
I can.

762
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,080
Can we do some kind of groom?

763
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,080
It must be very similar to this in the clothes.

764
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,080
Can we do a groom?

765
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
I can try it.

766
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,080
Okay.

767
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
Something's wrong.

768
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
Xiaoyue.

769
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
Xiaoyue.

770
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
Xiaoyue.

771
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,080
Xiaoyue.

772
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,080
Wake up.

773
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
Wake up.

774
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,080
Wake up.

775
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,080
Wake up.

776
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
Wake up.

777
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,080
Wake up, I'll help you.

778
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,080
Why do you smell like the fragrance?

779
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,080
Why do you smell like the fragrance?

780
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,080
Why do you smell like the fragrance?

781
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,080
Which one will you use?

782
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
This one.

783
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,640
Ying Ying.

784
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,440
Ying Ying.

785
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,000
Why isn't Ying Ying coming out?

786
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,600
Ying Ying,

787
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,760
wait for me here.

788
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,320
Ying Ying.

789
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,160
Ying Ying.

790
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,440
Ying Ying.

791
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,040
Your Highness.

792
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,040
Sister Qu.

793
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,600
Let's take them out first.
