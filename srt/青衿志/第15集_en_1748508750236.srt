1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If victory is not decided, let me fight

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The wind and moon are in the human world

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The youth is known as the old youth

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The past is the past, the past is the past

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
A sword falls and the wind flies

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Spring breeze is like a fan

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The old days are gone

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The new days are gone

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The old days are gone

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Your Majesty

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I came to protect you

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Your Majesty

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I have already thought of this result

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The military provisions are the spare provisions

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You save the lives of the people

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If I kill you today

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
will there be another official in the future

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
who will die for the people?

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you fight, you will die more than ten thousand people

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Shut up

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
General

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
General

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yue Chi came to kill the guilty by the order of the emperor

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now the general has been captured

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Do you have any other intentions?

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Your Majesty is wise

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's too strange for all the officials to gather here

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Please return to the palace as soon as possible for the sake of the country

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Kill him

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why?

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No matter what the situation is

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
At all costs

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I have to do what I have to do

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Isn't it the reason why the emperor called Yue Chi to the palace?

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Maintain the court stable

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's what I have to do now

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I entered the temple for the sake of my heart

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The peace of mind

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I have to do everything to achieve my goal

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If I want to get there

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I have to step into the blood of the innocent

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The bones of the brave

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Then I will leave this place

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yue Chi

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I was wrong

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Between you and me

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's always the same

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The same

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't want to be blamed

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yue Chi

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yue Chi

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Your Majesty

54
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Should I take a break?

55
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yue Chi

56
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Sister Ling'er, take a break

57
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm dizzy if you don't get dizzy

58
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I asked Yue to inquire

59
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I heard that His Majesty didn't leave the Qi Fu Hall for a whole day

60
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And today is the day of the first sick of General Zhen Nan

61
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
His Majesty and brother have no movement

62
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What do you want to have?

63
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
General Zhen Nan is now a sinner

64
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you want the emperor and the prime minister to send him to the grave?

65
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This is not right

66
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The more peaceful it is, the more terrible it is

67
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Since I entered the palace

68
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I have never seen such a deep gap between the emperor and his brother

69
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Have some tea first

70
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's good for your throat

71
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Why are you not in a hurry?

72
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's useless to be anxious

73
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Then you can be completely indifferent to this

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Not at all

75
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm already thinking of a way

76
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Say it

77
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This matter

78
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I have to let my sister talk to your brother

79
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm not going to talk to you

80
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm going to talk to you

81
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm going to talk to you

82
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm going to talk to you

83
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm going to talk to you

84
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm going to talk to you

85
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm going to talk to you

86
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm going to talk to you

87
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm going to talk to you

88
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm going to talk to you

89
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm going to talk to you

90
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm going to talk to you

91
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm going to talk to you

92
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm going to talk to you

93
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm going to talk to you

94
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Go and oui my fathers

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I

96
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You killed my father

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Give my brother back

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm the one who killed General Zhen Nan.

99
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You should have killed me.

100
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Huai Zhong! Don't be rude!

101
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Huai Zhong is young and ignorant.

102
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You two need not worry about him.

103
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There are many things to do today.

104
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's not convenient to entertain you.

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Please, be at ease.

106
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I did this.

107
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You don't need to...

108
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You gave me orders.

109
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Didn't you?

110
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You knew it was me who was pretending to be a ship.

111
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yue Chi.

112
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm the emperor.

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The right thing in this world

114
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
can be someone else's.

115
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But if you're wrong,

116
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
it must be the emperor who did it wrong.

117
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Because the only person

118
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
who can turn the tide

119
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
is the one who did it.

120
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This is how it happened.

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
General!

128
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I entered the temple

129
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
out of the martial arts world

130
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
for the sake of justice

131
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and peace.

132
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The case of Xinning.

133
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Did you see it?

134
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
If I want to reach the place

135
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
where the innocent are buried,

136
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and the brave are killed,

137
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
then this place

138
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
must be destroyed.

139
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm under the order of His Majesty

140
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
to come to the last city to see you off.

141
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Please forgive me.

142
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Please

143
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
thank my

144
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
lady.

145
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You're too kind.

146
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Take the coffin!

147
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I thank you all.

148
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Between you and me,

149
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
we've always been

150
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
against each other

151
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and want to fight back.

152
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm sorry!

155
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Flaming Party

156
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
dÃ©p!!!

157
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,000
Brother.

158
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,500
Why are you here?

159
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,300
I can't help but come over to see you no matter how worried I am.

160
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,660
The palace knows about it?

161
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,220
I don't know what exactly happened.

162
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,220
It's just that His Majesty has left the palace.

163
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,580
Brother, what are you doing?

164
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,180
I went hunting with His Majesty today.

165
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,660
I was injured by a wild bear.

166
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,580
I can't escort His Majesty back to the palace.

167
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,580
Understood.

168
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,780
I'll arrange for someone to leave to the inner court.

169
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,380
Are you afraid that the officials will know

170
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,260
or that he's the son of a criminal?

171
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,060
You'll have more troubles, right?

172
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,740
Brother.

173
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,900
Must you do this?

174
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,380
What?

175
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,260
Must you separate the public and private?

176
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,580
Must you only solve the problem

177
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,780
and not care about the people who are involved in it?

178
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,500
Must you choose between benevolence and the overall situation?

179
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,380
Can't they coexist?

180
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,700
Ling'er.

181
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,140
I'm like this.

182
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,860
Chuchuan, Her Majesty's message.

183
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,460
Let her enter the palace immediately.

184
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,740
Empress Dowager, she's here.

185
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,420
Greetings to Your Highness the Empress Dowager.

186
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,180
Sit.

187
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,020
Her Highness the Empress Dowager asked me to come here.

188
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,380
I have important matters to attend to.

189
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,380
Can't I invite you to sit here if I'm free?

190
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,780
Empress Dowager.

191
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,340
You want to question General Zhen Nan, right?

192
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,340
You're so smart.

193
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,980
I'm wrong.

194
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,700
But I have no regrets.

195
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,580
It's your problem whether you're wrong or not.

196
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,620
I can't control it.

197
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,380
Open it.

198
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,740
Open it.

199
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,340
General Zhen Nan.

200
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,740
Jiucheng is in danger.

201
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,060
This is a human heart.

202
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,060
Get out of here!

203
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,100
Why do you have to hold her back?

204
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,540
Yuchi.

205
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,620
I thought you understood me.

206
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,140
Yuchi.

207
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,460
I think you've guessed it.

208
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
Isn't it?

209
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,180
Five years ago,

210
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,580
His Majesty's father also had a flood.

211
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,580
The ground in Jiangzhou is wet.

212
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,260
If the water level rises by one inch,

213
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,060
the whole Jiangzhou will be in danger.

214
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,060
Your Highness.

215
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,580
The problem now is not only the flood,

216
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,580
but also the food.

217
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,900
The storage of food in Jiangzhou

218
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,700
is enough for the whole city to eat for less than five days.

219
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,380
How about this?

220
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,380
We can shorten the time.

221
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,700
We can hold on.

222
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,900
The aid of the court is on the way.

223
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,900
I think it will arrive in ten days.

224
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,980
No, Your Highness.

225
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,380
The food storage in Jiangzhou was flooded

226
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,380
half an hour ago.

227
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,900
Now all the food is gone.

228
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,260
Run!

229
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:59,120
Golden preview of the

230
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:05,420
Golden preview of the

231
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,420
Heavens is going to destruction in Jiangzhou.

232
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,900
Your Highness,

233
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,180
it's hard for human to resist now.

234
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,860
Let alone being too lazy to take on everything.

235
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,820
Look at the people in the city

236
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,100
They are all gone

237
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,180
Then I will fight against the sky

238
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,580
So many people are waiting to eat

239
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,580
I don't think there is any way

240
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,460
I can only stop this heart

241
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,820
When the supply and demand started

242
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,780
It was 300 eggs

243
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,260
Now it's only a few cities

244
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,260
Half of it is gone

245
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,660
Where can you reach the border?

246
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,060
Why do you care about that?

247
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,620
Anyway, it's not us

248
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,860
Go

249
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,860
What are you doing?

250
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,220
We are here to escort troops

251
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,340
Can you afford it?

252
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,820
Yes, we can afford it

253
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,180
Take it

254
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,220
It's a car

255
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,220
Take it away

256
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,180
People

257
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,180
Take it away

258
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,300
Take the car away

259
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:06,660
People

260
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,500
Take it away

261
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,820
The goods sold rely on the over 100 military supplies

262
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,820
It made 38,000 people in Chengdu

263
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,020
The most difficult time of the war

264
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,820
Son

265
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,420
Doctor

266
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,700
Your Highness, call the doctor

267
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,700
Come on

268
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,220
But he didn't live through that summer

269
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,140
The court sent people to investigate the unmarked military supplies

270
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,340
It's indeed a lost military supplies

271
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,060
Take it away

272
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,940
I said I'm not a criminal

273
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,380
You can't catch him

274
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,380
Take it away

275
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,380
Take it away

276
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,380
Take it away

277
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,900
You are all good people

278
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,380
Take it away

279
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,380
You can't take it away

280
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,380
I'm a good person

281
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,380
Take it away

282
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,980
I'm not a criminal

283
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,580
Taishou, you can't go with them

284
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,380
Taishou is a good person

285
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,180
You can't catch him

286
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,180
Take it away

287
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,580
Let my father go

288
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,580
Take it away

289
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:06,780
Heng'er

290
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,580
General Suo

291
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,180
You are for the country and the people

292
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,780
What crime do you have?

293
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,380
Everything in the world can be done

294
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,180
But not for the people

295
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,180
This is what my father did with the determination to die

296
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,380
But you did it to save people, father

297
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,780
If there is no one

298
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,580
Who are these rules for?

299
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,380
A person

300
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,380
Changes many people's goods

301
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,980
It's worth it

302
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,180
Huo Xiao used his own life

303
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,180
Changed a city of people

304
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,180
The water is clear

305
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,780
The river is safe

306
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,580
In order to protect the other people of the Huo family

307
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,180
He received the letter from the master

308
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,380
He committed suicide

309
00:20:37,580 --> 00:21:04,580
The other lucky people were

310
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,580
I didn't throw him away

311
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,580
It's for the sake of the Ji family

312
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,580
and the good fortune of Huo Xiao

313
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,580
It's for the sake of 38,000 people in the whole Jianghu

314
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,580
So, he left Jianghu

315
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,580
He left Jianghu and entered the troubled world

316
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,580
just for his father

317
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,580
For his father's sake

318
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,580
The one who saved the world

319
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:41,580
is the real hero

320
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,580
The real hero

321
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,580
Do we have to choose between the two?

322
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,580
Can't they coexist?

323
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,580
General Zhen Nan

324
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,580
is the one who caused the disaster

325
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,580
This is the heart of the people

326
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,580
Get out

327
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,580
Yue Zhi, I thought you understood me

328
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,580
He left Jianghu and entered the troubled world

329
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,580
just for his father's sake

330
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,580
For his father's sake

331
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,580
The one who saved the world

332
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,580
is the real hero

333
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,580
The real hero

334
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,580
Killing General Gu

335
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,580
Killing Huo Tai

336
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,580
Killing Huo Tai

337
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,580
Yue Zhi

338
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,580
This is what you want

339
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,580
I'm sorry

340
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,580
I'm sorry

341
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,580
I'm sorry

342
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,580
I'm sorry

343
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,580
I'm sorry

344
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,580
I'm sorry

345
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,580
I'm sorry

346
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,580
I'm sorry

347
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,580
I'm sorry

348
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,580
I'm sorry

349
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,580
I'm sorry

350
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,580
I'm sorry

351
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,580
I'm sorry

352
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,580
I'm sorry

353
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,580
The world

354
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,580
The most famous color

355
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,580
is your eyes

356
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,580
How naive

357
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,580
I can't turn back

358
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,580
Your Majesty, the moon is the most beautiful

359
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,580
What are you doing here?

360
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,580
Are you here to cut the grass and root?

361
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,580
I'm sorry

362
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,580
I'm sorry

363
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,580
I'm sorry

364
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,580
I'm sorry

365
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,580
I'm sorry

366
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,580
I'm sorry

367
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,580
I'm sorry

368
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,580
I'm sorry

369
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,580
I'm sorry

370
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,580
I'm sorry

371
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,580
I'm sorry

372
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,580
I'm sorry

373
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,580
I'm sorry

374
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,580
I'm sorry

375
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,780
Stone

376
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,620
Stone

377
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,560
Stone

378
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:58,120
Stone

379
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,520
I feel guilty about it.

380
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,480
I don't want to say

381
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,120
that it's not too late to avenge a gentleman.

382
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,280
My killing is too heavy.

383
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,120
Maybe I can't wait for your ten years.

384
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
But I don't regret it.

385
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,960
Everyone has his duty.

386
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,360
As the prime minister,

387
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,960
it's my duty to maintain the stability of the court.

388
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,880
My father's duty

389
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,080
is to protect the people.

390
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,760
He did it,

391
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,400
but he's still dead.

392
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,880
So you have to grow up

393
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,720
and be strong.

394
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,440
You have to get back the justice

395
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,160
for your wrongdoings.

396
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,640
General Zhen Nan's sword

397
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,160
is now back to its original form.

398
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,240
General has been prepared

399
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,320
to die with his father.

400
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,640
Even if His Majesty let him go,

401
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,520
he wouldn't leave him alive.

402
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,760
The family of Gu

403
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,640
and the reputation of Qi Cheng

404
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,160
are not to be forgotten.

405
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,880
You're right.

406
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,560
You're a good official.

407
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,040
I killed him.

408
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,160
He won't forgive you.

409
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,280
It's my fault.

410
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,440
It's also my duty.

411
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,240
Your Majesty,

412
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,640
I have one more request.

413
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
But it's okay.

414
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,200
Your Majesty,

415
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,320
please send Huai Zhong to the camp.

416
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,480
But

417
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,880
this is the only blood of the general.

418
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,120
But this is also the only wish of the general.

419
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,200
I know.

420
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,480
I'm willing to go to the camp

421
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,560
and serve the country.

422
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,040
I'm willing.

423
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,440
I want to be like my father.

424
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,240
You will be

425
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,480
a true hero

426
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,040
who will save the world.

427
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,520
rundown

428
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,760
What's going on?

429
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,160
Why are you still drinking?

430
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,160
There's still a broken rice in the pot.

431
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,440
I can't even drink water.

432
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,800
I don't care.

433
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,920
You must think of a way out for me today.

434
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,840
Okay, okay, okay. I'll think of it now.

435
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,600
Young Master, Young Master, bad news!

436
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,360
Bad news!

437
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,960
You're so flustered.

438
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,560
At most, there's an assassin who's going to assassinate me. What are you afraid of?

439
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,360
There's no assassin. They went to assassinate Miss!

440
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,960
What?

441
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,360
Xin Tong, Li Xiao, Fu Nan, and Gong Yu,

442
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,760
you're not going to be able to get out of here.

443
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,560
Xin Tong, Li Xiao,

444
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,560
Fu Nan and Gong Yu have sent a message saying that Yue Fei's body isn't well.

445
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,160
You can't just leave her alone today.

446
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,760
Her body isn't well? Did you get an imperial physician?

447
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,160
Yue Fei refused.

448
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,560
She's not well and she hasn't seen an imperial physician yet.

449
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,760
Nonsense.

450
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,360
Slow down!

451
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,560
Watch out for the floor!

452
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,360
Did you get an imperial physician?

453
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,560
They've sent him to the hospital.

454
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,360
Where is he?

455
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,560
He should be on his way.

456
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,160
The Imperial Physician's Office

457
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,360
She's really not well.

458
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,760
She can talk and smile, but she can't eat.

459
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,960
Maybe she's just being happy.

460
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,160
I think she's very well.

461
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,360
Why did she go to the Palace of Phoenix? What imperial physician did she call?

462
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,960
Your Majesty, let's go back to Yingqian Palace.

463
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,760
We're already here. What are we going to do?

464
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,160
The food is cold. Can we still eat?

465
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Your Majesty is right.

466
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,560
I want to see what she's going to do.

467
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,160
Ling'er, open the door.

468
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,960
You two talk. Don't mind me.

469
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,360
Ling'er, open the door.

470
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,960
Your Majesty, are you still in the middle of something important? What are you doing?

471
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
I'm not in the middle of something important.

472
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
You're very clear.

473
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,560
Brother, you heard it, right?

474
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,160
His Majesty said it's fine.

475
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,960
If you have any misunderstandings, just talk.

476
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,760
I'll open the door for you in an hour.

477
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,360
We're all family.

478
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,360
Just talk to each other.

479
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,160
Yue Ling'er.

480
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,560
Let's go.

481
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,960
Eunuch Gui, let's go.

482
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,560
Ling'er.

483
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,160
Let's go.

484
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,160
Put it down.

485
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,360
Yue Xiang is still like this.

486
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,160
He doesn't care about others.

487
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,160
He can't protect himself. How can he care about others?

488
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,360
He knows he's wrong. He doesn't care about others.

489
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,360
A city has tens of thousands of lives. How can he not care about others?

490
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,760
A military order is a heavy burden.

491
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,560
Because of the cold weather,

492
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,560
he lost a good official who is fair and innocent.

493
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,760
Or because he wanted to preserve the food, he gave up thousands of people. Do you think it's worth it?

494
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,760
The new government has just started. If the country is broken,

495
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
the people who are killed are still thousands of people.

496
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,760
He's dismissed, fired, and locked up.

497
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,360
There are many other options.

498
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,960
And you chose to kill him.

499
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,160
Have you ever thought about the will of General Zhen Nan?

500
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,560
Maybe he'd rather die standing up

501
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,160
than kneel and live.

502
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360
Doesn't this old man know he's tired?

503
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,160
This is the 25th thing he repaired.

504
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,760
I don't know. Go ask him.

505
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,360
Uncle, take a break.

506
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,160
Consort Yu, it's almost an hour.

507
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,560
Don't worry, Brother.

508
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,560
What? Are you nervous?

509
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,360
Why don't you go over and listen?

510
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,160
No. I believe they will make up.

511
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,360
You're so confident?

512
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,560
Of course. My brother.

513
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,160
I know my brother very well.

514
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,160
And His Majesty is also a very wise person.

515
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,760
I have a grudge against Qi Ying Ying for killing her father.

516
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,160
She once listened to Cao Mao and wanted to avenge her father.

517
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,960
But she failed to frame Ling Er.

518
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,600
The Du Tianzhao

519
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,560
suppressed Cao Mao back to the city.

520
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,160
She was saved by someone.

521
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,760
Someone used Xiao Shuo as bait.

522
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,360
Xiao Shuo was kidnapped by the people dressed as the imperial guards.

523
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,760
Wei Zhang found out.

524
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,560
Yi Qing Yuan came to the city.

525
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,560
He was killed by the people dressed as the imperial guards.

526
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
He was killed by the people dressed as the imperial guards.

527
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,960
Yi Qing Yuan came to the city.

528
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,360
He was kidnapped by Wei Zhang.

529
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,760
He was caught in a flood.

530
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,360
Cao Mao was very accurate.

531
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,760
He used a bait to force General Zhen Nan to use military bait.

532
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,360
You and I

533
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,760
are so fierce.

534
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,960
The person behind this

535
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,560
must still be Yi Qing Yuan.

536
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,360
You're very attractive.

537
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,760
I'd rather not have this charm.

538
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,360
From being kidnapped by Jiang Yun Shu

539
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,560
to General Zhen Nan opening a warehouse to store food.

540
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,360
Everything we do and think about is all fake.

541
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,160
Yi Qing Yuan must have a secret agent

542
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,360
by our side.

543
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,960
You've done too much for me and Xiao Shuo.

544
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,360
I want to stay by your side and be your bodyguard.

545
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,760
It's easy for Mr. Jian to be attacked.

546
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,960
But it's also dangerous for some people.

547
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,560
You don't know how to play chess.

548
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,160
Qing, where's your jade pendant?

549
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,960
It's gone.

550
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,960
It's Xiao Shuo's pawn shop.

551
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,560
You don't want to believe it's him, right?

552
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,760
Give me some time. I'll go look for him.

553
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,560
How much do you know about him?

554
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,560
What do you mean?

555
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,160
He came back after so long.

556
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,560
Why did he come?

557
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,160
Don't you want to confirm it?

558
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,160
You have your Qing Yuan pendant.

559
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,760
I have what I need to do.

560
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,160
How do you confirm it? You have to ask yourself.

561
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,760
Your Highness, it seems to be not right.

562
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,960
Hurry.

563
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,760
I'll go take a look.

564
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,960
Brother, didn't you talk it over?

565
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,560
Ling'er, since you've taken care of yourself,

566
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,960
tell me if you need anything. I'll go now.

567
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,360
Your Highness, what should we do?

568
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,560
Your Majesty, it's time to study.

569
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,960
Did you break a card?

570
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,560
Your Majesty is right.

571
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,760
Consort Yue's card is really sharp.

572
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,160
I'll just take the internal document and ask her to sit with you.

573
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,160
Consort Hui.

574
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,360
Commander in Chief.

575
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,360
I'm done. I'll go now.

576
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,960
Okay. I'll put the homework on your desk.

577
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,760
Remember to look.

578
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,560
What's wrong?

579
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,160
Consort Yue's card was stolen.

580
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,760
When did it happen?

581
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,360
Today.

582
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,760
Hao Ge Huo Jing Hang.

583
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,960
He clearly can't punish me.

584
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,360
He just blackmailed me.

585
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,160
What do you mean?

586
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,960
This is the last signal he gave me.

587
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,560
Ling'er came to the palace to maintain military relations.

588
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,360
Now he doesn't want it anymore.

589
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,760
After he humiliated Ling'er, he'll find a chance to get rid of me.

590
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,360
Commander in Chief, what should we do?

591
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,160
The Crown Prince of Li Dynasty once asked me to come.

592
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,360
No. This is a death sentence for treason.

593
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,160
I can't bear to see it. If I have to, I can only do it.

594
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,960
As long as there's a chance, I have to break into the Palace of Hell.

595
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,060
quality

596
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,360
quality

597
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,960
Hello?

598
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Young Master.

599
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,680
Look at it yourself.

600
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,520
Is it true that Huo Jing Heng and Yue Chi are separated?

601
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,520
It's true.

602
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,520
Yue Ling Er planned to gather Yue Chi and Huo Jing Heng together today.

603
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,640
He wanted them to be reunited,

604
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,960
but he didn't want to.

605
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,680
He took Yue Fei's name away instead.

606
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,880
Then Yue Chi didn't think of killing the palace

607
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,200
to seek justice for his sister?

608
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,800
Yue Chi is looking for a way out.

609
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,200
He already has the idea of leaving the city.

610
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,280
It seems that I can prepare to return to the country in advance.

611
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,680
Congratulations, Young Master. You've achieved your wish.

612
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,080
It's congratulations to the two of us for achieving our wish.

613
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,800
As long as you willingly bring Yue Chi here,

614
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,480
I will willingly give you your antidote.

615
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,360
Thank you, Young Master.

616
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,560
Anything else?

617
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
Young Master,

618
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,040
it's a grave crime to bring Yue Chi to leave the country.

619
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,640
If Da Ning is in trouble because of this,

620
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,440
will you cover for her at all costs?

621
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,240
Are you talking about me?

622
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,200
I wouldn't dare.

623
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,200
I'm just worried about you.

624
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,880
Officer Xue,

625
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,640
it seems that you've really forgotten your identity.

626
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,120
Do you really think that you're a princess who's being controlled?

627
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,600
Don't ask who wrote the love letter

628
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,520
and leave it to the wind to blow tomorrow

629
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,080
I'm willing to sacrifice my life

630
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,880
and go to the other side of the river to find my love

631
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,320
If I can't get my love back, I'll let the world know

632
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,720
and let the wind blow the snow

633
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,720
I won't let the moon shine without a name

634
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,560
and the moon will appear without a word

635
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,640
Love knows that when the blood is hot, the cold will disappear

636
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,080
and the soul will be destroyed
