00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Story of the Phoenix

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 1

3
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Good.

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Miss, you're back.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Miss.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Say, you've been here since you came here.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Give it to me.

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Ling.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This girl is so...

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If you have a sister, forget about your brother.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Sister Qingrui.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I've been begging her for a long time.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
She wants me to come home secretly.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But we just separated.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Stop it.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I just want to.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why are you so lively?

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Miss Jiang is a martial arts fighter.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
She's a great figure.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Of course.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's go.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's go.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's go.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's so nice to be home.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yousheng.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Come and try.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Your favorite bun is just out.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll get it for you.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You can't just grab it.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's been a long time.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Go and save it.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Go and save it.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't just keep it and keep it.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Promise me.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You were born in 16th.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's the first time I've seen you.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I brought you a gift.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I knew we'd be good friends.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Even if you and my brother

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
didn't kiss each other,

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I believe we'd be good friends.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Right?

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I thought you were a fast-witted soldier.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Are you hungry?

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And you.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is the food not good?

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Why are you so quiet?

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Maybe I've been walking for a long time.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I think the food in the palace

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
is so delicious.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You're the emperor now.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're staying in your palace

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
every day.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Do you have so many things to do?

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm busy with things recently.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
My mother is right.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I need to practice dancing.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I need to be born.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Right.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You need to practice dancing.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't stay there.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Walk more.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If you don't practice dancing,

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
you'll have to practice dancing.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't keep practicing in the palace.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Otherwise, you'll have to practice

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
the piano dance.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What's your order in the future?

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Just say it.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You didn't find

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
that you're not in the palace.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yue Fei.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yue Fei has been home for two days.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Look.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You know it all.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yue Fei has been away for so long.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You don't want to go there?

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You think I don't want to go?

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Go.

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm so tired of people in the palace.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Enough.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What are you doing?

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What are you doing?

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm with a big stranger.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't need to go there.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You don't need to go there.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Sit down.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm full.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Eat more.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I've seen a lot of clothes.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I didn't notice the maid.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm so tired of it.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'll make some for you.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yue.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
0.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
2.

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Uncle Liu, thank you for taking care of me.

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm going to...

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Uncle Liu.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There are many children today.

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Go back to your work.

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Uncle Liu, I'll walk you out.

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
When are you leaving?

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you sure about the date?

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Brother.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sure.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm not leaving.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yue Ling'er.

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Why did I call you back?

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You have to do something bad.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll send you to the palace tomorrow.

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I...

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Sister.

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What are you laughing at?

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What are you laughing at?

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Sit down.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Brother.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Didn't you say you have something to do?

120
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Go ahead.

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll talk to Sister Qing'er.

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Is everything all right?

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes.

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
We're going to talk about girls.

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You want to join us?

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You guys talk.

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Sister Qing'er.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You live here.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Just take it as your home.

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Why are you here?

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm here to pick Yue Fei.

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Go ahead.

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I can't wait to see if you can pick up the weirdo.

134
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Why are you holding Ling'er like a dog?

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Ling'er.

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Huo Jinheng.

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I finally understand.

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Sister Qing'er, don't go there.

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Sister Qing'er.

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This is the gift from last year.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I've kept it wrong.

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Don't mind it.

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Ling'er.

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I brought you the favorite snacks from the palace.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Huo.

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Is there a fan cake?

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
No.

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Is there a fan cake?

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't remember the name.

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But the red, blue, green, purple,

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and the five-color are all there.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The red one is the fan cake.

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The yellow one is the orange, red, and yellow.

154
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The green one is the green bean cake.

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The purple one is the strawberry juice.

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's made from the medicine.

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Strawberry juice is...

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Look at my memory.

159
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Strawberry juice is...

160
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's grape.

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm old-fashioned.

162
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Tell me.

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's okay to change the name.

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't think.

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Go.

166
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Get this clean clothes.

167
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You just came here and you're dirty.

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Your Majesty.

169
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Go.

170
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Don't worry.

171
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I won't eat grapes.

172
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Nor will I eat people.

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yue Fei.

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I haven't found your experience in a long time.

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But...

176
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Go.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I didn't expect you to eat snacks.

178
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're different.

179
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You're just a little bit more.

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What are you planning to do?

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm going to find a target

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and make a detour.

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That makes sense.

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But I think

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Jiangnan Water Flora is more suitable for the wine.

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Why do you have to make a detour?

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Jiangnan is a good place.

188
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But it's not like the imperial city.

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's a mess.

190
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's a mess.

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's a mess.

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's a mess.

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If you think Jiangnan is a good place,

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
why don't you change your mind

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and go to Jiangnan?

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Why are you walking so fast?

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Slow down.

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The lantern is cute.

199
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's like you.

200
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Let me give you a ride.

201
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's cute.

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But the Mid-Autumn Festival is over.

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What do I need this lantern for?

204
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I want to give you a ride.

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The lantern is so cute.

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Ming Er, can you show me?

207
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No.

208
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I can't.

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I can't.

210
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I can't.

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I can't.

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I can't.

213
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I can't.

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I can't.

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Of course.

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's cute.

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yes.

218
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I couldn't afford to buy the lantern.

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I couldn't get in the palace.

220
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I couldn't get in the palace.

221
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I was so envious.

222
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's okay.

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Your Majesty will agree.

224
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Take it.

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's pretty hot over there.

226
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll go and have a look.

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
There are many things that people want.

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's not something that everyone can get.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
How can I know if I don't try it?

230
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I used to go a long way.

231
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I used to walk a long way.

232
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But now I can't even get to the place where I can't get up.

233
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's also a good thing that I've got what I want.

234
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Congratulations to Jiang Wu Na.

235
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You have such a good luck.

236
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I hope that Jiang Wu Na's luck can't continue to be so good.

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
If you wish to help, you can do as you wish.

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Qing Er, what were you talking about?

239
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Nothing.

240
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm just thanking you for giving me this.

241
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'll keep it well.

242
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You're really generous and generous.

243
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You're really generous and generous.

244
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's nothing.

245
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm just thanking you for giving me this.

246
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'll keep it well.

247
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Ling Er.

248
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Ling Er, you're going shopping?

249
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Are you not angry?

250
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't be so generous.

251
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's a serious matter.

252
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Are you listening to me?

253
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Miss, you're tired.

254
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Get some rest.

255
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I like you.

256
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't like you.

257
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I like you.

258
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't like you.

259
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Qing Er, are you into something bad?

260
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
No.

261
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
SOUND

263
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't care if you like His Majesty.

264
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh no.

265
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh no.

266
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Don't wake up.

267
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,400
Ling'er.

268
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,600
What's wrong?

269
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,800
Nothing.

270
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
I fell down accidentally.

271
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,800
How old are you?

272
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Are you hurt?

273
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Did you sleep well last night?

274
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,400
You look so pale.

275
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,200
You look pale now.

276
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,200
What's wrong?

277
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Are you unhappy?

278
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
Qing'er.

279
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,200
I had a nightmare last night.

280
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
It's okay.

281
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
It's all fake in the nightmare.

282
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,200
You didn't ask me what I had a nightmare.

283
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Okay.

284
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
What nightmare did you have?

285
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:07,200
I dreamed that we both wanted to have the same pillow.

286
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Then we quarreled.

287
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
What nightmare did I have?

288
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
If that's the case,

289
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
I'll give Ling'er the pillow.

290
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,200
And if I want it,

291
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
I'll give Ling'er the pillow.

292
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Sister.

293
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Okay.

294
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Are you sleepy?

295
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
I'll stay with you.

296
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
If you're sleepy,

297
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
I'll keep you company.

298
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Qing'er is so good to me.

299
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
If he really likes His Majesty,

300
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
and His Majesty likes Qing'er,

301
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
I...

302
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
His Majesty wants Princess Qianzhao.

303
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,200
I think he likes His Majesty.

304
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
I think

305
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
you should stop thinking about it.

306
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,200
I'm sure His Majesty will do as you wish.

307
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
How can I stop thinking about it?

308
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Wei Zhang.

309
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Yes, my lord.

310
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,200
I heard that Empress Dowager is sad about Feng Lan Palace.

311
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
How is it?

312
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
You're so thoughtful.

313
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Look at this.

314
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Empress Dowager,

315
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Yue Fei is living in the house.

316
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Yue Fei has a sister in the house.

317
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
She's in a good relationship.

318
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Okay.

319
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Good.

320
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Empress Dowager,

321
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,200
His Majesty went to see Consort Yue today.

322
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Her Highness and Miss Qing

323
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
embroidered a box today.

324
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,200
It's Miss Qing.

325
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Empress Dowager, Miss Qing.

326
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Miss Qing?

327
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Why is she Miss Qing again?

328
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
What is she doing?

329
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Did she change her clothes?

330
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
She's not married yet.

331
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
She said she's Her Highness's best friend.

332
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,200
I think she's also being tortured by His Majesty.

333
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
I think something's wrong.

334
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
What best friend?

335
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
She's the one who takes men away from her.

336
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
I have to meet her.

337
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Sister,

338
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,200
you're the one who asked me to meet her.

339
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Why should I take men away from her?

340
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
Don't bother.

341
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Why?

342
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
You're the one who's always there.

343
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Go.

344
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Call them all.

345
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Tell them to come to my place.

346
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Xuan,

347
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Her Highness has been appointed.

348
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,200
A woman should have a loss.

349
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,200
She doesn't have the ability to be a woman.

350
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
She's so young.

351
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,200
You can't step into the royal city forever.

352
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,200
I'm here to see you.

353
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Your Highness,

354
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Qingru,

355
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
she's my brother.

356
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Yes, the benefactor of Yuexiang.

357
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Shut up.

358
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
What's your brother like in the front court?

359
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Who can be engaged to her?

360
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
When my mother gets married,

361
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,200
you can't even keep your sister.

362
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
The benefactor of Yuexiang?

363
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
How can I save her?

364
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
This is...

365
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Chen...

366
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
I didn't help you.

367
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Two years ago,

368
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
after being shot by His Majesty,

369
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
I was able to take care of Miss Qing

370
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
and I was lucky to survive.

371
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,200
So you're helping my son to be a good son.

372
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
I dare not think like that.

373
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
This matter is my fault.

374
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Miss Qing is thinking too much.

375
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Although she was a herb,

376
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
she almost made Chen's life more important.

377
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
But thanks to her,

378
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
the poison was high.

379
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
She was poisoned by poison.

380
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
She cured Chen's previous poison.

381
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
She knows medicine.

382
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
No wonder she's been with Yue Fei

383
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
in the Prince of Anle

384
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
every day.

385
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
If she's a good sister,

386
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
she should help Yue Fei

387
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
to get a good body.

388
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Let Yue Fei help His Majesty

389
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,200
to have a big son sooner.

390
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Little demon,

391
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
you're so capable.

392
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
I'm still young.

393
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
I've been a good son.

394
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
I've been a good son.

395
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
I'm a good son.

396
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
If you're in a hurry,

397
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,200
you should help her to get a good body.

398
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Nonsense!

399
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
You're so stupid.

400
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
I've been with Yue Fei for a long time.

401
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
I want to break up Ling'er and me.

402
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
You're strong.

403
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
People in the martial arts world are strong.

404
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,200
Is Sister Yunqing talking about herself?

405
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
It seems that

406
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
she really likes to get a good body.

407
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Yue Fei is very good.

408
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Emperor,

409
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
speak.

410
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Don't worry, Mother.

411
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,200
I have no idea

412
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
about this girl.

413
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
She saved Yue Xiang's life.

414
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
To be fair,

415
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
she was the one who cursed the former.

416
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,200
That's why she's the one who saved her life today.

417
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,200
I can help His Majesty to save the palace.

418
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
I'm sorry.

419
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
How could you die?

420
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
I'm grateful that you're still here.

421
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Can you let this woman close her mouth?

422
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Thank you?

423
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Then how should I thank you?

424
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
I'm grateful.

425
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
I won't bother His Majesty.

426
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Right.

427
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,200
I can't let her run away.

428
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Thank you?

429
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
You're right.

430
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
It's late.

431
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
The Empress Dowager said she would be thirsty.

432
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Drink some tea.

433
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Okay.

434
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
It's time for dinner.

435
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Don't disturb the Empress Dowager.

436
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
You can leave now.

437
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
I'll leave now.

438
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
Get up.

439
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
No appetite?

440
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Are you still angry?

441
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,200
The doctor said you need to make progress.

442
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,200
There are always many things to say.

443
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Qing,

444
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,200
life is not a burden.

445
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,200
You have to keep a mouth for yourself.

446
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

447
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Look at other bright places.

448
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Don't always be trapped in the dark places.

449
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
There are other directions.

450
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,200
I can find them with you.

451
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
So,

452
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
the direction you're looking for

453
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,200
is to be willing to go to the left.

454
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Be a good friend of his.

455
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
I was in the war.

456
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,200
You said you wanted the people to have a good night.

457
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
The people in Qianying and the people in the country

458
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
are different.

459
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
It's a pity.

460
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
He's just a busy man.

461
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,200
How can he be a good emperor?

462
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
Zheng Yingying is born without a father.

463
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,200
That's why he knows the people are in a hurry.

464
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,200
I have to help him.

465
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
I hope so.

466
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,200
I'm afraid you'll think of him.

467
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
And in the end,

468
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,200
you'll be in a fight.

469
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
So,

470
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,200
you didn't want to stay here.

471
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Is he worthy of being a princess?

472
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
What?

473
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Where should I go to eat?

474
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Feng Nan Palace.

475
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
You didn't leave?

476
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
No.

477
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Let's go.

478
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
Let's go to Feng Nan Palace.

479
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
Ling'er.

480
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Okay, okay.

481
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
Good.

482
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
You've moved all of this.

483
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,200
You don't have to stay with your sister.

484
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,200
I'll wait for you to take the air out.

485
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,200
So I can take her in.

486
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
No need.

487
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
Your sister Yunqing

488
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
has been here for five times.

489
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
She's very annoying.

490
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Don't you like her?

491
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Of course.

492
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,200
But I think Qing'er

493
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,200
likes His Majesty.

494
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
What are you talking about?

495
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Think about it.

496
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,200
What's your opinion when he looks at me?

497
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
You like me?

498
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
I'm not bad if I don't kill you.

499
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
Really?

500
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Of course.

501
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
I promise you.

502
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,200
He won't like me.

503
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Okay.

504
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Since that's the case,

505
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,200
I'm relieved.

506
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
It's annoying to say this.

507
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
I told Yuechi

508
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
to let him leave the imperial city.

509
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
He won't do anything to her.

510
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
If he doesn't feel relieved,

511
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,200
he'll send a team of people to protect her.

512
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
But your brother

513
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
won't do anything to her.

514
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
I'll be angry if he says that.

515
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
What's wrong with him?

516
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
He's hiding Princess Qian Chao.

517
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,200
Brother Huang, listen to me.

518
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
Although Qing'er is Princess Qian Chao,

519
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
don't think she's a princess.

520
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
She won't do anything

521
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,200
to pay for the wealth of the prosperity.

522
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
What do you mean?

523
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Don't think she's a princess.

524
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,200
She's a very peaceful person.

525
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
She's very relaxed in life.

526
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,200
She's very good to everyone.

527
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
She's a good princess.

528
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Jiang Yunqing saved your life.

529
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
How could she be like this?

530
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Indeed.

531
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
But it's not far from my brother

532
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
and sister.

533
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,200
They've been close since they were young.

534
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Later, they got engaged again.

535
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,200
They almost became my sister-in-law.

536
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,200
This princess is so stubborn.

537
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
She's not happy at all.

538
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,200
I don't know what your brother thinks of her.

539
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
What are you happy about?

540
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Yes.

541
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
No matter what you like,

542
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Qing'er is my brother.

543
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
She's a good girl.

544
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
She's a good girl.

545
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
So my brother won't care about her.

546
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,200
You and Qing'er

547
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,200
are all important and want to protect you.

548
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,200
He doesn't want you to be killed

549
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,200
because of some unethical talents.

550
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
Think about it,

551
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,200
he's the one who's been in love for years.

552
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
And the other one

553
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
is the one who can make a revenge.

554
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,200
A wise and generous princess.

555
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,200
He doesn't dare to use any risky method.

556
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,200
He can only make you leave.

557
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Is there any other way

558
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
to do this?

559
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Ling'er.

560
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
I never remember

561
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,200
your brother and Princess Qiancao's brother.

562
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
It's unfair.

563
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
I have so many

564
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
trust in your brother.

565
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
But your brother

566
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,200
is always like a sand in the sand.

567
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,200
I think he's

568
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
so much trust in me.

569
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Why is the smell so sour?

570
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
I'm sorry.

571
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
I can't help it.

572
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,200
I'll adjust it.

573
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,200
But there's another smell.

574
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
You're comforting me, aren't you?

575
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,200
I'm not.

576
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,200
I really think this wine is good.

577
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,200
So I have my own taste.

578
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,200
No matter which princess Qiancao

579
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,200
is so good at your eyes and your brother's eyes,

580
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
I won't like you.

581
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
I'll go back to my room.

582
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
I'll go back to my room.

583
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,200
I'll go back to my room.

584
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
I'll go back to my room.

585
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
I'll go back to my room.

586
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
I'll go back to my room.

587
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
I'll go back to my room.

588
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
I'll go back to my room.

589
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
I'll go back to my room.

590
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
I'll go back to my room.

591
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
I'll go back to my room.

592
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
I'll go back to my room.

593
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
I'll go back to my room.

594
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
I'll go back to my room.

595
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Why didn't you go to the front door?

596
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
The front door is the emperor.

597
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
The street in the night

598
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
made you so excited.

599
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
It's a black and white piece.

600
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Maybe it's more important.

601
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
Do you want to pay?

602
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
I'll pay.

603
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Here.

604
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
The duck in the jade lake.

605
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,200
And the wine that Ling'er made.

606
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
Here.

607
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
I understand you.

608
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
You're deeply in love with Jiang Yunqing.

609
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
I'm worried about her.

610
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
I'm worried about her.

611
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
So I want to protect her.

612
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
I'm angry with you today.

613
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
I won't let her down.

614
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Even if Jiang Yunqing stays in your house,

615
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
I won't be a burden to her.

616
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
But I just hope that

617
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
from now on,

618
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,200
we'll be together forever.

619
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
Take it.

620
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Don't be so stubborn.

621
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Why is the wine sour?

622
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
After you made me a drink,

623
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
I was so happy.

624
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
I didn't dare to do it.

625
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
I wanted to be a great master.

626
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,200
So I started to develop my new style.

627
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,200
But sometimes,

628
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,200
it's a good thing to be a good drinker.

629
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
At least,

630
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,200
I can be a legend in the world.

631
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
What about you, Ling'er?

632
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,200
I want to make a play.

633
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
The play...

634
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,200
tastes good.

635
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
I said the same thing.

636
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
You have a good idea.

637
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
After I was convinced,

638
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,200
I thought Ling'er was a good man.

639
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
You never thought that

640
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,200
I was a good man because of Ling'er.

641
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
I thought you were a good man.

642
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
I thought you were a good man.

643
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
I thought you were a good man.

644
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
You're so weak.

645
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
Let's go.

646
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,200
It's okay.

647
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Let's go.

648
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Be careful.

649
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
He came here

650
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
to comfort you.

651
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Maybe he just became the master of the house.

652
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
He has a son.

653
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
Maybe...

654
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
he's really different.

655
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
You're the king's son?

656
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,200
Okay.

657
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,200
But don't forget.

658
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
I'm just a woman.

659
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
I can't be compared to the crown prince.

660
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
I'm just a woman.

661
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
This is the foundation of the two courtesies.

662
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Even if he gets a big amount of gold,

663
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
can the whole court's cultural relics be disliked?

664
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
He knows it.

665
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
He might not be able to move the whole court's cultural relics.

666
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
He might not be able to move the whole court's cultural relics.

667
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
You might say he might not be able to move the whole court's cultural relics.

668
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
That's what if he does.

669
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,200
You have to risk your life with your little words.

670
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,200
Just for your little bit of conscience?

671
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
Of course not.

672
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
I'll catch him.

673
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,700
No need.

674
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
Cousin,

675
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,200
we're in a hurry,

676
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
until the evening,

677
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,200
whose storages are always atällant

678
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,200
and favored by the emperor.

679
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
It's really hard for us.

680
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Prince.

681
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Prince. Prince.

682
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,200
Prince.

683
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,200
I remember Fenglun Palace is the palace of the former Empress.

684
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Now you are living in the Moon Forest.

685
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Are you feeling sad or upset?

686
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,200
Prince, forgive me.

687
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
I have done everything you asked me to do.

688
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
But the fire is still on.

689
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
I tried to make it out of the fire.

690
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
But I couldn't.

691
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
He just didn't do anything.

692
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,200
Then you should think about it.

693
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Prince.

694
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
Prince.

695
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Prince.

696
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
What is the Empress Dowager doing?

697
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,200
I'm going to see her.

698
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
Gu Jia.

699
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
Chase after them.

700
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Prince.

701
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Yuezhi.

702
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
You'd better give me an explanation.

703
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Prince.

704
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Prince.
