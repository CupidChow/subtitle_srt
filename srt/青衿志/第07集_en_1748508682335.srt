Episode 1

3
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Your Majesty, Yue Fei has left.

4
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,200
He has left.

5
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,000
Where is Ling'er?

6
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,600
Yue Fei has left.

7
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,200
He has left to guard Yue's mansion.

8
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,400
Yue has to be escaped.

9
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:33,800
By the way,

10
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,600
Yue Fei found this in the mansion.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,200
If you want to stay in the capital for long,

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,600
you can help the outside world.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You can take the new life as an opportunity.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,800
Now, people are not far away.

15
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,000
Right?

16
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,400
Let him go.

17
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,000
He has left. He can't find us.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
Let him go.

19
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,200
Yue Fei,

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,800
Yue Fei,

21
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,200
even if I am the only one,

22
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,200
I can protect the world.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
You only want to live in peace.

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,600
I will be English.

25
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,800
No matter where you are,

26
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
I will be in peace.

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,600
Yue Fei,

28
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,580
Chen Shuai,

29
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,200
you've decided to run away.

30
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
Why did you get the royal tally?

31
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,400
You have

32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,900
an underwear from aille de taped in your pocket.

33
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,000
It's not your business.

34
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,400
You have your words.

35
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,600
You will get no luxury here.

36
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,200
Chen Shuai,

37
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,600
we're leaving.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,600
Let's go.

39
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,520
thank you

40
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,060

41
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,820
I really want it?

42
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,560

a happy past

46
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,720
You too.

47
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,220
Let's find the key of the ring.

48
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,160
Ok.

49
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,480
Stand still.

50
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,220
Alright.

51
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,780
Move aside.

52
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,320

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,300

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,540
Lord motto is,

57
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,880

59
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,880
Majesty

60
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,280
Long time no see

61
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,460
D snatch enemity

62
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,460
This is the прав to be초

63
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
I will take over the whole of the country.

64
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
I have nowhere to go.

65
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
Let go of Lord Wei.

66
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,160
I am just kidding.

67
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,160
His Majesty won't mind, right?

68
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,160
I will take over the whole of the country.

69
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,160
I don't mind.

70
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
I don't mind.

71
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,160
Lord Man has entered the imperial city.

72
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,160
The sword of the imperial army

73
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
only protects the king.

74
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,160
He doesn't recognize the king.

75
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,160
Wei Zhang.

76
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,160
I have to do this.

77
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,160
The crown prince of the imperial army

78
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,160
came to the imperial city to study.

79
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,160
I came to help His Majesty to take a look.

80
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,160
Let's see who is the one who has been blinded by His Majesty.

81
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,160
He made such a stupid law.

82
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,160
It seems that this person

83
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,160
wants His Majesty and Lord Fan to be at ease.

84
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,160
He should be killed.

85
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,160
This is my first time.

86
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Lord Man, you are meaningful.

87
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
Chen Youhua.

88
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Lord Man is a treasure.

89
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
He doesn't need to enter the imperial city.

90
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
He doesn't need to lose his country.

91
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
His Majesty is in charge.

92
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Lord Wei, you are so powerful.

93
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
You have taken advantage of me.

94
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
You have taken advantage of me.

95
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,160
You have taken advantage of me.

96
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,160
Now you still want to punish me.

97
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
The emperor is a criminal.

98
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,160
He is guilty of the public.

99
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
This is a must.

100
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,160
What do you think?

101
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
What?

102
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,160
It's him.

103
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
Yuechi.

104
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Yuechi is dead, isn't he?

105
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,160
He is human and a ghost.

106
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,160
How could he appear here?

107
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,160
The name of the grass is Yuechi.

108
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
Greetings, Your Majesty.

109
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
Why is my brother not here yet?

110
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Why?

111
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,160
Qing'er, my brother is here.

112
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Du Tianzhao.

113
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Du Tianzhao, why are you here? Where is my brother?

114
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Don't worry about your brother.

115
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
Can you leave?

116
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Why do I stay here?

117
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
You can't leave.

118
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
Who are you?

119
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,160
You can leave if you don't want to.

120
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
I...

121
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Let go of me.

122
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
I am sorry.

123
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
Can you leave?

124
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
I want to leave.

125
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
You can't leave.

126
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
I want to leave.

127
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
You can't leave.

128
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
I want to leave.

129
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
I don't allow you to leave.

130
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
I want to leave.

131
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
Yuechi.

132
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
The bamboo shoot is for you.

133
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
Yuechi.

134
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Yuechi.

135
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Leshi.

136
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,160
Qing'er,

137
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
I have an engagement.

138
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,260
I should have made Du Tianzhao busy

139
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,160
for a lifetime.

140
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,160
But theson could also be Toni mustn't be alone.

141
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,160
I only went to the front to die.

142
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
I'm the special one, the last woman.

143
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,160
I can't let you and me live together.

144
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,160
I can only temporarily give up on you.

146
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,160
If I can leave the city one day, I will definitely find you.

147
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
I will not let you go.

148
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,160
I will go to the exit.

149
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Later, I will drink with you.

150
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:30,160
When the rain stops, I will stay with you.

151
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:38,160
In this world, the most famous color is the color of your eyes.

152
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:45,160
How naive, I don't want you to turn around.

153
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Just remember, in this world, memories matter.

154
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Let Mr. أن Fried, Mr. Impossible, Mr. Storm face it!

155
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,480
the dynasty goes our way.

156

Save that man from the first court

166
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,360
to help me rebel against the court.

167
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,780
I will kill him next time.

168
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,160
Don't disturb the state affairs.

169
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,560
Go to a court hall

170
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,160
and get killed right now.

171
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,120
Be self-reliant and study better.

are really dangerous

175
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,300
I'm afraid that he will regret

176
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,440
being rough to me

177
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,640
How?

178
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,760

179
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,680

in game

187
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,840

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,840
Thus, on entering the seven worlds

195
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,800
your positions will be

196
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,360
the situation for yo臣

197
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,400
Likewise, you guys have

198
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,800
again

199
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,280
On entering the seven worlds

200
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,840
theresh

201
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,520
What's the matter?

202
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,160
Thank, thanks.

203
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,480
Come on.

204
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,880
No, don't go.

205
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,800
Come on.

206
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,800
Be careful, don't disturb him.

207
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,960
Stop him, be careful.

208
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,400
Yes.

209
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,440
Let me handle these.

210
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,720
Not you

211
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,080
You und Ori Mc

212
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
You unduplied

213
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,000
You sure?

214
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,020
Yeah

215
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,080
That's the ship

216
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,200
It's Sage

217
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,600
It's Ranked

218
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:53,820
Sock

219
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,200
Because it's調omo

220
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,000
Okay.

221
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
From now on, they will know

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,600
that the moon is about to set.

223
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,200
Your Majesty means...

224
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,600
The Snake Town is at its peak.

225
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,600
Long live the Emperor!

226
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,200
May the Emperor be well.

227
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,800
Thank you, Your Majesty!

228
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,400
Eunuch Gui, please announce the decree.

229
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,600
Your Majesty, please think twice.

230
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,400
We are willing to ask Your Majesty to take back the decree.

231
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
The Moon is the first traitor of the court.

232
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,800
How can we take the responsibility of our great name?

233
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,200
Please stand up and speak.

234
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,800
If Your Majesty doesn't take back the decree,

235
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,000
I will be very sorry.

236
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Your Majesty, please take back the decree.

237
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,200
The Snake Town is at its peak.

238
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
From now on,

239
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,200
everyone, please don't kneel down.

240
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,600
Let's not talk about it.

241
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,400
Why can't I recognize the Prime Minister of Yue Chi?

242
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,400
The Central Military Commandery is not the second tribe.

243
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,000
You, Yue Chi, don't visit the Prime Minister of Yue Chi.

244
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You came to the court for a few years.

245
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,200
You don't know how to recognize him.

246
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,600
The four-finger hero doesn't ask about the origin.

247
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,400
The red fox is the only one.

248
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,000
The smoke is the only one.

249
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,600
The Ou Yang is the first one to rise.

250
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,600
You are as good as a woman.

251
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,200
Is it the military?

252
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,400
What are you saying? Who is the woman?

253
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,800
Your Majesty,

254
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,400
the common people are so ugly.

255
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,600
They are so ugly.

256
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,000
The former court is still in the front.

257
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The right side is the Prime Minister.

258
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,600
The former court is the most important.

259
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,400
But the former one is the most important.

260
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,800
The former court is the most important.

261
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,600
You have proof, Prime Minister.

262
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
You don't have proof.

263
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,400
The official is asking for the truth.

264
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,200
If you are so arrogant as the Prime Minister,

265
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,600
you are going to be in danger.

266
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
The former court failed.

267
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,600
The cause is a disaster.

268
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,200
The law of the court is not fair.

269
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,800
You challenge the others.

270
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,200
You can push the other people to disobey.

271
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,200
The quality of this world is so degrading.

272
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,800
You are just reason for you to obey the rule.

273
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
The Austrian had said

274
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,720
if you choose to ideals, you have the right.

275
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,200
Absolutely happiness.

276
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,600
Prime Minister, do you think

277
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,880
Who is the official?

278
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,440
Your Majesty, you are the emperor and the people of the world.

279
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,360
Meng Zi You Yun, the noble and the designator of the nation.

280
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,720
You are noble and kind.

281
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,280
But the people of the world are the root of the nation.

282
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,080
In the past, I was the people of the world.

283
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,320
Now the people are still the people.

284
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,480
I am still the people.

285
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,280
The people of the world are not the people.

286
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,880
You, you.

287
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,320
Good.

288
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,960
What a loyal person.

289
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,000
I hope that the people of the world

290
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,120
will be like the moon.

291
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,240
Be loyal to the people.

292
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,520
Do some good deeds.

293
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,840
The people of the world are not against it.

294
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,080
Think of a way to poison their mouths.

295
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,960
Stop talking.

296
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,120
Stop talking.

297
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
Stop talking.

298
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,640
I really don't understand these people.

299
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,840
Don't bother me.

300
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,840
I have another way.

301
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,680
I have.

302
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,440
I think out of passion.

303
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,560
I am in the same dream today.

304
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,360
Then, why...

305
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,360
I'm not YOU

306
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,600
were I just?

307
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,360
Are you okay?

308
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,040
Are you okay?

309
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,160
Sir

310
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,920
Funny

311
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,240
Sorry

312
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:58,840
Sorry

313
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,160
You don't believe me.

314
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,640
What do you want from me?

315
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,960
Speaking of which,

316
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,400
I'm still close to you.

317
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,320
Your father's three sisters' son

318
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,040
is like my brother.

319
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,880
When we met last time,

320
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,960
I remember

321
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,960
his four-sister's words.

322
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,600
I'm tired.

323
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,720
Your wife is in the flower shop.

324
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,720
I know what she's doing.

325
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
You're gonna say what to do?

326
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
Why you don't pay me?

327
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,720
Any heart.

328
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,560
How can we hurt ourselves

329
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,920
during the着急 deal with Rimelan?

330
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,760
What an Chocolateouter!

331
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,920
Jealous of myself.

332
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,280
Come on.

333
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,360
I'm scared.

334
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,120
Give up, okay.

335
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,320
It can't be...

336
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,400
You're gonna be so proud of yourself?

337
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,600
I'll 200% be Pour in food grab.

338
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,840
The End

339
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,840
Is there anything you want to do?

340
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,840
Just leave without me

341
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Your Majesty

342
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,840
I have something to do

343
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
What do you want to say?

344
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,840
Last night, I was not able to sleep

345
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
I was thinking for a long time

346
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,840
I decided to be the right-hand man of the Yue family

347
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,840
and then I will serve you

348
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
It's okay to serve you

349
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
It's good to help

350
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
What about others?

351
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Do you have any objections to Lord Ouyang?

352
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,840
Please, Your Majesty

353
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,840
Okay, I agree with your opinion

354
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,840
I am very pleased

355
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,840
Of course, Lord Wei is a servant

356
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
I have a memorial

357
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,840
I will give it to you

358
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,840
I am a good man

359
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,840
But I am not a good man

360
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,840
Please, Lord Yue

361
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,840
If you are a good man

362
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,840
You must not use the military code of the Qi Ling army

363
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,840
Otherwise, you will be a traitor

364
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,840
The Yue family will never enter the world

365
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,840
Otherwise, you will be a mess

366
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
If you don't agree with me

367
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,840
I will die

368
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
I will not let him go to the throne

369
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,840
What?

370
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,840
Are you going to make the blood sword?

371
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Yes, Lord Wei

372
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,840
I will give Lord Wei a nice memorial

373
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,840
Let him walk more carefully when he is in the country

374
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,840
Yes, Your Majesty

375
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,840
Lord Ouyang

376
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,840
Please, Your Majesty

377
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Please, Your Majesty

378
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Please, Your Majesty

379
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,840
Life is good and good

380
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,840
Lord Wei, you are right

381
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,840
Thank you, Your Majesty

382
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,840
Good day, Lord Ouyang

383
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,840
Lord Wei, you are right

384
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,840
Now, can you teach your doctor again?

385
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Left side, left side, right side

386
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
What?

387
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,840
You can't use the Qi Ling army

388
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
The Yue family can't be a traitor

389
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,840
Why don't they say it?

390
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
They can't live in the country

391
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,840
They didn't say it

392
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
But they think it like this

393
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,840
You are already in the right place

394
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,840
I have always been in the right place

395
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
Not already

396
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,840
No, I want to help you

397
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
You help me?

398
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,840
You can't even look at the clouds

399
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,840
You are so embarrassed

400
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
You must be angry with your sister

401
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,840
Besides

402
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
It's a good thing

403
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
You are in trouble now

404
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,840
I must help you

405
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Okay

406
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
Then tell me

407
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
What do you want to do?

408
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,840
I want to enter the palace

409
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
What did you say?

410
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,840
I said I want to enter the palace to help you

411
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
No

412
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
Why not?

413
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
The situation in the court

414
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,840
Has changed completely with my defeat

415
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,840
The Cao Meng is also in the imperial city

416
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,840
You can't go into the palace

417
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,840
Brother, I am also a family

418
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,840
The way of the Yue family is never the way of the Yue family

419
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,840
And I can't hide behind you for the rest of my life

420
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,840
To seek your protection

421
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,840
I have to do something for you

422
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Ling'er

423
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
This is not a play

424
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,840
I didn't play

425
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
Think about it yourself

426
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,840
Can you do it the same as Yue Xiang and Yue Fei?

427
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,840
Maybe you can hide for a while

428
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,840
What about the time?

429
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Can you keep hiding from the people?

430
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,840
Brother, I must enter the palace

431
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Your Highness

432
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,840
We are not suitable for you

433
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,840
I really don't know what to do

434
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
I see

435
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,840
I really can only stay here

436
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
Can't I go anywhere else?

437
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Your Highness

438
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
You are pregnant now

439
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
This is the time to be nervous

440
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
Besides

441
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,840
You are the head of the dragon

442
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
Do you know how many eyes are looking at you?

443
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
But you can't go out

444
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840
It's like real

445
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,840
What real?

446
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
Ling'er

447
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
Hu Jinheng

448
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Nonsense

449
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,840
Who told you to enter the palace?

450
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840
There must be a belly at the door

451
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,840
Does Yue Chi know?

452
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
He knows

453
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
I will be Yue Fei if there is no accident

454
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
What do you mean?

455
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
Yue Chi is alone

456
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
He can't be separated

457
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Can't be together with the court and the harem

458
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,840
Why do you think so?

459
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,840
The harem is not less dangerous than the court

460
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,840
This is my idea

461
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Your idea?

462
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,840
I, Yue Ling'er, even if I go to the battlefield

463
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,840
I am a hero

464
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,840
I can't help but to take care of the harem

465
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,840
Don't worry

466
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,840
No problem

467
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,840
Really? So powerful?

468
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
Of course

469
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
But

470
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
I can only stay here

471
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,840
I can't go anywhere else

472
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
You can't

473
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,840
You are the main protector of the harem now

474
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
Fine

475
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
But I can buy back the painting of the harem

476
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,840
from the palace

477
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
That's fine

478
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,840
You can take the person who wrote the painting

479
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
and give it to you

480
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,840
How is it?

481
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,840
It's okay

482
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,840
You can accept it

483
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,840
Your Majesty

484
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
It's late

485
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
Let's take a rest

486
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,840
Yue Fei and that woman

487
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,840
must be in a bad mood

488
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,840
Eunuch Wang

489
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,840
How can you let someone show off his foot?

490
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,840
It's so weak

491
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,840
I must be the one who can show off his foot

492
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
It's so weak

493
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,840
Your Majesty

494
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
Your Majesty

495
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,840
You have been telling me

496
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
that I am not feeling well recently

497
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,840
that you let Yue Fei to take care of the harem

498
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
I see

499
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,840
I'll serve you

500
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
and go to bed

501
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
What?

502
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,840
You are here to serve me?

503
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Yes

504
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840
Eunuch Wang passed away

505
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,840
and the harem is under Yue Fei's control

506
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
Okay

507
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,840
Huang Si

508
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,840
Sheng Chong

509
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,840
is like a ghost

510
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,840
Don't be angry

511
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Yue Fei is not the one who can take care of the harem

512
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
It's your fault

513
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
No

514
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
It's your fault

515
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
I will take care of it

516
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,840
No

517
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
Let's go to see how the harem is doing

518
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,840
I want to see how he is going to save the three fireflies

519
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,840
You are so stupid

520
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
Let's go

521
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Yue

522
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
Let's go to His Majesty

523
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
and let him take the imperial edict

524
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
I am not a servant in the harem

525
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840
Wait

526
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,840
Don't you know that the Empress Dowager is pregnant?

527
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Even if she doesn't know

528
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,840
she will give you the imperial edict

529
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,840
It means she is determined

530
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
What should we do?

531
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,840
I will take the imperial edict

532
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,840
No

533
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,840
By the way

534
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,840
I will find my brother

535
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
He will come

536
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
Let's go

537
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
Your Highness

538
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,840
Yue Fei

539
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Here comes the imperial edict

540
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,840
You can leave

541
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,840
Yes

542
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,840
Your Highness

543
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,840
Where is Yue Fei?

544
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
Your Highness

545
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,840
What?

546
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,840
You are Yue Fei?

547
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,840
I dare not

548
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,840
It's just that Yue Fei is pregnant

549
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
and has a baby

550
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,840
She is pregnant

551
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
Please go back, Your Highness

552
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
After all, the child is a big boy

553
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,840
The child is just a child

554
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
It's just that I am the child

555
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
What?

556
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
I will take care of her

557
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,840
Your Highness, you are joking

558
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,840
It's really not helping

559
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,840
You can hide from the first place

560
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,840
But you can't hide from the 15th place

561
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
I have the time

562
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840
You are so great

563
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
My goodness

564
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,840
People will scare people to death

565
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
You heard it

566
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
You can hide from the first place

567
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
but you can't hide from the 15th place

568
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,840
You are in the middle of the market

569
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,840
You will meet people again in the morning

570
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,840
But when I show up

571
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,840
I will...

572
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
This is the traffic police office in Liaocheng

573
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
It is said that the previous officials

574
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
bullied the people

575
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
and refused to let the broken temple

576
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,840
return the land to the sweet

577
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,840
At least it can be a positive thing

578
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,840
To this

579
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,840
the eldest of the royal family

580
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
the mother of the royal family

581
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
reported the flower garden dancing and fake death

582
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
and stole the sell-out device

583
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
She wanted to help the maids

584
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,840
investigate the flower garden

585
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,840
and this one

586
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,840
A group of 13-14-year-old boys

587
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,840
are on the road to build a green-tongued jewelry store

588
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
These are all

589
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
Do you want to see

590
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,840
what I am doing every day?

591
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,840
Give it to me

592
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Give it to me

593
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
I have already eaten one

594
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
It is so cheap

595
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
I need to speed up

596
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,840
Your Highness, don't worry

597
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Have a grape

598
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
It is sweet

599
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
It's sweet

600
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
Congratulations to you

601
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,840
Today the emperor

602
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
wants you to try it

603
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
Please take it

604
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
Go with us

605
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
What?

606
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Your Majesty

607
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,840
Yuefei is here

608
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
You should all go

609
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
Let's go.

610
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
Your Majesty.

611
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,840
What did you ask me to do?

612
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,840
Why are you standing so far away from me?

613
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,840
Come here and talk.

614
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,840
No need.

615
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
I'm standing here and I can hear clearly.

616
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Didn't you ask Xiao Yue to tell me that something happened?

617
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840
You also asked me to beg Mother.

618
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,840
You mean this?

619
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,840
I...

620
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,840
Your Majesty asked me to do the six palaces.

621
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,840
I know that.

622
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,840
You can sit down first.

623
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,840
But I don't know what to do.

624
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,840
You can see it first.

625
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,840
This palace is like a ship that floats around.

626
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,840
It's a boat full of wooden boards and a top-of-the-top street.

627
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,840
Every part has its own rules and rules.

628
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
It's very smart.

629
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,840
You don't need to do anything on purpose or break anything.

630
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,840
You just need to see it.

631
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,840
What else do you need to do when you see this ship?

632
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Just see it?

633
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
Just see it.

634
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,840
But remember,

635
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,840
you are watching everything.

636
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,840
Someone is watching you behind you.

637
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
Your Majesty.

638
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
Let's eat first.

639
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,840
Eating is bigger than the sky.

640
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,840
His Majesty has been coming to Yue Fei for seven days.

641
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
He came to my palace often.

642
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,840
I can't even see his shadow.

643
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,840
His Majesty is cold to anyone.

644
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
Since he came to the palace,

645
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
he has changed a lot.

646
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,840
It's a matter of time.

647
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
Yue Fei is a good man.

648
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,840
He is pregnant and still alone.

649
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,840
How can we talk to him?

650
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,840
I think he can't be happy for a few days.

651
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,840
Sisters, I'm confused.

652
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,840
Take the money.

653
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,840
Why are you confused again?

654
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,840
I'll pay you this afternoon.

655
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,840
It's too good to be a good man.

656
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,840
Look.

657
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,840
I can't play with you anymore.

658
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
One more round.

659
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,840
I've been playing with you for half a month.

660
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,840
I'm not playing with you anymore.

661
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,840
That's right.

662
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Let's go.

663
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,840
Your Majesty,

664
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,840
what are you going to do?

665
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
I'll listen to the doctor.

666
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,840
You're so insensitive.

667
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,840
It's not a good thing to be insensitive.

668
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,840
Your Majesty and I are so friendly.

669
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
You know Fan Dazi.

670
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,840
He is a kind person.

671
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,840
He has so many bad people every day.

672
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,840
I don't have a plan to stay in the palace.

673
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,840
What if the emperor loves you?

674
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,840
He always asks you to eat.

675
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,840
He is the biggest dependence.

676
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
When he gets used to it,

677
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,840
will you stay in the palace for the rest of your life?

678
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
How can you be so fast?

679
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,840
You don't understand.

680
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840
Men know men best.

681
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,840
If he asks you every day,

682
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,840
he will be angry at you every day.

683
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
Fine.

684
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
What do you think you should do?

685
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,840
I think

686
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,840
he should let him know about other bad things.

687
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,840
He is the emperor.

688
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,840
It's his duty to do that.

689
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,840
It's his duty.

690
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,840
What do you think?

691
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,840
I don't know.

692
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,840
It's his duty.

693
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,840
What do you think?

694
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,840
I don't know.

695
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,840
I think

696
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,840
he should let his family know.

697
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Yes.

698
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,840
My father is very proud of me.

699
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,840
He is very sensitive.

700
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
I think

701
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,840
he should let him know that I'm a good person.

702
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
I think

703
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,840
he should let his family know.

704
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
I think

705
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,840
he should let his family know.

706
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,840
I'm not afraid of the world

707
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,840
I'm not afraid of the world

708
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,840
I'm not afraid of the world

709
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,840
I'm not afraid of the world

710
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,840
I'm not afraid of the world

711
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,840
I'm not afraid of the world

712
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,840
I'm not afraid of the world

713
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,840
I'm not afraid of the world

714
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,840
I'm not afraid of the world

715
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
I'm not afraid of the world

716
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,840
I'm not afraid of the world

717
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,840
I'm not afraid of the world

718
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840
I'm not afraid of the world

719
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840
I'm not afraid of the world

720
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,260
My old days are not old

721
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,320
I asked which letter did the book understand and read

722
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,440
The

723
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:22,840
首集 我 闲 力 血 Bìngan Qiú Ghost

724
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,540
with the Z fungus

725
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,040
lit with fiery !!!

726
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,360
Luo zientesha

728
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,120

00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,880
the song will co?

732
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,160
The writing cannot keep

733
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,760
The steam engine may stay

734
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,340
The old story repeat

735
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,660
The old days never existed

736
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,560
We live in the most dangerous place

737
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,680
The real problems begin

738
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,200
The unmeaning world

739
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,240
The family of each enemy

740
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,280
The 그래요

741
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,880

Will only be足夠
