1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If victory is not decided, let me fight

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The wind and moon are in the human world

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The youth is known as the old youth

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The past is the past, the past is the past

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
A sword falls behind the ten thousand years

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Spring breeze is like a leaf

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Rain has become snow

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Wen clan, daughter of Prince of Gu Bei,

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
is here to see Li.

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The imperial edict is missing.

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
When did it disappear?

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't know.

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That imperial edict is so embarrassing.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's so embarrassing.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm so sorry.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Your Majesty,

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the princess is a noble person.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's not proper to read the imperial edict with such a low status.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Then,

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll leave it to you.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I can't.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't know the words.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You need to resist the edict.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Bring the imperial edict here.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm just kidding.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Didn't Eunuch Gui

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
bring the imperial edict to you?

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Wen clan, princess,

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
is a noble person.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
She's gentle and gentle.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
She's elegant and elegant.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
She's elegant and elegant.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
She's gentle and kind.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
She's a noble person.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
She's a good wife.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
She's a good example.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
She's now

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
the title of Noble Consort.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Noble Consort?

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You're wrong.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The emperor said

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
this is called

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
external and internal beauty.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The appearance and appearance are different.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What?

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Could it be wise things

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,740
couldn't be

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
devoid from true beauty?

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Ning'er!

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,500
I thought it was the Themen's Consort.

51
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,000
Why Noble Consort again?

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Still還有那個灯 많이用了

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,740
the Camellia قUT

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Looks like your fortitude is really gretingable.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I will accept the decree.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Wait!

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Empress Dowager's decree

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
has ordered me to announce the decree.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Everyone, kneel!

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Empress Dowager's decree.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Wen clan is a man of good character and is very grateful.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
However, the North Army is in a difficult situation.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Wen clan is the daughter of the former emperor.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
If the honor is too high, the previous dynasty will be in trouble.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The imperial guards will be sent to settle the court.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Congratulations, Consort Wen.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Please accept the decree.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Consort Wen, the hairpin on your head is the support of the imperial concubine.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It is not appropriate.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Empress Dowager also specially ordered that

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I hope Your Majesty can remove the hairpin on your head

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and change it into a comb.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You should be more cautious in your actions.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Your Majesty, I will take my leave.

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Get up.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Your Majesty, I have been waiting for you for a long time.

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why are you sitting here?

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I am thinking about you.

81
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I was drinking just now

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and suddenly thought of something.

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Rather than the two parties drinking together,

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
it is better to be honest.

85
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It is more precious and decent.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It is better to live a good life.

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I can't understand what happened at the table.

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Your Majesty, you should rest early.

89
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This time is too early.

90
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I wonder what Your Majesty wants to do.

91
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Whatever I want to do, you will agree to it.

92
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I wonder if Your Majesty and I

93
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
will be able to live together.

94
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What I want to do is the same thing.

95
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Your Majesty and Princess are quite good at playing.

96
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Don't make a fuss. Let's get down to business.

97
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Since we are talking about business, let's sit down and talk about it.

98
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Don't think about running away.

99
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
300 secret guards are all around the Qunyu Pavilion.

100
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The former Prince of the North was well-prepared and brave.

101
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Compared to this one, I don't know how many times he has been on the wall.

102
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What are you going to say?

103
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Princess, you know the truth. I think the Prince of the North loves you very much.

104
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If he were still alive, he wouldn't have let you see it for yourself.

105
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Why would he die?

106
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Don't you know?

107
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The way you looked at me just now was very cruel.

108
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You wanted to kill me first and then be happy.

109
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I want to ask you. There are thousands of heroes in the world.

110
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
They come and go for power.

111
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If he can't be the emperor, then no one can be.

112
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Your Majesty wants me to be a concubine?

113
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Even if you can't be the future,

114
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
you shouldn't be entangled with Cao Mang.

115
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'll leave it here today.

116
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
As long as I live,

117
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
your plans will not work.

118
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Then you can die.

119
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
If he dies, then there will be me.

120
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If I can't live,

121
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
there will be thousands of heroes in the world.

122
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
When I was on the battlefield,

123
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I saw too many heroes.

124
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Now that we're in the court,

125
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
we only want the people to be safe.

126
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Whoever wants to destroy this peace,

127
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
is your enemy.

128
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Your Majesty only hopes that the world will be peaceful.

129
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
If Cao Mang is willing,

130
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
you two can go back to the northern border to live in peace.

131
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Whether we're safe or not,

132
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
is up to you.

133
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I won't break my promise.

134
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If you don't believe me,

135
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll write a letter to the God of War.

136
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What do you think?

137
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You have a way to contact Cao Mang, right?

138
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
No.

139
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If you want to protect him,

140
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
then you have to do it.

141
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
If you don't believe me,

142
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
then you can go back to the northern border to live in peace.

143
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If you can't,

144
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
then you can't.

145
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I want to go back to the northern border.

146
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You can go back to the north border.

147
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:26,700
O

148
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,020
Work hard to ensure good working 고양 가족

149
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:43,600
ふ嘛來

150
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,440
I think I'll do that

151
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,140
Is that what you mean?

152
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,400
Look at her

153
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,080
She is not just a cordsy

154
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,240
They are little canines

155
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,360
They can get as far as hair

156
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,380
My Radon doesn't do that

157
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,140
Let's take a look over there

158
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,980
You came to Shanghai

159
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,500
Perhaps committed suicide

160
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,820
What's going on

161
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,380
This is not right.

162
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,380
This will put her in danger.

163
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,380
You still have time to worry about her.

164
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,380
Think about yourself first.

165
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,380
Mr. Yi.

166
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,380
Is there a way to save her?

167
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,380
You and Cao Mang are not friends.

168
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,380
You are not friends.

169
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,380
You and Cao Mang will be fine.

170
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,380
Can you make me believe you?

171
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,380
Other than trust, you have no other choice.

172
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,380
I don't know why, but I always feel that it's not right.

173
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,380
Gentle and kind,

174
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,380
we are going to meet outside the imperial city.

175
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,380
Cao Mang has changed to a faraway western bridge from the imperial city.

176
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,380
No matter what,

177
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,380
this trip must go.

178
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,380
Only going, there is a sense of unity.

179
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,380
If you don't go,

180
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,380
there will only be war and sacrifice.

181
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,380
Be careful.

182
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,380
I have arranged it properly.

183
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,380
If there is an accident, the Qi Lin army will come out to receive you.

184
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,380
Protect you completely.

185
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,380
It is indeed you who forced her to write.

186
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,380
Let her go.

187
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,380
She is my consort.

188
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,380
I told you to let her go.

189
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,380
Your Highness's actions are so unambiguous.

190
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,380
Be careful of being used by others.

191
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,380
We came here this time to

192
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,380
make peace with you.

193
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,380
To be your dream.

194
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,380
What does this mean?

195
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,380
This place is all my land.

196
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,380
Want to make peace?

197
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,380
I'm asking if your heads are still there.

198
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,380
Your Highness,

199
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,380
you can't kill me.

200
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,380
You should surrender.

201
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,380
I killed you first.

202
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,380
You are already the flesh on the board.

203
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,380
You still talk like a child.

204
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,380
Who is the knife,

205
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,380
who is the fish,

206
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,380
I'm afraid you don't know yet.

207
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,380
Bring them all in.

208
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,380
Go.

209
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,380
Hurry up and go.

210
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,380
Behave yourself.

211
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,380
Your Majesty,

212
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,380
all the people who are in ambush have been captured.

213
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,380
I admit.

214
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,380
Your Highness, do you admit to your fate

215
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,380
or admit defeat?

216
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,380
Defeat?

217
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,380
I admit to everything.

218
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,380
I just want you to let Wen Rou go.

219
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,380
If you want to kill me, you have to fight.

220
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,380
Come at me.

221
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,380
I don't want to

222
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,380
break up my friendship.

223
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,380
This is the order of the tiger and the king.

224
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,380
As long as you let Wen Rou go, I can give it to you.

225
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,380
What are you doing?

226
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,380
I want to kill my father.

227
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,380
I want to drag him along even if I die.

228
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,380
I have never harmed anyone in the Wen family.

229
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,380
The princess hates you so much.

230
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,380
It must be the prince's provocation.

231
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,380
Please tell me

232
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,380
the reasons.

233
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,380
No.

234
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,380
It's not him.

235
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,380
Two years ago,

236
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,380
the old king

237
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,380
tried to take the throne

238
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,380
to stop the army

239
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,380
with a giant stone.

240
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,380
Your Majesty, the mountain is broken. The giant stone is blocking the way.

241
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,380
I was trapped by him.

242
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,380
Turn around.

243
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,380
There is no way back.

244
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,380
Only death.

245
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,380
Kill.

246
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,380
The old king took a step forward.

247
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,380
He reached the capital.

248
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,380
The throne was in his pocket.

249
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,380
But the previous dynasty was already under attack.

250
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,380
The last barrier

251
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,380
of the city was still there.

252
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,380
After the battle,

253
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,380
the old king had

254
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,380
30,000 soldiers.

255
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,380
He was defeated by

256
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,380
the enemy

257
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,380
several times.

258
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,380
The war report came from the front line.

259
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,380
You know that your father died a tragic death.

260
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,380
He is still in his memory.

261
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,380
I was afraid

262
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,380
I wanted to go with the old king

263
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,380
at that time.

264
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,380
I was afraid that I would die alone.

265
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,380
But I didn't want to.

266
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,380
I wanted you to live.

267
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,380
I wanted to live with you.

268
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,380
The military rumor

269
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,380
was that

270
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,380
Huo Jing Heng killed the old king.

271
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,380
I thought that

272
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,380
if you think so,

273
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,380
you will have a thought.

274
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,380
A thought of

275
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,380
living and revenge.

276
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,380
So,

277
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,380
you were so stupid

278
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,380
and unstoppable.

279
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,380
Even if I asked for your help,

280
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,380
you never responded.

281
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,380
All these years,

282
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,380
all these thoughts,

283
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,380
all these hatreds

284
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,380
became a joke.

285
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,380
Zhuo. No.

286
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,380
I am not a fool.

287
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,380
No.

288
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,380
What are you doing?

289
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,380
His Majesty never

290
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,380
took your life.

291
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,380
His Majesty means

292
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,380
I live and die.

293
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,380
You still care about me.

294
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,380
If you die like this,

295
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,380
I will feel so bad for you.

296
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,380
I have no parents.

297
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,380
Even hatred is a joke.

298
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,380
What else can I care about?

299
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,380
I am so worried.

300
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,380
His Majesty tried so hard.

301
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,380
Now he is dead.

302
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,380
He just wants you to live.

303
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,380
Even if he is so stupid,

304
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,380
he can guess it.

305
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,380
You always

306
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,380
take advantage of him.

307
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,380
But he still cares about you.

308
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,380
He is afraid of your life.

309
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,380
Why did you do that?

310
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,380
Zhuo.

311
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,380
I miss you.

312
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,380
I am willing to die for you.

313
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,380
No.

314
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,380
No.

315
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,380
You still don't know what to do.

316
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,380
Your lover's life

317
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,380
is at stake now.

318
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,380
What do you want?

319
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,380
Stop it.

320
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,380
Wenrou.

321
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,380
You didn't agree with me

322
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,380
when you were with me.

323
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,380
But I am the emperor of a country.

324
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,380
I will do what I want.

325
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,380
If you sign

326
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,380
the will of the Yihe,

327
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,380
no one will die.

328
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,380
Two tigers fight against each other.

329
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,380
The big one will be injured and the small one will die.

330
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,380
If someone is injured

331
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,380
and killed, it's a game of double.

332
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,380
Think about it.

333
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,380
Did anyone do the mountaineering and mountaineering?

334
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,380
If Beijing and Daning

335
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,380
fall into other people's hands,

336
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,380
what will happen?

337
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,380
War is everywhere.

338
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,380
The world is in chaos.

339
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,380
Even if you take the US,

340
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,380
how can you

341
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,380
rest in the palace of the people?

342
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,380
You can't sit on the high platform.

343
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,380
In a word,

344
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,380
even if the people's lives are like ants,

345
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,380
when Daning disappears,

346
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,380
can you sit on the high platform?

347
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,380
Sign it.

348
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,380
We sign it.

349
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,380
Okay.

350
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,380
Then please bring the princess

351
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,380
to join the army with me.

352
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,380
Prepare the royal seal

353
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,380
and sign the will of the Yihe.

354
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,380
Then we will leave early to return to the land.

355
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,380
You just let us go so easily?

356
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,380
Of course it's not that easy.

357
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,380
It's rude to walk along the river

358
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,380
and go east.

359
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,380
I don't want to see you die.

360
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,380
There is a carriage

361
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,380
for you to prepare

362
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,380
as you walk east along the river.

363
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,380
The army is without a way,

364
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,380
the people are restless.

365
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,380
We both need to be alert.

366
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,380
The army is not far away.

367
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,380
We can't go far.

368
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,380
We can't go far.

369
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,380
We can't go far.

370
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,380
We can't go far.

371
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,380
We can't go far.

372
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,380
We can't go far.

373
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,380
We can't go far.

374
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,380
We can't go far.

375
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,380
We can't go far.

376
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,380
We can't go far.

377
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,380
We can't go far.

378
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,380
We can't go far.

379
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,380
We can't go far.

380
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,820
Two ways

381
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,820
will surely work.

382
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,820
See if the prince AND the princess can do reckoning.

383
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,820
We may talk if they are interested.

384
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,820
I trust your words.

385
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,860
Good.

386
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,860
You can trust me now.

387
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,700
Dici, Dici

388
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,780
Hurry

389
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:17,900
Go

390
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,860
You're not going to die.

391
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,860
You're going to die.

392
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,860
Go.

393
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,860
Go.

394
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,860
Go.

395
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,860
Go.

396
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,860
Go.

397
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,860
Go.

398
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,860
Go.

399
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,860
Go.

400
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,860
Go.

401
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,860
Go.

402
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,860
Go.

403
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,860
Go.

404
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,860
Go.

405
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,860
Go.

406
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,860
No.

407
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,860
Let's go together.

408
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,860
Go.

409
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,860
Go.

410
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,860
Princess.

411
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,860
Please save him.

412
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,860
Go.

413
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,860
Go.

414
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,860
I beg you.

415
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,860
I want you to live.

416
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,860
Live well.

417
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,860
Princess.

418
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,860
I wish you a safe journey.

419
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,860
You can't die

420
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,860
if you die.

421
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,860
Princess.

422
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,860
Since I was born,

423
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,860
everything has been smooth.

424
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,860
I've been blessed.

425
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,860
Everyone is as beautiful as me.

426
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,860
I've been ruined.

427
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,860
I've seen the world

428
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,860
and I'm full of hatred.

429
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,860
I've been full of wishes.

430
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,860
It's him.

431
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,860
He broke the danger of life and death.

432
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,860
He held my hand again at the cost of his life.

433
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,860
No.

434
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,860
No.

435
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,860
He was obsessed with me,

436
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,860
chased me, and fooled me.

437
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,860
Go.

438
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,860
But I'm not him.

439
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,860
I'm not him.

440
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,860
I'm not him.

441
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,860
I'm not him.

442
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,860
I'm not him.

443
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,860
Do you want to

444
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,860
help me?

445
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,860
Wei Ying.

446
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,860
Yuan'an.

447
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,860
You've lost weight.

448
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,860
Are you okay?

449
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,860
Are you hurt?

450
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,860
Shuang Jin.

451
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,860
He's going to die.

452
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,860
I don't know how to repay

453
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,860
this heart.

454
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,860
Maybe

455
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,860
revenge with life

456
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,860
is the best way.

457
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,860
I can stay with you

458
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,860
as long as I want.

459
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,860
In this world,

460
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,860
the most famous

461
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,860
colors

462
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,860
are your eyes.

463
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,860
How naive

464
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,860
I am.

465
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,860
I miss you in my heart.

466
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,860
Even if I die for you, I'm willing to.

467
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,860
No.

468
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,860
No.

469
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,860
He was so stupid,

470
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,860
he said

471
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,860
he would medicine me.

472
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,860
I'm not a fool.

473
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,860
I don't know

474
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,860
what he wanted.

475
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,860
But

476
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,860
he is aware of

477
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,860
the attainment of

478
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,860
Zhu душ.

479
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,860
He said

480
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,860
those Practitioning removed

481
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,860
Everything is after you.

482
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,940
Wu Shang

483
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,700
Brother Yue

484
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,860
Brother Yue

485
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,220
Leave now

486
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,260
leave me alone

487
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,940
Brother Yue

488
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,940
Brother Yue

489
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,500
Later in ahead, honey

490
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,500
as I've told you

491
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,860
The Crown Prince's men burned the military account of our Emperor Daning.

492
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,860
Are you trying to start a war with us?

493
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,460
I don't think I can do that.

494
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,260
The current situation is the loss of the previous dynasty's soldiers.

495
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,260
I'm afraid that the soldiers' brotherhood has been threatened.

496
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,660
Your Majesty is joking.

497
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,260
These black-fist soldiers are the elite of the protection of the country.

498
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,460
They only obey the Crown Prince and Princess.

499
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,860
Even I can't drive them away.

500
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,460
Princess, this show is about to start.

501
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,460
Kill them!

502
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,460
Kill them!

503
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,460
Kill them!

504
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,460
Kill them!

505
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,860
Kill them!

506
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,860
Kill them!

507
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,260
Stop!

508
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,860
Your Highness!

509
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,060
Let them go!

510
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,860
Aren't you afraid?

511
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,860
Your Highness!

512
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,860
Kill them!

513
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,860
Are you okay?

514
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,860
Are you okay?

515
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,860
Why? Why did you choose to live?

516
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,860
I...

517
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,860
Shoot!

518
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,860
Are you okay?

519
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,860
Let's go!

520
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,860
Let's go!

521
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,860
This is bad.

522
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,860
We've only summoned the Heavenly Army.

523
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,860
Retreat!

524
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,860
Your Highness, you'd better not move.

525
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,860
You can't escape here.

526
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,860
How are you?

527
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,860
Let me see.

528
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,860
I'm fine.

529
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,860
I haven't felt anything for a day.

530
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,860
You're still the hardest.

531
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,860
Bear with it.

532
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,860
Since you're being stabbed, I'll help you pull it out.

533
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,860
Wait.

534
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,860
Bear with it.

535
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,860
It's okay.

536
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,860
The sword is made specially.

537
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,860
The sword is not a sword.

538
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,860
It's a delicate hook.

539
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,860
Is there a good way to kill the Crown Prince?

540
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,860
Or do you just want me to take you out of the game?

541
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:23,860
The blood-stain can be used to kill the Crown Prince.

542
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,860
The blood-stain can be used.

543
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,860
There are more good things for the Crown Prince.

544
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,860
I can find the herb for Yue Xiang to use.

545
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,860
Whether you use it or not, it's up to you.

546
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,860
I just think the blood-stain can be used.

547
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,860
It's a waste to waste it here.

548
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,860
It's not that easy to use.

549
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,860
This ice-cold ghost is fine.

550
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,860
It's not poison.

551
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,860
Hurry.

552
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,860
Bear with it.

553
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,800
Don't touch it.

554
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,180
Stay away from her!

555
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,800
Please, Prince assured.

556
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,100
Calm down.

557
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,580
She is your great-grandmother.

558
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,480
A fool!

559
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,800
Please drop it!

560
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,860
Be careful

561
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,140
Yue Chi, don't move

562
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,380
Tell me where he is

563
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,380
He is here

564
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,020
Do you remember our strategy?

565
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,860
The target is moving to the second

566
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,860
The target is moving to the second

567
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,860
The target is moving to the first

568
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,860
What's going on?

569
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,860
He was bitten by a snake when he fell

570
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,860
Don't worry, the snake has run away

571
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,860
Come to help me

572
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,860
Go forward

573
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,860
What are you looking at?

574
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,860
He is a sick man

575
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,860
He should be carrying all the medicine

576
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,860
I look for

577
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,860
I look for

578
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,860
Is there anything that can cure your eyes?

579
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,860
Wow, the white bag, baby

580
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,860
This medicine is a bit too much

581
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,860
How about you give it a try?

582
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,860
Try it

583
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,860
How is he now?

584
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,860
It doesn't look good

585
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,860
It shouldn't be

586
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,860
I didn't use all my strength just now

587
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,860
Even if he is weak

588
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,860
He won't be so badly injured

589
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,860
The blood on his mouth is black

590
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,860
Could it be a poisonous snake?

591
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,860
The snake is poisonous

592
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,860
But the toxicity is not so fast

593
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,860
It will be poisonous in a moment

594
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,860
Could it be that my attack just now

595
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,860
Inspired the original toxicity in his body?

596
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,860
No wonder

597
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,860
He looked half dead before

598
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,860
He is still the same

599
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,860
Go

600
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,860
Go

601
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,860
Come on, follow me

602
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,860
Be careful

603
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,860
Go

604
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,860
Go

605
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,860
Go

606
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,860
Go
