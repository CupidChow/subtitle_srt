00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,800
Your Highness, you were hurt by the water.

3
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,600
Why didn't you say it when the imperial physician was here yesterday?

4
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,160
Let's just do it one more time.

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,200
Actually, I'm not afraid of being hurt.

6
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm just afraid that you'll be worried.

7
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,600
And I don't want to let Your Majesty and I feel

8
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,200
that I'm a person who is still injured

9
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,600
under their skin.

10
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,800
But you're injured.

11
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,920
You're seriously injured.

12
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,000
What's wrong with you?

13
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,200
How can I explain to your brother?

14
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Let me see.

15
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,600
Does it hurt?

16
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,600
Why are you here?

17
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
Yue Fei is on the stage.

18
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,000
As the emperor,

19
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
of course, I'm here to take care of you.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,200
Mother asked me to bring you a lot of loquat.

21
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,200
I don't want to take it.

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,600
I'll take it for you.

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,800
Wait a minute.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
How do you feel?

25
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,000
Much better.

26
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,200
But what do you use?

27
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,600
You're so good.

28
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,800
But I'm walking the walking stone.

29
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,800
I'm creating the gold-glazed medicine.

30
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,400
It's much better than the medicine you use.

31
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,800
It's good and fast.

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
And it won't be too late.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,800
Take it.

34
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Thank you.

35
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,400
I should help you this time.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,200
You did a good job.

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
I helped you a lot.

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Thank you.

39
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
That's good.

40
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
But don't do it again.

41
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,400
I know.

42
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,200
By the way,

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,200
you said you were walking the walking stone.

44
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,600
Your brother didn't tell you.

45
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,000
You're really a famous person.

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,600
Is it fun to walk the walking stone?

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,200
Many years ago,

48
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,400
I went to a mountain of human-like nature.

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
There was a huge water lily.

50
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,600
And a monkey that was full of mountains.

51
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,200
One of them was very wild.

52
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,000
I sent that monkey to my good friend.

53
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,000
Empress Dowager,

54
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,600
the drink is half-sweet.

55
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,200
The tea water is also half-sweet.

56
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,200
And I'm afraid that the good tea this year will be gone.

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,200
How can you add a couple of men and women?

58
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,600
Ask me.

59
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
What do you mean?

60
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,600
My brain is broken.

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,000
Can I ask you?

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,600
Empress Dowager,

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,400
if you say so,

64
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,400
before I enter the palace,

65
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,800
there is a flower in our village.

66
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,200
All the good girls are willing to marry me.

67
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,800
I have to pick it up.

68
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Really?

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,200
Then you became a eunuch.

70
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Empress Dowager,

71
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,400
what's wrong?

72
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,400
Sister.

73
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,400
Donghang is here.

74
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,800
Empress Dowager, why do you suddenly think of me?

75
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,400
I'm talking about my brother.

76
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,600
I just came here.

77
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Can't I?

78
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Eunuch Wang,

79
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,400
go and get some new tea for the eunuch.

80
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,400
Bring it to the eunuch.

81
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Good tea.

82
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
There must be a demon everywhere.

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
Sister, just say it.

84
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,600
What's the matter?

85
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,400
Cool.

86
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,400
There is a cool sister.

87
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,000
There is a cool brother.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,200
You are in a good mood.

89
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,200
Me?

90
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes.

91
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,600
I'm not suitable.

92
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,400
You are suitable.

93
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,000
You are good at everything.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,200
Why can't you help your nephew?

95
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,400
Besides,

96
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
you have such a book.

97
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,400
The book of love.

98
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,400
Sister.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,800
Good.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,200
Even if you are not good,

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,200
daughter.

102
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,200
Sister.

103
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,200
His Father needs it?

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,720
Of course.

105
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,000
It's ok if I hear.

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,800
Tell me.

107
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,140
His Majesty is already

108
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,000
Norwegian, right?

109
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,360
You're so ridiculous.

110
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,120
You're the one who can ask

111
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,800
the personal life of the emperor.

112
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,560
You don't like Ling'er, do you?

113
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,560
How could that be?

114
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,760
Don't talk nonsense.

115
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,440
You wrote this book?

116
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,600
Yes.

117
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,720
There are three major elements in the play.

118
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,200
The face is to be careful and clear.

119
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,760
You said it,

120
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,320
but you didn't say it.

121
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,520
How could that be?

122
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,080
These are real.

123
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,320
You haven't seen the pig's run and eat the pork.

124
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,560
How did you write the play?

125
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
You don't know?

126
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
For example?

127
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,960
For example,

128
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,240
the face is to be careful and clear.

129
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,400
Even if you're rejected, you can't be careful.

130
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,480
You have to be careful and clear.

131
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,160
The key is to make it clear

132
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,520
what the other party likes.

133
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,120
If the other party has an emotion,

134
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,920
you have to go to comfort them.

135
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,840
The most important thing is this.

136
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,080
What the dog 4?

137
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,360
What the dog 4.

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,160
What's this?

139
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,440
It's really romantic.

140
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,080
I don't understand romantic words.

141
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
I'm not sure if I can find it.

142
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,080
I didn't expect that the state-owned fish is not that much.

143
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,080
But when we left the gate,

144
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,080
it was more interesting than the others.

145
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
I wrote it down.

146
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
No.

147
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Give it back to me.

148
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
Your Majesty.

149
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,080
Ice water.

150
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Are you crazy?

151
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
If you say something, I'll kill you.

152
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
I'll kill you.

153
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,080
Don't be so mean.

154
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,080
Can I eat your sardine?

155
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
Give it back.

156
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,080
Your Majesty.

157
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,080
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,080
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,080
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
Your Majesty.

164
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
Your heart was sent out.

165
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Sent out?

166
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,080
Your Majesty.

167
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,080
I'll believe you.

168
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
I'll tell you.

169
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,080
Two jin of rice.

170
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Two loaves of grass.

171
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,080
Two rabbits.

172
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Two rabbits.

173
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,080
Your Majesty.

174
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
Your Majesty.

175
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
I'm here.

176
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
What's wrong?

177
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
You had a dream?

178
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
No.

179
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,080
I suddenly remembered.

180
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
How did you do it?

181
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Your Majesty.

182
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Please.

183
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
Where are you going?

184
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,080
You just had a small miscarriage.

185
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Your Majesty, I'm sorry.

186
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
I especially appreciate

187
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,080
the soup made by you in Shoukang Palace.

188
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Soup made by Shoukang Palace?

189
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
You were late.

190
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,080
You didn't know

191
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,080
that Empress Dowager always likes to take medicine.

192
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,080
So she made a soup made by Shoukang Palace.

193
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,080
You're a forbidden person.

194
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
No one knows.

195
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,080
No one will disturb you.

196
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
No matter what,

197
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,080
that's also Empress Dowager's place.

198
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,080
I won't bother her

199
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,080
if it's too late.

200
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,080
I'm just a little tired.

201
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,080
I'm going back to rest.

202
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
Yue Fei.

203
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
Empress Dowager's insistence

204
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
is very meaningful.

205
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
You have to go to the soup today.

206
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,080
If you don't, you have to go.

207
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
Yue Fei, you can leave now.

208
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Empress Dowager, don't worry.

209
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Everything is arranged.

210
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,080
Yue Fei.

211
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
Yue Fei.

212
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,080
Yue Fei.

213
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
Empress Dowager,

214
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,080
what's going on?

215
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,080
I'm sorry.

216
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
I've been in a lot of trouble lately.

217
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
I have to go to the soup.

218
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,080
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,080
It's okay.

221
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
I'll take care of it.

222
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,080
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,080
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,080
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,080
I'm sorry.

228
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,080
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,880
I'll come and soak it in the future.

232
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,280
It'll make me feel better.

233
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,480
This place is really a place where you can practice in daily life

234
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,680
and take the medicine.

235
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,280
There are more medicinal plants in the pond.

236
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,480
It's indeed a good thing.

237
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
You...

238
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,880
You want to go to the pond?

239
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
Let's go.

240
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,280
I'm not a little girl.

241
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,880
I'm not your self.

242
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
Then...

243
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
Let's go.

244
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
You...

245
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,680
Are you okay?

246
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,880
What was that just now?

247
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
Pond.

248
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,480
That's the pond.

249
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
You know what?

250
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,680
When I was little,

251
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,080
I used to drink water

252
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,680
to watch the flowers bloom.

253
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,480
So I was able to drink water.

254
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,680
I was able to drink water.

255
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
I was able to drink water.

256
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,480
I was able to drink water.

257
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,880
When the flowers bloom,

258
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
I often wait for them to bloom.

259
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,080
It looks good.

260
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,080
But it's a little short.

261
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,880
The first time I saw it,

262
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,880
I thought it was just a moment.

263
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,280
But it's always a little short.

264
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
In...

265
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,680
I'm worried that after mother set up the traps here,

266
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,080
you won't be able to attack.

267
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,880
So I want to pull you

268
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,280
to get hurt.

269
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
Are you okay?

270
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
Let's go.

271
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,080
Empress Dowager,

272
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,880
in this situation,

273
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,680
we've already...

274
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,080
made it.

275
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,140
solves the problem

276
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,780
I lived on

277
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,880
Is an old marriage

278
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,680
Madame's allegation

279
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,480
isもう

280
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,780
just a mistake.

281
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,080
Xiao Zhang,

282
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,880
remember,

283
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,280
your husband

284
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,480
will never give up.

285
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,880
I swore

286
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
I want to revenge

287
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,880
I only want you to live well

288
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
A person who can't understand

289
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
Two people in your body

290
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
You are not smart

291
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
You have no ability

292
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
One hundred

293
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,880
I can't do it

294
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
I can't promise you

295
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
Okay?

296
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Xu Lingyao

297
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,880
You just want to send you to the Cao family

298
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,880
That's to serve the Cao family

299
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,880
You have been forced to move the Cao family

300
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
How can you

301
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
Since you eat my Cao family's food

302
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,880
Then you have to serve the Cao family

303
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
You are not smart

304
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,880
You know what you are talking about

305
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Please send the Cao family back

306
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
Ling'er

307
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,880
She colluded with the thief first

308
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Don't really set her free

309
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
You let the Nings and the Huang family's face

310
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
But Your Majesty

311
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
You know it

312
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
She is not the thief

313
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,880
Her aunt was taken as a bait

314
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,880
She

315
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
She is going to be used by the Cao family

316
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,880
She is going to be our concubine

317
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
She is not a pawn in the court

318
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
She is a living person

319
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
But she wants to kill your brother

320
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
She wants to do it for you

321
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
She is not going to revenge

322
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
That's the problem

323
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,880
Her father died in the battle of the Yangtze River

324
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
That's on the battlefield where you died

325
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,880
Yes, the battlefield is ruthless

326
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
But there are people who love it

327
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
How many people in the war

328
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
have been killed by the six historical lock

329
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,880
Even the sun of the second day

330
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
can't be seen

331
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Although the Yue family is not the chief

332
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
But the chief of the Shen family

333
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
Ling'er

334
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,880
Like Hui Fei

335
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,880
Lin Buqing and Lei Yan

336
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Can't stay in the country

337
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
I don't agree

338
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Sister Yin Yin

339
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
Sister Xu Yin

340
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
Go and report to her

341
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,880
Yin Yin

342
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Yin Yin

343
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Yin Yin, are you okay?

344
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
I killed you all

345
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
I killed you all

346
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
Go

347
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
Yin Yin, what are you doing?

348
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
It's just a child

349
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
Yue Fei can't be born

350
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
We can't be born again

351
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
I killed you

352
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
I want to have a child with the emperor

353
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
I want to have a child with the emperor

354
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
I want to have a child with the emperor

355
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,880
I don't deserve to be the emperor

356
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
You should shut up

357
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
No

358
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
I want to say

359
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
I want to say it loudly

360
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
It's a big deal

361
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,880
To be honest, I want to tell you

362
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
I don't want to live anymore

363
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Do you know

364
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Every day I see the killing of my parents

365
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
The people who hurt their own family

366
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
In front of themselves

367
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
What does it feel like?

368
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
You don't know

369
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
You don't know anything

370
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
Yin Yin

371
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Because every day I just know

372
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,880
The emperor went to Fengnan Palace today

373
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
Went to Yue Fei's house

374
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
Tomorrow the emperor went to Yong'an Palace

375
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,880
Had a porridge

376
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,880
The high point of the Zhou Ping

377
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,880
He praised his craft

378
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
You are worried about your own status

379
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,880
No security, no status, no power

380
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
But you have never thought of me

381
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
I

382
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
I want to be a man

383
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,880
No power in the Niang family

384
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,880
No parents to support me

385
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
I have

386
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,880
Just one time, one time

387
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
You guys

388
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,880
What right do I have to give up on me?

389
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
What do you want?

390
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
I'm like this

391
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
Don't come over

392
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,880
I used to have a parents who loved me

393
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,880
My brother

394
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
All of this

395
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Shen Yuechi and his family destroyed them

396
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
Shen Yuechi destroyed them

397
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,880
You think I don't know Ling'er well?

398
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,880
You think I'm willing to be

399
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,880
A beautiful person?

400
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
I have no way

401
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,880
I really don't have

402
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
I don't have anything now

403
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
What to do

404
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
I told you not to come over

405
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
I said

406
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,880
Don't come over

407
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Don't come over

408
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Calm down

409
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
I can talk to you

410
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
You can

411
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,880
Throw the sword away

412
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
I can

413
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
You are giving me a knife

414
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,880
I'll die with you

415
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Whatever you say

416
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,880
There is no判刀 in this harem

417
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880
I'd rather die with you

418
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,880
I'll do it for you

419
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,880
What are you doing?

420
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,880
I thought you wouldn't take the harem as your home

421
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,880
But at least I'm your family

422
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
Chunying

423
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,880
You know you killed Huang Si

424
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,880
You have been in the harem for three days

425
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,880
It was the woman who gave the harem a two-year-old wedding

426
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,880
She gave you the harem that she loved you

427
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,880
Do you know how we came here?

428
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,880
It was Yingwan

429
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,880
She was kneeling in the harem

430
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,880
Then the Empress Dowager gave her the harem

431
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
Yingwan didn't walk a path

432
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
She didn't think much

433
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Do you know how scared I was when I saw you?

434
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
I was afraid I'd be late

435
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
Chunying

436
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,880
Don't be so obsessed with your pain

437
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,880
Can you think of us?

438
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Can you think of us who have been together for more than two years?

439
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,880
I'm sorry

440
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,880
I'm sorry

441
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,880
I'm sorry

442
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,880
Don't be sorry

443
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
We are always sisters

444
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,880
We have been together for two years

445
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,880
We have been a family

446
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
I can't see

447
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
What are you doing?

448
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,880
I'm begging you

449
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,880
Okay, stop fighting

450
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,880
We were going to take Yingying out of the harem

451
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,880
I'm sorry

452
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,880
I'm sorry

453
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
I'm sorry

454
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,880
I'm sorry

455
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,880
I'm sorry

456
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
Still my work and slim

457
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
Whatruck happened to him?

458
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,880
It's true

459
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,880
What do you talk about?

460
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
ground

461
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,640
The specialist

462
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,240
be a glutton.

463
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,240
Go.

464
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,080
I'm so sorry.

465
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,520
Hong Fei, you!

466
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,920
Please come in.

467
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,360
You guys have a nice talk.

468
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,680
I'll call you later.

469
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,560
The End

470
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,320
You don't believe in your brother?

471
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,160
Actually, I understand Hui Fei.

472
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Don't you blame him?

473
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,000
It's good if the world is peaceful.

474
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
The End

475
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,520
This time, the emperor decided to punish you

476
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,760
for two months' salary

477
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,040
and pay the compensation for Yue Fei.

478
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

479
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,760
I'm sorry for the matter of the Great Yan.

480
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,760
But since you and Yue Fei

481
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,040
have become sisters,

482
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,120
we're all family.

483
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,560
Thank you for your love for me, Your Majesty.

484
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,040
Maybe one day,

485
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,960
I'll let go of everything.

486
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,960
But no matter what,

487
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,560
when and where,

488
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,120
I and you

489
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,680
will never be family.

490
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,160
The End

491
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,800
How is it?

492
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,200
Go.

493
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,120
You need it.

494
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,120
It looks good.

495
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,520
Good.

496
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,320
Let's go.

497
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,320
The End

498
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,360
If it weren't for your missing leaves today,

499
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,560
I wouldn't have come here.

500
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,480
You dare to come here

501
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,400
even if you eat or drink.

502
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,160
By the way,

503
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,400
I came here today

504
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,880
to light up your little gold treasury.

505
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,280
You're right.

506
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,640
Sister Xu's little gold treasury

507
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,560
is not only for you to light up.

508
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,440
You said it.

509
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,480
It seems that we can count it.

510
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,240
Besides,

511
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,320
it's not the last one of us today.

512
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,840
It sounds like a lonely person.

513
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,120
Sister, they want...

514
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,480
They want to peek at me.

515
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,600
They don't have a door.

516
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,000
You found it.

517
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,480
You're really being considerate of me.

518
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,960
Yue Fei,

519
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm telling you,

520
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,320
since today,

521
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,000
I won't be in love with you.

522
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,480
You.

523
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,520
You're being considerate of me.

524
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,240
Get out.

525
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,400
I think it's Xia Wen.

526
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,120
She's being considerate of me.

527
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,160
I told her that

528
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,840
you're going to punish her for her two months' salary.

529
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,720
It's for Ling'er.

530
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,520
Yue Chi,

531
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,120
you two are really brothers.

532
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,160
One is responsible for the skin,

533
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,840
the other is responsible for the hand.

534
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,440
Do you guys really have divides?

535
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,180
Cheng Yunot

536
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,160
is very careful

537
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,160
of moving theイ کchat out of her home.

538
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,180
She's stopping her job

539
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,020
to bring back a Phu Kanye.

540
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,160
Brother Imperial,

541
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,920
is going to disappear

542
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,080
when he complains this?

543
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
That's enough.

544
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,400
Honestly,

545
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,580
the rescue of Ying Ying

546
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,560
was nothing more than

547
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,680
참 Isit.

548
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,080
It was a dangerous sneaky campaign.

549
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,080
Your Majesty, someone has been arrested.

550
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,080
The police have already taken away the Zhong Mi Eye Control.

551
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,080
They have sent the police to the city.

552
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
They are arrested.

553
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
I don't know.

554
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
The guards are in the middle.

555
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,080
Don't be angry. I'll go after them.

556
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,480
Great Hitman

557
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,220
boat

558
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,080
Surf and Mal�äter

559
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Crap!

560
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,840
afraid that the AI will shoot his attack

561
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,960
failure

562
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,800
If I were to nicely chose

563
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,940
the opponent should be position 8

564
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,480
I should frame territories

565
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,980
Very good.

566
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,000
Remember, find Pandora,

567
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,220
the ahead advanced three spirit,

568
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,660
Heroes of theωςion,

569
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,260
but beeverığım sleeps late,

570
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,520
furo the leg and hum against it,

571
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,540
and the peach-tailed spawning down,

572
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,620
then not boycottuble,

573
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,460
