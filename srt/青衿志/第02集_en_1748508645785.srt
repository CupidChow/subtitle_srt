1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the world

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If the happiness is not decided

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let me come and fight

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The wind and the moon are all warm

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The young people are all old and young

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The hot spring and autumn are all here

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The mountains and mountains are all over the river

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The wind and the moon are all over the river

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The spring breeze is moving and the sun is shining

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The hot spring and autumn are all warm

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Episode 1

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Episode 1

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The house is about to be exposed

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You love to be loved

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You can't just open your mouth

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Your Majesty, you found me at the beginning

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But the new dynasty is not stable

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The royal family is in a bad mood

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Two years of pushing the new government is not difficult

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I want my brother to be your left-wing right-wing

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
To be together with the world

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What about me?

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm in the wrong again

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You can't be a good girl

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You are so smart

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm afraid there is only the part of being a good girl

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Who said your brother was a good girl

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He was cold-hearted to the court

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He only had a good job

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I let him be with me

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's how he was so smart

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, I was right

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I know my brother is so bad

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But you still need him

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Not me, but the people

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Please have some tea

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't be so polite

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You don't have a cup

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't worry, Ling'er

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We grew up together

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I can't lie to anyone

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No matter what

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I allow you to be a good girl

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Never let your career down

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We grew up together

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's just that we have been together for two years

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And I'm not doing this for the sake of Yuejia

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't say that

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't be so polite

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What do you want?

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll give you a treat

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I want my brother

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Everyone is talented

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If he's a good girl

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He'll have a lot of money

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But I'm the only one who knows

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How fast he was born

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
How dangerous it is to stand against me

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
How secret his sword is

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
How scary his sword is

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I think a man like my brother

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Should be a good man

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Should have faith in history

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Just like you think

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's not a big deal to keep a name in history

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's hard to say how it was today

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
How to say it later

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No, I'm not just a musician

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm more myself

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I understand

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But I'm not responsible for this history

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm just responsible for our family

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's not good

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Come, take a look

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The family of Yuejia is about to be defeated

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't worry

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I can starve to death as a prime minister

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I won't starve to death

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll do whatever I need

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You're my friend

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Of course

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But be careful

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't let your brother find out

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Don't worry

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
My brother is busy with the traffic

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So he doesn't have time to worry about this

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And I'm the best man in our family

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
My brother likes my ability

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I like it

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What did you say?

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I said I like you

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You're smart

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
If you have a sister like you

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's a real blessing

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Why did Ling give me so many girls?

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think it's these

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I think it's money

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I just got the money

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And I got the money

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Your Highness

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Consort Hui gave you the invitation

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And invited you to the tea party

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Consort Hui asked me to have tea party?

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
She's not feeling well

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But she said

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
She invited all the concubines

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
If you don't go, you'll be unlucky

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Your Highness

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'll go

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What if they find out about the disaster?

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What if they offend you?

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Ling will be in trouble

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Go

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Consort Hui is here

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
She's waiting for us

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Are you going to open the door?

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You're late

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're going to be punished

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I won't open the door today

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Ling will be in trouble

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You can say it

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Consort Hui, you can say it

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Whether you want to smell it or not

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Whether you want to get married or not

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What do you mean?

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Smell it and it's a mouth

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Smell it and it's a hand

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Smell it and it's a blood

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Smell it and it's a shoulder

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You should know my usual hobby

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
After all, I'm a martial artist

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So I can do it

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's not super

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Sister Qu

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Didn't you say you just danced without a song?

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
She wants to play with us

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The harem has always been a good match

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm a harem

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So the rule of punishment is natural

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Smell it and it's a hand

142
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Natural

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Xiao Yue, come

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's her

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I misunderstood

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Then sister

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's a shame

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Come on

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Sisters, come here

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Today is my sister

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I chose some treasures

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Is the pearl powder you usually use fake white?

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Is it?

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Is it fake white?

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes, Your Highness

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Today, let's see if our pearl powder is fake white

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The latest fish-shaped pearl powder

158
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Fish-shaped pearl powder

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If it's not my sister

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I can't bear to take it out

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Then someone asked

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's all pearl powder

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why is our family not fake white?

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Why?

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Because our family uses pearl powder

166
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's right

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Pearl powder is more suitable

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The pure pearl color is similar to the face

169
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's the dead white without blood

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Look, look, look

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Isn't it?

172
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
How natural?

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But we only have ten

174
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Ten?

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's 100

176
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
100

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You're against me?

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Today I say

179
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
20

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
20

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
How can this be?

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Today is my birthday

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Sister Qing didn't come to celebrate my birthday with me

184
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll give you some presents

185
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll buy five

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Come, I'll buy five

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Ten for your palace

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You can get it first

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Not only the classic

190
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But also the limited edition

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Sister Qu

192
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The hand-cut is too scary

193
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I won't buy it

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll go and see

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Just go

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Sister Qu, I'll go and see

197
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I won't buy it

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes, yes, yes

199
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You can buy it when you sleep

200
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Buy this cotton candy

201
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The cotton candy

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The cotton candy

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The cotton candy

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Just go

205
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The cotton candy

206
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Open the back

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's so pretty

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's big

209
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The fee is not paid

210
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Why don't you tell me?

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I seriously feel a bit worried

212
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But my ツシ赴证

213
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,480
Do you close the welche

214
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:46,000
Go back to know

215
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,920
Yan

216
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,000
Go back to know

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,760
Go back to know

218
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
ᕚᕖᕖᕖᕖᕖᕖᕣᕖᕖᕤᕖᕖᕖᕖ

219
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Sister-in-law

220
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The house of the late maid is so thick.

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
How about it?

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Isn't Huo Jing Heng's house even thicker?

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's not stay here and beg for forgiveness.

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Let's go straight to the big one.

225
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What do you think he likes?

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What are you doing?

227
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You want to say that you're a thousand-meter-long mirror?

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You can, Xiao Yue.

229
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You've grown up.

230
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Last month, an external injury just got into the ten-meter-long mirror.

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's said that you can use it.

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You've always seen the lotus flower on the top of the four-leafed top of the top of the ten-meter-long coffin.

233
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Is that so?

234
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Can you see the night pearl that the most beautiful lady wants to see?

235
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Of course I can.

236
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The most beautiful lady wants to guess...

237
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
...the most beautiful lady.

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
A thousand-meter-long mirror?

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
How much do you plan to sell it for?

240
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Your Majesty, you're right.

241
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I won't sell it to you anymore.

242
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm worried that you'll forget me when you see it from a distance.

243
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Your skills are better than your ability to make money.

244
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

245
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Am I being too much?

246
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You know that the Sixth Palace is not happy with you.

247
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Why do you still want to fight them?

248
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Because I want to be the empress.

249
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Of course I want to fight the Sixth Palace.

250
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I know what you want to do.

251
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
How much more do you plan to sell it for?

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's more than enough.

253
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Get ready.

254
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You're not good at flying.

255
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You're not good at flying.

256
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Ling'er, I made money. I'll give you the money.

257
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Don't be so happy.

258
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I've made this unique shape.

259
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'll tell her to tell you the top-class soldiers...

260
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
...who don't stay in the junior high.

261
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

262
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Instead of doing nothing,

263
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
you should be strong and strong.

264
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
A woman is strong, a country is strong.

265
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You should be responsible for your life.

266
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You should be reminded of theraszam spoken to by...

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
...�outed by Imperial Concubine Xia.

268
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
When the wedding comes, use your performance...

269
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
...to change the writing for her.

270
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
She's quite tonight- Tapi!

271
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Stay away from her!

272
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't get upset about this.

273
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
She'll feel deer if she's upset,

274
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and me being a Capital Guardsman is about إ yours.

275
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Everything finding your reason...

276
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,400
He's so thin.

277
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,440
But,

278
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,160
where's Yue Fei?

279
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,480
Yue.

280
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,120
What are you looking for?

281
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,280
I don't know

282
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,240
how to get His Majesty's honor

283
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,320
to be lost.

284
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,240
I was fine when I came here.

285
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,560
If I were to ask him

286
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,720
when I was in the treasury,

287
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,960
would I be really his crime?

288
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,120
Don't worry.

289
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,640
It's so big here.

290
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
We'll find it.

291
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,800
How about this?

292
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,040
You can look for it here.

293
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,320
I'll go there and check for you.

294
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,280
Okay, Your Highness.

295
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,200
Ruyi.

296
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,280
The forbidden area?

297
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,520
Huh?

298
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,920
No..

299
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,200
Good weapon?

300
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,160
Who's that?

301
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,240
Bastard.

302
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,080
Believer?

303
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,740
To być advanced man indeed.

304
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,960
ifiable advantage.

305
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,420
They are called witchcrafts.

306
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,340
Everybody badly balm your influence.

307
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,320
Don't believe something.

308
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,560
He's not hidden.

309
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,780
He doesn't listen to youGAN for no reason.

310
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,780
This is the place where the officials gather.

311
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,780
It's right there.

312
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,780
If you walk one more step forward,

313
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,780
you'll see the King of the Eyes.

314
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,780
It seems that you can't talk properly.

315
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,780
Are you a man or a woman?

316
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,780
It doesn't look like a painting of the evil.

317
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,780
Let me go.

318
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,780
You can go,

319
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,780
but can you...

320
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,780
Can you help me?

321
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,780
Yes, you can help me with the kitchen table.

322
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,780
Since you know the distribution of the mechanisms here,

323
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,780
why would you...

324
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,780
If you hadn't come to the forbidden place and opened the gate,

325
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,780
could I have fallen to this place?

326
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,780
You can put yourself in the trap.

327
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,780
Do you want to cooperate?

328
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,780
Just do what you want.

329
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,780
Hurry up.

330
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,780
I'll go.

331
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,780
What a strong look.

332
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,780
It's...

333
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,780
the woman of the three realms.

334
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,780
Empress Dowager.

335
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,780
This meal is really insulting.

336
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,780
You just gave me a big burden.

337
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,780
I even disturbed Empress Dowager's mood.

338
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,780
You were just being straightforward.

339
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,780
Now you're weak.

340
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,780
It's really boring.

341
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,780
How can you break the road

342
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,780
that's so slippery?

343
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,780
You're doing well, Xiao Jia.

344
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,780
You can take two of my clothes.

345
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,780
Empress Dowager, you look so strange.

346
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,780
Why don't you take one of my clothes?

347
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,780
Interesting. Come on.

348
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,780
I'll take my leave.

349
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,780
You're playing with the machine.

350
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,780
It's good.

351
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,780
But you can't run like this.

352
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,780
Can you hang it on your face?

353
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,780
What's wrong with my face?

354
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,780
You can't eat or drink.

355
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,780
You...

356
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,780
Your Highness.

357
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,780
I found the容易.

358
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,780
I'm afraid I'll be late.

359
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,780
Where did you go?

360
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,780
I went to the forbidden land.

361
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,780
Empress Dowager, are you okay?

362
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,780
I heard that Empress Dowager used to have a name

363
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,780
called Ghost Sword.

364
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,780
In the palace, many guards wanted to

365
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,780
make Empress Dowager happy and break into the forbidden land.

366
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,780
They just flew out.

367
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,780
Why didn't you fly out?

368
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,780
Who did you talk to before you lost your mind?

369
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,780
It seems that Yan Ning is a palace maid.

370
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,780
I told her that there's something wrong with her.

371
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,780
She was so angry that I asked her to go see her.

372
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,780
Don't come to me with Yan Ning anymore.

373
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,780
Why?

374
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,780
Your Highness, wait for me.

375
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,780
The blood of a woman is still a tool.

376
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,780
Your Highness, why did you miss a blood?

377
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,780
Oh, no. Blood?

378
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,780
What are you doing?

379
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,780
What happened to Empress Dowager's body?

380
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,780
It's said that there's a woman who flew into the forbidden land

381
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,780
and fought with her.

382
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,780
I think that the blood

383
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,780
of the Empress Dowager is now out of the bed.

384
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,780
Such a big blood.

385
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,780
Which one of the concubines can wear it?

386
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,780
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

387
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,780
Sister, you said that the shoes are so big.

388
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,780
It's not like a normal girl can wear it.

389
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,780
I'm curious if it makes sense.

390
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,780
Which palace maid is the most suitable for the shoes?

391
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,780
I remember now.

392
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,780
Yue Fei is as tall as a man.

393
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,780
Because you said...

394
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,780
Yes, except Yue Fei, there's no other person.

395
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,780
Yue Fei.

396
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,780
Let's go.

397
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,780
The Empress Dowager is here!

398
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,780
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

399
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,780
You are Yue Fei?

400
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,780
Yes, I am.

401
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,780
You let the people enter the forbidden land and disturb the Empress Dowager's cultivation.

402
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,780
You left this shoe here.

403
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,780
The harem's sister is innocent and wants to try it.

404
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,780
Is Yue Fei's sister here for a while?

405
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,780
Since the harem is about to be worn out,

406
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,780
why did she arrive at the palace so soon and take over the palace?

407
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,780
The sister is...

408
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,780
The shoe's posture is clearly the shoe's shoe.

409
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,780
The size is so big.

410
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,780
The harem's size is not as big as Yue Fei's.

411
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,780
Who else can wear it?

412
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,780
Yes, the size of the shoe and the angle of Yue Fei's foot.

413
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,780
I can't touch it.

414
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,780
What if someone else pretends to be a man?

415
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,780
The harem's position is too low.

416
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,780
I can't even touch the shoe's foot.

417
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,780
Empress Dowager Fang is in the forbidden land and is disturbing people.

418
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,780
This person knows how to dance.

419
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,780
I heard that Yue Fei's sister is a good dancer.

420
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,780
I think you can only dance in the harem.

421
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,780
Who said I can dance?

422
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,780
I'm just a gentle woman.

423
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,780
Can you do that?

424
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,780
You are a pervert.

425
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,780
Empress Dowager, is the harem's size so big and tall

426
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:31,780
that she should be in the forbidden land and be in the forbidden land?

427
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,780
Enough!

428
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,780
You are so noisy.

429
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,780
You are so noisy.

430
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,780
You are so noisy.

431
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,780
Do you want me to talk?

432
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,780
Whether it's true or not,

433
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,780
there are many ways to practice dancing.

434
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,780
You are a pervert.

435
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,780
It's not true.

436
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,780
You are a pervert.

437
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,780
Your Majesty.

438
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,780
Your Majesty.

439
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,780
Your Majesty.

440
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,780
Your Majesty.

441
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,780
Even if it's Empress Dowager,

442
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,780
you can't hurt my beloved consort.

443
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,780
You are also a pervert.

444
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,780
There is a big problem.

445
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,780
Why don't you tell me?

446
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,780
My son is...

447
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,780
Your Majesty.

448
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,780
Your Majesty is truly a treasure.

449
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,780
He is a kind and kind person.

450
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,780
It's been a thousand years.

451
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,780
He is so happy.

452
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,780
I thought it was hard to match the harem's size

453
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,780
with my son.

454
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,780
So I brought the harem's size

455
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,780
with me.

456
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,780
It's interesting to see a little boy

457
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,780
in the harem.

458
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,780
He wants to catch my son's partner.

459
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,780
Isn't that good?

460
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,780
It's so wonderful.

461
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,780
Yue Fei.

462
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,780
I like you.

463
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,780
I want to be your friend.

464
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,780
Let's go.

465
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,780
Let's go to drink.

466
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,780
Empress Dowager.

467
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,780
Empress Dowager.

468
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,780
Let's go to drink.

469
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,780
Drink less.

470
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,780
Your Majesty.

471
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,780
It seems that there are some misunderstandings.

472
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,780
I will apologize to you

473
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,780
in the future.

474
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,780
Will you apologize to me?

475
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,780
Are you going to be the Empress Dowager

476
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,780
or the Empress Dowager?

477
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,780
Yue Fei.

478
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,780
Why do you keep wearing a veil

479
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,780
during the day?

480
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,780
What's so hard to say?

481
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,780
I've been wearing a veil

482
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,780
for a while.

483
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,780
And I'm afraid that I'll be too scared

484
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,780
to see the Empress Dowager.

485
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,780
I'm embarrassed.

486
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,780
I said I'm embarrassed.

487
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,780
If you don't obey my order,

488
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,780
do you know what crime it is?

489
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,780
Yes.

490
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,780
You look like an old friend of mine.

491
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,780
Empress Dowager, I...

492
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,780
You...

493
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,780
You look like a old friend of mine.

494
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,780
He's like you.

495
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,780
I'm a man.

496
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,780
I'm too cold.

497
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,780
Get up.

498
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,780
Get up.

499
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,780
I used to be a martial artist.

500
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,780
My son was like an outsider.

501
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,780
He became a martial artist

502
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,780
who was a strong man.

503
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:23,780
I didn't expect him to be the most shameless

504
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,780
and free emperor.

505
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,780
He's also shameless.

506
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,780
He's shameless.

507
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,780
Look at his harem.

508
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,780
He didn't marry

509
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,780
the one he wanted.

510
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,780
Many people in the room said

511
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,780
that he didn't like women

512
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,780
because he was too cold.

513
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,780
Good thing you're here.

514
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,780
I like it.

515
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,780
People say that

516
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,780
it's easy to be a man.

517
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,780
He's wise and fearless.

518
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,780
He's shameless.

519
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,780
Only the living know it.

520
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,780
He's a real man.

521
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,780
He can't be a man.

522
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,780
He's so tired.

523
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,780
But he said

524
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,780
someone taught him

525
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,780
to be a man

526
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,780
and to be a man.

527
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,780
He's a man.

528
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,780
He's a man.

529
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,780
He's not a man.

530
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,780
I wrote it in the new law.

531
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,780
When did you teach him to be a man?

532
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,780
Your Highness, you're finally back.

533
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,780
Are you okay?

534
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,780
I won't be able to see you again.

535
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,780
Go to the kitchen to eat something good.

536
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,780
It's your punishment.

537
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,780
I'll sleep in a dark room

538
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,780
if I suffer today.

539
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,780
Your Highness, I forgot to tell you.

540
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,780
His Majesty is waiting for you.

541
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,780
Greetings to Your Majesty.

542
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,780
It's not a day of sorrow.

543
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,780
You must rest well.

544
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,780
It's too much to wash.

545
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,780
Is it to save the money?

546
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,780
It's not a loss.

547
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,780
The emperor is too easy to be bewitched.

548
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,780
He hasn't changed.

549
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,780
Why is he so impulsive?

550
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,780
I've been using it for years.

551
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,780
I haven't prepared it well.

552
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,780
Please thank Your Majesty.

553
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,780
I'm not hiding it.

554
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,780
I'm a emperor.

555
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,780
I'm also a beggar.

556
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,780
I think it's time for you and Yue Fei

557
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,780
to be careful.

558
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,780
I can only let you calm down with Ming Yan.

559
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,780
This is your

560
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,780
brother's

561
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,780
new law.

562
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,780
He's so arrogant.

563
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,780
It's okay if you don't keep your name.

564
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:37,780
Now, you're still a lonely and cruel man.

565
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,780
Sit.

566
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,780
Ling Xiong is a genius.

567
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,780
He's the youngest Prime Minister of the imperial court.

568
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,780
He's been a great merit.

569
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,780
He's dead.

570
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,780
You must be proud of him.

571
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,780
You think it's too late.

572
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,780
You think it's too much.

573
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,780
Right?

574
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,780
I don't know about the court.

575
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,780
If Ling Xiong is still alive,

576
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,780
there must be another plan.

577
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,780
You still have to say it.

578
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,780
You don't have anything to say to me?

579
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,780
Yes.

580
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,780
I thank you for your love for me.

581
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,780
I'm a man of my word.

582
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,780
I thought I'd be a good man.

583
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,780
I'm afraid I'll be a bad man

584
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,780
if I'm a bad man.

585
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,780
I'll be a good man.

586
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,780
I'll be a good man.

587
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,780
I'll be a good man.

588
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,780
I'll be a good man.

589
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,780
I'll be a good man.

590
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,780
I'll be a good man.

591
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,780
I want to be the empress.

592
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,780
You didn't say anything.

593
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,780
You're talking.

594
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,780
Calm down.

595
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,780
It's all for Ling.

596
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,780
Your Majesty hasn't answered my question.

597
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,780
You're so precious.

598
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,780
How can you hide it?

599
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,780
How many are there?

600
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,780
Let me see.

601
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,780
Your Majesty, I didn't think it through.

602
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,780
I was so confused.

603
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,780
I couldn't even stop myself.

604
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,780
Are you going to save me?

605
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,780
Why am I so confused?

606
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,780
Your Majesty.

607
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,780
What's wrong?

608
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,780
I'm just whispering.

609
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,780
I suggest you to be separated.

610
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,780
It's not an offence.

611
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,780
I was wrong.

612
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,780
I'm just saying.

613
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,780
I'm not forcing you.

614
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,780
Go on.

615
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,580
Consort Yue is going to be a good woman.

616
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,780
I'm just saying.

617
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,780
What's wrong?

618
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,780
I'm just saying.

619
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,780
I'm just saying.

620
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,780
Consort Yue is the one who's going to be a good woman.

621
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,780
I'm just saying.

622
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,780
I'm just saying.

623
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,700
Yes.

624
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,140
Consort Yue is on the bed.

625
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,540
Okay, Your Majesty.

626
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,900
Your Highness.

627
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,900
You're awake.

628
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,820
I look like I'm asleep.

629
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,980
I'm afraid that I'll be the queen

630
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,580
and I'll be the fairy.

631
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,060
I'm not sure yet.

632
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,580
Where are we going then?

633
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,780
Your Majesty has to go to the palace

634
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,300
every day for half an hour.

635
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,020
I want to read the book again today

636
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,220
to avoid being too tired.

637
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,220
I've been doing this for so many years.

638
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,660
I've never had any rest.

639
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,740
You look like a emperor.

640
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,260
Everyone looks like

641
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,420
the emperor,

642
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,460
but no one is here.

643
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,140
But Your Highness,

644
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,460
why do you look like him?

645
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,740
He's a virtuous man.

646
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,340
He's as virtuous as I am.

647
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,900
Of course he's not a emperor.

648
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,820
Your Highness,

649
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,260
you're interested in him.

650
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,340
How do you think he's right?

651
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,220
I hope he's a bit different.

652
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,420
Otherwise, I'll be in trouble.

653
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,380
His Majesty is kind to you.

654
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,540
He's a kind and loyal man.

655
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,380
His Majesty reminded me

656
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,100
not to mess up

657
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,780
his mother's face and face.

658
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,060
He's not good to me.

659
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,900
I mean...

660
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,020
You're a mother.

661
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,580
Why didn't you say so earlier?

662
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,340
You didn't ask me.

663
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,020
Your Highness,

664
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,420
the gate is closing.

665
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,260
Let's go.

666
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,180
Wait.

667
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,620
Open the door.

668
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,060
Your Majesty,

669
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,140
what are you doing?

670
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,940
I'm the one who delayed your order.

671
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,740
You're in the same boat as my wife.

672
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,740
Go get some food.

673
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,660
Go.

674
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,700
Go.

675
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,400
Listen,

676
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,220
the Ministry of representing justice

677
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,460
shall all of you come down!

678
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,420
Your Majesty,

679
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,540
I want to bid you farewell.

680
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,900
I'm not afraid of the world

681
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
I'm afraid of the world

682
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,900
I'm afraid of the world

683
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,900
I'm afraid of the world

684
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,900
I'm afraid of the world

685
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,900
I'm afraid of the world

686
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,900
I'm afraid of the world

687
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,900
I'm afraid of the world

688
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,900
I'm afraid of the world

689
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,900
I'm afraid of the world

690
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,900
I'm afraid of the world

691
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,900
I'm afraid of the world

692
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
I'm afraid of the world

693
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,900
I'm afraid of the world

694
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,900
Love is a wound

695
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,900
Black stone, light, rain, light, storm

696
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,900
Red blood, purple blood, hot blood

697
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,900
The past is not sweet

698
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
The past is not sweet

699
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,900
The past is not sweet

700
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,900
Who wrote the letter of kiss?

701
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,900
The wind and the wind are clear

702
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,900
The wind and the wind are clear

703
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,900
The blood in my heart

704
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,900
Can be found and broken

705
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,900
The blood in my heart

706
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,900
I'm afraid of the world

707
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,900
I'm afraid of the world

708
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,900
I'm afraid of the world

709
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,900
I'm afraid of the world

710
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,900
I'm afraid of the world

711
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,900
I'm afraid of the world

712
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,900
I'm afraid of the world

713
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,900
I'm afraid of the world

714
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900
I'm afraid of the world

715
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900
I'm afraid of the world

716
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,900
I'm afraid of the world

717
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,900
I'm afraid of the world

718
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,900
I'm afraid of the world

719
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,900
I'm afraid of the world

720
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900
I'm afraid of the world

721
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,900
I'm afraid of the world

722
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,900
I'm afraid of the world

723
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,900
I'm afraid of the world

724
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,900
I'm afraid of the world

725
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
I'm afraid of the world

726
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,900
I'm afraid of the world

727
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,900
I'm afraid of the world

728
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,900
I'm afraid of the world

729
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,900
I'm afraid of the world

730
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,900
I'm afraid of the world

731
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,900
I'm afraid of the world

732
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,900
I'm afraid of the world

733
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,900
I'm afraid of the world

734
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,900
I'm afraid of the world

735
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,900
I'm afraid of the world
