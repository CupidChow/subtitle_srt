1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The King of the Rings

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Episode 23

3
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Your Majesty, the Empress Dowager has resigned.

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The Sixth Seventh Seventh Emperor is here.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The Palace of the Red Left is in a critical state.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh no, there's no accident in the carriage.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's the night of the palace.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If you're exposed,

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
His Majesty can't protect you.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Just kill him.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Then the carriage will come out.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Don't be impulsive.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Don't worry.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll go in and check.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Can you do it?

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can do it if I don't.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm the first official of the Great Ning.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No matter what,

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll keep my brother safe for you.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You stay here.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We'll talk about the rest later.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Open the door.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
God bless you.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Be safe.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Brother Tianzhao,

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
be safe.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Your Majesty,

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I have something important to report to you.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
His Majesty is in a critical state.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I saw it myself.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yue Fei and a maid

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
met in the dark.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
She was suspicious.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Then His Majesty was killed.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This assassin

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
is pretending to be a maid.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I suspect that

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
the assassination

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
was done by Yue Fei in the dark.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The purpose is

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
to avenge the dead Prince of An Le.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
To avenge Yue Fei?

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
To avenge the dead Prince of An Le?

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Your Majesty,

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
it's really...

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yue Fei,

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm still your maid.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Of course.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then don't ask anything.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Just listen to me.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Who's the maid?

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Qiwen.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You open the door.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yue Fei was assassinated.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're asking Jin Wei to come and save her.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why are you asking me?

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Your Majesty,

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
who am I listening to?

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Qing'er.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's the end of the world.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm dead here.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You're afraid of being assassinated.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You've been assassinated many times.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're afraid of being saved.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You're afraid of coming back with me.

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's different.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I can't delay you anymore.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Trust me.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
As long as I say something,

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Huo Jinghong will come to me.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You still believe him?

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't believe him.

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm just useful to him.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The Empress Dowager is here.

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Qing'er,

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm afraid you're the future husband.

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You have to listen to me.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hide it well.

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm here for you.

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Husband?

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yue,

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
bring her to the palace.

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Use your strength to open the door.

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't open it.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Did you hear me?

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes, Your Highness.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't eat.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Come.

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Her Majesty.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I was only at my banquet earlier.

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
How can you bother

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Feng Gunmen to come over and visit me?

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yue Fei,

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Is the Food People's Court here?

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Your Grace,

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,600
Don't make me sleepy-

98
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:27,800
Hu Jing Feng

99
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,840
where did you go beyond the level

100
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,880
the gap you earth in it is so fast

101
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,800
that it's beheaded

102
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,520
They had the trouble today

103
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,440
I don't understand

104
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,400
why you did not come

105
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,720
Cheng

106
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,280
Yes

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,640
Stop

108
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,640
Your majesty come

109
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,880
It's ok

110
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,380
What?

111
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,180
Don't hurt our baby.

112
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,180
What baby?

113
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,980
What baby?

114
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,380
Baby, your baby.

115
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,780
Yue Fei has your baby.

116
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,580
Mother,

117
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,380
Yue Fei's body is different from the past.

118
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,980
He can't be surprised.

119
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,880
So, Zheng Cai secretly hid his assassin's body.

120
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,280
He should go back to the palace to rest.

121
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,280
Why did mother make such a big deal out of it?

122
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Your Majesty, Yue Fei,

123
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,480
you're so thoughtful.

124
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,280
You're so thoughtful.

125
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,480
What should we do?

126
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,880
What are you talking about?

127
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,880
Why did you send me to get you a baby?

128
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,280
He can be trusted.

129
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,880
You'd better cooperate.

130
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,780
I'll keep your baby safe.

131
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,980
Your Majesty.

132
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,380
I told you.

133
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,180
I saw the emperor

134
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,380
sending a big army to follow Yue Fei.

135
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,780
I said it's a good idea.

136
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,980
Now it seems like it should be.

137
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,580
It should be.

138
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,780
Your Majesty,

139
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,980
I was just pretending.

140
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,180
I was afraid that I couldn't tolerate the cold.

141
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,880
But Doctor Xuan is important for the whole pulse.

142
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,680
I'll be punished by you after the trial.

143
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,080
Yue Fei is right.

144
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,480
You can't delay it.

145
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,680
Doctor Xuan.

146
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
I'll go now.

147
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,680
What's going on?

148
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,080
The patient has been diagnosed.

149
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
It's over.

150
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
What are you doing here?

151
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
I'm here to save someone.

152
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
To kill the emperor.

153
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
He said he was going to kill the emperor.

154
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,280
The emperor didn't send the maid away.

155
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
If he's a big man,

156
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
I'll give him to him directly.

157
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
To protect the man?

158
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
I'll just stay here for a month.

159
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
Why are you still here?

160
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
I'll leave now.

161
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,280
If you're not happy,

162
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
let go of me.

163
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
I'll kill him again.

164
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,280
I'll kill him again.

165
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,380
Tell me what's going on here.

166
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,380
What happened?

167
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,380
Something happened.

168
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,380
What happened?

169
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,380
The night is late.

170
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,380
It's so late.

171
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,380
Doctor Feng.

172
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,380
My love is not a joke.

173
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,380
It's a big deal.

174
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,380
You can talk.

175
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,380
This pulse...

176
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,380
This pulse is...

177
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,380
Is it really there or not?

178
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,380
Your Majesty.

179
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,380
It's blood.

180
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,380
I've never seen such a cruel blood.

181
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,380
It's blood.

182
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,380
It's so terrible.

183
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,380
I told you.

184
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,380
It's a misunderstanding.

185
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,380
Congratulations.

186
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,380
My dear.

187
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,380
It's late.

188
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,380
You should rest.

189
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Yes.

190
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,480
What are you doing here?

191
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,480
Hurry and leave.

192
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
I'll leave too.

193
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
Yue Fei, don't get up.

194
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,480
I'll send you to mother.

195
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Don't move.

196
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
You'll leave.

197
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Xiaoyu, send mother back to the palace.

198
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

199
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
I'll take my leave.

200
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Your Majesty.

201
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Doctor Gong.

202
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,980
Your Majesty, today is a very special day.

203
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,480
I'm here to ask you.

204
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Yue Fei, you're so kind.

205
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,480
You've been in the palace for a long time.

206
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,280
You've always been loyal to the world.

207
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,280
Now that you're old,

208
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,280
you should go back and rest.

209
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,780
You should be loyal to the world.

210
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,780
Yue Fei, send Doctor Gong back to the palace.

211
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,780
Yes.

212
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,780
Your Majesty, please spare my life.

213
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,780
I'm just sending you to Jiang Nanyang.

214
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,780
Xia Cheng Jin?

215
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,280
I can't bear to see this.

216
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
Why are you lying?

217
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Am I lying?

218
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,780
I'm talking about your health.

219
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,780
You're not even close to me.

220
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,780
Mother, she's mistaken.

221
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,780
The doctor will also be mistaken.

222
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,780
The doctor's count is not all medical.

223
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,280
It's normal for the medicine to be treated.

224
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,280
You've made me so anxious.

225
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,280
I should thank you.

226
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,280
You and I are close friends.

227
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Your friend is my friend.

228
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
You don't need to say goodbye.

229
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Are we close friends or just a long time?

230
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,280
Your Majesty, you're so close.

231
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,280
You're so quiet, and you're not even close to me.

232
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,780
The grass and the snake are the same.

233
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:13,780
This is what I really want to say.

234
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,780
I've always been sincere to you.

235
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,780
I know nothing.

236
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:26,780
Why did you ask me to come here?

237
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,780
Because I want to be late.

238
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,780
Why did you vet this hair Of course you haven't.

239
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,780
Aunty Xin has died

240
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,780
What are you doing here now?

241
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,780
I want to see how do I look?

242
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,580
I came here for the elderly

243
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,780
Thank you for finding me.

244
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,680
The court sóscars should punish no one but music to Xiu p.

245
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,680
Follow orders from the court Couldn't help

246
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,440
Well.

247
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,460
Funny part

248
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,060
Miao umbrellas

249
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,680
The exed was captured

250
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,340
In lifespace

251
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,040
The court不到

252
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,040
It's a common thing to do.

253
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,640
Your Majesty, you're so bold.

254
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,240
That's just a miscarriage.

255
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,640
It's better if you're lucky.

256
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,040
Why don't you just do it again?

257
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
How dare you force me to do it?

258
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,640
I can't bear it.

259
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,640
Then I'll just stay here and stay in the Palace of Phoenix.

260
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,640
When will you be able to bear it?

261
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,440
When will I leave?

262
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,840
He kicked me.

263
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,940
I'm lucky. I'm not tired.

264
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,040
Your Majesty, please go back.

265
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,540
Your Majesty, you're a man of your word.

266
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,740
You can't be careless.

267
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,740
Okay. The day will come.

268
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,540
Consort Yue, rest in peace.

269
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,740
Indeed.

270
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,840
Looks like she's always been wearing a bright red uniform.

271
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,540
She must have known my identity long ago.

272
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,740
You bastard.

273
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,340
You're making my hand turn.

274
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,140
Consort Yue is pregnant.

275
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,340
If Huo Jin Heng has this kind of thing,

276
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,340
the situation will be dire.

277
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,340
Please make a decision earlier.

278
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,940
Du Tianzhao, Qing Ru's injury is already healed.

279
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,940
Tell me quickly what happened to my brother.

280
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,540
It's a game.

281
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,140
A game?

282
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,140
Game? Who?

283
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,140
My brother. He said it himself.

284
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,740
It's all my fault for being so impulsive.

285
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,940
Indeed. What kind of way is this?

286
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,740
Did His Majesty and Yue Chi have to be on the same page?

287
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,940
Yes. They were all wrong.

288
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,140
Why are you asking?

289
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,540
I was helping out.

290
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,740
Your Highness, Empress Dowager has ordered

291
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,140
that these tonics will be used for the whole stage.

292
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,540
So many.

293
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,340
So many.

294
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,740
Your Highness, if this is the original tonic,

295
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,940
it will be a big deal.

296
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,140
If this continues,

297
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:15,140
whether it's called death or blood,

298
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,540
isn't Empress Dowager really treating me?

299
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,940
Your Highness, the people from Shoukang Palace came to talk.

300
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,540
They must be able to eat all of them.

301
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,540
Oh, I see.

302
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,140
Shoukang Palace.

303
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,540
It's just right here. It's not as good as the door to Du San's house.

304
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,740
Actually, I have a request.

305
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,540
I hope Empress Dowager will be able to make it.

306
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,940
Today, I'm drinking to celebrate my birthday.

307
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,340
You're making everything up.

308
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,940
Guo Guo, hurry and pour the wine.

309
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,740
I'll be right back.

310
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,340
Wow, it's quite a poem.

311
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,440
Once you drink, the day will come.

312
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,340
Um...

313
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,540
Okay, you can drink this wine properly.

314
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,540
This is even happier than my drinking skill.

315
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,980
I... I...

316
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,860
I'm praising you. Why are you crying?

317
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,260
Empress Dowager, I...

318
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,860
I want to ask you a question.

319
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,580
Xiao Yue!

320
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,700
Your Highness!

321
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,940
Xiao Yue!

322
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,420
Your Highness!

323
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,260
Your Highness, I'm here. What's wrong?

324
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,500
Hurry and tell the six tools to help me get the carriage. I'm going to leave the palace.

325
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,220
Leave the palace?

326
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:09,860
Don't ask.

327
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,340
Okay, Your Highness.

328
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,500
Hurry.

329
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,100
I didn't drink much.

330
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,420
You're pregnant. You're really pregnant?

331
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,700
Drink it.

332
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,620
Get lost.

333
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,500
Did you know that long ago?

334
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,260
How could I know that you're pregnant?

335
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,060
I mean, you're an outsider.

336
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,220
You knew my identity from the beginning.

337
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,700
Do you have any idea?

338
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,220
The heavens and earth can be seen.

339
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,740
I really don't know about this.

340
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,420
Although I suspected his stubbornness before,

341
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,740
he didn't want to discuss it with me.

342
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,300
Never mind.

343
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,780
I asked for a decree to leave the palace.

344
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,180
I'm leaving the palace.

345
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,020
I won't come back.

346
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,580
How could that be?

347
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,540
Empress Dowager won't allow you to leave the palace.

348
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,020
What did you say?

349
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,020
I just want to...

350
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,700
I just want to...

351
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,100
Just want to...

352
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,980
Just want to remind my brother that I want to go home and say goodbye to him.

353
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,500
Just want to go home and say goodbye to him.

354
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,100
Say goodbye?

355
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,980
Okay.

356
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,500
Drink it.

357
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,740
Drink it up.

358
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,740
Okay?

359
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,900
Drink it.

360
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,940
The more you worship, the more you'll be late.

361
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,740
He?

362
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,140
worshiping his brother?

363
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,380
Okay.

364
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,780
Run, right?

365
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,580
Then I'll go with you.

366
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,140
You know everything?

367
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,540
I've confirmed it.

368
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,940
The news about the palace is indeed a good game.

369
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,980
It should be a good game.

370
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,380
But this is too ridiculous.

371
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,180
I'm afraid the emperor will think of something else.

372
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,180
Sister Qin'er.

373
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,180
Where are you going?

374
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,580
Yuechi can't go out of the palace.

375
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,780
I'll go and see.

376
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,380
Don't worry.

377
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,980
I finally got you out.

378
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,380
Don't let the snake in.

379
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,980
How about I go and see?

380
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,980
Brother.

381
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,180
This is not a big belly.

382
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,980
You're the big belly.

383
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,980
Go, go, go.

384
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,380
Go back to the manor.

385
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,180
I'll take you to the yellow belly.

386
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,180
Now?

387
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,180
Now.

388
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,180
Ling'er.

389
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,580
It's all packed.

390
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,980
Brother, don't worry.

391
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,180
Let me think about it.

392
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,180
What else can I expect?

393
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,180
The bed...

394
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,180
Commander.

395
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,580
Something bad happened.

396
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,380
The emperor brought a lot of soldiers.

397
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,580
Xu Fan and the spirit came here to knock on the door.

398
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,780
What?

399
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,140
Ai- 올리

400
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,940
Ai- 올리

401
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,980
Don't be rude.

402
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,220
I heard that Yufei

403
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,380
is miss the brother in his bachelor's degree.

404
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,380
He went out a few times.

405
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,380
I feel shaved.

406
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,740
So I decided to personally come and take care of Prince Anle's ceremony.

407
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,940
I thought it was a gift from heaven.

408
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,020
Oh no, the goods are only coming up.

409
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,020
What should we do?

410
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,580
You two be careful.

411
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,380
You're hanging up.

412
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,340
Don't stand there. Hang up.

413
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,820
Be careful. Be careful.

414
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,820
It's too expensive.

415
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,380
Are you dissatisfied with the flight?

416
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,380
It's okay.

417
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,380
I've arranged a party.

418
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,380
Party? Party?

419
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,380
I'll make sure the other brothers have a good time.

420
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,380
You're thoughtful.

421
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,380
I think it's almost done.

422
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,380
It's almost done.

423
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,380
I think it's very suitable.

424
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,380
It's so lively.

425
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,380
It's like the moon is in the human world.

426
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,380
Do you think so, Yue Fei?

427
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,380
Yes.

428
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,380
The King of the World

429
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,380
Episode 1

430
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,380
Don't think that I'm a good man.

431
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,380
I'm a good man.

432
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,380
I'm brave.

433
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,380
I can't control myself.

434
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,380
I need a partner.

435
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,380
I fight with the soldiers.

436
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,380
I'll protect the country for the rest of my life.

437
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,380
If you're still in the human world,

438
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:47,380
I'll be the right-hand man in the court.

439
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,380
Please leave.

440
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,380
Yue Fei is dead.

441
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,380
Yue Fei can be a man.

442
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,380
I'll ask Prime Minister for help.

443
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,380
If Prime Minister has the knowledge,

444
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,380
please grant my sincere heart.

445
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,380
Yue Fei, can you leave?

446
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,380
Don't be impulsive.

447
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,380
Brother, I miss you.

448
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,380
Come back and see me.

449
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,380
If there's no Yue Fei,

450
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,380
I'll go with you.

451
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:08,380
I don't know if you'll be lonely.

452
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,380
What are you doing?

453
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,380
I'm so happy.

454
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,380
I want to see him again.

455
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,380
I want to stay with him.

456
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,380
Calm down.

457
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,380
Calm down.

458
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,380
Calm down.

459
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,380
Leave.

460
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,380
I have something to tell Yue Fei.

461
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,380
You're not going to stay with him?

462
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,380
He's dead.

463
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,380
How is the court?

464
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,380
I'm the most late and the most family.

465
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,380
I have no choice.

466
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,380
It's fun if you keep pushing.

467
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,380
Is it fun?

468
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,380
You and my sister are so close.

469
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,380
I don't know.

470
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,380
For the sake of a dead man,

471
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,380
I've been a good man.

472
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,380
I'm grateful for your kindness.

473
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,380
But...

474
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,380
I think...

475
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,380
I just want to live a peaceful life.

476
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,380
I don't want to be a fool anymore.

477
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:05,380
I'll worry about you.

478
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,380
If I don't do something that will blow up my world,

479
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,380
you'll be şeyipered and you'll owe me.

480
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,380
As long as you love me.

481
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,380
You'll always love me.

482
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,380
I must leave it to the court country- Karl's share.

483
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,540
Then...

484
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,700
Let's go and check for this mask.

485
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,700
Go.

486
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,020
Its condition caused something poss oops coming.

487
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,140
Stop it.

488
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,860
Stop completely dethroning.

489
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,900
I will be with you

490
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,780
and protect you.

491
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,660
Who will be the leader?

492
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,300
Once you get to the throne,

493
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,100
do you know what you want to do?

494
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,300
Yes.

495
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,220
I have the freedom.

496
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,380
I want to leave the door to myself.

497
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,660
It was the most important part.

498
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,740
I was trapped here forever.

499
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,620
But, someone told me

500
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,820
to end my life for Langlang.

501
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,740
未安迎之万名

502
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,320
it surpass my USSR

503
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,660
with the rest of the world.

504
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,900
Are you worth it?

505
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,660
Yes.

506
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:56,540
My鉄塔 Garden

507
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,300

509
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,180
Why

510
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,540
OK

511
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,940
Hollywood

512
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,300

Nederlands

517
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,380
I was anxious.

518
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,380
What are you worried about?

519
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,380
You're afraid I'll be caught?

520
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,380
Yes.

521
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,380
I'm afraid they'll catch you.

522
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,380
I'm afraid they'll hurt you.

523
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,380
I'm afraid they'll kill you.

524
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,380
So, did Tang Luo really catch me?

525
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,380
I'll do anything to save you.

526
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,380
Qing, to me,

527
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,380
you're more important than anything else.

528
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,380
Maybe we can spend some ordinary days

529
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,380
leaving the capital and the places you've been looking for.

530
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,380
You've moved.

531
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,380
I haven't.

532
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,380
You still want to be a fire alarm?

533
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,380
Did you forget the one two years ago?

534
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,380
I didn't forget.

535
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,380
You were waiting on the way to the city.

536
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,380
So he's going to kill you.

537
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,380
Now he's here to use you to attack the imperial power.

538
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,380
If Chu Jing appeared again,

539
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,380
he'd still be...

540
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,380
Okay, Qing.

541
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,380
Wang Qin,

542
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,380
tomorrow morning,

543
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,380
I'll take you away.

544
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,380
Yue Chi,

545
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,380
don't let me down.

546
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,380
Leave me alone.

547
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,380
Brother,

548
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,380
have you already known?

549
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,380
If I didn't,

550
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,380
are you going to keep it from me?

551
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,380
I didn't mean that.

552
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,380
You and Huo Jing Heng

553
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,380
cheated me into the palace in a dream.

554
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,380
You took me to his place step by step.

555
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,380
What on earth do you know about me?

556
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,380
I...

557
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,380
Brother,

558
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,380
don't be angry.

559
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,380
Brother,

560
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,380
you asked yourself

561
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,380
if you really didn't want to be in the court.

562
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,380
You and Huo Jing Heng

563
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,380
moved to Rong Ying Academy together.

564
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,380
You were happy, right?

565
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,380
During that time,

566
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,380
your face

567
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,380
was covered in blood.

568
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,380
I was so angry.

569
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,380
During that time,

570
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,380
your face

571
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,380
was covered in blood.

572
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,380
But I haven't seen

573
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,380
such a smile

574
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,380
for a long time.

575
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,380
That's the original you.

576
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,380
You're so kind,

577
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,380
you're so energetic.

578
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,380
You've never changed.

579
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,380
What he wants

580
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,380
is not just me.

581
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,380
What he wants

582
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,380
is also my Qi Ling Jun.

583
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,380
Huang Quan is a hero.

584
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,380
He's a man who kills people.

585
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,380
I can't

586
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,380
kill everyone one more time.

587
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,380
Actually,

588
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,380
Huo Jing Heng

589
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,380
might be a good emperor.

590
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,380
You like him so much.

591
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,380
Then you stay.

592
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,380
I'll leave.

593
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,380
Brother,

594
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,380
actually, I came here today

595
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,380
to return this to you.

596
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,380
I'm sorry.

597
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,380
I, Ling Xun Jing,

598
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,380
will definitely be your father.

599
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,380
For the Lang Lang family,

600
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,380
I will always be

601
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,380
your father.

602
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,380
The one you forgot two years ago.

603
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,380
You were waiting on the road

604
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,380
on his way to the city.

605
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,380
So he wants to kill you.

606
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,380
I'll leave.

607
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,380
Wang,

608
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,380
maybe we can spend a happy life

609
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,380
and leave this place

610
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,380
where you've been.

611
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,380
Don't worry.

612
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,380
I'll let you live a peaceful life for two years.

613
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,380
I just don't want to force you

614
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,380
to do anything.

615
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,380
I just want to tell you

616
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,380
that as long as you're willing

617
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,380
to be the prime minister of the country,

618
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,380
I'll do anything for you.

619
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,380
I'll do anything for you.

620
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,380
I'll do anything for you.

621
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,380
I'll do anything for you.

622
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,380
I'll do anything for you.

623
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,380
As for the prime minister,

624
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,380
he'll always be the prime minister.

625
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,380
I'll do anything for you.
