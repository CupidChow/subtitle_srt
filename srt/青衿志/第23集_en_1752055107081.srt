1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If victory is not decided, let me fight

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The wind and moon are in the human world

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The youth is known as the old youth

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The past is the past, the past is the past

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
A sword flies after falling

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Spring breeze is like a leaf

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:12,680
The

8
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,500
From the fields to the table, green healthy

9
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Sis believing number forty-six

10
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Come on

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What number 46?

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Try it.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,400
Your Majesty, you may not know,

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,800
but the old general

15
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,400
has been raising everything here.

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,200
So,

17
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,000
it's named after Xiao Heng.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,400
Try it, Your Majesty.

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,800
How is it? Is it soft?

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,200
It tastes good today.

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,000
The chicken in the mountains

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,600
is really good for the body.

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Look at the grandpa.

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,000
Is he much better than

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
the previous two years?

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,200
Yes, indeed.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,800
Grandpa,

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,600
this time, it's really a big trouble.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,800
So,

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,600
I'm here to beg you.

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
What?

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,800
How dare you

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
take advantage of me?

34
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
I won't take advantage of you.

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Sit down.

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,600
I know I was wrong, grandpa.

37
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
But,

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,000
since the imperial army was transferred,

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,800
the people have been suffering a lot.

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
By then, the casualties

41
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,200
will be very heavy.

42
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,000
If you can come back,

43
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
you will definitely defeat the enemy.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,800
Don't waste your breath.

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,000
I've said it before.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,400
You are a man of the Jiangfu Manchu,

47
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
why do you have to be

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
an emperor?

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This time is good.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,200
You stay here

51
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
to keep grandpa company

52
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,600
and raise the money.

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,400
Come here.

54
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,600
Take this girl to the county.

56
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,000
Show her how to raise pigs.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,800
Come on.

58
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,600
Your Majesty, please.

59
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll teach you how to raise pigs.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,800
Come on.

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,600
Give me the money.

62
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I'll teach you how to raise pigs.

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,600
Give me the money.

64
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,400
Grandpa,

65
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,600
I still call you

66
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
General Du.

67
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,000
You were angry with me for not showing your ability.

68
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,000
You were angry with me for doing this.

69
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
But I didn't do anything else

70
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,200
just to make the world peaceful.

71
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,800
Now the enemy is coming.

72
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
For the people in the world,

73
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
for the public property

74
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,600
that I was born and died with.

75
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,800
I beg you to leave the mountain.

76
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,200
The old man

77
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,800
has grown up.

78
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,600
It seems that my daughter

79
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,200
has a good view of her son.

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,200
But

81
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,800
I won't let the soldiers out.

82
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,800
Miss.

83
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
You bastard.

84
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,200
How dare you

85
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
to clean up the house?

86
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,800
It's nothing.

87
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,200
Come on.

88
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,800
I'll do it.

89
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
What are you doing?

90
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,600
Let's go.

91
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,200
Let's go.

92
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Let's go.

93
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Let's go.

94
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Let's go.

95
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Let's go.

96
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Wait.

97
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Wait.

98
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,400
We're almost there.

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Go forward.

100
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Yes, Your Highness.

101
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,600
He is a traitor.

102
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,400
The evidence is here.

103
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,600
I will find him.

104
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Stop.

105
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Let them stop.

106
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,400
Go.

107
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,200
It seems that the Crown Prince doesn't trust me.

108
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Guo Jing Heng.

109
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,200
You take the position of northwestern army.

110
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Yue Chi.

111
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,400
I believed you.

112
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,600
But the princess told me.

113
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,800
You really plan to go to the east?

114
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Why not?

115
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,000
In the past, the famous general of the northwestern army

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,200
Du Lang

117
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,600
was hiding in Mount Fengmu.

118
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,800
He must have passed through this place.

119
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,600
That day, I heard Yue Chi

120
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,400
and a man talking in the army.

121
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,200
Do you think

122
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,400
the one who can come to Dali Army

123
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,600
and ask the old general to go out of the mountain

124
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
can also be the one?

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,200
He knows you best.

126
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,200
I can't help but to believe his words.

127
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,000
You let me down.

128
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Yue Chi.

129
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,200
Why can't we win?

130
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,000
We are the only ones.

131
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,200
The Crown Prince is thinking too much.

132
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,200
We are never the same.

133
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
I have my own people.

134
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Take them down.

135
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
It seems that I have nothing to do with Yue Chi.

136
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,600
Dad.

137
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,600
Go back.

138
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
I will go with you.

139
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
I will go with you.

140
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
I will go with you.

141
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
I will go with you.

142
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
I will go with you.

143
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
I will go with you.

144
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,400
It's not good to be a trap.

145
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,800
Prepare to welcome the guests.

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I will prepare.

147
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Officer Yue.

148
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,600
Do you want to do anything

149
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
to Yue Chi?

150
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,800
The Crown Prince will deal with it.

151
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,600
I will kill him.

152
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
You have nothing to say?

153
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,600
I will be a little regretful.

154
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
But

155
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,000
what do you want to hear?

156
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,400
I don't want to hear it from you.

157
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm sorry, Yue Chi.

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,400
Yue Yuan, I can't give you a gift.

159
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,200
I can only borrow one.

160
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,180
I'm not so these days I can't think about it

161
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,480
Don't screw around water

162
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
I'm sure.

163
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I'm sure.

164
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
I'm sure.

165
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
I'll be the horseman.

166
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,200
I have to walk the next path by myself.

167
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
You should go back.

168
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
How is that possible?

169
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
We're almost at the end.

170
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
I can't leave you and let you be in danger.

171
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Then the two of us are not in danger.

172
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Du Tianzhao.

173
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
I'm really grateful to you.

174
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
You've walked so far with me.

175
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
I'm Guo Jiu.

176
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
I'm here with Consort Yue.

177
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Who dares to do it?

178
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
It's enough.

179
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Enough.

180
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
I, Yue Ling'er,

181
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
will always remember it.

182
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
You're the one who saved me.

183
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
You saved me.

184
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
You saved me.

185
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
You saved me.

186
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
You saved me.

187
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
You saved me.

188
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
I'm sorry.

190
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Ling'er.

191
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
I've kept this in my heart for a long time.

192
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
I want to tell you today.

193
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Actually, I knew you didn't like me.

194
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,200
But even though I'm your friend,

195
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,200
I want to walk the hardest path with you.

196
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Not just for you,

197
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
but for myself.

198
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
For the people I love,

199
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
for the life I want,

200
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
I've tried my best.

201
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Du Tianzhao.

202
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Let's go.

203
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
It's still dark.

204
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Ling'er.

205
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
No one's here.

206
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
We don't know

207
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,200
what that Yue Chengxiao is.

208
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Who knows?

209
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
He's actually a spy.

210
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
It's good now.

211
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
You said we can't eat,

212
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
but we can't drink water.

213
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Let's go.

214
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Let's go to the fire room and eat something.

215
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Let's go.

216
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Let's go.

217
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Let's go.

218
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Let's go.

219
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Let's go.

220
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Your fragrance is really interesting.

221
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
It's really interesting.

222
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Of course.

223
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
I asked Yingwan to make it.

224
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
It's more interesting than other fragrances.

225
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Brother.

226
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Are you okay?

227
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Why are you so black?

228
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
And you're so thin.

229
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Don't worry about how we got here.

230
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
The soldiers outside have been cleared.

231
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
But it won't last long.

232
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
I'll get you out of here first.

233
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
How do I open this lock?

234
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
This is not an ordinary lock.

235
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
This should be the gun-shaped

236
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
cotton-tipped steel lock that was built in the Chinese war.

237
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
There must be a fire.

238
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
It also needs enough strength.

239
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Can you open it?

240
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Ling'er.

241
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Don't worry about me.

242
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
I can't open this lock.

243
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
I have to figure out a way

244
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
to send someone up the mountain

245
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
to the northwest to build a base.

246
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Tell Huo Jinghang that

247
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Li Jun has figured out our plan

248
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,540
without any

249
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Okay.

250
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I got it.

251
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
I'll go right now.

252
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Ling'er.

253
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
It's dangerous.

254
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
You have to be careful.

255
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Don't worry.

256
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
As long as I'm not broken,

257
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
I'll make sure that Ling'er is fine.

258
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Thank you.

259
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Thank you.

260
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Be careful on the road.

261
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Let's go, Ling'er.

262
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Princess.

263
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
We found a man and a woman outside the camp.

264
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
It's suspicious.

265
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Be careful.

266
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
This is very slippery.

267
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
I knew

268
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
that my brother and His Majesty

269
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
wouldn't just leave like that.

270
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
It's just that

271
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
they're hiding it from me again.

272
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
They're acting and playing the role.

273
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
They're hiding it from me too.

274
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
But

275
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
if you think about it carefully,

276
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
they

277
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
are not going to depend on us.

278
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Right?

279
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
It's mainly on you.

280
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
So we have to

281
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
move forward with more strength.

282
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Your sister Yunqing

283
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
is really a snake and a snake.

284
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
If you see her again next time,

285
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
you won't be soft-hearted, will you?

286
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
I'm not soft-hearted.

287
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
You...

288
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Let her go.

289
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Let go of her.

290
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Do you think

291
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
you two

292
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
can walk to the camp in the northwest?

293
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Without you,

294
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
I wouldn't have walked.

295
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Without me,

296
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
you wouldn't have walked out of this place.

297
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Can you get through this foggy forest?

298
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Let me go first.

299
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
I really don't know

300
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
why you're always targeting us.

301
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Are you

302
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
the one I know?

303
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I'll fight you!

304
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
This poisonous bug all over the forest

305
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
is more than I can handle.

306
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Brothers,

307
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
the four enemy forces have arrived.

308
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
They want to break through

309
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
our Fengming Mountain.

310
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Let's see

311
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
what it is like to set a tiger back to the mountain

312
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
and take them back to their hometown.

313
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Take them back to their hometown.

314
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
General,

315
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
a little cripple came.

316
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
He said he was a hundred thousand,

317
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
he said he was on fire.

318
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Premier Zuo?

319
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Tianzhao?

320
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
Father!

321
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
I miss you so much!

322
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,200
I've suffered a lot on this journey.

323
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Let go!

324
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Tell me what's wrong.

325
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Why are you crying?

326
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Get up!

327
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Yes, I have something to do.

328
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
A hundred thousand firecrackers.

329
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
What hundred thousand firecrackers?

330
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
What's wrong with him?

331
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Why is this newbie so crazy?

332
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
He thought he could get us down?

333
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Since they have changed their strategy,

334
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
we have to re-plan.

335
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Re-plan?

336
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Ling'er asked me to send a letter.

337
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
What?

338
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Ling'er?

339
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
Where is Ling'er?

340
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Jiang Yunqing took her away on the way.

341
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

342
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
If I had told you earlier,

343
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
would you have listened to me?

344
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Besides,

345
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Jiang Yunqing and Ling'er

346
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
are not in danger.

347
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Grandpa,

348
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
did you send the firecrackers?

349
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,840
German bacon

350
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
I'll fight you!

351
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,640
Yue Shang!

352
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,480
Did you see Ling Er?

353
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,360
Isn't Ling Er by your side?

354
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
She was taken away by Xue Jing Kuan, that poisonous woman.

355
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
What?

356
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,880
Wen Chao, hurry up.

357
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
This...

358
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Stop!

359
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Don't move.

360
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
I'll help you this time.

361
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,640
Hand Ling Er over.

362
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,640
You have to pretend to be me.

363
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Stop!

364
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Let Ling Er go!

365
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
I'll spare your life.

366
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,600
Don't you want Ling Er?

367
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I can give you my life.

368
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,640
Surrender.

369
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,120
Qing Er!

370
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,200
You always forget who I am.

371
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,480
But I always remember it.

372
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,640
No matter who you are,

373
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
our love was always true.

374
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,840
I used to think...

375
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,040
Ling Er and I are the biggest support in your long life.

376
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,760
I also thought that when I went to the battlefield,

377
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,240
the whole Yue family and Ling Er,

378
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,160
you were their biggest support.

379
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,080
Now,

380
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,040
you really don't care about Ling Er's life?

381
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,280
It's because of our friendship back then,

382
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,320
that I gave you a chance to choose.

383
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Ling Er's life is in your hands.

384
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
Think about it.

385
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,720
As long as you compromise,

386
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,560
and deliberately use the Crown Prince's identity as a bait,

387
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Ling Er will surely come back safely.

388
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,840
You'll not mat loud.

389
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
I'll count to six.

390
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,360
You give me one more chance.

391
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,520
Do it by yourself.

392
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,840
Ling Er!

393
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,840
Kill!

394
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,040
Stelle parse

395
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm all to blame

396
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,600
I hope Ling Er would be fine

397
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,160
I am such a useless

398
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,720
You, stop

399
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
You think you can save Ling'er

400
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
by being alone in Li State?

401
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
You are the emperor.

402
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
You are the king of our country.

403
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,600
The king of Li State is infiltrating the enemy state.

404
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
You came out of the state of peace

405
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
to provoke us.

406
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
You are a national funeral.

407
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
Do you know that

408
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
the emperor is not the one

409
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
who wants to cross this border.

410
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
It's me.

411
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Not the emperor,

412
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
but me, Huo Jing Heng.

413
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Two years ago,

414
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
I was in charge of the killing of the Qilin Army.

415
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
I knew it.

416
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
The responsibility on me

417
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
made me unable to be myself.

418
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Not to mention you.

419
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
Huo Jing Heng and the emperor

420
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
have been in the position since you ascended the throne.

421
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
They can never be separated.

422
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Go back.

423
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
Officer Xue won't kill Ling'er.

424
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
If you want to save Ling'er,

425
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
we have to think about it.

426
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Tomorrow morning,

427
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
gather the troops

428
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
and attack Lieguang.

429
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Yes.

430
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
You can put it on.

431
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Your clothes are dirty.

432
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
It's not comfortable to wear.

433
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Then eat something.

434
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
You can eat a piece of dessert.

435
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
You can go down first.

436
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Yes.

437
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Who are you going to show it to if you don't eat or drink?

438
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Who are you waiting for to torture?

439
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Huo Jing Heng?

440
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Didn't you see the sword we received?

441
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
If I hadn't protected you,

442
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
you would have been angry with me.

443
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,600
For a man who doesn't care about your life,

444
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
you went to the mountain and watered it.

445
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
You suffered so much.

446
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
Don't you understand?

447
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
He doesn't care about you at all.

448
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
He chose to win between you and the camp.

449
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
If I were him,

450
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
I would also choose to shoot the sword.

451
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
I would also choose to win.

452
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Because it's not just a win.

453
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
It represents the peace of the people of Daning.

454
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
And the integrity of the land of Daning.

455
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,600
He knows

456
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
I hope he can do that.

457
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
If he doesn't do that,

458
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
he will be sorry for the love of the people of Daning.

459
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
What about you?

460
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,600
I am also one of the people of Daning.

461
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
So crazy.

462
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
When he was in the palace,

463
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,600
did his eyes stay on you for a year?

464
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Even if he wanted to save you in an instant,

465
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
he was still looking for you all over the place.

466
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
You are hurt.

467
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Ling'er,

468
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
I did hurt you.

469
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
But I never thought of hurting you.

470
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
In the middle of life and death,

471
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
who is protecting you?

472
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
You really don't know.

473
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
It's okay if you don't eat.

474
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
I will let people clean up later.

475
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
You just follow me in the future.

476
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
I will see him again.

477
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Sister Qing'er,

478
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,600
you still think about me.

479
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Can't you think about your brother a little bit more?

480
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,600
You designed him over and over again.

481
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
You let him into danger.

482
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,600
You are so heartless to him.

483
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
You are innocent.

484
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,600
We are all in the play.

485
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
But you are innocent.

486
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
Sister Qing'er,

487
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,600
you have always taken care of me and helped me.

488
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
I am very grateful.

489
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
But this time,

490
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
I beg you,

491
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
beg you,

492
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
please help me.

493
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
Please.

494
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Can you stop for me?

495
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Okay, Ling'er.

496
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
I am sorry.

497
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
I have something I have to do.

498
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
I can't stop for anyone.

499
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
I will stop with any feelings.

500
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Ling Xia,

501
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
you have come a long way back.

502
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
You must be very safe.

503
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
I can't eat the chicken you cooked.

504
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
I really miss it.

505
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Two years ago,

506
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
grandpa was angry with you.

507
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,600
He wanted to stop bothering you from now on.

508
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
But you were so angry with him.

509
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
From now on,

510
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
it's none of your business.

511
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,600
You still hate me, don't you?

512
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
I know your thoughts.

513
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
How can I hate you?

514
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
Although grandpa has been on the mountain for years,

515
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
I have heard that you have managed the world well.

516
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
But the world

517
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
should be rejected by the people who have the virtue.

518
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
Grandpa just cares about you.

519
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
He cares about you.

520
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
And you

521
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,600
are more suitable for free and free life.

522
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
You are not the king.

523
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
In this life,

524
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,600
it's hard to be free and free.

525
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,600
I have failed your good intentions.

526
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Maybe you are destined to be a man of the world.

527
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Now,

528
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
you have a chance to help me.

529
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Alright.

530
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Let go of the bed.

531
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Grandpa will help you.

532
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
You mean

533
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
you are willing to go to the temple?

534
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
I won't go.

535
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
I can't go.

536
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
You know,

537
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,600
I am not as close as Fengming Mountain.

538
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
Besides,

539
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,600
do you need grandpa and the northwest army

540
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
to guard the border for you?

541
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,600
I am willing to lead the northwest army

542
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
to guard Fengming Mountain

543
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,600
and guard the border for you.

544
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
It's late.

545
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
Let's go.

546
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Take care.

547
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
His Majesty said

548
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,600
he was busy with the war and was not well.

549
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
He won't attend the morning court.

550
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
He is dismissed.

551
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Your Majesty,

552
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
they were dismissed according to your order.

553
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
They are so angry.

554
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
I see.

555
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
You lost Ling'er

556
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
after the battle.

557
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Say something.

558
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Call my Ling'er back.

559
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Call my Ling'er back.

560
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
Your Majesty.

561
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Your Majesty.

562
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,600
I will bring Ling'er back.

563
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Your Majesty.

564
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
I like you.

565
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
I like you.

566
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
Not only today,

567
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
I don't want to leave you.

568
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Every day after this,

569
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
I hope you can stay with me.

570
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Help me, accompany me.

571
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Not only the emperor,

572
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,600
but also the man in front of you.

573
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
Ling'er,

574
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
are you willing?

575
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
Wait for me here.

576
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Yes.

577
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Your Majesty.

578
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
I'm here.

579
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
I'm here.

580
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Your Majesty.

581
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
I'm here.

582
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
I'm here.

583
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
I'm here.

584
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
I'm here.

585
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
I'm here.

586
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
I'm here.

587
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
I'm here.

588
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
I'm here.

589
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
I'm here.

590
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
I'm here.

591
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
I'm here.

592
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
You're here.

593
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
I'm here.

594
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
I'm here.

595
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:11,600
I'm here 17 point screens time and a maximum wood to pay you right here.

596
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,600
I recommend you to take a look at

597
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,600
Men's empress.

598
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,360
I should have solved more problems.

599
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,720
But how did I solve this problem?

600
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,840
Have you ever thought about it?

601
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,480
You're living such a selfish life.

602
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,280
Of course.

603
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,360
Ling'er, would you like to drink with me

604
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,480
and go to the Wan Ting Mountain in the imperial garden to watch the sunset?

605
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,520
Today?

606
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,280
No. You, every day.

607
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,400
Who wants to go with you every day?

608
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

609
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,200
Go.

610
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,120
Bring me some water.

611
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,320
And bring me some mapo tofu.

612
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,440
You...

613
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,840
Go.

614
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

615
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,560
How could His Majesty do this?

616
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,280
His Majesty really misses Her Highness.

617
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,280
Let's go help him.

618
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,000
Although he's the emperor, he's also the husband of Consort Yue.

619
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,320
He wants to clean up the house and bring his wife back.

620
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,360
Stop.

621
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,400
One, quarter down.

622
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,840
Report.

623
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,880
제가 또klore Mister is apparently the Ju spiral.

624
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,840
His Majesty wants to fight with Consort Yue today.

625
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,000
Go meat it.

626
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,000
Due to Jiang啦 gifts,

627
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,200
I didn't expect that there is a hard fork in Mount Fengming.

628
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,800
This time they gathered their troops,

629
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,000
they must be alone.

630
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
They must have a backup.

631
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Your Majesty, the military is in danger.

632
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,800
The army of Li State and the Rebellion Committee are in contact.

633
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
The Crown Prince of Li State, Prince Lang, is also in danger.

634
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
The Queen is provoking, the military is being controlled.

635
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
But this time, they gathered their troops,

636
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,800
and the army is strong.

637
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,400
Even the old general's army of the northwest,

638
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,800
they can't defeat them.

639
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,400
Your Majesty, the two armies of Li State are in contact.

640
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,800
We have gathered all the troops we can gather.

641
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,600
I ask for your order. I am willing to lead the Qi Lin army personally,

642
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,800
to fight together with the Ning State's elite troops,

643
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,000
to defeat the Li State.

644
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,600
Your Majesty.

645
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,800
I don't agree.

646
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,600
If the Li State knows that our army and the previous dynasty's army are in contact,

647
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,400
the other states will think that our Great Ning has no base.

648
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,600
In the future, they will also become the laughing stock of others.

649
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,800
Even if the war is at its peak,

650
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,400
there is no way to use the national law.

651
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,000
The Qi Lin army is a rebel army.

652
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
If we rely too much, we will be defeated.

653
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
That's right, Your Majesty.

654
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,200
Your Majesty, you must not use the Qi Lin army.

655
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
Shut up.

656
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,600
You have one and you have one.

657
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,400
Who can do it?

658
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Why are you talking about the imperial edict?

659
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,000
Prime Minister Yue is against the imperial edict.

660
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
That is to lead the army to kill the enemy.

661
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,400
Whoever is talking nonsense,

662
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,800
just send me to the battlefield

663
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,600
to be a human-meat stew.

664
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,400
Tomorrow morning,

665
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,400
Prime Minister Yue will lead the Qi Lin army and the Great Ning army

666
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,800
to fight together.

667
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,800
I will obey your order.
