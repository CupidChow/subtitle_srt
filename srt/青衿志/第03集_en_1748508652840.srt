00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Please.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,300
instead of sending your message.

3
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,900
Episode 26

4
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,660
Your Majesty, I want to report something important.

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,680
His majesty.

6
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,880
As an old man,

7
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,360
most old people

8
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,600
sell lives for His majesty.

9
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,360
There's trouble for them...

10
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,800
And there's pain too.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,240
Well said, my lord.

12
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,320
Thank you for the hard work.

13
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,560
Come.

14
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,240
Please share jumps rejected box.

15
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,400
In fact, you used beer drink

16
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,880
to bring bad luck back to TV shows

17
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,240
and verschiedenen rivals.

18
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,040
I playing to China

19
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,800
and affected the す細級

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,960
So I don't스가

21
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,440
Worth it

22
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,080
for your hard work

23
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,360
and office jobs.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,040
You're behind myあOUGH

25
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,920
as your rent.

26
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,840
You become the harvester for your spare.

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,720
What?

28
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,720
I think that Yue Fei is just a little bit of a problem.

29
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,720
I remember that the Zheng family and the Yue family are a family of two.

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,720
Uncle is so angry.

31
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,720
Shouldn't it be that they are in love with Yue Fei?

32
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,720
It's all my fault.

33
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,720
I didn't expect that the left-wing lord of Tang Tang

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,720
is not close to the Zheng family.

35
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,720
It's just that they are in love.

36
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,720
If you don't like him, let him go out.

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,720
Who is asking for a favor?

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
Who wants to go out?

39
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
Mother.

40
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Sister.

41
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,720
I was just joking with the emperor.

42
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,720
I'm the first emperor to be in the imperial family.

43
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,720
I haven't thought about how to explain myself in a good youth.

44
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,720
Really?

45
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,720
Why is Lv Lv's marriage a family of two?

46
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,720
It's a marriage.

47
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,720
I'm the one who can't see the daughter of the emperor.

48
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
Really?

49
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Then the daughter of the emperor will be so upset with you.

50
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Your Majesty.

51
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,720
Use your heart to pay the price.

52
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Calm down.

53
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
Calm down.

54
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,720
Who is the one who came to take the dangerous thing?

55
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,720
He's dead.

56
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Who read it?

57
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,720
The father sent you to the Zheng family

58
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,720
just to practice your marriage.

59
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,720
I didn't expect that you are still this kind of person.

60
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Now you think you can't control yourself

61
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,720
when you are running around like a man?

62
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
I know.

63
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
Sister.

64
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
I'm not a good sister.

65
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,720
I can take my son as my son.

66
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,720
He's been beating me for half an hour.

67
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,720
He should be punished for me.

68
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Hurry up.

69
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,720
This is the reward for the emperor.

70
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
I can't bear it.

71
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,720
The harem has come.

72
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,720
Why don't...

73
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Your Majesty.

74
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,720
The Prime Minister is going to the Fengyang City.

75
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Yes.

76
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,720
The situation is going to be like this.

77
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
I have to rely on this thief to fool the emperor.

78
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
He's got some trouble.

79
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,720
It's been a while.

80
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,720
Why can't you see the oil?

81
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,720
His Majesty has been here to work.

82
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,720
The kitchen is all made according to His Majesty's taste.

83
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
His Majesty is a martial artist.

84
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
He is very confident.

85
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
He is a light.

86
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,720
He can do anything for me.

87
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Forget it.

88
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
Let's sit down and eat together.

89
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
No need.

90
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Your Majesty.

91
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,720
I'm a married woman.

92
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,720
I'm a thief in the kitchen.

93
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
I won't think about it with you.

94
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
I'm leaving.

95
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Where's my thief?

96
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Who stole my thief?

97
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Huo Jinghe is dead.

98
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
He is not a thief.

99
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
I haven't even been married before.

100
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
I can still starve to death.

101
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,720
He is so soft.

102
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,720
He is like a snowman when he was little.

103
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,720
He has been a ghost for years.

104
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Why is Du Tianzhao here?

105
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,720
You are Yue Fei?

106
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,720
I'm a noble person.

107
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,720
I'm afraid I'm not good at listening to me.

108
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,720
How can I remember that you are a little girl?

109
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,720
That's a child.

110
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
I'm not allowed to be a girl.

111
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,720
How can I remember that you are not allowed to be a girl?

112
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
I like it.

113
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
I can change at any time.

114
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,720
After the two families are married,

115
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
the night is dark.

116
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Why don't you and I go to the dorm?

117
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Go to the dorm?

118
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
I can't beat you to death.

119
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
Why should I go to the dorm?

120
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
You are wearing a dress.

121
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
You should think about it.

122
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Yue Fei.

123
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
I'm asking you.

124
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Tell me.

125
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
What are you doing here?

126
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
If you don't tell me,

127
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,720
I will tell you about it.

128
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,720
You...

129
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,220
Take the Puerto Rican,

130
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,720
and take the foreigner out.

131
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:58,020
Then,聯ub

132
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Not cool down.

133
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,520
right,

134
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,960
won'tating like the king capable of

135
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,760
getting you in darkness,

136
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,600
forcing to get you inside

137
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,140
is just nonsense.

138
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,600
Keep a close eye onass you have this so 준비

139
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,740
that'll make you feel

140
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,360
the public sound.

141
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,240
Yue,

142
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
please promise

143
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,180
we can make a deal

144
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,720
on coming to your place

145
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,680
and asos qualify you,

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,800
I can also take good care of

147
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,820
old Somewhere Inside and outside for you.

148
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,220
to keep her in a safe place.

149
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,620
She's a good person.

150
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,820
What about the conditions?

151
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,020
Your Highness.

152
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,420
This is going to be a disaster.

153
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,420
What kind of gold-globe is this?

154
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,420
It's so heavy.

155
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,420
What is the lesson?

156
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,820
The delivery man said

157
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,020
that once the door is opened,

158
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,220
he'll know everything.

159
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,220
Then you can leave first.

160
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,220
Your Highness.

161
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,620
Go.

162
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,620
The memorial.

163
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,820
This is my condition.

164
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,020
I won't say your identity,

165
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,820
I'll take care of you.

166
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,020
But,

167
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,220
it's a matter of my own good and evil.

168
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,420
I'll take care of you.

169
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,220
I'll ask you to lead the Prime Minister

170
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,620
to take care of the meat for me.

171
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,020
I'll take care of you.

172
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,620
I'll take care of you.

173
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,020
Are you okay?

174
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,420
Your Highness.

175
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,220
You know who's the bad guy.

176
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,620
The clothes are not wet.

177
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,820
Look behind you.

178
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,820
Your Highness.

179
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,020
You've been here many times.

180
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,220
The clothes are not wet.

181
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,820
What about the clothes?

182
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,820
Are they still wet?

183
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,820
You're so good.

184
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,820
You can go back now.

185
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,220
My lady.

186
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,820
It's raining last night.

187
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,020
It's time to make a move.

188
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,420
No.

189
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,420
The silver of the mansion

190
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,420
was taken by the Prime Minister to buy the military seal.

191
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,620
No money left.

192
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,220
When will the Prime Minister come back?

193
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,620
I want to ask you.

194
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,620
These days,

195
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,220
the sun is shining.

196
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,420
It's getting dark everywhere.

197
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,620
I almost even took off my head and the table.

198
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,620
But, I can't get close to the sun.

199
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,620
It's such a big mansion.

200
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,220
How can a big family

201
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,820
be able to get down?

202
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,020
Fortunately, the silver of the Emperor

203
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,420
was originally

204
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,220
made by the East Wall to make the West Wall.

205
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,220
I didn't expect that the East Wall is the Emperor.

206
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,820
The West Wall is still the Emperor.

207
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,620
The silver of the Emperor is given.

208
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,220
But, I can't stop him from

209
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,620
getting the military seal every day.

210
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,620
He's crying again.

211
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,420
Let's see what it's called.

212
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,020
The Four Seasons' Revenge.

213
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,220
Ling Ermu Huang.

214
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,220
The soldiers are coming.

215
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,420
You're here.

216
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,620
You are...

217
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,220
Look carefully.

218
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,620
Is there something familiar?

219
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,020
Have you seen it before?

220
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,020
Brother Qian Zhao.

221
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,620
Ling Er, don't run.

222
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,220
I've promised you that I won't tell you.

223
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,220
Really?

224
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,020
The most fragrant rose-flavored sweet potato

225
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,420
is sold once a month.

226
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,620
I can't even get a brand.

227
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,220
Put it down.

228
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,620
Have a taste.

229
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,820
Yuechi is my brother.

230
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,420
My brother is my business.

231
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,620
Your brother told me

232
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,020
that you'll stay in my house for a few days

233
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,420
and wait for your brother to leave the palace.

234
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,220
To your house?

235
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,820
Yes.

236
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,020
You can go back and look for something to eat

237
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,620
and even if you know me,

238
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,220
I'll give you the garden.

239
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,220
No, I'm not going to go back.

240
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,220
No money?

241
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,420
No money.

242
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,220
Fine.

243
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,820
I'll go to all the houses.

244
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,220
All the houses?

245
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,620
Come here.

246
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,220
Miss.

247
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,420
It's okay.

248
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,420
No money.

249
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,020
Someone is going to take care of us.

250
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,420
That's great.

251
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,420
Thank you, sir.

252
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,420
No, no, no.

253
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,620
No, no.

254
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,220
That's great.

255
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,020
Thank you, sir.

256
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,500
Delicious.

257
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,420
Giving out Buddhists Base.

258
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,620
Meizhang.

259
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,660
Sinceь you're here,

260
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,020
Why aren't you here?

261
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,620
I'm at home.

262
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,620
But it's issues of their kind in home.

263
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,500
How is it?

264
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,820
Your Majesty,

265
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,940
the situation is quite serious.

266
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,940
Okay, go and have a look.

267
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,340
Yue Fei.

268
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,780
Yue Fei.

269
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,980
Your Highness.

270
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,620
Even the court has been busy recently.

271
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,220
And the night is still long.

272
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,180
How could you do that?

273
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,580
Your Majesty,

274
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,860
Consort Yue is sick all day.

275
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,980
She can't take care of herself.

276
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,700
I don't know what you're looking at.

277
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,140
You may leave.

278
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,660
Okay, Your Majesty.

279
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,180
It seems that my uncle

280
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,380
finally got back to his position.

281
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,820
Your Majesty.

282
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,220
Okay.

283
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,540
Let's go.

284
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:46,460
What's in

285
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,500
this instant drink.

286
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,540
The one...

287
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,980
Come on.

288
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,980
Drink some water.

289
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,980
Drink some water.

290
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,980
Drink some water.

291
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,980
This...

292
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,980
The food in the mansion

293
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,980
made you hungry.

294
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,980
The mansion is special.

295
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,980
It's not a common thing.

296
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,980
There are many restaurants

297
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,980
that are served with food.

298
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,980
But they are not enough.

299
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,980
So I can only

300
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,980
eat less.

301
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,980
I can't eat more.

302
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,980
What else do you want to eat?

303
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,980
I want to eat...

304
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,980
I want to eat

305
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,980
the most expensive food in the building.

306
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,980
There are the steamed buns of the boy's hometown.

307
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,980
There are the fried golden flower cakes of the east side.

308
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,980
There are the lamb in the north side.

309
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,980
And that...

310
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,980
That...

311
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,980
I...

312
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,980
I haven't finished talking.

313
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,980
I have to go to the court.

314
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,980
Du Tianzhang.

315
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,980
Du Tianzhang.

316
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,980
The steamed buns of the boy's hometown.

317
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,980
The fried golden flower cakes of the east side.

318
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,980
The...

319
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,980
What else have you eaten?

320
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,980
Why are there so many things in the phoenix?

321
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,980
Sit down.

322
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,980
His Majesty wants to see you.

323
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,980
I really want to understand.

324
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,980
There are foxes and ears.

325
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,980
They are not enough.

326
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,980
What do you mean?

327
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,980
I don't understand.

328
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,980
Recently,

329
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,980
the discount is not bad.

330
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,980
It's a good thing for the court.

331
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,980
I don't feel bad

332
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,980
about what I did to His Majesty.

333
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,980
I just got the emperor's army.

334
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,980
Recently, there are many troubles

335
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,980
that the emperor has been trying.

336
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,980
I think I should go to the court.

337
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,980
I have something to do with this.

338
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,980
The phoenix of the left side.

339
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,980
Is it a little less?

340
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,980
How much more?

341
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,980
I have to go to the court

342
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,980
to investigate the matter.

343
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,980
I'm going to the court.

344
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,980
You are so stubborn.

345
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,980
Wait for me to go out.

346
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,980
I will make you a full-fledged horse.

347
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,980
His Majesty is here.

348
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,980
I welcome you.

349
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,980
Big brother.

350
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,980
Recently, the weather is cold.

351
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,980
Why agree to make a shot?

352
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,980
His Majesty is here to witness his greatness.

353
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,980
It's quick landing.

354
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,380
Effectively, his majesty doesn't have a different position,

355
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,620
which is again in his dominaria.

356
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,140
However,

357
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,500
there must be someurties.

358
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,540
his majesty is not that protective of Chen Qian.

359
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,740
This way, there is this Reaper.

360
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,580
Maybe,

361
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,380
do you have aתom what he likes to discuss?

362
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,500
Yi Zihong can't meet up with us.

363
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,000
Mingmao smiling all the time.

364
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm sure he's worried about eating and sleeping.

365
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Your Highness, the door is closed.

366
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Prince Anle moved in.

367
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
He moved in?

368
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The King of Qi Ling is not a bad person.

369
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
He's not bad, right?

370
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Your Highness.

371
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Wait for me here.

372
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'll take care of him.

373
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'll be the one to take care of him.

374
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Episode 1

375
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Why are you eating both of them?

376
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
My job is a sour honey fairy.

377
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You're so...

378
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Brother Qian Zhao, you're much cooler than my brother.

379
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You're buying both of them for me.

380
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You're so...

381
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Prince Anle, the more you eat, the more bitter you'll be.

382
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Which one of these two do I eat?

383
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Which one is better?

384
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Du Tian Zhao.

385
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You're so gentle.

386
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You're my sister.

387
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Du Gu Xing,

388
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
do you care about the secret investigation of Du Tian Zhao?

389
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Especially Ling'er.

390
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
He's a good person.

391
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You're so kind.

392
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You're so kind.

393
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm not that kind.

394
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You don't need to worry.

395
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm not.

396
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You're just kind.

397
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You're just kind.

398
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You're just kind.

399
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You're just kind.

400
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You're just kind.

401
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You're just kind.

402
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You're just kind.

403
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Who are you?

404
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Move.

405
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Follow me.

406
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yue'er.

407
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Yuezhi.

408
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
It's been two years.

409
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
Yes.

410
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,800
It's been two years.

411
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Sister Qing'er,

412
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
Yijun has been breaking through the court for several times.

413
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,200
The court is in a big mess.

414
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,600
Brother, you can't go back to the palace.

415
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
You're the princess.

416
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,200
Do you have a way?

417
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,800
Think of a way, okay?

418
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,600
Ling'er,

419
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,400
Qing'er can't do this.

420
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,000
Neither can you and I.

421
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
The emperor is in the palace.

422
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,000
Princess Changping is in the palace.

423
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,200
She's just a girl.

424
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,000
She's dressed up as a guard.

425
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,000
She's a good girl.

426
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,400
She's married to Yuezhi.

427
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,800
She's got a wife.

428
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
She's got a day off.

429
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,800
She's got a son.

430
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Prime Minister,

431
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,800
the emperor sent us to send a message to you.

432
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,600
Since you're married,

433
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,400
Yue's family is the royal family.

434
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,800
You're going to be in the palace with the princess soon.

435
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,600
I hope you can come back.

436
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Yuezhi,

437
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
this is a promise.

438
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
It's not a family.

439
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's a promise.

440
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
You're born.

441
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,200
I'll be with you.

442
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
You do it.

443
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,400
I'll take you out of the palace.

444
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,600
No matter if it's Ling'er or Qingtan,

445
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,600
as long as I'm a princess,

446
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,200
no one can hurt her.

447
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,200
The emperor is in the palace.

448
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,800
The banquet is closed.

449
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,200
Qing'er.

450
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,800
Prime Minister Yue,

451
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,600
as long as you're willing to surrender,

452
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,000
I'll re-establish the capital.

453
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,600
I'll still save you.

454
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,200
You can't fight in vain.

455
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,800
You can't retreat.

456
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,400
Prime Minister,

457
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,000
know the palace.

458
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Brother.

459
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,400
I escaped.

460
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,200
Qing'er.

461
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,000
When the emperor was shot,

462
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,400
the palace...

463
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,800
I escaped.

464
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,600
Qing'er.

465
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,600
When the emperor was shot,

466
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
the palace...

467
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,000
was closed.

468
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,000
Sister Qing'er left me today.

469
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,800
She was...

470
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
17 years old.

471
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,600
Brother.

472
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
What should I do?

473
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,800
Ling'er escaped that year.

474
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,800
I was seriously injured.

475
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
When I was learning the ritual,

476
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,200
you were all gone.

477
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,800
I thought you were already...

478
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,600
I was surrounded by several soldiers.

479
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,200
It was not easy to escape.

480
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,200
But I heard the others say

481
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,200
you died in the big world.

482
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,800
I was killed in the big world.

483
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,800
I've been trying to protect you.

484
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,000
I couldn't bear it.

485
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,400
I heard Ling'er was killed in the palace.

486
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,000
I wanted to save her.

487
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
But who knew

488
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
what happened?

489
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
Your Majesty.

490
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,800
The female assassin who killed you

491
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
is here again.

492
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,400
Didn't I tell you to send her to the finals?

493
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Why are you back so soon?

494
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,400
She ran away when she left the imperial city.

495
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,000
She was really upset.

496
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
It's just that she was very strange.

497
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,200
She didn't come back to the palace this time.

498
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,400
She went down the palace.

499
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,400
The guards were chasing her.

500
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,400
They seemed to see her going to the northwest.

501
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Northwest?

502
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,000
Did she enter the Feng Lan Palace?

503
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,800
Go to Feng Lan Palace.

504
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,000
Send her down.

505
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,400
No one can enter except the pillow.

506
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,800
The assassin is here.

507
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,800
She still remembers the moon.

508
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,200
Nonsense.

509
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,800
You're a prime minister.

510
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,200
How can you be so hard on her?

511
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,200
You're the only one who has a dog.

512
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,200
The prime minister is ahead of you.

513
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,000
And it's just a matter of time.

514
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
That's not possible.

515
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,000
Ling'er can be entrusted to her.

516
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,000
Come with me.

517
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,400
You can't stay here.

518
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
You can leave the imperial city with my identity.

519
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Where can you go?

520
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,800
Could it be that you want to kill the world?

521
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,000
She killed Huo Jinghe.

522
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
I can't do it myself.

523
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,600
But we can do it together.

524
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Qing'er.

525
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,000
As a princess, you have the right to live.

526
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,800
But how can you kill her?

527
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,400
When the world is in chaos, people will be in trouble.

528
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
How can we fight alone?

529
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,000
Could it be that Huo Jinghe

530
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,400
is the one who killed the devil?

531
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
Who do you want to kill?

532
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,400
My father, my brother, uncle and uncle.

533
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,600
At least I'm from Jiang family.

534
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,000
Not her.

535
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,000
What do you want to use?

536
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,400
How many people are hurt?

537
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,600
How many blood and tears?

538
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,200
How many people are killed?

539
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,600
How long is the chaos?

540
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
You're a princess.

541
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,000
Maybe I can't stand on your feet forever.

542
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
But I can't agree with you.

543
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,000
I won't help you.

544
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Yuchi.

545
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,600
I'm in the front court.

546
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
I'm not a official.

547
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,800
I'm not a official who can be trusted by others.

548
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,800
Because the peace is right,

549
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,200
it's not a chaos.

550
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,000
If the world can live a peaceful life,

551
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,000
I'll be a good person to thousands of people.

552
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,200
It's not that I'm a spy, Huo Jinghe.

553
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,600
I've been suspicious of him since I joined the palace.

554
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,800
He's kind, kind, and gentle.

555
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,000
He's a wise man.

556
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
To me,

557
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,200
as long as he's a wise man,

558
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,600
whether he's Huo Jinghe or not,

559
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,800
it's all different.

560
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,800
Who's that?

561
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,000
Me.

562
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,800
Wait a minute, Your Majesty.

563
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,800
I'm not asking for your permission.

564
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,600
Why didn't you come out to pick me up?

565
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
I'm busy.

566
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,800
Do you need help?

567
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,600
If you don't come out,

568
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
I'll go in.

569
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,200
Is Your Majesty really that anxious?

570
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,800
Are you sure?

571
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Except for Your Majesty,

572
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
I'm afraid no one dares to hurt me.

573
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,200
I'm afraid no one dares to hurt me.

574
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,200
I'm afraid no one dares to hurt me.

575
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,200
I'm afraid no one dares to hurt me.

576
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,200
I've prepared some fresh toys.

577
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
I'm going to give them to Your Majesty.

578
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
I know that you've hidden some good things.

579
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,000
But at that time...

580
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,200
It seems for the trigger in the front court

581
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
that the sooner one its thread is.

582
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
The sooner one is the Higher one's thread,

583
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,600
the less松 us幹嘛.

584
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,600
Yong放身後你帶了咋所及的誘說.

585
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,600
I've become more and more Jasperous about this.

586
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,800
All of you,

587
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,800
have been chose by Mei Zhenglong

588
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
for the sake of making a mistake.

589
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,600
And should I be the tidak...

590
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,600
be the echo kind?

591
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,200
Many people ask me

592
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Why are you here?

593
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Your Majesty, you forgot that you were here a few days ago.

594
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Really?

595
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Of course.

596
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
I don't like to be on the bed at night.

597
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
You've seen it.

598
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Didn't you tell me personally that the harem is not allowed to be under the rule of the imperial court?

599
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Your Majesty's words are really scary.

600
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,200
I've been looking at the memorials since a long time ago.

601
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
I'm curious.

602
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,200
When I was organizing the ceremony, I was blinded by the cold.

603
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,200
Your Majesty, you want to punish me for being so busy?

604
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
Yes.

605
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,200
The Yue family is in the harem.

606
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
They put you in the harem.

607
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
They've wronged you.

608
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
You can just watch.

609
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
It's good to let the consort be married.

610
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
What a pity.

611
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,200
I can't see any interesting things in the harem.

612
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,200
But I found some interesting things in the harem.

613
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,200
Why don't you go with me to see it?

614
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
Okay.

615
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Wait.

616
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
You...

617
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,200
You can't let the little private delivery man come.

618
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
You have to let the Prime Minister come to visit.

619
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
He's in the harem of the ghost.

620
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
It's not too late.

621
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Can you help me?

622
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
What's this?

623
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,200
How can a dead person be a little familiar?

624
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
I think I've seen it in your palace before.

625
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,200
What's wrong?

626
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
I've seen it in your palace.

627
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,200
It's not the one that was in a meeting with you before.

628
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Princess Qian Chao, Jiang Yun Jing.

629
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Get up.

630
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Put him in your mansion for me.

631
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
Take good care of him.

632
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
I'm the Prime Minister of Jin.

633
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
You arranged a Princess Qian Chao for me.

634
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
What's this?

635
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
If you say so,

636
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
you can't be so stubborn to be the Prime Minister.

637
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
You can't be so stubborn to be the Prime Minister.

638
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
I can't say that.

639
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Then what should I say?

640
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
We've already made a deal.

641
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,200
You protect my life for me.

642
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
I'll protect your life for you.

643
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
We'll do the same thing as each other.

644
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
We'll do as the husband and wife agree.

645
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
We have to believe each other.

646
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
What do you mean?

647
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
I'm not your wife.

648
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
I'm not the Prime Minister.

649
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
I'm not the Prime Minister who discusses with you.

650
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
You sent people to the Moon Manor

651
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
to investigate Ling'er's news.

652
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
I've been here for a long time.

653
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
You're in a hurry to set up a meeting

654
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
and to create a chance.

655
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
You're lucky to know Ling'er.

656
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
You don't know her.

657
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
I thought you were a criminal.

658
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
I...

659
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
What do you mean?

660
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
We're in a good relationship

661
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
and we're not in a bad relationship.

662
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,200
That's the best.

663
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Otherwise, if you break up with her,

664
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,200
this plan will be in Ling'er's hands.

665
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Let her see clearly

666
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
your face.

667
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Your face.

668
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Take good care of her.

669
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
I haven't answered yet.

670
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
You're so annoying.

671
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
You're making me a cow.

672
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
You're so heavy.

673
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
You're so cowardly.

674
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
What's this?

675
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
You're so stubborn.

676
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
You're my most famous ghost.

677
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
You're so stubborn.

678
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,200
You're so stubborn.

679
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Why are you following me?

680
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,200
Let me go.

681
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
If you see me when you go out,

682
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
I'll be mad.

683
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Okay.

684
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Stop it.

685
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
Stop it.

686
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,200
Ling'er, run.

687
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,200
This woman is crazy.

688
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Ling'er.

689
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
It's nothing.

690
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
What's wrong?

691
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
Sister Qing'er.

692
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
I miss you so much.

693
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Okay.

694
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Okay.

695
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Is it really you?

696
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
Silly girl.

697
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Why are you crying?

698
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
We meet

699
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,200
until we're happy.

700
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Okay.

701
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
Ling'er, your brother is still in the palace.

702
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
I'm going to save him.

703
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Sister Qing'er.

704
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
You're so stubborn.

705
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
You're so stubborn.

706
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
You're so stubborn.

707
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
You're so stubborn.

708
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
You're so stubborn.

709
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
You're so stubborn.

710
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
You're so stubborn.

711
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,200
You're so stubborn.

712
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
We haven't seen each other for so long.

713
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,200
Look.

714
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
You're so thin.

715
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
How about

716
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,200
we eat something delicious

717
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
and have a good sleep?

718
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
When will I

719
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
have the time to eat and sleep?

720
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
What are you doing?

721
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
The white cat is singing in the shade of the moon.

722
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
The dark night is long.

723
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
No one can write it down.

724
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
They all want to see the wind.

725
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Love is a dream.

726
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Black time, rain, light, and storm.

727
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
The wind is hot and cold.

728
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,200
I can't help but miss you.

729
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,200
Who wrote the wind and the snow?

730
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
The wind and the snow are all in the wind.

731
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
The snow is all in my heart.

732
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
I can't help but fall asleep.

733
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,200
When is my life going to end?

734
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,200
The world is full of snow.

735
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
My life is gone.

736
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
The moon is finally coming.

737
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
No one can write it down.

738
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Love is a dream.

739
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Black time, rain, light, and storm.

740
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
They all want to see the wind.

741
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
The wind and the snow are all in the wind.

742
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
They all want to see the wind.
