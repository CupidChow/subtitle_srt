The Long Ballad

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Consort Yue, please forgive me.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
His Majesty is really not here.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Then where is he?

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
He is...

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He flipped the consorts' name cards today.

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He must be in Yanning Palace.

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yanning?

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't talk nonsense.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't have anyone in Yanning Palace.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Then... then...

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He must have gone to find Zhao Jieyu.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Where is Zhao Jieyu?

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Why are you all here?

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why are you all here?

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's just catch him.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Shh.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Your Majesty!

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I know you are in there.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If you have the ability, just hide from me forever.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't see me for the rest of your life.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Xiao Yue, let's go.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He's really not here.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He's not here.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This doesn't look like a loss of honor.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It looks like His Majesty did something wrong.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He wouldn't dare to touch me.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This man is not a good person.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's go.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What's wrong?

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Your Majesty, I really can't do this job anymore.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Thank you, Eunuch Gui.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This month is a new year.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Your Majesty, the moon is out of the palace.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Should we stop it?

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let him go.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Wei Zheng, follow him.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't let him find out.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's so troublesome.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Just catch him.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll go.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Your Majesty, I'll go.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's so troublesome.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Just catch him.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What else do you have in mind besides catching and killing?

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm very annoyed right now.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Don't let me give you a treat.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Go.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Today, I'm reading the name of the Duke of Yanning.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's not appropriate to not go.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
No need.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm not going. You go and talk.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You...

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It seems that no one will find out.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Go.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Go.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm going.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You go first.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm going.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Go.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Go.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Go.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Go.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Go.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Go.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Go.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Go.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Go.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Why?

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So...

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Revenge and assassination of Huo Jing Heng are just excuses.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Understanding and supporting me to become the right-hand man of the State of Ning is also an excuse.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Being careless and showing off your identity is also an excuse.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What about Xiao Shuo?

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Xiao Shuo isn't.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Xiao Shuo's back is really just an accident.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So the rest...

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
is all true?

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You said that he's a ruler worthy of being followed.

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I also want to see if it's true.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The delicate flesh of the snow white,

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
the yellow and clear blood yellow,

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
is therefore called the golden and silver flower.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
My family has always loved this dish.

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You don't know how to play chess, do you?

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
A stubborn bull and a stubborn donkey.

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
One is sick and wants to go home.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
One doesn't want to see you.

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I don't believe that I can't cure you.

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Brother.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Brother.

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Come out.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's play.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Sister Xinru.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Ling'er.

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Ling'er doesn't know anything. Let her go.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Your Highness!

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Ling'er!

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Ling'er!

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll go find His Majesty.

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Ling'er.

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Ling'er.

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Ling'er.

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Ling'er.

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Ling'er.

107
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Ling'er.

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Sister Xinru, what's wrong?

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Why did I hurt you?

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Did something happen between you two?

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You wanted to leave the palace of Dark Saga by holding me back, didn't you?

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Do you want to escape?

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Your identity is known to the world?

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's right.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
If your identity is known to the world,

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I will definitely stand by your side.

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What?

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Sister Xinru, tell me.

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm so anxious.

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're too noisy.

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So,

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
what I guessed was right?

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Nothing is right.

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I caught you

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
to threaten Yuchi.

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Threaten?

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I just didn't expect that

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
you would come to me when I wanted to escape.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Why?

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
There's no reason.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Sister Xinru, tell me, okay?

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I know the answer.

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
There's no answer.

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's the end of the month.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Okay.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
If you want to escape,

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll protect you from the city.

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Episode 2

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't you think you're too cruel to Ling'er?

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Her identity is special.

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
If you were cold to her,

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
how could she stand in the harem?

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Your Majesty,

144
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Consort Hui said that tonight,

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
she will be organizing the account books in the harem with Consort Yue.

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Zhao Jieyu said that she will be

147
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
dressing up as one with the Empress Dowager.

148
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Xia Meiren said that she will be

149
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
discussing the matter of the wedding dance.

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Other judges said that

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
her mind was not too much

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and she had a cold.

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
No one came to serve her today.

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Leave.

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Did you hear that?

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
She is more confused than you.

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's not the reason for you to be cold to her.

158
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
They say that a child is not worth a child.

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
How can you involve her in her brother's matter?

160
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,680
Don't look at your old

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're like this.

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I think you're coveting Consort Yue.

163
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Maybe it's true.

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Maybe.

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I know.

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I shouldn't have thought that way

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
about the Empress Dowager.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But you two are not fake.

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And I do have feelings.

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What feelings?

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I feel that

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Ling'er has liked me

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
since I was a child.

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You must have felt it wrong.

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
How is that possible?

176
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm the only man who received

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Ling'er's money.

178
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Except for her brother.

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I also received Ling'er's money.

180
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Did I say anything?

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
No.

182
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You're the Imperial Uncle.

183
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Ling'er is the Consort.

184
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You two can't be together.

185
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Stop thinking.

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
She's not the Consort.

187
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I can also not be the Imperial Uncle.

188
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We two are more happy

189
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
than anything in the world.

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We don't care about

191
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
favor, favor, favor,

192
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and the wealth of the imperial family.

193
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Really?

194
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Do you still care about your head?

195
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Your Majesty.

196
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Your Majesty, bad news.

197
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Her Highness was kidnapped out of the palace.

198
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The Imperial Family

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Episode 2

200
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What's wrong with Jiang Yunqing?

201
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Which path is he taking?

202
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If I knew he was like this,

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I would have thrown him in Dali Temple.

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Ling'er doesn't have to suffer this.

205
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Their friendship is deep.

206
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We can't understand it.

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's his kindness.

208
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
He's kind and kind.

209
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It must be Yuechi and Jiang Yunqing.

210
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Aren't you anxious?

211
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I am.

212
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But I believe that

213
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Ling'er can protect herself.

214
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Okay.

215
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Search separately.

216
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
After finding her,

217
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
we'll go to the end of the world.

218
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Go.

219
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Go.

220
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Now, the ancient bed is noisy.

221
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But the music hasn't been played.

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The music is coming.

223
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Sister.

224
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Sister Qi'er.

225
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What's wrong with you?

226
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm fine.

227
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Are you feeling unwell?

228
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You're sweating a lot.

229
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Water.

230
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Okay.

231
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Sister Qi'er.

232
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Sister Qi'er.

233
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Open the door, Sister Qi'er.

234
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Open the door, Sister Qi'er.

235
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm worried about your health.

236
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Shut up.

237
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I can't die.

238
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Sister Qi'er.

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay.

240
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You can rest for a while.

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Tell me.

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What do you want to do?

243
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The one who knows must die.

244
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't believe you can kill me.

245
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
My identity has been exposed.

246
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yue Zhi was killed by Fengming.

247
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You thought I would let you go?

248
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
How could it be?

249
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
My brother will never hurt you.

250
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Then I don't regret it.

251
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's good if you kill me.

252
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yue Zhi chose her.

253
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Don't be in my way.

254
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Actually...

255
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Actually, I don't want to kill him.

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Otherwise, you would have done it long ago.

257
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You thought I didn't want to?

258
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But I don't have a chance to have him.

259
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Actually,

260
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
if I were like your brother,

261
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I would pretend to be a concubine

262
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and stay with him.

263
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You can't pretend to be a concubine.

264
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Because he can't be with you now.

265
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I don't want to kill him.

266
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Because he can't be with you now.

267
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yue Zhi is so difficult.

268
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I don't want to kill him.

269
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I just don't want my brother to be famous.

270
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I hope my brother can go back to where he should be.

271
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes.

272
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You are a new person.

273
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You are a hero.

274
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm just a foreign country.

275
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But Ling,

276
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
you know what?

277
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The two generations of Yue family's military officials

278
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
used to be the phoenixes of the Jiang family.

279
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
They are so glorious.

280
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
They are so beautiful.

281
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
They are so beautiful.

282
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Ling.

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The military is as deep as the sea.

284
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You know this.

285
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm fine.

286
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Sister Qing.

287
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Sister Qing.

288
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You have to promise me.

289
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Sister Qing.

290
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Sister Qing.

291
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Xue Jingguan.

292
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Master.

293
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The master is coming to us.

294
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Let's go.

295
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Let the princess persuade the rest.

296
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yue Zhi.

297
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yue Zhi.

298
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yue Zhi.

299
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yue Zhi.

300
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Okay. No one will blame you.

301
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,500
I won't blame you either.

302
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,000
Sister Qing'er, drink some medicine.

303
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You'll get better soon.

304
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay.

305
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Sister Qing'er, no one will blame you.

306
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,000
I will protect you.

307
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I will protect you.

308
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Sister Qing'er, are you feeling better?

309
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
My soul is still here.

310
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I won't leave.

311
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Not you.

312
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Even if I have to leave, I have to protect you from the outside world.

313
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Then I'll leave.

314
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Sister Qing'er, I'm sorry.

315
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Sister Qing'er.

318
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
How is it?

319
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Your Majesty, I didn't protect Consort Yue well. Please punish me.

320
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It has nothing to do with you. If you really do it,

321
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Ling'er might be in danger.

322
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Where is she now?

323
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Not far ahead.

324
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Let the fireworks go. Inform the Prime Minister.

325
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yes.

326
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Take me to find her.

327
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I...

328
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I can't.

329
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I can't go down.

330
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What are you doing?

331
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Sister Qing'er.

332
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Qing'er, I saw a bug in your hand.

333
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'll help you get the bug out of your body.

334
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Ling'er.

335
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Brother.

336
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
How can you hurt Ling'er?

337
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
If you want to hurt me, don't hurt her.

338
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Sister Qing'er has let me go.

339
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm not afraid of you.

340
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Don't hurt her.

341
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Sister Qing'er has let me go.

342
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm the one who should stay.

343
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Come back with me.

344
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm here.

345
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
No one will hurt you.

346
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm not going back.

347
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Ling'er, don't wait for me.

348
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yuchi.

349
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Brother.

350
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What do you want to do to Sister Qing'er?

351
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Tell me first.

352
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Shut up.

353
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Qing'er, what's wrong with you?

354
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Prepare a horse for me.

355
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Or you and Ling'er will be on the way to the netherworld.

356
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You want to go to Li City?

357
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Qing'er, no matter what Yi Qingyun promised you,

358
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
don't believe him.

359
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
He's a man of many tricks.

360
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
He's the best at playing with people.

361
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
He will only use you.

362
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I can't go back.

363
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
He will kill you.

364
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yi Qingyun?

365
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You can't go with him.

366
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Brother.

367
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What happened between us?

368
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Ling'er.

369
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You can't handle this.

370
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yes.

371
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I can't handle it.

372
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Everything that happened between you

373
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
is so hidden.

374
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Sister Qing'er.

375
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I want to protect you.

376
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Just like you protected me.

377
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
If you have to choose,

378
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
stand by my side.

379
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Let me protect you.

380
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Sister Qing'er.

381
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'll go after her.

382
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Ling'er.

383
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Are you okay?

384
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Sister Qing'er.

385
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm fine.

386
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Let's go.

387
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,760
There's a

388
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,000
Wan Zeyun over there.

389
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You go first.

390
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Someone is watching.

391
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
What about you?

392
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I'll take care of them first.

393
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
No.

394
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It's dangerous.

395
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'll be with you.

396
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You can't do anything.

397
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
If you stay,

398
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
it will harm you.

399
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I'll go with you.

400
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I'll go with you.

401
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I'll go with you.

402
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'll go with you.

403
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I'll go with you.

404
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I'll go with you.

405
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
If you stay,

406
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
it will harm you.

407
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Then

408
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
you'll come back,

409
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
right?

410
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Go.

411
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I can't leave with you.

412
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Sister Qing'er.

413
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Ling'er.

414
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Goodbye.

415
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm sorry.

416
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm sorry.

417
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm sorry.

418
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm sorry.

419
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm sorry.

420
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm sorry.

421
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm sorry.

422
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm sorry.

423
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm sorry.

424
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm sorry.

425
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm sorry.

426
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I'm sorry.

427
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm sorry.

428
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm sorry.

429
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm sorry.

430
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I'm sorry.

431
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm sorry.

432
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm sorry.

433
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm sorry.

434
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm sorry.

435
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm sorry.

436
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm sorry.

437
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I'm sorry.

438
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm sorry.

439
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm sorry.

440
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm sorry.

441
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm sorry.

442
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm sorry.

443
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Zhe'er.

444
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Zhe'er?

445
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Zhe'er.

446
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,340
Go with me.

447
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm waiting for you

448
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm willing to wander around for love

449
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Miss, is this your mother?

450
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Someone came to pick you up

451
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Do you want to get in the car?

452
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Wait for me

453
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
There's another person

454
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Another person?

455
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I thought you were the only one

456
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Whether it's my daughter or someone else

457
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
As long as I'm still a princess

458
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm sure you can get her

459
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Yanzhi

460
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm leaving

461
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Jing'er

462
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You will come, right?

463
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Mother

464
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Jing'er

465
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Step aside

466
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I can't go back

467
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Jing'er

468
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Trust me

469
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yanzhi

470
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
No

471
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Prime Minister Ye

472
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I hope you will

473
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
live in love

474
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
We will only be here

475
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Impossible

476
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Impossible

477
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You are my wife

478
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
No

479
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I never am

480
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I knew who you were

481
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So

482
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Don't take this escape route

483
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
As long as you are willing to stop

484
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Everything will be accepted

485
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You won't be threatened

486
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You won't be terrified

487
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Don't go to the abyss

488
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Go home

489
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Go home

490
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Go home

491
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Jing'er

492
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Jing'er

493
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
He betrayed you

494
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Right?

495
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You are looking at me

496
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Will you hurt him?

497
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Brother

498
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I won't let you hurt him

499
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Every year, Huang Chengguo

500
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
died many people

501
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Even the pool in the garden

502
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
can't be filled

503
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I am the one he saved with his life

504
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And

505
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
When Jing'er got a fever

506
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I was there

507
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
When Jing'er got a fever

508
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
The more I

509
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
ate

510
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
the more I

511
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
ate

512
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
ate

513
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
He ate

514
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
because of your name

515
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Jing'er

516
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Jing'er

517
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Xiao Yue

518
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I am a little tired

519
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I want to rest

520
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You help me send His Majesty and brother back

521
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yes, Niuniu

522
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Look, Jing'er

523
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Look

524
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
The little brain is here

525
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Lin Hai, don't worry

526
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It's useless

527
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Jiang Yuxing as a princess

528
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
has his own task

529
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and his own way to go

530
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
People can only be together

531
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
and can't be together

532
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
But even if

533
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
the goal is different

534
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
But the feelings we had

535
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
can be real

536
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
What?

537
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
You have a pimple on your face?

538
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
It's just

539
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
It's not like what you said

540
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Then I can't

541
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
be heartless

542
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Actually, these days

543
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I have been thinking about the whole thing

544
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Since that day

545
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
We locked His Majesty and brother together

546
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Why did it suddenly become like that?

547
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Then

548
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
My green card was also withdrawn

549
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But you and His Majesty rushed to me in the middle of the night

550
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
to save me

551
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Then

552
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I saw that they were in a good relationship

553
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It means they didn't fight

554
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Maybe they just pretended to fight

555
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
to lure someone out

556
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And the person who wanted to escape the imperial city

557
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
was Qing'er

558
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It means

559
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It means that the one who has a problem

560
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
is Qing'er

561
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Anyway, this princess

562
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I already knew that she was not a good person

563
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
At that time, Yuechi

564
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
insisted on my saving her

565
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
About Jiang Yunqing

566
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
To be fair

567
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Huo Jianheng is the most unlucky

568
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
She has been assassinated

569
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But the one who assassinated her was the former princess

570
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Just like that

571
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
She has been begging for your brother and sister

572
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
and has given up

573
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Then I

574
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Did I do something wrong?

575
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You did something wrong

576
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You should leave the right and wrong to the outsiders

577
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
to judge

578
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Anyway, you are always right in my eyes

579
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Thank you

580
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Brother Tianzhao

581
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Look at this

582
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I made it

583
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Has the emperor come today?

584
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
There are many things to do in the court

585
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
The emperor will come when he is free

586
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Can you win?

587
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Of course

588
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Why are you here?

589
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Of course I am here to make money

590
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
You ran away last time

591
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
You didn't win

592
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Then, do you want to play together?

593
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Of course

594
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I saw the precious things that your father gave you today

595
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Okay

596
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I'm afraid you can't win

597
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Let's go

598
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yue Fei is upset recently

599
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You can go with her

600
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Why doesn't the emperor go by himself?

601
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Is it inconvenient?

602
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Yue Fei is not upset now

603
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
How can the emperor go?

604
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It's Xia Mei who knows me

605
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Then

606
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I'll trouble you

607
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I beg you

608
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Please keep it a secret

609
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm sorry

610
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm sorry

611
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm sorry

612
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I'm sorry

613
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm sorry

614
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I'm sorry

615
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I'm sorry

616
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I'm sorry

617
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I'm sorry

618
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm sorry

619
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm sorry

620
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I'm sorry

621
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm sorry

622
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I'm sorry

623
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I'm sorry

624
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I'm sorry

625
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I'm sorry

626
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm sorry

627
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I'm sorry

628
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm sorry

629
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm sorry

630
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I'm sorry

631
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'm sorry

632
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I'm sorry

633
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm sorry

634
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm sorry

635
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm sorry

636
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I'm sorry
