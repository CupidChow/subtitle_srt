00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,520
I always feel that Huo Jianhang's words are a bit strange.

3
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
He said it on purpose.

4
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,560
Does he already know what it is?

5
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,200
When did he find out?

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
Ling'er and Xuanjing are just a coincidence.

7
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
Xiaoyue,

8
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
go and see if the food is ready.

9
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes, Your Highness.

10
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,000
Ling'er.

11
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
Come, be careful.

12
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,000
Is it going well?

13
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
It's going well.

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
The carriage is coming.

15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
It's you, brother.

16
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Why are you looking for me?

17
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,400
I just want to ask you.

18
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,000
Do you still want to wait for the empress?

19
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,800
If you have feelings for someone,

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,800
and don't want to go to the palace,

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,200
tell me earlier.

22
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,800
I want to know your plan.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,400
Who can I have feelings for?

24
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,400
You've been in the mansion for days.

25
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,400
You don't have feelings for Du Tianzhao.

26
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Feelings?

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Of course not.

28
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,200
Really?

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Of course.

30
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,600
What do you think of Huo Jianhang?

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Your Majesty.

32
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,400
Your Majesty,

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,600
he is a famous man in the world.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
He is a good man,

35
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
a wise man,

36
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
a kind man,

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,000
a kind man,

38
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,600
and a very good man.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,800
How do you think of him?

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,800
You are so good to him.

41
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
That's it.

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,000
You are very kind to him.

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,600
I don't mind changing back.

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
What?

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,600
From now on,

46
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,400
Huo Jianhang and you will be in good terms.

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
So soon?

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Are you going to leave the palace?

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,600
Are you willing to?

50
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
I am.

51
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,800
But I think

52
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,400
it's not enough time to change.

53
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,000
It's not too late.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's not too late.

55
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,200
I can do everything I can.

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,400
You can do the rest

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,800
by yourself.

58
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,400
It's all here.

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
You can prepare the book.

60
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
The Japanese poem of Huo Gou?

61
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
This poem

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,800
is the first time I have written

63
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
the details of Huo Jianhang

64
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,200
and his life in the palace.

65
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,600
You can memorize it.

66
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
I will not tell you.

67
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
You are so smart.

68
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,400
You are so smart.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,600
If you really leave,

70
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,400
what can I do?

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,200
You are so smart.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,800
You can do a good job

73
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,400
in the next ten days.

74
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,600
Otherwise,

75
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,200
you will be like him.

76
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,800
You will be like water.

77
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
You can save him

78
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,600
and destroy him.

79
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
But this person

80
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,600
is not a person.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He is so dark.

82
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,200
You are familiar with him?

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
No.

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,200
I don't remember.

85
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
I think it's

86
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,400
the time of the young.

87
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,400
But I saw the Japanese poem of Huo Gou.

88
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,800
I can't figure it out.

89
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Stop.

90
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,400
Prepare the book.

91
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,600
Prepare the things tonight.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,400
Tonight?

93
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,200
Yue Fei.

94
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

95
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,200
Sit.

96
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,400
Well,

97
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,800
thank you for your hard work.

98
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,600
Let's check the books tonight.

99
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,600
The number of people

100
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,200
who have been together for so many days

101
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,800
suddenly changed.

102
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,000
They are not

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
in the same position.

104
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
What a ghost.

105
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
What should I do?

106
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
You see,

107
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
this book is so hard to read.

108
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
It's hard to read.

109
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
It's hard to read.

110
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
It's hard to read.

111
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
My brother is ready.

112
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
He is ready.

113
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
He is ready.

114
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
What should I do?

115
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Give it to me.

116
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
I want to read it.

117
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Why are these two people

118
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
so hard to read?

119
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
They are not good at making details.

120
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I'm afraid they have been in contact

121
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
with each other for a long time.

122
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
They will be free from the night.

123
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
They will leave tomorrow.

124
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
The goods are badly damaged.

125
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
The wind will cause pain.

126
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
I will keep it warm.

127
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
He is light and light.

128
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
He doesn't like heavy goods.

129
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
He is not good at making details.

130
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
He is not good at making details.

131
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
This army of people

132
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
can be separated from each other.

133
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
The world is in a state of

134
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
lack of wealth and ambition.

135
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
However,

136
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
the army of people

137
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
is the most precious.

138
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Brother,

139
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
you can leave now.

140
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,600
I have been prepared.

141
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
But there are still many memorials.

142
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
How can I do it alone?

143
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Brother,

144
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
I know you are the best to me.

145
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Please help me.

146
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
My Lin'er is good at doing things.

147
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
You don't have to help me.

148
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
But...

149
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Lin'er,

150
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
you don't have anything

151
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
to tell me?

152
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
I am your brother.

153
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
No.

154
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
The emperor is here.

155
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
I am here to see you.

156
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Consort Yue,

157
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
the garden of jade flowers.

158
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Brother, listen to me.

159
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
I am here again.

160
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
I am nervous when I hear it.

161
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
If I go out like this,

162
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
I will be in trouble.

163
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
But I will be in trouble.

164
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
But I will be in trouble.

165
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
I am afraid that

166
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
I will be in trouble.

167
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
If I go out,

168
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
I will not make trouble for you.

169
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Go.

170
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I have seen you.

171
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Do you think

172
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
I am Consort Yue?

173
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
The emperor thinks you are Consort Yue.

174
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
You are Consort Yue.

175
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Huo Jinghe is really a good girl.

176
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
I hope he can help me.

177
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
All right.

178
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
You are tired from coming and going.

179
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
You can rest here.

180
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
All right, Your Highness.

181
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Brother is really leaving.

182
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
You should think of a way.

183
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
You should think of a way.

184
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
I have thought about it.

185
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
He is thinking about you.

186
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
He will take pictures of the memorials.

187
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
As for who will be the first one to come,

188
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I have no difference.

189
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Anyway,

190
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Consort Yue is in the palace.

191
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Look at what you are saying.

192
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
You are so stupid.

193
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
You want to break the bridge?

194
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Consort Yue is so wise.

195
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
She will be angry

196
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
if she doesn't come back.

197
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
I can do this myself.

198
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
This thing has already been changed.

199
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Can it really today?

200
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
There are only two opposite-dies.

201
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
The two same Me��owniş family comes.

202
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
Be quiet.

203
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
I am afraid that there will be a difícil on the integrated building.

204
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Your Majesty.

205
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
We don't care about your health.

206
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
But we have a good sąun makeover,

207
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
it isaire to be out of this palace.

208
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
in the future.

209
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,600
Isn't it a human's will?

210
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,920
Then you should help me.

211
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,280
Think about it.

212
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
How good he is to you.

213
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,760
How convenient it is to play the game of game.

214
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,080
Although it's a bit troublesome to keep people.

215
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,960
But once you succeed,

216
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,600
you won't be in trouble.

217
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,280
I'm not.

218
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,080
I'm thinking about it.

219
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,280
You promised me.

220
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,760
But there's one more thing.

221
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,160
You must promise me.

222
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,840
Don't come here tonight.

223
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
I'm not better than you.

224
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,520
I have to do it.

225
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,680
The first time I saw you last night.

226
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,760
You made me so angry.

227
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,280
Angry?

228
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,600
I'm so angry.

229
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,340
Granduncle, if you come back now.

230
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,600
Where are you going?

231
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,560
A room key for Empress Dowager's relics.

232
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,060
Lesson has passed.

233
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,000
How come they look so lost?

234
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,440
Let's walk first.

235
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:53,060
The junt Memorial Daarboc allowed the

236
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,060
Calm down.

237
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,820
Are there any beautiful people

238
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,500
that you're close to?

239
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,580
Sister,

240
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,020
you said it easily.

241
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,260
Is it possible for a person to be so heartless?

242
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,300
If you say it again,

243
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,460
even if I'm looking for it,

244
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,140
it's mine.

245
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,980
If I have feelings for God,

246
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,540
I will live my life

247
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,740
with no feelings.

248
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,700
I will live my life with no feelings.

249
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,020
Who do I love?

250
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,700
Episode 18

251
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,060
What nonsense are you talking about?

252
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,060
I think you've cleaned up.

253
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,260
You should be more sober.

254
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,660
Who said that a person is so easy to find?

255
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,700
Heng'er

256
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,820
also found Yue Fei

257
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,660
after playing the role of a light for many years.

258
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,060
There's always a day

259
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,580
when you can find

260
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,180
the person you are.

261
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,260
My person is all stolen by him.

262
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,700
Sister.

263
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,540
Brother.

264
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,340
You left for the evening.

265
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,460
Is there an urgent office?

266
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,700
To prepare the night work

267
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,140
before the ENI's announcement is held later.

268
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:04,580
No need.

269
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,580
We've tried for a long time.

270
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,620
Anyway, you had to fix the presentation

271
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,580
carefully

272
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,700
to avoid having it re-rolled.

273
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,700
You've already fixed the plan.

274
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,380
What plan?

275
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,060
Meanwhile, some some sedatives charge with alive water.

276
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,060
The body then entirely head in the compromised zone in the Waterless Cave.

277
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,260
So deep into the lake, the seal haveurpens in the dung,

278
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,140
which I wears to drink the water from oat.

279
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,060
Oh...

280
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,080
So like that...?

281
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,340
Which is why I think if I should investigate into the case?

282
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,620
Ask Universal Li.

283
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,880
Main Meer Dong Yun.

284
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,900
Let's investigate into it.

285
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,700
Whom I am thinking that makes the most of Jasu manual of our민 is Timurin Meir.

286
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,360
Ok

287
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,420
So many flowers

288
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,420
Right

289
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,520
Goldenيم flowers

290
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,020
Iiss you your majesty

291
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,100
Your majesty

292
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,840
Those flowers

293
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,800
Since own there inside yu hu

294
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,660
Cigzą could from love

295
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,160
They might give you that.

296
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,540
Don't be.

297
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,060
That's too un associative.

298
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,180
It's pretty good for me.

299
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,520
As for Yue Fei,

300
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,860
don't need to fold it.

301
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,460
They're not good-looking,

302
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,660
they might-

303
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Why don't you just stop?

304
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,660
There's no need to go.

305
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,660
Ling is really giving Huo Jinghang a telegram.

306
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,660
You all can leave.

307
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,660
Yes.

308
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,660
Your Majesty, you're going to stay here for a long time?

309
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,660
I'm not as good as I was before.

310
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,660
I'm just a little bit too much.

311
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,660
I don't want to be apart from you.

312
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,660
Huo Jinghang is a good man.

313
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,660
What on earth do you want?

314
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,660
I'm just thinking about the beauty of the zhezi.

315
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,660
Jingye, I don't want to see the zhezi.

316
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,660
I don't want to see the wild boar.

317
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,660
Your Majesty, you've been in the court lately.

318
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,660
Is there anything else you want to do?

319
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,660
You can just take your time and rest.

320
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,660
Didn't you have the chance to be a witness before?

321
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,660
Jingye, are you going to let it go?

322
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,660
I have a thousand miles to attend to the zhezi.

323
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,660
I'm so grateful to you for your kindness.

324
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,660
Good.

325
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,660
These are the difficulties I've encountered in the court.

326
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,660
I've made a conclusion.

327
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,660
Why don't you come and talk to me?

328
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,660
This is the first one.

329
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,660
What do you want to say?

330
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,660
Shut up.

331
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,660
Your Majesty, it's time to go to bed.

332
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,660
Your Majesty.

333
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660
Have your time.

334
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,660
Your Majesty.

335
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660
Get off.

336
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,660
Your Majesty, don't you have to go to the court at this hour?

337
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,660
The morning is cold.

338
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,660
I said I'd come back to get my clothes on.

339
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:41,660
I don't know where I'm going to go if I'm in such a hurry to leave.

340
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,660
I'm not here to see you.

341
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,660
I'm here to see you.

342
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,660
If I can see your back more, that would be great.

343
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,660
Even so,

344
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,660
I'm not too reckless.

345
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,660
If you really can leave, you'll be hurt.

346
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,660
Did I miss a place to stay?

347
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,660
Your Majesty is right.

348
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,660
If you're willing to stay, you can go back to work.

349
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,660
You'll have more to do on your way back.

350
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,660
I'm not here to wait for you to protect your beloved consort.

351
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,660
Yes!

352
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,660
Go.

353
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,660
Hmm?

354
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
Brother.

355
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,660
You're so optimistic.

356
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,660
You don't want to enter the palace at all.

357
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,660
You don't want to marry Huo Qian Heng, do you?

358
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,660
Brother.

359
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,660
Actually,

360
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,660
I didn't think about it.

361
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,660
At first, I was so angry that I agreed.

362
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,660
Later, I came out with His Majesty

363
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,660
and realized that I was not a good person.

364
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,660
I was so angry that I didn't want to marry him.

365
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,660
I was so angry that I agreed.

366
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,660
Later, I came out with His Majesty

367
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,660
and realized that I was not a good person to him.

368
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,660
I'm sorry.

369
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,660
I don't want to marry him.

370
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,660
You're so disappointed.

371
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,660
Ling Yue, what's wrong with you?

372
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,660
Why don't you tell me directly?

373
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,660
To me, Ling Yue's feelings are the most important.

374
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,660
But if you have a little bit of a reason to marry him,

375
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,660
Ling Yue can't marry him.

376
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,660
No matter how old he is, we don't care about him.

377
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,660
Brother.

378
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,660
Isn't your sister tolerant?

379
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,660
Since that, then change the plan.

380
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,660
I will arrange for you to leave the palace first.

381
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,660
I will take you safely and safely.

382
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,660
I will take the opportunity to leave in the next round.

383
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,660
I can't afford to leave the Huo Jin行.

384
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,660
What's wrong again?

385
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,660
I think so.

386
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,660
Let's discuss it.

387
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,660
Pay more attention and make more time.

388
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,660
Hurry up and pack up.

389
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,660
Just leave in a moment.

390
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,660
So many people?

391
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,660
There are so many guards coming in and out.

392
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,660
Why can't they leave?

393
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,660
Fortunately, the guards are here.

394
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,660
I can't run anymore.

395
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,660
I have no idea what the Huo Jin行 can do.

396
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,660
Only that one.

397
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,660
I can only take the chance to escape.

398
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,660
Why does he have a bad feeling?

399
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,660
I've been carrying a lot of things.

400
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,660
I'm a good person.

401
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,660
I'm a good person.

402
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,660
Since I entered the palace, I've been dreaming of your love.

403
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,660
I'm so happy.

404
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,660
I don't dare to be a favor to you.

405
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,660
I want to send a message to the royal court

406
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,660
in March.

407
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,660
I want to invite you to visit the palace.

408
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,660
I want to invite you to visit the palace.

409
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,660
May you be blessed.

410
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,660
You're so stubborn.

411
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,660
Sister Hui Fei.

412
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,660
Yue Fei and the Empress Dowager

413
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,660
have gone to the palace.

414
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,660
They've asked us to meet them

415
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,660
and have a chance to meet His Majesty.

416
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,660
Isn't that a good thing?

417
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,660
What do you know?

418
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,660
He's a traitor.

419
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,660
He's now favored by the imperial court.

420
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,660
He's now favored by the imperial court.

421
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,660
The palace concubines say he's a good man.

422
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,660
If His Majesty is in a hurry

423
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,660
and he's in a hurry,

424
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,660
what will you do?

425
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,660
It's him.

426
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,660
Yue Fei is special.

427
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,660
I'm lying to him.

428
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,660
What's the name?

429
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,660
The red flower.

430
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,660
The red flower?

431
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,660
You've been a worker.

432
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,660
Tell me.

433
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,660
What's so good about staying here?

434
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,660
The royal consort is the best.

435
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,660
No matter how rich and noble she is,

436
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,660
she's a family member.

437
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,660
She's just a deaf and deaf bird.

438
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,660
She's a deaf fish.

439
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,660
How can she be free and free?

440
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,660
I'm not doing anything for her.

441
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,660
Why can't she fly?

442
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,660
Who are you talking about?

443
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,660
Who?

444
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,660
Ling'er.

445
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,660
Yes.

446
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,660
What's your relationship with her?

447
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,660
What's your relationship with me?

448
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,660
You like her.

449
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,660
Let me go.

450
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,660
I warn you.

451
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,660
Stay away from her.

452
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,660
Ling'er and Yue Chi are close to the royal consort.

453
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,660
You shouldn't leave.

454
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,660
What's wrong?

455
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,660
It's dangerous.

456
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,660
What's dangerous?

457
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,660
They'll be safe if they leave the palace.

458
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,660
You're a woman.

459
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,660
Commander, you can't leave.

460
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,660
Let go of me.

461
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,660
They're all on my neck.

462
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,660
Let me go.

463
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,660
Where's the koong?

464
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,660
Commander, you're a secret agent.

465
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,660
Secret agent?

466
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,660
Come on.

467
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,660
The new advisor is here.

468
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,660
The most noble and noble.

469
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,660
The queen of the palace.

470
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,660
Look.

471
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,660
The palace is full of flowers.

472
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,660
Yes.

473
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,660
Xia Yu.

474
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,660
Xia Yu.

475
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,660
Have you prepared everything?

476
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,660
Don't worry.

477
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,660
I forgot.

478
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,660
Be careful.

479
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,660
Be careful of the dress.

480
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,660
Be careful.

481
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,660
It's good.

482
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,660
I want to see if the dress is gone.

483
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,660
Can't they keep an eye on it?

484
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,660
Consort Yue is here.

485
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,660
Consort Yue.

486
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,660
Why are you leaving so early?

487
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,660
Greetings to Your Majesty.

488
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,660
Greetings to the Empress Dowager.

489
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:30,660
I'm here to see the beauty of the sisters.

490
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,660
I'm ashamed to see the beauty of the sisters.

491
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,660
You're leaving now.

492
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,660
You're not wasting your time.

493
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,660
Consort Yue is not only good at making money.

494
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,660
She's also a man.

495
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,660
You're right.

496
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,660
Such a fearless and powerful woman.

497
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,660
She's wearing the late night dress.

498
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,660
She looks like a man.

499
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,660
All right.

500
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,660
Don't be so impulsive.

501
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,660
Before the banquet,

502
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,660
a group of women are talking nonsense.

503
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,660
Is this the process of the beauty of the sisters?

504
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,660
Let's change to a big dress.

505
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,660
Consort Yue.

506
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,660
You're dressed up today.

507
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,660
It's so disgusting.

508
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,660
It's so fragrant.

509
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,660
Start.

510
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,660
When did we meet?

511
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,660
I want to hug her.

512
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,660
It's funny.

513
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,660
All right, Muluang.

514
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,660
Stop it, start.

515
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,660
You must put the help on here.

516
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,660
Look at me later.

517
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,660
I think you should do something.

518
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:03,660
General Du Gu, did brother say where he would go after he left the palace?

519
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,660
I didn't say.

520
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,660
Then didn't you ask him?

521
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,660
I did. I don't need to ask.

522
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,660
I think brother and the emperor must have some misunderstandings.

523
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,660
He doesn't want to leave.

524
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,660
How about we leave?

525
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,660
Miss, if you say so, I'll send someone to send you back.

526
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,660
Sibitang.

527
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,660
Noble Lady Lan, Shenhua.

528
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,660
I thank the emperor.

529
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
I also have a sword.

530
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,660
Do you want to fight with the emperor?

531
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,660
I'll save one more.

532
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,660
Save one more.

533
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,660
The concubine will be sent to the palace.

534
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,660
Sibitang.

535
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,660
Sibitang.

536
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,660
But I haven't talked yet.

537
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,660
Your Majesty.

538
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,660
Sibitang.

539
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,660
Sibitang.

540
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,660
Sibitang?

541
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,660
Only Sibitang is really a country.

542
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,660
Your Majesty has already made a plan.

543
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,660
Your Majesty.

544
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,660
I also have a plan.

545
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,660
Your Majesty must be interested.

546
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,660
You want to perform too?

547
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,660
What?

548
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,660
Is it the best to take the Yangtze River?

549
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,660
It's not.

550
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,660
Wait a minute.

551
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,660
This is the best.

552
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,660
This is the secret of our Yue family.

553
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,660
It's called the reverse-reverse.

554
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,660
Reverse-reverse?

555
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,660
How to say it?

556
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,660
Can you lend me the hairpin?

557
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,660
Thank you.

558
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,660
Reverse-reverse is like a light,

559
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,660
but the reverse-reverse is like a light.

560
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,660
Reverse-reverse is like a light,

561
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,660
but the reverse-reverse is like a light.

562
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,660
This is the original hairpin.

563
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,660
That's right.

564
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,660
I use the whole-body shanghu to make this hairpin.

565
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,660
It's very precious.

566
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,660
This item is limited to the Empress Dowager.

567
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,660
May the Empress Dowager live a long life.

568
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,660
May the Empress Dowager live a long life.

569
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,660
Your Majesty.

570
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,660
It's so nice.

571
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,660
This is the handkerchief I wear at home.

572
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,660
Reverse-reverse is like a light,

573
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,660
but the reverse-reverse is like a light.

574
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,660
Reverse-reverse is like a light,

575
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,660
but the reverse-reverse is like a light.

576
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,660
Your Majesty.

577
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,660
Yue.

578
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,660
Yue.

579
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,660
Yue.

580
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,660
You're still alive.

581
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,660
Your Majesty, I was helping you make the cake.

582
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,660
Why are you here all of a sudden?

583
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,660
Not bad.

584
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,660
This handkerchief is made from the hand of Xiao Yue.

585
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,660
That's so amazing.

586
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,660
It's so wonderful.

587
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,660
Yue,

588
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,660
can you try the secret tree?

589
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,660
Of course.

590
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,660
But today is the Emperor's day.

591
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,660
I'm thinking about

592
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,660
not letting the Emperor try it first.

593
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,660
Good.

594
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,660
Let the Emperor try it.

595
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,660
The secret tree is really not fake.

596
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,660
Really not fake?

597
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,660
No matter what,

598
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,660
I can find it.

599
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,660
You can find it.

600
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,660
Good.

601
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,660
Your Majesty is the Emperor of the Ninth and Fifth.

602
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,660
The scene is long.

603
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,660
I'm the only one who's willing to do it.

604
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,660
I'm afraid that the Buddha will not allow me to do it.

605
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,660
I'll go to the court to see you off

606
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,660
and read the book with me.

607
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,660
The book is as light as a spring.

608
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,660
I said that the time can stop.

609
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,660
I'm willing to do it.

610
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,660
Don't disappoint me.

611
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:18,660
I dare not leave you alone.

612
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,660
Yes.

613
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,660
I indeed.

614
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,660
But it takes money.

615
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,660
Right?

616
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,660
accompaniment is skinny already.

617
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,660
right?

618
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,620
Here I will give you that

619
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,620
because it's better than me.

620
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,140
Fine, I ask you to keep family in China hostility.

621
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,980
I want to keep money by family.

622
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,940
Have some family together.

623
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:59,620
As one people must have in parent,

624
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:03,060
his ordinary as ever.

625
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:08,740
As one person must have in

626
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,720
opportunity,

627
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,700
ake

628
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,380
Huo Qingheng

629
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,760
Elder sister

630
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,240
Qinger

631
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,060
Ling'er

632
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,400
What are you doing here

633
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
How do you know we're here?

634
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,400
You're making a secret!

635
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,400
What? What?

636
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Nothing.

637
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
Ling'er, why are you here?

638
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Aren't you a concubine?

639
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Who told you?

640
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,400
I thought you wanted to marry an emperor.

641
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
I was sad to have a marriage.

642
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
That's not important.

643
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
I have something more important to do.

644
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
You go first.

645
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
I almost forgot.

646
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
I have something more important to do.

647
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
Jiang Yicheng ran away.

648
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
What?

649
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
No.

650
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,400
You won't kill her again, will you?

651
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
What should we do?

652
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
The master ordered us to take her away.

653
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,400
Let's wait for her to send the order.

654
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Don't mess up her plan.

655
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
What? Yuechi is leaving?

656
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Can't we do this?

657
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,400
What the hell is Yue Fei doing?

658
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,400
When I kill Huo Jinghe, I'll take you out with me.

659
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
Go back now.

660
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
The Empress Dowager is here.

661
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Huo Jing can't protect you.

662
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
I'll go.

663
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
But I'll take you with me.

664
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Don't mess up.

665
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Yue Fei, where are you going?

666
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
So spoiled.

667
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Go away, you're so strong.

What are you thinking of?

684
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,200
Why didn't you rush away?

685
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,520
Never mind, Royal Mother.

695
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,820
