00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Episode 1

3
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,800
You disappeared from the imperial city like this?

4
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,000
You're so absurd.

5
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,400
How is Yue Chengxiao?

6
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

7
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,200
Yue Xiang is fine. He's already resting in the mansion.

8
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,100
Let him rest well.

9
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,900
I didn't expect that you're so powerful behind this man's back.

10
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,500
Who is Qiu Xing?

11
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,500
He was sent by the imperial guards to all the city's battle stations.

12
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
The people of the street can take him away

13
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,300
in this secret control of the imperial city.

14
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,100
He won't wait for us to catch him in the battle.

15
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,900
Then, let him run away?

16
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,500
This is a matter of time.

17
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,700
We can only wait.

18
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,700
The Imperial Guards

19
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,700
The Imperial Guards

20
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,900
You're back.

21
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,500
Young Master.

22
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,500
I thought I'd never see you again.

23
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,100
I dare not.

24
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,700
It's just that Yue Chi has been looking for my whereabouts these days.

25
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,100
Do you still remember what I told you?

26
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,900
The assassins were killed and the people were killed.

27
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,500
It seems like you don't understand what I mean.

28
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,300
Young Master, I was wrong.

29
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,500
I never thought you could assassinate Huo Jingheng.

30
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,900
Huo Jingheng is a reasonable person.

31
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,300
He can take the throne on his back.

32
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,900
He can assassinate you.

33
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,100
Don't you think the status of the former emperor

34
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,100
is more interesting than assassinating Huo Jingheng?

35
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,300
If you were suppressed by me, Yue Chi...

36
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,900
Will Yue Chi use the power of the Qilin Army

37
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,300
to save your fiancée?

38
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,900
At that time, the country will be in trouble.

39
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,300
It will be hard and hard.

40
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,700
Just like you.

41
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,900
Young Master, don't.

42
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,700
Young Master.

43
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,800
Let's go back to your place.

44
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,000
Young Master.

45
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,100
Young Master.

46
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,300
Young Master.

47
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,100
Young Master.

48
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,300
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,300
Young Master.

50
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,100
Young Master, I was wrong.

51
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,500
Xiao Xiao is annoying.

52
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,900
She won't be angry.

53
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,700
I will do my best

54
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,100
to never let you down.

55
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,100
I never like to help others.

56
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
I like to let others follow me.

57
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,100
I will go to the temple.

58
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,100
I will pay for everything.

59
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,100
I will make the future chaotic.

60
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,100
I believe you have the courage to enter the palace.

61
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,100
You are almost a man who escaped from the capital.

62
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,100
If you didn't find out the power of my servant,

63
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,100
you would have left.

64
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,100
Young Master.

65
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,100
Forget it.

66
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,100
Tell me about Yuechi.

67
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,100
Is there anything special about her?

68
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,100
If it wasn't for you,

69
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,100
I would have died in front of Yuechi.

70
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,100
I didn't expect you to be so good at sword skills.

71
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,100
Thank you for your cooperation

72
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,100
and letting me learn such a good sword skill.

73
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,100
I just hope that one day,

74
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,100
the most common enemy is not me.

75
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,100
I dare not.

76
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,100
I just want to say that

77
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,100
you are so nervous.

78
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,100
I think you really thought about it.

79
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
Nianchao is too much.

80
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,100
You dare to keep me.

81
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100
I am grateful for your kindness.

82
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,100
Forget it.

83
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,100
I am so embarrassed.

84
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,100
What do you think about Yuechi?

85
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,100
I dare not act rashly.

86
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,100
Please think about it.

87
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,100
If I have the position of the Regent,

88
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,100
I am willing to do as you know.

89
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,100
Regent?

90
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,100
Since she was a young girl,

91
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,100
she has been a great fan of the country.

92
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
She has the ability to be rich.

93
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,100
She is a Regent.

94
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,100
She is a great fan of the country.

95
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,100
Yuechi doesn't care about the position.

96
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,100
She cares more about the people and the Yue family.

97
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,100
Besides,

98
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,100
she is not a simple person.

99
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,100
Since you think

100
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,100
Yuechi won't give up Huo Jinghe easily,

101
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,100
you can force her.

102
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
You are the auntie.

103
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,100
When you are the auntie,

104
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,100
you can see them

105
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,100
and make trouble for you.

106
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,100
You can do it.

107
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,100
But it doesn't matter.

108
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
I have a way to make you do it.

109
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,100
Yuechi.

110
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Yuechi.

111
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,100
You are hurt.

112
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,100
Yuechi.

113
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,100
It hurts.

114
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,100
Please bear it.

115
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,100
You can't rest assured.

116
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,100
You risked your life again.

117
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,100
You have your Qingyun裝.

118
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,100
You want to take revenge.

119
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,100
I have something to do.

120
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,100
I made a mistake

121
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,100
in the city gate that day.

122
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
But I didn't do it for Qingyun.

123
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,100
I risked my life

124
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,100
to kill Chu Ge in the court.

125
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,100
I told you

126
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,100
that I will only make you lose your mind.

127
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,100
These days,

128
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,100
where have you been?

129
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
I haven't asked you for a long time.

130
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Where else can I go?

131
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
I have to take a bath.

132
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
I won't do it again.

133
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
I will protect you.

134
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
But Qingyun,

135
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
you promised me

136
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
not to risk your life again.

137
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
I will take you back to your room to rest.

138
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,100
Yuechi.

139
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,100
Now,

140
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
I am forced to go to the city gate.

141
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Am I right?

142
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,100
It's so romantic.

143
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
No.

144
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,100
In my eyes,

145
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,100
you are always the princess of the Yitai Wanqian.

146
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,100
From the first time I saw you,

147
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,100
the first time.

148
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Now, I am

149
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,100
but I must be very close to you.

150
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Qing.

151
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,100
I remember

152
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
you pushed your wife to me.

153
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Am I right?

154
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,100
Yes.

155
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
Just take it.

156
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
I will take it.

157
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
Is that the princess of Liuluo?

158
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
I heard that a big fire broke out in the city a few years ago.

159
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
The princess was killed by the thief.

160
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
No.

161
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,100
It was a sudden attack.

162
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,100
The queen kept the princess alive,

163
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,100
and she was killed by the thief.

164
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
The princess came back in seven years

165
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,100
in Liuluo.

166
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
I don't know how much she suffered.

167
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
You are bold.

168
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Let's go.

169
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,100
When did you start to learn to listen to the thief?

170
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,100
They said that

171
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,100
I should hide my ears from the thief.

172
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
Don't be so stubborn.

173
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,100
But

174
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,100
what happened to the word of Huang Jitan?

175
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,100
Eight years ago,

176
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,100
on the first day of the lunar month,

177
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
the princess was killed by the thief.

178
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,100
I don't think so.

179
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
The first time she was killed,

180
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
she was killed by the thief.

181
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,100
The thief was killed by the thief.

182
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
The royal court thought that it was a premonition.

183
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,100
They wanted to punish the thief.

184
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
The queen didn't keep the thief in the castle.

185
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
She went to the N.C.

186
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,100
and was punished.

187
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,100
Right.

188
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
The queen was afraid that the crown prince was in danger.

189
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
So she entrusted her to Consort Su.

190
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
She took the princess to the N.C.

191
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
It seems that the emperor recognized the princess.

192
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,100
But the emperor was so bold.

193
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
He asked the princess to know the princess.

194
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,100
No matter what,

195
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,100
just recognize her.

196
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,100
Xia Petun...

197
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
Hello, Xia Petun.

198
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Can you please call mother?

199
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,100
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,100
When I was a child,

201
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,100
I had arrived to the N.C.

202
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,100
But she didn't admit the sister of the emperor.

203
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,100
She didn't know about the princess' readable mistake.

204
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,100
So how did she misunderstand me?

205
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,500
I've already lost

206
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,380
this wife I've never heard of.

207
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,100
Qing'er,

208
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,540
don't hurt yourself anymore.

209
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,060
Don't do anything

210
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,740
that will make yourself

211
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,100
in danger.

212
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,260
Empress is kind and kind.

213
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,940
If she knows something,

214
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,820
she will surely hope you can be safe and sound.

215
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,220
I'm sick.

216
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,940
I'm not here.

217
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,620
I'm sleepy.

218
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,140
I'm going back to my room.

219
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,060
Don't go back on that.

220
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,780
ended up on my breakfast.

221
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,740
That was an absolute concession.

222
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,860
No more masquerade and no one did anything.

223
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,300
Jesus.

224
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,420
I'm tired.

225
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,460
Don't go back on that.

226
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,420
Give me the change.

227
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
Don't pour yourself for Communism anymore.

228
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,580
I'm a deviant man.

229
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,580
I'm going to punish the crown prince.

230
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
After the crown prince is finished,

231
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,580
it's normal to punish him for his wrongdoings.

232
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,580
It's a pity that it's the princess.

233
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,580
The princess doesn't know how to sleep.

234
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,580
She's not even dead.

235
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,580
You can't even bring your clothes here.

236
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,580
You're going to punish her for your brother.

237
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,580
Where are you going?

238
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,580
You're an outsider.

239
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,580
You can't break into the harem.

240
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,580
You're a fool.

241
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,580
You're so young.

242
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,580
You're only three years old.

243
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,580
How dare you bring him to the harem?

244
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,580
I didn't.

245
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,580
I went to the harem to see the fish.

246
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,580
I took him to play.

247
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,580
You dare to change your mind?

248
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,580
You're the best.

249
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,580
I'm going to punish the crown prince for his wrongdoings.

250
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,580
You're going to punish the crown prince for his wrongdoings.

251
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,580
Come on.

252
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,580
Beat him.

253
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,580
I'm still not satisfied with the princess.

254
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,580
I'm going to be a fool.

255
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,580
You're going to stand in the harem.

256
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,580
Don't you think I'm going to be a fool?

257
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,580
Little Shuo, you're right.

258
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,580
I'm going to be a fool

259
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,580
if I'm going to be a fool.

260
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,580
Little Shuo.

261
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,580
Look. He's not a good person.

262
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,580
If that's the case,

263
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,580
continue to beat him.

264
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,580
Little Shuo.

265
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,580
Little Shuo.

266
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,580
Little Shuo.

267
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,580
What are you afraid of?

268
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,580
The ring.

269
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,580
It's okay.

270
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,580
Little Shuo.

271
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,580
Little Shuo, don't be so painful.

272
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,580
Father.

273
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,580
You're looking for me?

274
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,580
Pei Ning is a good girl.

275
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,580
If it wasn't for her,

276
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,580
you'd be in trouble today.

277
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,580
But I really can't stand it.

278
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,580
The princess is so useless.

279
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,580
She's also been beaten

280
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,580
by the crown prince.

281
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,580
The medicine in the army is the best.

282
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,580
You can take it

283
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,580
to the crown prince tomorrow.

284
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,580
Thank you, father.

285
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,580
Princess,

286
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,580
the medicine that the Yue family gave you

287
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,580
is the best in treating the disease.

288
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,580
Thank you.

289
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,580
Thank you.

290
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,580
The princess is as good as

291
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,580
she is with her lover.

292
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,580
If she doesn't go with her,

293
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,580
she'll be in trouble.

294
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,580
Princess,

295
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,580
you should take care of yourself.

296
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,580
Eat something.

297
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,580
Princess,

298
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,580
you can't eat rice cakes.

299
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,580
And today,

300
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,580
you...

301
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,580
I spent two or three months

302
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,580
on the work.

303
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,580
I finally found it out.

304
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,580
I went to the peach garden.

305
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,580
I met someone.

306
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,580
I just wanted to say hello to them.

307
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,580
I heard it was a bad deal.

308
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,580
I owed some money.

309
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,580
I sent my daughter to the city to make some money.

310
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,580
I didn't know

311
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,580
how the Yue family's daughter

312
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,580
got the princess and the empress's love.

313
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,580
Then I went to the store.

314
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,580
How long has the Yue family's daughter

315
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,580
been in the city?

316
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,580
Half a year.

317
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,580
After the big fire,

318
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,580
I didn't see her.

319
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,580
I didn't go home.

320
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,580
I didn't find a corpse.

321
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,580
Where can

322
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,580
the daughter of the Zhuanghu family

323
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,580
go?

324
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,580
Maybe she's dead.

325
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,580
Yes.

326
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,580
Maybe she's dead.

327
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,580
Maybe she's dead.

328
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,580
Maybe

329
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,580
in the journey of the city's En Temple,

330
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,580
a girl shouldn't be picked up

331
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,580
and stole something

332
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,580
that can change her life

333
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,580
and escaped the place of the dead.

334
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,580
Everything will be fine.

335
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,580
I promise.

336
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,580
How long has the princess been in the city?

337
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,580
The princess has been in the city for two hours.

338
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,580
The young master has grown up.

339
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,580
He can't make it to the palace.

340
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,580
He can't make it to the palace.

341
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,580
Even the father is praised for his high-ranking.

342
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,580
Did you see it?

343
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,580
I often see you.

344
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,580
But you still blame me.

345
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,580
Qing, are you awake?

346
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,580
Come in.

347
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,580
I'm hungry.

348
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,580
Go and take a rest.

349
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,580
The meal is ready.

350
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,580
I'll take you to a place

351
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,580
after breakfast.

352
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,580
Yuechi,

353
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,580
I'm going out like this.

354
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,580
Don't worry.

355
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,580
I'm here.

356
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,580
No one will find out who you are.

357
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,580
This is...

358
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,580
You'll know when you see it.

359
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,580
Come.

360
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,580
Uncle.

361
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,580
You're still young.

362
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,580
You're still so tall.

363
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,580
I've been keeping Yun Shuo here for the past two years.

364
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,580
This old lady's son

365
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,580
took Qi'er out for business.

366
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,580
He entrusted me to take care of my mother.

367
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,580
Now, the old man

368
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,580
treats Yun Shuo as his own grandson.

369
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,580
Yun Shuo goes to school and studies every day.

370
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,580
She's not very good at eating and wearing.

371
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,580
I've taught her the martial arts of her body.

372
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,580
I taught her the etiquette.

373
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,580
She's not the Crown Prince of Yi State.

374
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,580
But she's very good at living.

375
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,580
I'm relieved

376
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,580
to have you take care of her.

377
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,580
Yun Shuo is very close to you.

378
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,580
Qi'er,

379
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,580
everything will be fine.

380
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,580
Yuechi.

381
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,580
Thank you.

382
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,580
I want to be with you.

383
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,580
Can I?

384
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,580
Are you really willing to?

385
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,580
Now,

386
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,580
I see you're doing well.

387
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,580
You're also safe.

388
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,580
I don't think

389
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,580
I'm that angry all of a sudden.

390
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,580
You said

391
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,580
she's the princess who's not worthy of being chased.

392
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,580
I also want to see if it's true.

393
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,580
You've done too much for me and Xiao Shuo.

394
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,580
I want to stay by your side

395
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,580
and be your guard.

396
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,580
Can I?

397
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,580
How can you do such a hard thing?

398
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,580
Besides,

399
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,580
your identity is special.

400
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,580
You can stay in the mansion.

401
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,580
As long as you're like Yun Shuo,

402
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,580
I'm very satisfied.

403
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,580
Qundong A film and production By Xiao Shu天

404
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:21,580
Cut choreography byquaru

405
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,580
You and Mei Niang after the kids form tomorrow,

406
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,580
we'll stop playing with you!

407
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,580
That's right!

408
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,580
We'll stop playing with you!

409
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:25,700
For Yiwen

410
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,580
Our turn.

411
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,580
I'm not a good girl.

412
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,580
I'm a girl who doesn't have any parents.

413
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,580
I can climb up myself.

414
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,580
I tried it.

415
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,580
No one can climb up.

416
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,580
I'm not a good girl.

417
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,580
I'm not a good girl.

418
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,580
I'm not a good girl.

419
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,580
I miss home.

420
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,580
Let me sing you a song.

421
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,580
Come on.

422
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,580
I miss home.

423
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,580
The Story of the Phoenix

424
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,580
Episode 1

425
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,580
Your Majesty, calm down.

426
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,580
No.

427
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,580
I can't be alone.

428
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,580
Yue Chi.

429
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,580
Yue Chi.

430
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,580
Is there a guest?

431
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,580
It's my old friend.

432
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,580
He passed by the yellow car to see me.

433
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,580
We were having lunch.

434
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,580
Why don't you...

435
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,580
I'll do whatever I want.

436
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,580
The old man.

437
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,580
You're so fast.

438
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,580
Okay.

439
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,580
What do you want me do?

440
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,580
I'm a good girl.

441
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,580
Don't tell Xia Er and other people

442
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,580
about the marriage.

443
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,580
Maybe not.

444
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,580
Sorry.

445
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,580
I didn't expect you had private rest today.

446
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,540
With my level and look,

447
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,860
I've bigger number.

448
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,060
Are you sure?

449
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,020
I'm worried.

450
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,180
Brother Xie.

451
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,120
Jiang Roshan,

452
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,620
Mr. Zhao,

453
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,040
a fine omen.

454
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,920
Let me have a look yourself.

455
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,320
Take a photo of your face.

456
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:21,720
Come on.

457
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:23,800
Chief.

458
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,580
I'm a very honest person.

459
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,580
So I'd like to discuss with you.

460
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,580
Do you want to give me a hug?

461
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,580
Brother Yue,

462
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,580
the guest who came today is a distinguished guest.

463
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,580
How do these girls know that I'm a distinguished guest?

464
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,580
Do I have anything special?

465
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:53,580
I know the official title of the man who just said that.

466
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,580
Moreover,

467
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,580
can you talk to Brother Yue about these things?

468
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,580
You don't respect the status of a distinguished guest.

469
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,580
Is it a status of being a distinguished guest who is on the street?

470
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,580
Brother Ji,

471
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,580
let's go to the study room for these things.

472
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,580
The man's family is close.

473
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,580
Let the girl listen to the joke.

474
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,580
It's okay.

475
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,580
I saw the guest didn't move fast.

476
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,580
He must be dissatisfied with the dishes.

477
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,580
Uncle Liu,

478
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,580
why don't you let the kitchen add two more dishes?

479
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,580
Let them have a chat while eating.

480
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,580
Miss,

481
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,580
what do you want to add?

482
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,580
Add a dish...

483
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,580
and a golden-grey flower.

484
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,580
Miss,

485
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,580
I've never heard of the dishes you said.

486
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,580
It's simple.

487
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,580
First, steam the crab.

488
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,580
Then, take the crab meat out of the crab.

489
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,580
Roll it into a dough.

490
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,580
Cut it into small pieces.

491
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,580
Put it in the steamer.

492
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,580
The white crab meat in the snow white.

493
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,580
The golden crab meat in the snow white.

494
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,580
The name is golden-grey flower.

495
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,580
My family used to love this dish.

496
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,580
Add another dish.

497
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,580
The dish is called the spring roll.

498
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,580
The spring roll is ten pieces.

499
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,580
It's washed with wine.

500
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,580
It's half-cooked with a fork.

501
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,580
How about this?

502
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,580
Uncle Liu,

503
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,580
take the paper.

504
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,580
I'll write the volume to you.

505
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,580
It's so mysterious.

506
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,580
I'm afraid it's the former court.

507
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,580
Sit down and eat.

508
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,580
Don't waste it.

509
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,580
Sit.

510
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,580
Sit.

511
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,580
Eat.

512
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,580
The server is ready.

513
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,580
Good.

514
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,580
The server is rich.

515
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,580
Two poets,

516
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,580
have some tea.

517
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,580
You and Yuexiong are friends,

518
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,580
are you from the United客.

519
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,580
Right.

520
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,100
It's so late now,

521
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,420
go back and have some rest.

522
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,300
Young master soaring like its head and來到 the wind,

523
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,020
it's safe and quiet.

524
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,560
But some of them are prendreous.

525
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,800
You can't be a pervert, can you?

526
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,120
As soon as the two armies have fought,

527
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,540
young master Jin is easily captured.

528
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,480
Instead, he'll allow me to

529
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
Cao Mangxiao has taken the risk.

530
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,000
It's not a good time to turn off the light.

531
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,720
Let's go back to the room.

532
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,520
He's not doing anything.

533
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,320
He's just making a mess.

534
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,800
Let's continue.

535
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,080
Go on.

536
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,600
What friend is he?

537
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,280
This map...

538
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,800
is so familiar.

539
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:49,400
So many people are talking about the Moon

540
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,320
Shah Ji.

541
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,280
Mom!

542
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,480
Are you fine?

543
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,820
No!

544
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,700
Get up!

545
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,580
Let's leave.

546
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,560
Don't set me up.

547
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,520
I'll get out of here!

548
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,640
Look at those two.

549
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,720
Yours.

550
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,260
What's wrong?

551
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,140
Qing Er.

552
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,380
Where's your match?

553
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,100
Ji Ye.

554
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,020
Then what do you think of the meeting?

555
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,500
Qing'er,

556
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,140
I'll send you out of the city first.

557
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,300
Xiaoshuang.

558
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,780
Help Miss Jiang pack up.

559
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,060
You must take care of Miss Jiang.

560
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,420
Please stay with her.

561
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,940
Don't rush me here.

562
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,380
I'll stay with her.

563
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,540
Do as I say.

564
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,060
Go prepare the horse.

565
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,260
Look who is coming.

566
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,420
Rain documentary about Jiang Shanshe

567
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,580
Yuexiang,

568
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,500
His Majesty is in an urgent shop.

569
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,700
Please come in.

570
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,300
Give it back.

571
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,460
I was afraid you would speak out

572
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,460
to opponent affairs in court.

573
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,180
Yu Yu.

574
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,060
It's not a good thing

575
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,460
to hide his identity.

576
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,220
I know.

577
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,500
I'm just angry.

578
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,100
You think I'm just

579
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,300
a petty person?

580
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,260
Do you think he's the former emperor

581
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,580
who knows his place?

582
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,260
I...

583
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,100
I'm not sure.

584
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,340
Will I

585
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,940
punish him

586
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,780
and leave him alone?

587
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,340
But there's one thing

588
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:52,740
that you and I

589
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,140
must think the same.

590
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,540
If the courtiers

591
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,660
know you're hiding this girl,

592
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,820
you'll lose your duty

593
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,620
and you'll be in trouble.

594
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,620
I won't let him be found.

595
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,620
Besides,

596
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,620
even if I have to leave him,

597
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,900
I can still serve His Majesty in the future.

598
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,340
I'm afraid you'll be in trouble.

599
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,460
Listen to me.

600
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,420
Let me deal with Jiang's daughter.

601
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,860
I'll send someone

602
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,900
to escort him out of the capital.

603
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,700
And then I'll send him

604
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,620
a safe place.

605
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,820
You can go and see him at any time.

606
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,140
I just wanted to let him leave the capital today.

607
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,860
You don't have to worry about it.

608
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,220
He's been

609
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,100
a strange man

610
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,300
since he was a few years ago.

611
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,340
I'm afraid he'll be used by someone

612
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,340
and harm you.

613
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,100
Thank you for your consideration.

614
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,300
I'll send him out as soon as possible.

615
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,180
I won't let you down.

616
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,860
You still think

617
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,420
I'll kill him

618
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,620
if I tell you this?

619
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,020
I don't have that kind of intention.

620
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,300
Forget it.

621
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,860
You must send him

622
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,380
away within two days.

623
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,180
The farther, the better.

624
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,580
Yes.

625
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,900
Send Miss Jiang out of the capital immediately.

626
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,740
Don't delay.

627
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,900
Chuchuan, you've been sent to the capital.

628
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,700
Miss Jiang will lock herself in the room.

629
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,780
She won't leave anyway.

630
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,980
It's cold.

631
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,580
I can't move a bit.

632
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,020
You're not even listening.

633
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,100
You're not good at pushing.

634
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,300
Don't stand there.

635
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,540
Qing'er,

636
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,180
you're too much.

637
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,700
Uncle Liu is old and has a bad leg.

638
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,980
You even let him stand by the door for a day.

639
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,300
Come out.

640
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,900
I have something to tell you.

641
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,100
No need to tell me.

642
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,580
I only tell you that I won't leave.

643
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,180
His Majesty is really angry this time.

644
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,060
If you don't leave now,

645
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,140
I'm afraid the sword will not protect you.

646
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,820
It's useless.

647
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:18,980
It's not big deal.

648
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,180
He and his men are so close.

649
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,100
It's also a risk.

650
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,740
He will come and get angry with you.

651
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,820
He won't take your life.

652
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,700
I'm worried that he will ask you to come closer.

653
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,980
You will be in trouble.

654
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,980
You know that

655
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,580
I've been separated from Yunshuo for many years.

656
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,180
I don't want to leave him again.

657
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,460
I promise

658
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,180
you'll leave for the moment.

659
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,180
When all these things are over,

660
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,460
I'll see you back myself.

661
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,980
Let's get to know each other, okay?

662
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,860
If I leave,

663
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,260
what about you and Ling'er?

664
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,420
It's all my fault.

665
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,220
How can I leave alone?

666
00:37:59,060 --> 00:37:59,660
My lord,

667
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,060
why don't we

668
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,340
tie him up?

669
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,020
No.

670
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,140
Two more days.

671
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,500
You can send Ling'er to the capital tomorrow

672
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,380
and let him come to Quanquan.

673
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,500
Then let him

674
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,780
go back to Xingqing.

675
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:19,860
Remember,

676
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,140
the way I taught me.

677
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,900
Don't worry.

678
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

679
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,860
I'm afraid of the world.

680
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

681
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

682
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

683
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

684
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

685
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

686
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

687
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

688
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

689
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

690
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

691
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

692
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

693
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

694
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

695
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

696
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

697
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

698
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

699
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

700
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

701
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

702
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

703
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

704
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

705
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

706
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

707
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

708
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,860
I'm not afraid of the world.

00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,860
