00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Story of the Dead

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 1

3
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Why don't you go to rest first?

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
When Miss Lin Er comes out,

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll ask her to come out immediately.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll see.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This woman is too fierce.

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Don't let her run away.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
My master told me to watch her.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
She can't leave.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But you...

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
can leave.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What are you talking about?

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You just kicked me out.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You don't even think about who will buy you food.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Who will buy you a house?

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You don't buy me food, but I'll buy you a house.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Who else can buy you a house?

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That one in the middle.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sister Qing Er.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Think about it.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you're in the palace and you're doing well,

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm lucky.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Alright.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I think it's almost time to eat.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The food in the mansion is good.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's eat something delicious first.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Something expensive.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I really know how to cook.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
A bird's nest.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sure Lin Er is slow.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Is she?

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The minister of the Ministry of Rites,

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
the minister of the Ministry of Rites,

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
the mafus of the Ministry of Revenue,

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
the Ministry of에 jugar,

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
the א σε Truckmagist泵整

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,760
with мыADA

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Mr. Fan?

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
How come he's mention Mr Fan

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,920
when he even median your line of book

42
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,240
this year as

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,840
the 17th he's doing himself,

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,240
Mr. Tsche tops the corporate

45
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Could it be Huo Jianhe?

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Could it be that he is a man of the word?

47
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,240
What do you mean? I have to go and see.

48
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,240
Xiao Yue, I'll sleep for a while.

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,240
Don't disturb me.

50
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,240
How dare you!

51
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,240
How dare you to sleep on your own?

52
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,240
You're a traitor!

53
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Such a big fire?

54
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Huo Jianhe is not that happy with his life.

55
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,240
I think we should make a name for ourselves.

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,240
We should take the King of all countries as a witness and cut off the army.

57
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,240
So that the people can have a peaceful and happy night.

58
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
I have my reasons for this.

59
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
I am responsible for this.

60
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
I think this is inappropriate.

61
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,240
Your Majesty, if you ask the King of all countries for the money,

62
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,240
how will the King of all countries protect their territory?

63
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,240
My Lord, what is the territory of the King of all?

64
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,240
There is only the territory of the King of all countries.

65
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,240
The territory of the King of all is protected by the King of all.

66
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
So you mean

67
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,240
the King of all countries is no longer the King of all countries?

68
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Don't forget, my Lord, the land of the King of all is a game of the King of all.

69
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,240
I am the King of all, the King of all,

70
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,240
but I have no intention of letting the King of all go.

71
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

72
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
If this is the end of the world,

73
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,240
will the King of all countries be hurt?

74
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
It's a big deal.

75
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Now the situation is outside the country.

76
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
How can we be so serious?

77
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Enough.

78
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,240
The King of all countries is in the dark.

79
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
It seems that Huo Jing Heng is trying to get the trouble.

80
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,240
He intentionally made a mistake with Du Tian Zhao.

81
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,240
He is trying to find out the situation.

82
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Huo Jing Heng is a little bit stubborn.

83
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Why didn't you just mention the matter of the meal?

84
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Now, you are being taught by Ouyang Wen.

85
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,240
Now the attitude of the court is a bit too much.

86
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
It's not good to mention the matter of the meal.

87
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,240
I just want to test the attitude of the court.

88
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Now the King of all countries is in hatred.

89
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
You really can do it.

90
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,240
Do you know how many soldiers the King of all countries has?

91
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
More than 50,000.

92
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,240
But the King of all countries has more than 40,000 soldiers.

93
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
More than 40,000?

94
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,240
Only 600,000 soldiers are in the court.

95
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,240
If the King of all countries is forced to attack with force,

96
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,240
I'm afraid that the soldiers can't resist for a long time.

97
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,240
The best thing is that the soldiers don't move.

98
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Then what are you talking about with those court officials?

99
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,240
The King of all countries has their own lines in the court.

100
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
They all have money.

101
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,240
I just want to borrow their pocket money.

102
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,240
I want to take advantage of the situation.

103
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,240
As for how to solve this matter,

104
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,240
I don't have the right strategy.

105
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
But uncle,

106
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,240
I saw the memorial paper you received a few days ago.

107
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,240
The jewelry is in the right place.

108
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
The good idea is that it's not poor.

109
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
Why?

110
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,240
It's not a good idea to take advantage of the situation.

111
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
I'm the one who's been hit.

112
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
You heard it?

113
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,240
I heard that uncle's family has lived in a distant relative's house.

114
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
His family is in a bad situation.

115
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,240
I think it's because of the death that he's separated.

116
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
How about this?

117
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
I...

118
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
Allow uncle to go back to his mansion.

119
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,240
Take care of his family and rest for a few days.

120
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
No, no, no.

121
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Uncle, I won't rest. I can do it.

122
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Then just let it go.

123
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
How long do you need to rest and how long do you need to rest?

124
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
It's a fair business.

125
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
No, no, no.

126
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,240
It's not good to let it go.

127
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
How can I live after it?

128
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
I have a big family.

129
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,240
What about the school meal?

130
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Take out a role for me now.

131
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Wei Zhang, go and pay the price for the left.

132
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Yes.

133
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
No, I'm sorry.

134
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,240
The memorial papers before were not approved.

135
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
Really?

136
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Who approved them?

137
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
It's...

138
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
Shut up, you.

139
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
It's Yue Fei.

140
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
Yue Fei.

141
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Uncle, you can't get enough of this.

142
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,240
I won't blame you.

143
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,240
Why did you think of such a ridiculous reason to make this up?

144
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
It's so unfair.

145
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Since uncle is so wise,

146
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,240
I'll go to Fengleng Palace

147
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
and face Yue Fei.

148
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Greetings, Your Majesty.

149
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Yue Fei, have some tea.

150
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
No need.

151
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,240
The door is locked.

152
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,240
Yue Fei, I heard that

153
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
Yue Fei was in the harem with you,

154
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
but he was in the court.

155
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
I just heard that

157
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Lord Du was in the court

158
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
and I was wronged.

159
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
I shouldn't have done this.

160
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

161
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
It seems that

162
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,240
you and Yue Fei have met privately.

163
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,240
You're so kind, Your Majesty.

164
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
I'm innocent.

165
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
I just met Yue Fei

166
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,240
when I was in the harem.

167
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
I was in the harem with Yue Fei

168
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
and I was in the harem with Yue Fei.

169
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
I just met Yue Fei

170
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
and I was in the harem with Yue Fei.

171
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
Lord Du,

172
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,240
let's be honest with you.

173
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Your Majesty,

174
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Lord Du was looking for me

175
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
some days ago.

176
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
I asked him to give me a few words.

177
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
I didn't dare to do it.

178
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
But I didn't expect Lord Du

179
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,240
to be so dangerous to me.

180
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
Yue Fei, you're talking too much.

181
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Think about your family.

182
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Your Majesty, look.

183
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,240
He's so dangerous to me.

184
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
It seems that

185
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
you're wrong.

186
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Lord Du,

187
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
what should we do?

188
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
I'm afraid that

189
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,240
we can't stop the temptation.

190
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
How could it be?

191
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
I know my fault.

192
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,240
I'm in the harem with Yue Fei.

193
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
I even know that

194
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
Yue Fei is so cruel to her

195
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
and so cruel to her.

196
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
I'm so impulsive.

197
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
I'm so impulsive.

198
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
I'm so impulsive.

199
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
I can't handle it.

200
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
I can't handle it.

201
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
I can't handle it.

202
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
I'm so impulsive.

203
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,240
I can't believe

204
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Yue Fei is so cruel to her.

205
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,240
How could she be so impulsive?

206
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,240
I'm not a person who can't handle it.

207
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,240
I'm so impulsive.

208
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,240
I'm willing to help you.

209
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,240
I'm just a harem.

210
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
I don't know how to eat.

211
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Zuo Xiang, you said

212
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
that you're from a family.

213
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
What?

214
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
I'm not willing to help you.

215
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
Yue Fei, don't be afraid.

216
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,240
I'm not a man who can't handle it.

217
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,240
If you really don't want to help me,

218
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
I won't force you.

219
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
I'm willing to help you.

220
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,240
I'm not a person who can't handle it.

221
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Wait.

222
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
I'm back to the city.

223
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
You didn't do it for me.

224
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,240
When did Uncle become so smart?

225
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,240
You're playing with Uncle.

226
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Uncle is not happy.

227
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,240
Uncle is a rich man.

228
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,240
He always puts a lot of effort into it.

229
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
But he should be.

230
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Otherwise, he can't guarantee

231
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,240
that one day he will send his uncle to the Empress Dowager.

232
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
Your Majesty is right.

233
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,240
He's always been happy.

234
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,240
These two big ancestors

235
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
can't bear to leave him alone.

236
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,240
No.

237
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,240
The outside world is so interested in Yue Fei.

238
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Does he know that he's a bandit?

239
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,240
When did you start to make up for it?

240
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Yue Fei's attack

241
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
was also a plan of His Majesty.

242
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Indeed.

243
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,240
From the day Yue Fei was attacked,

244
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,240
it was all my plan.

245
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Why do you think so?

246
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,240
One, Yue Fei often stays with Yue Fei.

247
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,240
The other, Yue Fei stays with him.

248
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,240
The Qi Lin Army is in chaos.

249
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,240
The situation in the capital is in chaos.

250
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
The city is in chaos.

251
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,240
If Qi Lin Army can handle it,

252
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,240
the world will be in peace.

253
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
That's all?

254
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,240
That's all.

255
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,240
It seems that the outside world

256
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
is not only a man who is a man of his own.

257
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,240
His eyes are really bad.

258
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
But that's good.

259
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,240
As long as Yue Fei and his group

260
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,240
are a group of wolf-bearing army soldiers,

261
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Ling Er doesn't have to go back to be a concubine.

262
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
That's good.

263
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Uncle will definitely help you.

264
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Thank you, uncle.

265
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
Brother Tian Zhao.

266
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,240
Brother, something happened.

267
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,240
Your brother was found by His Majesty

268
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,240
by me.

269
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
But don't worry.

270
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,240
His Majesty didn't blame him.

271
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
He just praised him.

272
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,240
He asked him to take the blame for his own safety.

273
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,240
He didn't blame me.

274
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
He didn't blame me.

275
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,240
He didn't blame me.

276
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
He just praised me.

277
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
He asked him to take the blame for his own safety.

278
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
That's great.

279
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Thank you for this.

280
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,240
Otherwise, I wouldn't have waited for the red-banded horse.

281
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,240
But you're so happy about this.

282
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Of course I'm happy.

283
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
What's this?

284
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,240
Yue Fei is ugly.

285
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,240
It's good for me.

286
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
By the way, sister Qi Er

287
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,240
hasn't been home for days.

288
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,240
I'll try it for you.

289
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,240
Thank you.

290
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Ling Er.

291
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,240
The chief asked me to protect you

292
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
so that you can stay away from the outsiders.

293
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
I'm not an outsider.

294
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
The chief said that

295
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
he was protecting you.

296
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,240
Your room is over there.

297
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,240
Please go back.

298
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Grandpa.

299
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
The palace has sent news.

300
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
Yue Fei is here.

301
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
He wants you to attack the palace tomorrow.

302
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,240
So fast?

303
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
That's great.

304
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
The prince of the king of the world is choosing the throne.

305
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Yes.

306
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,240
His Majesty wants to change the power of the king.

307
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
No need to be so formal.

308
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,240
The king is a general.

309
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,240
He has the chief to take care of him.

310
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,240
His Majesty wants to change the power of the king

311
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,240
into the power of the king.

312
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,240
He can't be so formal.

313
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
You want to make the king of the world happy?

314
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,240
The power of the king is the first.

315
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
I want to be in the power of the king.

316
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,240
I'm afraid that it's hard to be so formal.

317
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
It's so big.

318
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,240
There are many people who are in the power.

319
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
It's not easy.

320
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
Yue Fei means

321
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,240
how many people will be the heir of the king?

322
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Not bad.

323
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,240
So what should we do?

324
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,240
I'll be the prince of the royal school.

325
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,240
I'll be the prince of the king.

326
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,240
I'll be the crown prince.

327
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,240
In this way, the prince of the king

328
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,240
will not fight against the emperor

329
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
to win the throne.

330
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
Instead, he will support the king

331
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
and be the heir of the royal school.

332
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,240
How should we treat the prince of the king?

333
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Naturally, we should wait.

334
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
How can we come back to the palace?

335
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,240
The students are all rich and rich.

336
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
They are rich and rich.

337
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
They are not afraid of the poor.

338
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
So that's the case.

339
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,240
Ling, you are so old-fashioned.

340
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,240
How do you know if you are good or not?

341
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
How do you think, Hengsheng?

342
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,240
Not good.

343
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
Why not good?

344
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,240
Although the king is a fool,

345
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,240
he will make them fight against the emperor

346
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
in case of the house.

347
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,240
At that time,

348
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,240
how many people will be the heir of the king?

349
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,240
Not good.

350
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
When was it?

351
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
It's still a long time ago.

352
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,240
It's not like the emperor used to use the scroll.

353
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,240
But I don't hurt people.

354
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,240
Your Majesty,

355
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
in this plan,

356
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
did the heir of the king have any harm?

357
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
No.

358
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,240
If you ask again,

359
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
can we use the sword to force the heir to be the heir?

360
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,240
No.

361
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,240
Then no one will be hurt.

362
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
Your Majesty,

363
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Yue Fei is right.

364
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,240
But...

365
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,240
Since I can't help you to make trouble,

366
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
I'll tell you the truth.

367
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
I'll go back to the capital.

368
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,240
Then,

369
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,240
you can do as Yue Fei said.

370
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,240
When the school is forced to move,

371
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,240
Yue Fei will be more concerned.

372
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
I'll do it.

373
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
Yes.

374
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
The heir will be punished.

375
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,240
Yue Fei is a bad-natured person.

376
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
He does something wrong.

377
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
It's just that

378
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
he has a heavy heart.

379
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
I can't do it.

380
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,240
Qian Xu is beautiful.

381
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Yue Fei has a beautiful figure.

382
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
No need to do it.

383
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
It's a fact.

384
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
It's a fact.

385
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
The country is more experienced.

386
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,240
It's better for the country to do it.

387
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
Yue Fei is so far away.

388
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Then,

389
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,240
let the left side be the heir.

390
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
I...

391
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
How about this?

392
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,240
I'll give you a sign of communication.

393
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,240
Then,

394
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,240
you can enter the phoenix palace

395
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,240
with a great brightness.

396
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,240
Yue Fei will pay for it.

397
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Your Majesty,

398
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
I think

399
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
I'll go to the phoenix palace

400
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,240
to see Yue Fei often.

401
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
It's not convenient.

402
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
I'll give you a sign of communication.

403
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
What?

404
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
You want me to give Yue Fei a sign

405
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,240
so that he can enter your mansion with a great brightness?

406
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
That's not necessary.

407
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,240
Don't worry.

408
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,240
I'll believe you two.

409
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,240
It's very clear.

410
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
It's settled.

411
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Take it.

412
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
Sit.

413
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

414
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
Du Tianzhao.

415
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,240
You sell me?

416
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
I don't know.

417
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,240
Think about it.

418
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
It's not a bad thing.

419
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,240
You're now in a harmony with His Majesty.

420
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,240
Other concubines can only see it.

421
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,240
If you have the ability to prove yourself,

422
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,240
why don't you take it out and use it?

423
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240
I just wanted to help Ling'er fight for the throne.

424
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,240
It's so nice of her.

425
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
I'm so happy.

426
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
I'm doing everything I can to prove myself.

427
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,240
If Ling'er comes back,

428
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
how will she be able to win?

429
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
She'll come back.

430
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
No.

431
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
Ling'er won't be the princess.

432
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,240
Ling'er is the princess.

433
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,240
How can she get used to it?

434
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,240
She's staying in the mansion.

435
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
You're her brother.

436
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
You should think about her.

437
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
I have to find a chance to tell Ling'er.

438
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
If she really likes Du Tianzhao,

439
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,240
I won't force her to marry him.

440
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
But I've been working for a long time.

441
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
I can't be a concubine.

442
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,240
Your Highness.

443
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Your Highness.

444
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,240
His Majesty is here again.

445
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Don't mind him.

446
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
We need to do something important.

447
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,240
Come on.

448
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,240
I've chosen a place to study here.

449
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Please help me with the study.

450
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,240
Please help me with the study.

451
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
His Majesty has already booked a place.

452
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
Then you can write as His Majesty wishes.

453
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
If the others say so,

454
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
I won't ask more.

455
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,240
But the strategy of Xue Fan

456
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
was proposed by Yue Fei.

457
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,240
I care more about Yue Fei's intention.

458
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,240
Okay.

459
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
I'll read it.

460
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
Follow him.

461
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,240
I thought that

462
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,240
His Majesty's choice is good,

463
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,240
but it's too much.

464
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,240
However,

465
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
I have to choose the most important thing

466
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
that Prince Fan has to do.

467
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,240
The more he's known, the more he's been involved.

468
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,240
The more he can't find a way to refuse.

469
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,240
He has to make a choice.

470
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
Then you must make a choice.

471
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Look.

472
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,240
What's the name of the person you want to marry?

473
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,240
I don't know.

474
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
I'm not a messenger.

475
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
I'm not a messenger.

476
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,240
I'll just call him Rong Ying Academy.

477
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Yue Fei's mouth

478
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,240
is still so pure.

479
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
It's said that

480
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,240
when will Yue Fei's veil be brought?

481
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,240
When I recover,

482
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,240
I'll take it off.

483
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
When?

484
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
When the peace comes.

485
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
I think so.

486
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
Soon.

487
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,240
Soon.

488
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
Okay.

489
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
I'll wait for you.

490
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
No.

491
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Why did I really do it?

492
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,240
If I keep doing this,

493
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
I can't get out of the palace.

494
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,240
No.

495
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
I have to think of a way

496
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,240
to break the chain of the goods.

497
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Yue Fei is here to report to me

498
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
about the school's progress.

499
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
I just have some suggestions.

500
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,240
Tell me.

501
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,240
I'm thinking that

502
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,240
since the school is built by His Majesty,

503
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,240
it will be a great success.

504
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
I'd better keep some business in the school

505
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,240
and provide convenience for the lives of the prince.

506
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Yue Fei is right.

507
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,240
It's a good idea to keep the business.

508
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
I just know some good business

509
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
in the people's mouth.

510
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,240
I've made a list of them these days.

511
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,240
There are 14 restaurants, 9th floor, and Huo Yun.

512
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,240
I've personally investigated every one of them.

513
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
They are very reliable.

514
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,240
As long as I read this list,

515
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,240
the emperor who is stupid

516
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
can see that this concubine

517
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,240
is not a person who does big things.

518
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,240
Every business is a business of Yue's family.

519
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
I deliberately

520
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,240
make you think of it as a private meeting.

521
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,240
Okay.

522
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
Very good.

523
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
Good?

524
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
I understand what you mean.

525
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,240
What do you understand?

526
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,240
Yue Fei is worried that

527
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,240
the government will not be able to meet

528
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,240
the national treasury in the first place.

529
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,240
So he wants to attract more people's business.

530
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,240
First, he wants to take the people's life.

531
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,240
Second, he wants to

532
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
make more profits for me.

533
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
You bastard.

534
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Who said profits?

535
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
Since these business

536
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,240
are so enthusiastic about the government,

537
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,240
I can't give up.

538
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
How about this?

539
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,240
I'll give these shops

540
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
my own treasure

541
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,240
as a business card.

542
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,240
How is it?

543
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,240
Wait.

544
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
Come on.

545
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,240
Look.

546
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,240
Take it.

547
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
How is it?

548
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,240
Here is a letter.

549
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
But it's okay.

550
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,240
This time...

551
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,240
How is it?

552
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,240
There is a real problem.

553
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,240
I have been practicing martial arts for a long time.

554
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,240
The magic is very beautiful.

555
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,240
But it's better than nothing.

556
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,240
I think I have my own treasure

557
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
as a talent.

558
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,240
These shops are not bad.

559
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
You are right.

560
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,240
You are right.

561
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
Here.

562
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,240
Have some tea.

563
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,240
You are my future brother-in-law.

564
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
I won't fight with you.

565
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
After the magic is done,

566
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
I won't be able to leave.

567
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,240
I should leave.

568
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,240
Greetings to the emperor.

569
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
Rise.

570
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,240
Thank you, your majesty.

571
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Everyone.

572
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,240
When I first came to the city,

573
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,240
I knew that the Wangjue's city was destroyed.

574
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,240
So I changed it to the Xuanba Temple.

575
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,240
It seems that you are my great show-off.

576
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,240
You are all the king.

577
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,240
You will enter the school of Rongying.

578
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
You will be chosen as the crown prince.

579
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,240
The emperor has prepared the top-level accommodation for you.

580
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
It's a great place to stay.

581
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,240
Each of you will be accompanied by a single teacher.

582
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
The school also set up various shops.

583
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,240
You can have some leisure time in the school.

584
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,240
I will introduce you to the students.

585
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Your majesty.

586
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
I am a great show-off.

587
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
The purpose of the school is to...

588
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,240
It seems that the emperor is a real killer.

589
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,240
He has a good character.

590
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
The painting is a good example.

591
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
It's a good example.

592
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,240
The dance is a good example.

593
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
The horse is a good example.

594
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,240
The dance is a good example.

595
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
The dance is a good example.

596
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,240
The dance is a good example.

597
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,240
Your highness.

598
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,240
The emperor is here again.

599
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Again?

600
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
Your majesty.

601
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,240
Go.

602
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
Yes, your majesty.

603
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,240
I am so happy.

604
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,240
I have not been so happy for a long time.

605
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,240
The academy of honor and honor

606
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,240
has successfully helped me.

607
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,240
Sit.

608
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,240
I don't remember when the pain

609
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,240
that I had never been so much like this last time

610
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
was.

611
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,240
The emperor's body of the dragon robe

612
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,240
seems to have been cut off from the body.

613
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,240
It doesn't belong to itself.

614
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,240
It's a tight cut.

615
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Today, in front of the princess,

616
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,240
I dare to take a break for a moment.

617
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,240
Come.

618
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,240
Congratulations on your victory.

619
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
I have never thought that

620
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,240
I would be able to work with you one day.

621
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
Who said that?

622
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
The more the red line is drawn,

623
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
the closer you and Ling'er get together,

624
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,240
I will work hard

625
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,240
to take you to the court.

626
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
You said that

627
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,240
if two years ago,

628
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,240
I didn't get to this position,

629
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
what would happen now?

630
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
You are right.

631
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
I actually don't want to.

632
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,240
I only wanted to see Zou Tianya.

633
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Never mind.

634
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
It's too obvious.

635
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
If you don't want to be called emperor,

636
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
what does the dragon robe do?

637
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,240
Back then,

638
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,240
the emperor's body of the dragon robe was cut off.

639
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,240
The emperor's body of the dragon robe

640
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
had been cut off.

641
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
The emperor's body of the dragon robe

642
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
had been cut off.

643
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,240
All the parties couldn't stand it.

644
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
In the end,

645
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
I was the only one who pushed the emperor

646
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
into the position of emperor.

647
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,240
If you really don't want to, you can leave.

648
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,240
But you don't.

649
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,240
You still want to.

650
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,240
I've been fighting here all the way.

651
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,240
I just hope that this battle won't continue.

652
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,240
This road is the capital of the imperial army.

653
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,240
I've seen so many faces.

654
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:22,240
They don't have light, hope, and care.

655
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,240
This moment is so lucky that I've got half a liver.

656
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,240
The next moment is when I'm stabbed.

657
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,240
But this is not the way life is.

658
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,240
Don't scare me.

659
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Please don't scare me.

660
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
Don't be scared.

661
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,240
Where's your family?

662
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,240
I'm gone.

663
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
I'll take you home.

664
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,240
I'm coming.

665
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,240
Don't worry.

666
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,240
I'll protect your safety.

667
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,240
I hope that the children have a chance to grow up.

668
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,240
I can be myself in the family.

669
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,240
This is the most normal day.

670
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,240
I'll be able to count the number of people I've separated.

671
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,240
This yellow lantern is hidden in the endless darkness.

672
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,240
You put the lantern on me.

673
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,240
Do you know what you want to sing?

674
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
Yes.

675
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,240
I want to sing freedom and happiness.

676
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:53,240
I want to sing myself the most important step.

677
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,240
I'm trapped in this for the rest of my life.

678
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,240
I can't compare to the dead and the dead.

679
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,240
But someone told me...

680
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,240
To be the emperor of Langlang...

681
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,240
To be the emperor of Anying...

682
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,240
To be the emperor of the empire...

683
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,240
To be the emperor of Wan'an...

684
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
Do you know?

685
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Yes.

686
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,240
You haven't drunk for a long time.

687
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,240
Are you okay?

688
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,240
But you got a wound.

689
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,240
How would he know that I have a wound?

690
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,240
He wouldn't know who I am.

691
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,240
Come on.

692
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,240
I'm not here to save you.

693
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,240
Yuezhi.

694
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
Yue Fei.

695
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
I remember.

696
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Yuezhi is dead.

697
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,240
I personally shot the arrow.

698
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,240
It was in the eye.

699
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,240
I'm kidding.

700
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,240
Sit.

701
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,240
His sword skills are not good.

702
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,240
I did it on purpose.

703
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,240
Why?

704
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,240
It's a rare talent.

705
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,240
I can't bear to let him die.

706
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,240
I didn't expect that if he didn't go crazy...

707
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,240
I deliberately avoided the poison.

708
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,240
I only used three layers of power.

709
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,240
He's still dead.

710
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,240
He's too drunk.

711
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,240
I didn't...

712
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,240
What?

713
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
His Majesty is drunk.

714
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,240
He's not listening to me.

715
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,240
I don't know who he is.

716
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,240
But it turns out that way.

717
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,240
I didn't see him on the battlefield.

718
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,240
He gave me a chance to save him.

719
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,240
I owe him a favor.

720
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,240
Yue Fei.

721
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,240
Actually...

722
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,240
I did it for you.

723
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,240
I'll change my clothes.

724
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,240
You won't eat it.

725
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,240
I did it for you.

726
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,240
I can accept everything around you.

727
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,240
Including your brother.

728
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,240
If you know where he is now...

729
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,240
you can let him show up.

730
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,240
I will definitely protect him.

731
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,240
He's still not the same.

732
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,240
He can still be the Prime Minister of Da Ning.

733
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,240
He'll be a burden.

734
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,240
I'll make Da Ning out of him.

735
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,240
I'll make you pay for it.

736
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,240
Why are you so crazy?

737
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,240
I'm the Prime Minister of the Front.

738
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,240
I'm just a living man.

739
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,240
I'm not interested in dying.

740
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
What did you say?

741
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,240
I'm so touched.
