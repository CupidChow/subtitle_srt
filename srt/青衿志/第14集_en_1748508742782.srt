1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If victory is not decided, let me fight

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The wind and moon are in the human world

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The youth is known as the old youth

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The past is the past, the past is the past

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
A sword falls and the wind flies

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Spring breeze is like a leaf

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,260
The

8
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,000
Legend of Fei

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 16

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Your Highness, please speak directly.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yue Chen, I want you to follow me to Li State

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and be the Prime Minister of Li State.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Your Highness, you're joking.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yue Chen is a citizen of Ning State.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
How can he be the official of Li State?

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I have Wei State's Zhang Yi.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He has been to Zhao State and made a great achievement.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Your talent is better than Zhang Yi.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Why can't you?

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But Zhang Yi is finally returning to his homeland.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's because he doesn't like King of Qin and Wu.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He is afraid of Wei State.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is the way to survive.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Do you dare to promise that

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
in the future, the future King of Li State

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
will not treat King of Wu like he treats Zhang Yi?

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Treat Yue Chen like that.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,520
I can't be too

29
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,000
biased. I understand the principle of one king and one minister.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yue Chen, you and Huo Jing Heng

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
are like soldiers.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Two different starting points

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
even if the destination is the same

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
it's easy to be divided into two sides.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Huo Jing Heng is not the same as the previous

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Xia Ke Cao.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He needs your help now.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He can tolerate you.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But what about the future?

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I think you have thought about

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
what I said.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So many past and present events

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
your relationship with Huo Jing Heng

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
will not be old.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Your current status

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
is not a kind of concession?

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
When the knife is unbreakable

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
what do you think?

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yue Chen,

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
your dream is also mine.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We have achieved it together in the Li State.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you still have any concerns

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I promise you

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
when I get on the big treasure

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I will leave a secret paper

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and a single iron scroll

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
to protect you from the past.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Zhang Yi's past experience

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
will not happen to you.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yue Chen,

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
you think about it.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I will wait for your answer.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I am not feeling well.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I will leave first.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Commander, do you believe him?

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Of course not.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Your Majesty.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I heard

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
the Crown Prince

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
was being watched by someone.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He wanted to find out

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
who the bride was.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I didn't expect it to be Prime Minister Yue.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yi Qing Yun is really an old fox.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He arranged for people to buy

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
a special shop in the palace.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He said that someone in the most famous

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
zhezi opera house

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
was drunk and didn't drink.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You are really worth it, Yue Chi.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Come on.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's drink.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Don't waste it.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yue Chen.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You are not going to marry me?

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I will go.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't want to marry you.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I am not going to marry you.

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I will go.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I will go.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I will go.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I will go.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I will go.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I will go.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I will go.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I will go.

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I will go.

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I will go.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I will go.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Your Majesty.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't say anything.

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't say anything.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Drink.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Drink.

105
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,720
extra

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Min Fong.

107
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,600
Bi Sha, you are awake.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Where am I?

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,200
What time is it?

110
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,400
This is the Prince of Anle's mansion

111
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,600
It's getting late

112
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,800
But today is the last day of the month

113
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,200
Yesterday, the wine was too strong

114
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,800
You didn't drink a few cups and you got drunk

115
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,600
I asked the Prime Minister to send you here to settle down

116
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
The family is waiting outside the mansion

117
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,000
The house is also prepared for lunch

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,600
The emperor used it here to go back to the palace directly

119
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Let's eat and leave

120
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Yes

121
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,000
Sun Ziyuan

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,400
The soldier

123
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
The country's great cause

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,800
The place of death

125
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
The path of survival

126
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,000
You can't leave without tea

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,200
Okay, okay, Xiaoshu

128
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,800
Drink some water and rest

129
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,400
Where is this place?

130
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,800
We are good at our novel, right?

131
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,600
Look at them

132
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,400
What a proud family

133
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,600
Since when

134
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,200
I have had such a time

135
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,000
What?

136
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Their marriage has long been canceled

137
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
You are the family

138
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,400
Where is the heart?

139
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Where is the family?

140
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,000
It's getting late, let's go back to the palace

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,200
The emperor is leaving

142
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,800
I will go to the palace to settle down

143
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,600
No need, we still have things to do

144
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,000
Let's go

145
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,200
Our novel is the best

146
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,800
Ming Tian, you can change it yourself

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,800
Why are you here to see me?

148
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,200
Is there something wrong?

149
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,800
You are still saying

150
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
The ministers couldn't find you this morning

151
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
They all came to poison me and the Empress Dowager

152
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Today is the day of the tomb-raising

153
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,000
Did they find something to reflect on?

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,400
There is really something

155
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,000
The whole city is in chaos

156
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Why can't we eat?

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We were dragged by the ministers

158
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
And just now, he

159
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,000
You know, right?

160
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,800
I know

161
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Rise

162
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
I heard that

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Your Majesty hasn't eaten water rice for half a day

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I brought some new dishes from the kitchen

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
To give you

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I ate too much yesterday

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,600
I have no appetite

168
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,400
You have no appetite

169
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Or you are not in the mood?

170
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,000
Yue Fei is too strict

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,400
Yes, yes, yes

172
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,000
I am too stupid to say anything wrong

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,400
It's not like my brother

174
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Is a very considerate person

175
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,000
To talk to the Emperor

176
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,000
When my brother was the Yue Fei

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,600
His Majesty is much more relaxed than now

178
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,800
If only my brother was by his side

179
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,000
Right?

180
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,000
Or else

181
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Or else His Majesty would have asked my brother

182
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
To be the Yue Fei for two days

183
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,600
He is now

184
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,000
With the old time, long separation and reunion

185
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,400
There is also a long-standing longing in the house

186
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,400
I am afraid that he is too distracted by me

187
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,400
What are you talking about?

188
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,800
His Majesty's affairs

189
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,000
Are always state affairs, major affairs

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,400
My brother's life

191
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Is a bit delayed

192
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,800
Then why didn't he come to me

193
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,400
To discuss major matters?

194
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Your Majesty

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,200
The Minister of War is discussing with the Ministry of War

196
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,800
And the Ministry of Revenue

197
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,400
Is His Majesty here?

198
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Look

199
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Am I right?

200
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,200
My brother has changed a lot

201
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,800
His Majesty's appetite has changed a lot

202
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,600
He is much better than the Imperial Physician and the medicine

203
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,600
Let him wait

204
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,200
I want to eat first

205
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Yes

206
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Wait

207
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,200
Give this

208
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,800
To the Prime Minister and the music hall

209
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Order the Ministry of War to take three steps

210
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,200
To cooperate with them

211
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Yes

212
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,600
Let's go

213
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
This

214
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
Only two dishes?

215
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Yes

216
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Didn't I just say it's a new dish?

217
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,000
I'll give it to you first

218
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,000
You're going to check in, right?

219
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,480
Qi city is in a tight dogfight.

220
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,480
At present, Dibar is destroyed and collapsed.

221
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,520
Now the current promptly caused major floods.

222
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,360
Cancelling the capital area.

223
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,400
His Majesty made an order

224
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
to send a team of people and horses

225
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,720
to escort the manor dancers and workers.

226
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,600
The clothes must arrived second to arriveத

227
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,840
be arrived before a cold day.

228
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,720
I will inform the husbands to maintain Dibar.

229
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,120
We must summon and escort theuestos.

230
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
Also,

231
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,240
You sneakily went down leads

232
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,140
from Frost noodle house

233
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,160
to Temple of Moon.

234
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,320
I see.

235
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Who is the bold one?

236
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
I found there is another one.

237
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
But it's a mistake.

238
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Yes.

239
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
What's wrong?

240
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Say something.

241
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
You don't know what's wrong with him?

242
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Again?

243
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Prime Minister Yue's aesthetic is very simple.

244
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,400
The crown prince doesn't invite himself.

245
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
What?

246
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
You are afraid of being told by others?

247
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
It's a coincidence.

248
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,400
I happened to meet you at that time.

249
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
It's not a coincidence.

250
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
It's my intention.

251
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,400
What did you think about what I said that day?

252
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
I don't agree.

253
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
You are not sincere.

254
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
You almost put me in the mirror of rebellion.

255
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
If his majesty were to be angry,

256
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
would you protect me?

257
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Prince Ning wouldn't.

258
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Why do you want me, your highness?

259
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Prime Minister Yue is good at fighting.

260
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
He was good at war when he was young.

261
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,400
He can help Ning to take away Li's ten cities.

262
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,400
He can help me to take back ten cities.

263
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Li's ten cities are already old.

264
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,400
So this sick boy is the one who made this idea.

265
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Li's ten cities have always been my father's hatred.

266
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Now my father is sick.

267
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,400
I just want to help him to finish his last wish.

268
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
If I remember correctly,

269
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,400
Prince Li died three times in a year.

270
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Then he suddenly got the disease.

271
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,400
It's said that it's all from your hand.

272
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
You are just filial.

273
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
It's so random.

274
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Or you are just responsible for handling the funeral?

275
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,400
I just want Li's country to be back to peace.

276
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,400
It's a pity that my brothers don't fight for it.

277
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,400
It's a pity that my brothers don't fight for it.

278
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Only I can do it.

279
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
My father is old.

280
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
He doesn't understand.

281
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
He even sent me to Ning.

282
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,400
I stayed in Qianning for five years.

283
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Luckily, the god blessed me with a great gift.

284
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
I have been planning for many times.

285
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Finally, I can go back to the country.

286
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
I will rebuild Chaogang.

287
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Your highness is so filial.

288
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
I don't care about Li's country.

289
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
I just pretend that I didn't hear it.

290
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,400
If you are willing to follow me,

291
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
I will confess all my feelings.

292
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,400
No need.

293
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
I still have some medicine to deal with today.

294
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
You'd better go back.

295
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Okay.

296
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
I'm not a man who can't be controlled.

297
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
If you want to change your mind,

298
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
I will wait for you.

299
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
I will go back.

300
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
I have to go back.

301
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Keke.

302
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
So bad.

303
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Shuo.

304
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Brother Yue.

305
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
You are my friend.

306
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
I don't like you.

307
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
Shuo.

308
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Do you know who he is?

309
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
You know him?

310
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
I don't think he is a man who can be controlled.

311
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Keke.

312
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
I don't like him.

313
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
I have to be full of him.

314
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Brother Yue said that

315
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
he loves his brothers.

316
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,400
He hates his father.

317
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
He is unfilial.

318
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
He doesn't care about the peace.

319
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
He wants to fight for the truth.

320
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
He is unfilial.

321
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
He is a man of great power.

322
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
But he doesn't know that he is the king.

323
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
He is a man of great power.

324
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
He is unfilial.

325
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
He is Li's king.

326
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
People of Li State

327
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
have no good days.

328
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Shuo.

329
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
You have grown up.

330
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
You don't have to study with your teacher.

331
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
The one who taught me the most is not my teacher.

332
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
It's Brother Yue.

333
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,400
You two are a perfect match.

334
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
This letter is sent by Prince Man.

335
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
It's in the medicine bag.

336
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
I didn't expect Prince Man of Wilderness to cause a disaster.

337
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
It's a good deal.

338
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
But he got up too early.

339
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
The good show has just started.

340
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
Today, the teacher has sent people

341
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,400
to Qichen to deliver food.

342
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
If you go from Huangcheng to Qicheng,

343
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
Qinhu Mountain is a must.

344
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
If so,

345
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Prince Man will do something wrong again.

346
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Master, you should drink the medicine first.

347
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Drink it before you go.

348
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Okay.

349
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
From the back of the novel to the back of the horse,

350
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
all happened in the early days of Yi Qingyun.

351
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
Will all this be the same as Yi Qingyun?

352
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
I just want to make a move.

353
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
To return to the peaceful world 100 years ago.

354
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
If so,

355
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,400
what's his next plan?

356
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Master,

357
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
I'll tell you what I just said.

358
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
Okay.

359
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
The mountain is getting fuller.

360
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
Fellow fellow villagers,

361
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
don't be anxious.

362
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
Everyone has it.

363
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
General.

364
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
General, bad news.

365
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
The food team reported that

366
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
the brothers were on their way to Qinhu Mountain.

367
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
A group of wild bandits suddenly appeared in the mountain.

368
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
They were fighting with the brothers.

369
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
When they were fighting,

370
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
someone's torch lit a car.

371
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
All the food was burned.

372
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
The brothers are still fixing it.

373
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Huangcheng is sending a car again.

374
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
If you don't rob the street,

375
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
you can't get food.

376
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
There's no such thing as killing bandits.

377
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
General.

378
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
You're deliberately trying to get food.

379
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
General.

380
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
You're deliberately trying to get food.

381
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
General,

382
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
we can't get people in the yard.

383
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Someone sent a message to the front yard.

384
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
The rice mill on the hill is empty.

385
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
If this continues,

386
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
we can't survive.

387
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
We have a way.

388
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Your Majesty,

389
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
I have a report.

390
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
The white wolf Cao Ma

391
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
entered Huangcheng without any sign.

392
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
He was disrespectful to the superior.

393
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Now he deliberately blew up the dam.

394
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
This led to the flood in Qicheng.

395
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
The food team was stopped outside the city.

396
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
I think it was caused by him.

397
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
He is scheming.

398
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Please punish him, Your Majesty.

399
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
I already know this.

400
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
But now,

401
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
the flood in Qicheng is everywhere.

402
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
At present,

403
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,400
solving the flood is the most important thing.

404
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
When the flood in Qicheng is over,

405
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
we can catch Cao Mao.

406
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Your Majesty,

407
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
I want to ask General Zhen Nan

408
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,400
to send the food to the refugees

409
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
a few days ago.

410
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Now he has been imprisoned.

411
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
He is still in Huangcheng.

412
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Isn't this a riot?

413
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Yes.

414
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
If he were to do this,

415
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
how can we resist?

416
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
Is there any law

417
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
in General Zhen Nan's eyes?

418
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
Your Majesty,

419
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
General Zhen Nan

420
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
dared to release the food today

421
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
and raise the army tomorrow.

422
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,400
He is not a man of the court.

423
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
He just passed away.

424
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
But he is not just a scapegoat.

425
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,400
I beg Your Majesty to punish him.

426
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Kill the bad guys and kill the good guys.

427
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,400
I beg Your Majesty to punish General Zhen Nan.

428
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,400
You are wrong.

429
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
General Zhen Nan

430
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
did this to

431
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
catch the refugees.

432
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,400
If I kill him,

433
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
wouldn't it

434
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,400
be a big loss

435
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
to the refugees

436
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
who have been tortured

437
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
by the good guys

438
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
of the people?

439
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
You are right.

440
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,400
I will kill him.

441
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
I will kill him.

442
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,520
and suffer the suffering of the victims

443
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
Your Majesty, although you are the new ruler

444
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,200
you can practice the law and practice the governance

445
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,520
and you have your own principles

446
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,720
Please don't be so arrogant

447
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,400
I'm not a son of a servant

448
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,240
How can I be arrogant?

449
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,760
The decision is made

450
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,200
You don't have to care about it

451
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Pass my decree

452
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,160
to cut off the salary of the general of Zhen Nan

453
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
and fill the treasury

454
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,280
Dismiss

455
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,000
Dismiss

456
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,160
See you, Your Majesty

457
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,840
The dependents who play the zither

458
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,200
уч green all the evidences

459
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,160
rear India

460
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,720
including the emperor

461
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,240
The late emperor

462
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,720
Send these memorials to me

463
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,640
Where to give them back

464
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,480
and in my place

465
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,960
These long ago

466
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,480
Are under control

467
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,400
No, FU CONDIS doesn't have paid

468
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,120
the feast

469
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
The 40th mother

470
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,880
You are right

471
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,360
However

472
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,960
the firth mother

473
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,420
I heard

474
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,260
His Majesty pardoned the death of General Zhen Nan

475
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,780
Not only upset some old ministers

476
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,340
This is not military provision

477
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,780
It's a dead rule set by hundreds of years

478
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,740
If His Majesty really wants to

479
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,740
Look at it with the whole court

480
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,180
Afraid he

481
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,380
Have to suffer some pain

482
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,860
So say

483
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,300
Find him as soon as possible

484
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,820
Help him understand him

485
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,900
Come

486
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,260
You came

487
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,660
You made a coup yesterday

488
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,780
You never API

489
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:31,560
And never

490
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:40,020
I allow you to send troops to arrest General Zhen Nan in the prison in your name.

491
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,020
Yue Chi!

492
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,420
This is a crime of deceiving the Emperor!

493
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,820
Do you not want your head?

494
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,020
I know you will be angry.

495
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,620
I took the risk of my life to do this.

496
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,220
I can't watch you make mistakes.

497
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:09,220
General Zhen Nan saved Qi City's people in danger.

498
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,820
This is a good deed!

499
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,220
I ordered him to make up for his own mistakes. Why did you have to save him?

500
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:22,220
Yue Chi, I thought you understood me.

501
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,620
What you said is right.

502
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,620
But General Zhen Nan is the pride of the country.

503
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,020
Qi City is the capital of our Great Ning.

504
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,420
His Majesty is above the high-ranking court.

505
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,220
He shouldn't only see the people of General Zhen Nan and Qi City's plight.

506
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,220
He should also see the whole Great Ning.

507
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,420
The military resources are at stake.

508
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,620
If the border is not protected, it will be more than a city of people.

509
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,620
Don't talk to me about this.

510
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,020
Now the situation is stable.

511
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,620
Why is the border not protected?

512
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,820
The Crown Prince of Li State is still in our Great Ning Imperial City.

513
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,420
He is worried about the time that will be divided into our Great Ning.

514
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,620
He dared to come here alone.

515
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:08,020
Does that mean he is not going to come?

516
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,420
It's the rule not to touch military supplies.

517
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,620
Don't talk to me about rules, Uncle Lin.

518
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,420
I am the new emperor.

519
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,420
I am not that arrogant.

520
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,020
You are not the former emperor.

521
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,620
You are the current emperor.

522
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,820
You are just a commoner.

523
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,620
I hope that the children will have a chance to grow up.

524
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,820
The old people can grow up in their own home.

525
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,420
Isn't this the most normal and normal life?

526
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,420
You have the lives of countless people.

527
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,620
Cao Meng escaped and went back to the Great Ning.

528
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,820
This person doesn't have such a means.

529
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,420
There must be a clear reason behind it.

530
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,420
If we let the people of Wei State take the chance,

531
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,820
it's hard to guarantee that there won't be another war.

532
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,020
If Your Majesty can easily pardon General Zheng Nan,

533
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,220
I am afraid that everyone will laugh at the clear reason.

534
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,420
It will surely cause great trouble.

535
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,620
I...

536
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,020
don't want to repeat this.

537
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,820
Your Majesty.

538
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,620
The people of Wei State are for the sake of the world.

539
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,620
We must be cautious.

540
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,660
...

541
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,020
Yue Chi.

542
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,620
You just have to understand my situation for one more time.

543
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,620
One more time.

544
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,820
Stand up.

545
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,820
I...

546
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:05,820
I can't die.

547
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,820
Then kneel!

548
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,820
Don't get up! Kneel!

549
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,820
Prime Minister Yue, what are you doing?

550
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,820
Prime Minister Yue, I'm sorry.

551
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,820
I'm sorry.

552
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,820
I'm sorry.

553
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,820
I'm sorry.

554
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,820
I'm sorry.

555
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,820
I'm sorry.

556
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,820
I'm sorry.

557
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,820
I'm sorry.

558
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,820
I'm sorry.

559
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,820
I'm sorry.

560
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,820
I'm sorry.

561
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,820
I'm sorry.

562
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,820
I'm sorry.

563
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,820
I'm sorry.

564
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,820
I'm sorry.

565
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,820
I'm sorry.

566
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,820
I'm sorry.

567
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,820
I'm so sorry.

568
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,260
I'm sorry.

569
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,820
Please forgive me!

570
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,820
No...

571
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,820
Don't.

572
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,820
Please forgive me, I'm sorry.

573
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:26,700
It's all my fault.

574
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Please forgive me.

575
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:52,280
Our

576
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
Without a single soldier Gang members

577
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,940
Are you afraid that внутри will kill you

578
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,720
He said

579
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,080
It's not the time to take this poisonous snake

580
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:08,380
to ask

581
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,480
Aren't you afraid of death

582
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:09,920
and prepare to go out

583
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,220
for a table meeting

584
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,100
You're afraid you'll die

585
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,880
Egg is not allowed

586
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,800
Church Government

587
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,940
Against the country and the public

588
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,600
it's possible to get drunk

589
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,920
The world combined

590
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
I don't want to, but I don't want to

591
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,920
I don't want to

592
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,920
This thing

593
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Dad is determined to die

594
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,920
But you are

595
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,920
To save that day

596
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,920
If there is no one

597
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,920
These rules are for who

598
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,920
Just ignore

599
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,920
Your face

600
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,920
They say there is no rule

601
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,920
To help people

602
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,920
But why do you want to save this day

603
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,920
To save this day

604
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,920
I broke the old grass

605
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,920
And created this new world

606
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,920
Now I

607
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,920
Am the leader of this world

608
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,920
The new rule

609
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,920
Should be mine

610
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,920
If you don't understand these

611
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,920
You can't drink

612
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,920
I can't stay with you

613
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
Yue Chengxiang

614
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,920
His Majesty said that the matter of General Zhengyang

615
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,920
Is settled

616
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,920
You are kneeling and accompanying me

617
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,920
I don't want to

618
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,920
Turn around

619
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
How innocent

620
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,920
I don't want to

621
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Turn around

622
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,920
Yue Chi

623
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,920
I thought you understood

624
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,920
They say there is no rule

625
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,920
To help people

626
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,920
The old rule

627
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,920
Why do you want to break up

628
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,920
I broke the old grass

629
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
And created this new world

630
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,920
Now I am the leader of this world

631
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,920
The new rule

632
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,920
Should be mine

633
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,920
Chushan

634
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,920
Why are you here

635
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,920
His Majesty just ordered

636
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,920
To send General Zhengyang

637
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,920
To escort him out of the city

638
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
What

639
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
We need to stop the carriage

640
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,920
To escort General Zhengyang out of the city

641
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,920
No, you are wet

642
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,920
To Zhao Yu

643
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,920
It's too late

644
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,920
You sent someone to suppress General Zhengyang

645
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,920
Just arrived in Zhao Yu

646
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,920
Now

647
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,920
Where is he

648
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,920
Hiding

649
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,920
The people in the palace are all talking

650
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,920
But I promise I will give you back the message in two hours

651
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,920
Where is my sister

652
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,920
I just came back

653
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,920
You ask me

654
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,920
Sister is missing

655
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,920
My brother-in-law just had lunch

656
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,920
And went back to his room to sleep

657
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,920
I found no one in the room

658
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,920
Prepare the horse

659
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,920
Qing

660
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Qing

661
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,920
Come

662
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,920
Qing

663
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,920
Are you hurt

664
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,920
I am just

665
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,920
In the room

666
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,920
It's good that you are not hurt

667
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,920
Why are you here

668
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Suddenly

669
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,920
Something is on your mind

670
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,920
What you want to say

671
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,920
I feel guilty

672
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,920
I want to talk to you

673
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,920
I didn't expect

674
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,920
What's wrong

675
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,920
What happened

676
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
What happened

677
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,920
Why are you looking at me like this

678
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,920
Nothing

679
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,920
Just feel

680
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,920
You are a little different

681
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,920
You are a little different

682
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,920
You are a little different

683
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,920
Gongsun

684
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,920
You are in the Prime Minister's mansion now

685
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,920
You are having a good time

686
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,920
No

687
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,920
I just want to get the news

688
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,920
So I am with Yue Zhi Xu Yu

689
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,920
In fact

690
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,920
We have a long-standing relationship

691
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,920
Then you talk

692
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,920
What did you find out

693
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,920
The code of the General of the Ye's Sector

694
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Has been entered into the Chaoyue

695
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,920
But I don't know why

696
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,920
The imperial guards

697
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,920
Borrowed data

698
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,920
I only heard

699
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,920
So much

700
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,920
No

701
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,120
Let's go

702
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,320
Help me

703
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,080
Xiao...)

704
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
I'll take you home

705
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
There is no including

706
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,440
The gate is拍

707
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
Hurry up.

708
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
Hurry up.

709
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,440
Get me a car.

710
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
Sister.

711
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
Xiaoshuang,

712
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,440
get a doctor for Qingyuan.

713
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
I have an emergency.

714
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
I'm leaving now.

715
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
Yes.

716
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,440
I'm leaving now.

717
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,440
I'm leaving now.

718
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
I'm leaving now.

719
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
I'm leaving now.

720
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
I'm leaving now.

721
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
I'm leaving now.

722
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,440
I'm leaving now.

723
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
I'm leaving now.

724
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,440
What?

725
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,440
What're you doing?

726
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
Your Majesty!

727
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Kill the false commander general.

728
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
The regime is on tide.

729
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
Your Majesty!

730
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,440
You are an emperor!

731
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,440
Do you want to understand the right and the wrong?

732
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Yes, of course.

733
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,240
Your Majesty, I can only do this because of me.

734
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,000
Please change your mind.

735
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,840
General Zhen Nan released the army.

736
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,360
He has given the order.

737
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,160
If you insist on sending him away,

738
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,960
then let this carriage pass through me.

739
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,400
I have no complaints.

740
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,000
Good.

741
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,200
You threaten me so much.

742
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,280
You think I can't do it?

743
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,000
I dare not.

744
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I dare not.

745
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,600
Your Majesty, when Yuan Liang was captured,

746
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,520
I opened the military storage without permission.

747
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,480
I understand.

748
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,880
You have no other choice.

749
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,120
I know my mistake and I made it.

750
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,320
I don't care about the military plan.

751
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,120
I beg you to punish me.

752
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,720
I came to protect you personally.

753
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,040
Your Majesty,

754
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:15,880
opening the military storage is a crime.

755
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,160
I have thought about it since the moment I opened the storage.

756
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,440
Military supplies are spare.

757
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,840
You saved the lives of the people.

758
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,320
If I kill you today,

759
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,600
will there be another officer in Da Ning?

760
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,800
Will the people live?

761
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,400
What?

762
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,680
When the war starts,

763
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,040
there will be more than 10,000 people.

764
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,920
Shut up!

765
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,200
General!
