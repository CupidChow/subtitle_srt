1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If victory is not decided, let me fight

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The wind and moon are in the air, the youth is old

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The past is the past, the past is the past

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The wind and moon are in the air, the youth is old

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The past is the past, the past is the past

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Legend of Chusen

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Episode 16

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
How long have we been walking in this forest?

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Can we still walk out of this forest?

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I don't know

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Can we still eat the yellow-spotted fish in my sister's palace?

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Du Tianzhao, stop talking

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The more you talk, the more you drink

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Look, look, there are fruits

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You eat, Ling'er

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not hungry, you eat

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You eat

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You eat

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You eat

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Sour

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's look for more

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Ling'er

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Ling'er

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Ling'er

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We are in Datong

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We walked out of the forest

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What's wrong with you, Ling'er?

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm embarrassed

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I ate the worms I ate these days

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I was sweating in my stomach

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Can you still hold on?

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's important to find my brother now

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I can't stay here

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Help me up

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Ling'er, drink some hot water

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm so tired

37
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll go see if there's anything to eat

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I've arranged for you to eat

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You can find it here

40
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Are you sleeping?

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Then I'll go quickly

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Something better than the poison is coming

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What?

44
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You guess

45
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm already like this, you want me to guess?

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm tired

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Meat buns, still hot

48
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Why are you crying?

49
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Sister

50
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't know

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Sister

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Brother He is in Dayou, right?

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
If it wasn't me

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He would have cooked for us

55
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Delicious buns

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Then

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Sister Yingqin came to the house

58
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Do you know?

59
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
She also likes to eat

60
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Meat buns

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I thought

62
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We would be happy

63
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Good

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Just like this

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Keep going

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why?

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Why is everyone lying?

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Du Tianzhao

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I want to marry

70
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I want to have a brother

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I want to have a brother

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I want to have a brother

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I miss them

74
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Your family is still here

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Uncle Liu is still here

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He can cook a lot of buns for you later

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't want to eat by myself

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I want everyone

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I want everyone to eat together

81
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Sister

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Guests

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This is a female guest

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
She told me to make some medicine

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
For you

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Female guest

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Where is she?

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
She left with the money

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You can stay longer

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Let me tell you

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's late now

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You can go back by yourself

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Sister

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I care about you

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Do you need a horse cart?

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I can't

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm full

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You eat too

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'll go help you

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Bring the medicine

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Eat it while it's hot

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Still looking for food?

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Find it

105
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Must find

106
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Go

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You can go

108
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yes

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Wait

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Leave one

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Just you

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Come and make me a pan

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Where did the little lady come from?

114
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
She doesn't even have glasses

115
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm going to the hospital

116
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll go with you

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Go

118
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Go

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Go

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Go

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Go

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Go

123
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Go

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Go

125
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Go

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Go

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Go

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Go

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Go

130
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Go

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Go

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Go

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Go

134
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Go

135
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Go

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Go

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Go

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Go

139
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Go

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Go

141
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Go

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Go

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Go

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Long time no see

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Do you want to come to have a look?

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The border is tight

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The national treasury is short

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Those officials

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Do you think

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Remove Yue family

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Remove the Qilin army

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,360
will Dining really be peaceful forever?

153
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,840
The Ministry of War has sent troops,

154
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,080
and the Ministry of Revenue hasn't been paid yet.

155
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,440
But the army from Li is coming.

156
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,720
Do you have any idea?

157
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,440
If we face it face-to-face,

158
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,200
I'm afraid it will be a burden on the people and the people.

159
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,640
It's also easy to lose our lives.

160
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,440
General.

161
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,800
The Crown Prince of Li

162
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,280
thought he could take me as a king.

163
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,120
But he actually missed a trick.

164
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,080
What?

165
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,400
The northwest army that was famous

166
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,760
was hiding in the Fengming Mountain on the border.

167
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,480
The people of Li thought

168
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,560
that they could break in and enter Fengming Mountain

169
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,680
by changing the route to attack Fengming Mountain.

170
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,280
But as long as my grandfather is willing to go out of the mountain,

171
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,840
I will definitely teach them a big lesson.

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,640
There's something I haven't figured out.

173
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,200
General Du is famous.

174
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,840
Why didn't he attend the court these years?

175
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,160
Why do you feel so guilty?

176
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,120
Are you really going in?

177
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,320
Grandfather, I have to take this step.

178
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,920
We led the troops to the east

179
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,920
to protect the land and the people.

180
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,440
You entered the palace.

181
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,720
How is this an east?

182
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,000
This is rebellion.

183
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,480
What's the difference between this and the rebels who took the power?

184
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
If I can keep the peace,

185
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,360
I'd rather stay in the capital and be scolded.

186
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,160
Later, my grandfather didn't like my idea.

187
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,040
He chose to turn back and tell me.

188
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,400
I chose to enter the city to be the emperor.

189
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,960
This is a farewell to the people.

190
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,640
We have never been together these years.

191
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,880
I only know that he lives in the Fengming Mountain.

192
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,960
But I'm not afraid of him.

193
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,960
This old man is not afraid of him?

194
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,640
What do you think?

195
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,000
How do you plan to persuade him to send troops?

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,880
I'll try.

197
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,280
If I can't, I'll be scared.

198
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,600
The northwest army is best at the mountain forest.

199
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Surrounding Li Army in this valley is the best.

200
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,680
But now that Li Army lives on the mountain road,

201
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,680
it's hard for us to travel there.

202
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,480
We have to get in touch with my grandfather first.

203
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,960
How can I be so ungrateful?

204
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,560
To be able to break this Li Army's camp?

205
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,880
Since the Li Crown Prince has been interested in you for so long,

206
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Yuechi, you should respond.

207
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
Me?

208
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,160
The Qilin Army is already in the field.

209
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,560
The court officials won't give up easily.

210
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,640
Yuechi's private army must be the traitor.

211
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,040
We must deal with them.

212
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,040
We'll take this opportunity to split up.

213
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,840
Kill all the Qilin Army here!

214
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
Du Guoxiang!

215
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,440
You came to calm the anger of the people and to stabilize the court.

216
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,440
Aren't you leaving?

217
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:27,440
Du måste write an statement.

218
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,040
Boss, this is all between you and me.

219
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,200
General Du, we three should work together

220
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,960
and beat them to death.

221
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,880
Your Majesty is wise.

222
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,160
Just so so.

223
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,760
The wine from Li Dynasty

224
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,440
doesn't have the fragrance of Daning.

225
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,280
What a nice weather.

226
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,640
Your Majesty can leave in the chaos.

227
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,080
The south-west is weak.

228
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,280
There are many obstacles.

229
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,840
I'll protect you.

230
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,240
It's so windy at night.

231
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,680
Prime Minister Yue is still in the moon.

232
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,120
Where are you going?

233
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,720
Long time no see, Ming Qing.

234
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,720
Maybe now

235
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,680
I should call you Officer Xue.

236
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,560
Really?

237
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,520
I am Officer Xue.

238
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,400
You are a man of no value.

239
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,720
What about you?

240
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,680
I'm enemies with Huo Jing Heng.

241
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,320
Now I'm the regent of Li Dynasty.

242
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,760
When I was in Xidu Bridge,

243
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,720
I put you in danger on purpose.

244
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,720
But you ruined my plan.

245
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,080
I regret it too.

246
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,120
I shouldn't have left so soon.

247
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,880
Really?

248
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,240
I'm a man of no value.

249
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
It's so dark.

250
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,800
I should go back to the tent

251
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,840
and shoot the regent.

252
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,200
It's my troubles.

253
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,680
I will get you dressed and nutrition only.

254
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,960
Send Yuehchi as the regent

255
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,120
and bring him to the camp.

256
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,380
Well...

257
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,080
Must I implaw some dealings with the princess?

258
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,200
Crown Prince.

259
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,960
Don't you really think

260
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,800
Yuehchi will surrender to you?

261
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,240
If you don't really want to kill him,

262
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
why did you fight back

263
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,760
and lure the Qilin Army?

264
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,040
That was just the first step of our plan.

265
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,720
You don't know Yue Chi.

266
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,000
He wouldn't betray you.

267
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,040
You don't know him.

268
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,880
If the man who was killed by Shi Ruo

269
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,280
killed him himself,

270
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,080
how would you feel?

271
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,120
Yan Na, you used to think of him.

272
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,480
Yue Chi is different from Huo Jing Hong.

273
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,000
Officer Xue,

274
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,360
are you mocking me?

275
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,280
I'm just being honest.

276
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,960
Do you

277
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,880
believe in Yue Chi

278
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,280
and have no doubts about him?

279
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,560
We're all acquaintances.

280
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,680
I don't think we need to introduce ourselves.

281
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,160
From now on, I can't live without you two.

282
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,400
I was blind about

283
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,160
all your past일� wat

284
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,440
Forgive me.

285
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,920
You're too collectible.

286
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,920
I hope we can

287
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,680
vanquish blow and ne똭rhole.

288
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,600
Thank you.

289
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,560
I know ar entrapped palace taker beating up

290
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,560
you again

291
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,060
Your Majesty

292
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,500
Do us a favor

293
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,620
I don't understand

294
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,520
It's not interested in formation

295
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,760
If it's interested in cognitive straps

296
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,000
trivia

297
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,280
Just a opinion

298
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,160
スマホ

299
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,660
pi sku

300
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,320
you still dare to come

301
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,160
Wait! Wait for me!

302
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,760
I'm not your prime minister.

303
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
You should be punished!

304
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Yes!

305
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,360
What are you looking at?

306
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,160
I didn't expect him to come back at this moment.

307
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,160
The current situation is very unfavorable to us.

308
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,160
If you were Yi Qing, what would you do?

309
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,160
Be a Jue?

310
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Yes.

311
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,160
The south of the camp suddenly has a few more mysterious tunnels.

312
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,160
You should be careful when you're trying to find a way out.

313
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,160
It hurts!

314
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,160
If you don't want to hurt yourself, try my secret medicine.

315
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,160
What?

316
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Your head is injured? You lost your memory?

317
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
You're not dead yet!

318
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,160
Here.

319
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,160
I didn't expect that we would meet here.

320
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Yes.

321
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,160
You returned to the Jiang family after a long journey.

322
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
I'm sorry.

323
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,160
You returned to the Jiang family again.

324
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,160
All these years, have you been by the Princess's side?

325
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
Yes.

326
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,160
The Princesses of the Imperial Palace have been looking for us.

327
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,160
All these years, I've been working for the Princess and the Crown Prince.

328
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
I just arrived at the camp.

329
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,160
I heard that you were here. I came immediately.

330
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
What about you?

331
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
How have you been?

332
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,160
From what I can see,

333
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,160
you've become like this.

334
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,160
When we helped the Qianning Dynasty together,

335
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
the Jiang family treated us well.

336
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
They were very generous.

337
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Later, we heard that you chose the Prince of Huo.

338
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,160
You chose to be the Crown Prince in Hengning.

339
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,160
You're loyal and filial.

340
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,160
When someone scolded you, the brothers scolded me.

341
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,160
I also said a few words for you.

342
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,160
But when I knew that you were the Prime Minister,

343
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,160
I didn't say anything.

344
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,160
Maybe this Jiang Shanxin is not important to you.

345
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Your position is the most important.

346
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
But I still don't understand

347
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,160
why you've become like this.

348
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
I just don't want to see thousands of people

349
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,160
being defeated by war.

350
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
Choosing Huo Jingheng

351
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
didn't violate my moral principles.

352
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Then Huo Jingheng is your so-called loyal and filial.

353
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,160
He lied to you and then abandoned you.

354
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,160
He turned you from a moon to a street.

355
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,160
Is this a good omen?

356
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
I'm not going to let you go.

357
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
I'm not going to let you go.

358
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,160
I'm not going to let you go.

359
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,160
We grew up together.

360
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,160
I was born not to be a rich person.

361
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,160
I must have been blinded by Huo Jingheng.

362
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,160
But it doesn't matter.

363
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,160
As long as you turn around, we'll always be here.

364
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
We can still be like before

365
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
and do our best for the Jiang family.

366
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,160
Don't think that Li Miao is a person we should rest assured.

367
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Be true.

368
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,160
That way, people can understand.

369
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Bless you.

370
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,160
Supernatural Spirit,

371
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,160
are you going to return to your life?

372
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,160
Yes, I am.

373
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,160
I believe you won't make a wrong choice.

374
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,040
Lord refrigeration

375
00:22:47,200 --> 00:23:00,980
Crown prince told

376
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,000
you to come to me

377
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,280
you should have known earlier

378
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,020
why you love me

379
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,160
did not you want me to leave the court

380
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,000
Leave Huo Qing performance

381
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
I do hope so.

382
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
Then all of this,

383
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,880
isn't this what you want?

384
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,720
But I don't believe

385
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,880
that everything will be so easy.

386
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,680
I don't believe that you and Huo Jing Heng

387
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,360
will get tired so easily.

388
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,680
I don't believe that he will hurt you.

389
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,160
Everything is going too smoothly.

390
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,160
It's like

391
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,160
someone has arranged it.

392
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,560
If you have any idea,

393
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,760
you can explain it to me.

394
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,160
It's useless.

395
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,560
I heard you

396
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,560
talking to someone secretly in the forest.

397
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,960
Although I couldn't catch him,

398
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,360
you don't have to

399
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,760
hide it from me.

400
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,960
Yue Chi,

401
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
for the sake of Zhong Yi,

402
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,160
for the sake of the imperial court of Jiang family,

403
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,960
and for the sake of the future generations of the Yue family,

404
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
will you help me for once?

405
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Zhong Yi

406
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,360
is more important than right or wrong?

407
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
What is right?

408
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,760
What is wrong?

409
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,360
There is a set rule in the palace.

410
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Right or wrong

411
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,160
is only in the heart.

412
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
The heart?

413
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
You are the general of the Three Palace,

414
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,360
the best in the world,

415
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,360
who else can you go to

416
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,760
if you don't go to the battlefield?

417
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,560
The Huo family has been stealing military provisions from the military.

418
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,560
Is it because the food

419
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
is distributed to the people

420
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,760
that you are innocent?

421
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,760
Is that so?

422
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,960
Yes.

423
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,760
It used to be about Zhong Bao Si.

424
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Under the imperial court,

425
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,760
no emperor has ever been corrupt.

426
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,760
Just think that father is the one who governs the state.

427
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,360
But he has never been a star,

428
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:13,500
a

429
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
I have been a star.

430
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,560
The world has been in turmoil for a long time.

431
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,760
It's time to change the emperor.

432
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
Jiang Yun Qing,

433
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Xue Jing Guan,

434
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,360
no matter who you are,

435
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,960
you have been sitting under the golden Buddha of the Chen En Temple

436
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,960
and reciting countless sutras

437
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,360
and chanting countless sutras.

438
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,560
The empress has heard

439
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,360
all the words of your last years.

440
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,960
All the efforts you have made

441
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,160
for the sake of the country

442
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,760
is enough.

443
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,560
It's enough.

444
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,560
Back then,

445
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,960
the empress gave birth to the crown prince for two months.

446
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,960
In the struggle for the throne,

447
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,560
she lived in the Chen En Temple

448
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,760
for a long time.

449
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
But the sky didn't shine.

450
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
On the second floor,

451
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,160
she met me.

452
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,560
There were soldiers who kept coming to cut off the fire.

453
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,760
In the end, they killed all the enemies.

454
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,560
The empress took two children

455
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,760
and they were in the forest.

456
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,360
Even if there were a large number of soldiers behind,

457
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,160
they never let go of the other child's hand.

458
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
It's worth it.

459
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,760
I'll give you my head.

460
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,760
Give it to me.

461
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,560
Give me my head.

462
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,360
The little girl raised her hand.

463
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
Just like that,

464
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,560
the two of them kept fighting in the forest.

465
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
Always.

466
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,160
Always.

467
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,560
But they never got rid of the chase after the queen.

468
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,560
Your Highness,

469
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,160
I'll distract them.

470
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,560
I'll distract them.

471
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
I'll distract them.

472
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,160
I'll distract them.

473
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,960
Sister,

474
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,960
I'll give you Yuanjia.

475
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,960
So that you can protect me.

476
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,960
That one,

477
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
he was afraid of her.

478
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,160
He made the last decision he regretted in his life.

479
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,160
In the end,

480
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,760
he survived the Wei family

481
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,760
and found the empress

482
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,360
secretly gave her the royal seal.

483
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,560
He spent three whole years

484
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,160
trying to forget that nightmare.

485
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,160
But he couldn't do it.

486
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:19,180
He was afraid of the

487
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,760
emperor's wrath.

488
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,760
He decided to change everything.

489
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Four years later,

490
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,960
he entered the palace

491
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,560
and hid his sixteen-year-old eyes.

492
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,760
And he showed the royal seal and the royal seal.

493
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
From now on,

494
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,560
he is no longer the emperor's daughter.

495
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,760
He swore

496
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,960
he would protect the empress,

497
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
the princess,

498
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
and the dead Xue Jingguan

499
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,360
for everything.

500
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,360
I don't understand.

501
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Why don't you

502
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,960
find an exit for your life?

503
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
You have to carry

504
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,760
the glory that doesn't belong to you.

505
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,760
You have to carry the glory that doesn't belong to you.

506
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
It doesn't belong to your responsibility.

507
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,360
It doesn't belong to your hatred.

508
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
Don't be so stubborn.

509
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,560
I have no exit in my life.

510
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,360
My exit

511
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,560
is to bet on the life of the princess.

512
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,760
My back is the empress's skeleton.

513
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,560
He made me take

514
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,560
his daughter's weakness and fake it.

515
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,560
He made me take her life away.

516
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,760
I have to live a life

517
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,560
where everyone is different.

518
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,360
I can only climb up step by step

519
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,960
to get the position that belongs to him.

520
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,160
But do you know

521
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,960
what life

522
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,360
Xue Jingguan had?

523
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,560
You had the snow of winter.

524
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,560
You had your own winter bed.

525
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
You wanted to taste your own flesh.

526
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
I was so happy

527
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,360
when I met the empress.

528
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Her hands

529
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,760
were so soft

530
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,160
and warm.

531
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
She would hold me

532
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,560
and apply a cold medicine

533
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,160
on my winter bed.

534
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,760
She said that

535
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,360
all the bad things have passed.

536
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,360
In the future,

537
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,360
I will

538
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,360
have to live with her.

539
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,360
I will live with her.

540
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,760
I will live with her and the princess

541
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,360
and live well together.

542
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,960
Until Li Chaogong and others

543
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,160
were ruined.

544
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,360
I was too young

545
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
and too cowardly.

546
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,760
I have committed a crime

547
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,160
that I can never forgive.

548
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,760
So do you understand?

549
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
The poison of Yi Qingyun

550
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
can't be cured.

551
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,760
His punishment can't be accepted by me.

552
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,160
Your love,

553
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:20,680
love, phoenix, and

554
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,560
I can only take the empress's trust

555
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,360
step by step towards my goal.

556
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
I can't let the empress

557
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
come back to life.

558
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,160
I can't let the princess

559
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,560
see me again.

560
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,760
But I will keep the novel

561
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,760
and let it be re-written in the Nine-Fifths Village.

562
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,160
I will let all those

563
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,360
who were involved in the assassination

564
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,560
be buried with the empress.

565
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,960
You have sealed me.

566
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,160
Do you want to see all this?

567
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,960
Do you want to see the war, the Liao Yuan, the woman dying,

568
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,560
and the child being raised by a child?

569
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,760
You want to get back everything.

570
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,760
How much is the price?

571
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,360
I don't care.

572
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,560
Even if the world is in blood,

573
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,960
the world is in the hands of the world,

574
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
I will do it.

575
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,760
I ask you one last time.

576
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,760
Will you help me?

577
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,560
I don't want to.

578
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,360
I won't help you.

579
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,760
You have the power to take all the land.

580
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
No one will look down

581
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,960
at the people like the ants.

582
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Not even a glance.

583
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,960
But Huo Jing Heng is different.

584
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,560
When danger comes,

585
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,960
only he

586
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,560
dares to make a great effort,

587
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,760
dare to break through the city,

588
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,360
dare to sacrifice himself for the sake of the people.

589
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,960
As long as he stands in front of the people,

590
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,360
I am willing to be his shield,

591
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,760
to be the last piece of the armor

592
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,960
on the last boat

593
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,360
that is as strong as

594
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,360
the skin of a tiger.

595
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,560
Today is the last day.

596
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:08,960
Stop.

597
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,160
He is a traitor.

598
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,960
Where is the evidence?

599
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
I will find it.

600
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:21,960
Ying,

601
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,160
take the president to the lower level for healing.

602
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,160
You want to kill him so badly.

603
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
Traitor.

604
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,360
What's the use of him?

605
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,760
Officer Xue,

606
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,360
you are the most unqualified

607
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,560
to betray the Gu Tan.

608
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,560
Don't forget that the last betrayal

609
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,760
is from the Japanese.

610
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,160
Your Highness,

611
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
your soup is ready.

612
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,560
Put it here.

613
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,360
It's okay.

614
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,960
I won't die.

615
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,960
You won't die.

616
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,760
Are you sad?

617
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,560
Are you sad?

618
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,760
I feel sorry for him.

619
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,560
I understand.

620
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,960
But I can't help it.

621
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,160
His reaction

622
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,560
is also in my expectation.

623
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,760
But

624
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,760
Yi Qingyun did this.

625
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,360
I didn't expect it.

626
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,960
It seems that I am too naive

627
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,160
to be able to do it.

628
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,360
What's your new progress?

629
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,120
I can't be

630
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
lazy anymore.

631
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,560
I have a good chance

632
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,760
to get rid of Di Xing.

633
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,760
Your Highness,

634
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,160
what's wrong?

635
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,360
Your Highness,

636
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
I am a mole.

637
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,360
Many soldiers

638
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,960
have a disgusting reaction.

639
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:22,960
Have you checked it?

640
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,960
I have checked it one by one.

641
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
All the food and drink

642
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,760
are traces of poison.

643
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
Go and check the city.

644
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,160
Yes.

645
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:42,760
Your Highness,

646
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,560
you are not well.

647
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,560
You don't need to be so polite.

648
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

649
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,360
Your Highness,

650
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,360
this place is full of worms.

651
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,960
The water is dirty.

652
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,560
But the water is not enough.

653
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,560
It's not good to stay here for long.

654
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,160
I suggest

655
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,360
to move eastward.

656
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,360
The eastern area is open.

657
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,960
There is a river on the right.

658
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
The water is clean.

659
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,160
But it's not convenient to move eastward.

660
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,960
People are half dead.

661
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,560
How can we fight them?

662
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,160
How can we fight them?

663
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,360
I will think about it.

664
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,760
You have a good rest.

665
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
Tomorrow morning,

666
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,160
the whole army will move eastward.

667
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,360
Yes.

668
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,120
Great,

669
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,400
what a happy死 party.

670
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:45,840
Mom,

671
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,760
dad is right here.

672
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,560
I am here.

673
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,440
I go back now,

674
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,360
Father is here.

675
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,560
Yes.

676
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,560
We have gotten this full of Justin,

677
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,760
we need to find races and classification.

678
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,760
Call...

679
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,760
Trumpeter.

680
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,360
We need to find the race and classification.

681
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,360
Go.

682
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:09,760
Come.

683
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:10,960
Come.

684
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,360
You are a loyal man.

685
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,560
Everyone will think you are not a bad person.

686
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,360
Well...

687
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,840
You are an emperor.

688
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
Why are you so mean?

689
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,120
Before I became an emperor,

690
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,480
I sold high-quality medicine in the martial arts world.

691
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,240
Do you think it's easy to sell?

692
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,480
Fine.

693
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,360
You are a man and a woman.

694
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,000
Tell me.

695
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
You tried so hard to make them move.

696
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,560
What's your plan?

697
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,400
If Li Army wants to expand the Eastern Yi Zhi,

698
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,000
they will pass Chixiagu.

699
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,200
I will lead the northwest army to go down the mountain

700
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,840
and besiege them in the valley.

701
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,320
Let them retreat as far as possible.

702
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,120
Go.

703
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,080
You guys

704
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,800
go to the road ahead separately.

705
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,640
Go back quickly.

706
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,600
Yes.

707
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,560
["Xianyuan Gate No.3"]

708
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,680
General.

709
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,360
It seems His Majesty's on the way up.

710
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,240
Jingji has several ?er600? follow-ups

711
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,200
that are similar to one poisonous snake in the recorded flash.

712
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,240
Are you hurt?

713
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,040
No.

714
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,960
What a stupid guy.

715
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,400
Have you arranged the people?

716
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,080
As you ordered,

717
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,240
I sent the army

718
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,600
to search near Li Jun.

719
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,720
Good.

720
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,920
When this little bastard comes,

721
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,120
the cucumber will be cold.

722
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:53,980
Let's go to the
