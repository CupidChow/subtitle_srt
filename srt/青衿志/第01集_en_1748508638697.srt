1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Emperor's Love

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Episode 1

3
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Go! Go!

4
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm the King of the City!

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You're not going to show up

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
to attack my cavalry.

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You're a genius.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If it weren't for the Emperor's marriage,

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
you wouldn't have fallen into this world.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
As long as you're willing to surrender,

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
you'll take me to the capital

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and I'll still be your hero!

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The King of the City has a dance.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But I have to keep my hands on the drum.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I can only stand at the front line.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I can't retreat!

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Be quick!

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Know the take off point!

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,640
Without having a hairpin, I am so exhausted

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,680
Let's find a chicken Essence

21
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,660
and I can always stay up

22
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,760
How zen you are like aidry

23
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,400
This place isavored with whoosh

24
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,220
I am allone

25
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,000
King of Qi Ling only

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I have no soldiers.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I can only fight in the battle of Yuechi.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can't retreat.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Miss.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
His Majesty is not bad today.

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But if it wasn't for the battle of the two years ago,

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yuechi deliberately defeated him.

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He might not be able to enter the Great Wall.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This area is the Ming family's place.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Even if it's a place to pass on the message,

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't know why you think

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yuechi deliberately defeated the new emperor.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The old dynasty is the capital of the world.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yuechi is not stupid.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He is just a little bit too weak.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If it weren't for the old emperor's insisting on the Yue family to be the hostage,

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
he wouldn't have gone to the battlefield.

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You dare not say that.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yuechi was actually defeated in the battlefield.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Why did he deliberately defeat him?

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He didn't defeat him.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He was killed by the father.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The Anle King's Mansion is the most important place in the court.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yuechi's family.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes. After Yuechi died,

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
His Majesty was chasing after the emperor to feed the Anle King.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He died.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Isn't his sister also living here?

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It must not be a good thing.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The emperor is appointed by the emperor.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yuechi is a mature and loyal man.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He is very well-mannered and pure.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He is the heir of the throne.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yue Fei is assigned to the palace.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He is the son of the emperor.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What should I do, my lady?

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If you enter the palace,

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
how can you live that life?

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
My lady.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The inn is the best.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You can't be self-confident.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
At this moment, you should be calm.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Uncle.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I asked you to find that person.

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
To save my life.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I have to go down.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I need to find my lady to come with me.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What?

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Ling'er.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Brother.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Brother.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You are finally back.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You want to marry my sister?

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Ling'er.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Do you want me to abolish her or abolish her?

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's not appropriate.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
My Yuechi's sister.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
She doesn't say that.

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Actually, it's not wrong.

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I heard that she is good looking.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
She is very...

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But that's not the point.

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The point is,

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
after you died,

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
she didn't make a living for your Yue family.

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Are you willing or not?

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Of course I am.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You don't know that

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
the palace is full of beautiful women.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
They are not the same.

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Your sister has such a small flower.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
She doesn't want to be under the sun.

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
She doesn't want to be under the cat's shadow.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
She doesn't want to be in the wind.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
She is so scared.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But...

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But...

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But...

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But...

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's not bad to be a concubine.

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You can't keep your family safe.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You can remember the wealth of the world.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Think about it.

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
If one day,

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
your sister really gets everything,

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
you don't have to hide it.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And our Yue family

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
won't be killed by others.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
How do I feel that...

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
you want to marry her?

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I was scared because of the imperial edict.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What should I do?

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay, okay.

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'll think about it.

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Think about it.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Think about the way to prove it.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Go.

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Your Majesty.

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

126
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,960
Your Majesty, the Imperial Guards have arranged a new dance.

127
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,480
May Your Majesty please be seated.

128
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,920
Your Majesty, you have improved.

129
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,880
It seems that you haven't been able to stop.

130
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,880
Please be yourself.

131
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,840
Come and wipe the sweat for me.

132
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,440
Yes.

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm afraid that if I really don't believe you,

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll lose my life.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I dare not.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm not talking about you.

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You don't have that ability.

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm talking about him.

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Your Majesty, what is this?

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
A gentle knife.

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
A knife.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
A knife.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
A knife.

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
A knife.

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
A knife.

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Tell me.

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What do you want?

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Jin Yi?

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Zhu Bao?

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Ming Wei?

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Or do you really want to kill him?

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You bastard!

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Your Majesty, be careful!

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Your Majesty.

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
How did you find out?

156
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You look like you're trying to wipe the sweat for me.

157
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Shi Ze is investigating the life.

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Maybe you're investigating me.

159
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm investigating you.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I underestimated you.

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
There are too many people who want to kill me.

162
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You have to be careful.

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You're still a little self-aware.

164
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'll die today.

165
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
There must be a thousand people who will kill me.

166
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You bastard!

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll wait for you to wipe the sweat for me.

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're dead?

169
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I didn't allow you to die.

170
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You can't die.

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Your Majesty, take care of him.

172
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'll be back early.

173
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You want to tell me I'm going to the palace?

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes.

175
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
We've been like this since we were kids.

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We've been looking at the dress.

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We went to the palace to explore the way.

178
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But I'm sure Huo Jing Heng can make it.

179
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We're not a ghost.

180
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We can't change it.

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Chu Chen, you and the emperor have fought for so many years.

182
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
He knows you're a bad guy.

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
No way.

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The emperor was a good man.

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He was a bad man.

186
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I was happy to see him.

187
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Huo Jing Heng didn't see my face.

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But I heard that Huo Jing Heng is a good man.

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He's a good student.

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You've been a good student for two years.

191
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You haven't grown up yet.

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What's wrong?

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Don't look like him?

194
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
No.

195
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're not enough for a woman.

196
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What's wrong?

197
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Don't look like him?

198
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No.

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're not enough for a woman.

200
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Where are you not enough for a woman?

201
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm not soft enough.

202
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm really soft.

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm not soft enough.

204
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Who said that?

205
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Then this one is the same as mine.

206
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes, it's the same.

207
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The same?

208
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I see.

209
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Brother, add some rouge on your face.

210
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And I have a cure for my eyes.

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's the same on the spot.

212
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No need.

213
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Try it.

214
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
No need.

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm fine now.

216
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Please think twice.

217
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I know you're a new lady.

218
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But this method is too unreliable.

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's not all for Ling'er.

220
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I really want to attack her.

221
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I heard that this time,

222
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Nke has selected many officials from the front court.

223
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm worried that she wants to kill the root

224
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and settle the officials in the front court.

225
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What if Ling'er gets into the palace?

226
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What if she gets bullied?

227
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I can't let Ling'er suffer this.

228
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The Ministry of Revenue has a guarantee.

229
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The four sides of Jin and Sui will be in good shape.

230
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I've been in the imperial court for two years.

231
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But after the rebellion,

232
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
the internal and external forces are in trouble.

233
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But the external forces are in trouble.

234
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The military and military forces are in trouble.

235
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The internal and external forces are in trouble.

236
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What's good about that?

237
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yes.

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
If you can't remember,

239
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
then forget it.

240
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Your Majesty, there's something I want to do.

241
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Although you want to show your kindness,

242
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
the daughter of the Yue family,

243
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Ling'er,

244
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
is the younger sister of the front court.

245
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's not a big deal to get into the palace.

246
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's important.

247
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I hope you can think about it.

248
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

249
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's a decision.

250
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
No need to say more.

251
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Leave the court.

252
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Your Majesty,

253
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
the news from the Palace of Phoenix has been sent.

254
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yue Fei is ready to enter the palace.

255
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Your Majesty, I want to see you.

256
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm not seeing you.

257
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm going to use the palace to see the female assassin.

258
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Eunuch Wei,

259
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
go and tell them about what I told you.

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yes.

261
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The palace is in the palace.

262
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The palace is in the palace.

263
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Is it a holiday?

264
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's a new year.

265
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's a new worker.

266
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Your Majesty,

267
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
from now on,

268
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I will not be a maid.

269
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You can be the maid.

270
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Get up.

271
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You are a natural.

272
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You are like a fortune.

273
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Why do you have to be so experienced?

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You are the one who killed me.

275
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You are right.

276
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But I've heard too many words.

277
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You can leave.

278
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You can leave.

281
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Since ancient times,

282
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
the palace has been a place of suffering.

283
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Every emperor has his own hobby.

284
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm happy to have you.

285
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm really interested in you.

286
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Take it off.

287
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Give me the precious thing on you.

288
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll spare you.

289
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The precious thing on you?

290
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What are you doing?

291
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Episode 1

292
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The most interesting thing is that

293
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I know he's a little bit arrogant.

294
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He's too strong.

295
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Who did this?

296
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He's so beautiful.

297
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Thank you.

298
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Episode 1

299
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's too bright.

300
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's too bright.

301
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh no.

302
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Your Highness.

303
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Your chest is hard.

304
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I know.

305
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You must be a woman.

306
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll open your hand.

308
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm much better.

309
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What's your name?

310
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Hong Yue.

311
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm also a little girl.

312
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Xiaoyue.

313
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Where are the people from Fengnan Palace?

314
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The one who entered the palace is only one person.

315
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There are no other people.

316
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That's also from the sister.

317
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Your Highness.

318
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Do you think he's a little bit arrogant?

319
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
There are only a few people in Fengnan Palace.

320
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We can't be too arrogant.

321
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What does Huo Jinghe mean?

322
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
He doesn't give my sister a medal.

323
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
He's just so cool.

324
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
He even went to the village with my sister.

325
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
He's a little bit arrogant.

326
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Where are you going?

327
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm going out for a walk.

328
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
In order to make His Majesty happy,

329
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
you can't enter Fengnan Palace.

330
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Why?

331
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
His Majesty said that you can't understand the rules in the palace.

332
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You must read the palace rules first.

333
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Is it...

334
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
12?

335
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
One is a ten-quant, the total is 120.

336
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Xiaoyue.

337
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You're always so ten-quant.

338
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
His Majesty said that he's also a ten-quant.

339
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Chen Duwan is also a ten-quant.

340
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's the first year of the month.

341
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
No, it's all the same.

342
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Let Huo Jinghe take the initiative to find the door.

343
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Sister Hui Fei.

344
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This is Fengnan Palace.

345
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Are we really going to do this?

346
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
His Majesty has always been a woman.

347
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
He spent all his time to win the month of the month.

348
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If he's a bad person,

349
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
we can't have a good friend.

350
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You're so sweet.

351
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
When you see that woman, you'll praise her.

352
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You'll be close to her.

353
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yunwan, you're gentle.

354
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
When Xia Zhao is almost done,

355
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
you'll tell her to visit her inn.

356
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Remember to be natural.

357
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And I'll put this secret love in her pillow

358
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
at this time.

359
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Then a person will come to her.

360
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Let her be a criminal who makes a mistake.

361
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Xiaoyue, I'm a little thirsty.

362
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Help me to check.

363
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Okay, Your Highness.

364
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Chen Xingzi.

365
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What's wrong?

366
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
This is Yue Fei, right?

367
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
She's really beautiful.

368
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Why does the palace match the veil?

369
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's a coincidence.

370
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
There were a lot of things to do a few days ago.

371
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I got a little bit of a headache.

372
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Then why are you wearing this?

373
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The Yue family is a martial arts family.

374
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm wearing it for free.

375
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Why don't you follow the rules?

376
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I don't follow the rules.

377
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I just think it's a little strange.

378
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I think so too.

379
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's strange.

380
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Siqiqiao, you don't look like a woman.

381
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You're really funny.

382
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
How could I not be a woman?

383
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You can't say that again, sister.

384
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What's the matter, Xuanhuai?

385
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
His Majesty is here.

386
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

387
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Huo Jiuhan?

388
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

389
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You...

390
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Your Majesty, I think this person is in trouble.

391
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Look at his figure.

392
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Don't be so mean.

393
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Your Majesty, his figure...

394
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
He's wearing a silk coat.

395
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Not bad.

396
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Your Majesty, where's his height?

397
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
He's so tall.

398
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I think he's not fit for the Japanese.

399
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Good.

400
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Did I say something wrong?

401
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Why didn't you say anything?

402
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I got a little bit of a bruise.

403
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm afraid I'll get a bruise.

404
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You got a bruise?

405
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Okay.

406
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Who are these people?

407
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Your Majesty, these are all concubines.

408
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
These are all concubines.

409
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I see they all look the same.

410
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Okay.

411
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You two go with the new concubines.

412
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm leaving.

413
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But His Majesty...

414
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
He...

415
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
But His Majesty...

416
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

417
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

418
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
They all look the same.

419
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Your Highness, you've drawn the Emperor's figure so well.

420
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
He's so mysterious.

421
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You don't need to be so coincident.

422
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Let's go out and play.

423
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Okay, Your Highness.

424
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Ling'er's letter?

425
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Brother, how are you doing in the palace?

426
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Ling'er is very worried about your safety.

427
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I think that

428
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
the fact that you brought me here is really a lie.

429
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It's my fault.

430
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You still care about me.

431
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
After all, you're not right now.

432
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Second, you're not right.

433
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Two years ago,

434
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Huo Jinghe's subordinate, Bai Jiang,

435
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
failed to get along with Huo Jinghe.

436
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You're right.

437
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You can understand.

438
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Brother, if you're not doing well in the palace...

439
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm doing well.

440
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I won't stop him.

441
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Just wait and see

442
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
how I can get Huo Jinghe to be the best.

443
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Let Yue Fei become the best.

444
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Your Majesty,

445
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
why did you go to Feng Lan Palace after the court?

446
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And,

447
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
you don't have any face problems.

448
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Is it because of the memory?

449
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Do you want to ask the doctor?

450
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Do you want me to

451
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
give you a few more tablets

452
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and then ask the doctor?

453
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Shut up.

454
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
This is the relationship between me and Yue Fei.

455
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It's still a mess.

456
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It's almost the time.

457
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The order of Feng Lan Palace can be withdrawn.

458
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But,

459
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I won't leave you be involved in anyhooing.

460
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Disko Fu Lan exactly.

461
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Have you see Feng Lan?

462
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
How dare you.

463
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,200
and you are in a bad mood.

464
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,400
You should die right now.

465
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,440
Brother.

466
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,800
Why do you want me to be the empress?

467
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,560
Ling'er.

468
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,720
I don't know

469
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,000
what Huo Jinghe is like.

470
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,360
If I take the empress as my son,

471
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,080
I don't know if I'm bad to Ling'er.

472
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,160
Right.

473
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:30,960
Gui,

474
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,000
I found it out without asking you.

475
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,880
Your Majesty,

476
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,400
as you should know,

477
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,920
All imbibed manatees

478
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
absolutely need primordial kids.

479
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,080
Merit.

480
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm afraid I'm alive.

481
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,060
Kaizuadas

482
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:46,800
Sometimes,

483
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,440
they can be different questions.

484
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,720
At times,

485
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,680
they don't make the same questions,

486
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,720
Two guys from my company

487
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,880
One keep doing like that

488
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,480
Look at how they sleep so early

489
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,680
It's still a kind of candy

490
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,720
Are you going to the harem today?

491
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,640
You are?

492
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,320
Of course.

493
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,480
He won't have any hidden talents.

494
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,640
Yue Fei is not going there either.

495
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,440
No.

496
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,920
Why are you staring at me like that?

497
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,680
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

498
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,720
I'll talk to you later.

499
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,200
Go ahead.

500
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:47,960
Your Majesty,

501
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,560
you've been against Yue Lin for two years.

502
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,440
You've been against her for many years.

503
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,200
It's not easy for her to enter the harem.

504
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
You should go to

505
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,320
sing and sing at night.

506
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,920
You're just a piece of paper.

507
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,680
That's singing and singing at night.

508
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,680
That's how the king's army did it.

509
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,640
I don't have a good conscience

510
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,040
for Yue Lin.

511
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,960
She's a former imperial maid.

512
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,280
She lost her brother's protection.

513
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,120
She can't afford to be with anyone.

514
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,560
She's in a bad mood.

515
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,480
I've been a good music singer

516
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,480
for many years.

517
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,240
But this is a real trouble.

518
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,920
Why don't you

519
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,840
just take her into the harem

520
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,240
and let her know the safety of the harem?

521
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,000
The background is so dirty.

522
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,160
What's the idea?

523
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,760
Your Majesty, it's dirty.

524
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,200
Your Majesty, it's the best.

525
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,320
Where did you get it from?

526
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,360
Your Highness,

527
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,480
Yue is a yellow-haired man.

528
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,080
She's been bullied by the people.

529
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,840
His Majesty has saved her.

530
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,000
He even asked her to work as a maid

531
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,440
and give her a life.

532
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,720
Actually, Yue can't do much.

533
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,960
But His Majesty never cares.

534
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,080
He's also called

535
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,600
to protect her in the harem.

536
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,040
He doesn't want me to suffer.

537
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,280
His Majesty is a good man.

538
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,680
Huo Jinghe is a bit muddleheaded.

539
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,120
He's not bad.

540
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,920
But a girl who's not well-behaved

541
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,360
is so gentle and kind.

542
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,760
She's also very careful about Ling'er.

543
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,080
Maybe she can

544
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,080
really entrust her life to Ling'er.

545
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,120
Yue, help me with the pen.

546
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,560
I'll send a letter to the house.

547
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,120
Your Highness, you don't need to send a letter.

548
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,640
I just prepared a letter to Your Highness.

549
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,760
The people in your house are here.

550
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,040
Who's here?

551
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,160
That person.

552
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,880
Why are you here?

553
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,240
What if they find out?

554
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,920
Brother, don't be nervous.

555
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,880
Don't call me brother.

556
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,720
I'm from the town of Zhengda Guangming.

557
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,760
Don't worry.

558
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,360
The maid of the Prince of An's Mansion

559
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,400
is here to see Yue Fei.

560
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,200
Do I look like her?

561
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,000
What do you mean?

562
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:57,880
Go back.

563
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,520
No.

564
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,600
Go back to your room.

565
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,640
No.

566
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,640
I'm here to check on you today.

567
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,600
How's it going?

568
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,120
How's the work in the palace?

569
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,760
Huo Jinghe is reliable.

570
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,880
He's not special.

571
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,580
He's always

572
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,680
a warm-hearted person.

573
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,600
He's easy-going and kind.

574
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,200
He's not bad-looking.

575
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,000
He's also good-looking.

576
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,120
He's also good-looking.

577
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,240
He's also good-looking.

578
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,760
I think

579
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,080
you're not bad-looking.

580
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,720
Are you satisfied with Huo Jinghe?

581
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,240
Then what do you think?

582
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,440
What do you think?

583
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,480
Me?

584
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,240
You're married. I'm married.

585
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,840
You're not my brother.

586
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,840
You don't have to be my father.

587
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,360
Do you think Huo Jinghe is reliable?

588
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,960
Yes.

589
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,800
Yes.

590
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,640
That's enough.

591
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,680
But he's very kind.

592
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,040
As a husband,

593
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,480
he doesn't necessarily...

594
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,840
That's not important.

595
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,120
You can be satisfied.

596
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,400
I'm satisfied?

597
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,240
Are you willing to go into the palace

598
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,240
and be the empress?

599
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,360
Yes.

600
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,000
Yes.

601
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,720
Okay.

602
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,320
In that case,

603
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,840
I'll help you

604
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,040
win the throne of the empress.

605
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,400
I also need you to

606
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,360
prepare something for me.

607
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,440
I'm going to go with you.

608
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,720
Please wait a moment.

609
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,280
Greetings, Your Highness.

610
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,040
I heard that your mother

611
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,080
was born in the Korean period.

612
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,200
She's not pregnant.

613
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,520
I have a house

614
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,960
from Western Regions.

615
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,720
It's good for her.

616
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,720
Sister,

617
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,400
it's you.

618
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,280
You're here to

619
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,880
get along with the Eunuch.

620
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,480
Your Highness, thank you.

621
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,600
I wonder what you have to pay for.

622
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,360
I don't dare to pay for Eunuch.

623
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,360
I just have a small favor

624
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,480
to ask for your help.

625
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,120
I'll take my leave then.

626
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,440
How many sisters

627
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,720
have you

628
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,320
wanted to buy the palace

629
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,360
and win the throne?

630
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,360
Have you ever been against the emperor?

631
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,240
Don't make a fuss about the emperor

632
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,720
and make a big mistake.

633
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,000
What's this?

634
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,520
I dare not

635
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,400
open the door

636
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,920
of Yue Fei's heart.

637
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,120
Yue Fei?

638
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,680
No.

639
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,640
I'm so sorry.

640
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,720
I don't know anything.

641
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,440
Take the palace away.

642
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:43,960
Yue Fei,

643
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,320
you're so bold.

644
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,880
I...

645
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,520
Come here.

646
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,320
Let me take it.

647
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,880
How could you have such a strong hand?

648
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,480
But the real one

649
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,560
is nothing.

650
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,880
It seems that

651
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,000
you're more like that.

652
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,320
Sister,

653
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,440
sister, it's bad.

654
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,200
I heard that the emperor went to Fengnan Palace.

655
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,920
What are you panicking about?

656
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,760
Maybe the emperor

657
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,760
went to the palace to sit.

658
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,600
To make the crown prince's skin

659
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,120
and make the hundred skin of the hand.

660
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,000
The first is the emperor's

661
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,760
and the second is the emperor's.

662
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,600
For the sake of the emperor's

663
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,920
and the emperor's support,

664
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,680
I'll give it to you.

665
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,600
Sister, it's bad.

666
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,440
I heard that the emperor left the palace at midnight.

667
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,640
Maybe the emperor is fresh at one time.

668
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,000
I forgot it a few days ago.

669
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,480
This is beautiful.

670
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,000
This open mountain moon

671
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,560
is a short hair and a long hair.

672
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,160
Panlong Kun.

673
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,000
The word is from Song Taizu.

674
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,440
It's called a line of the whole.

675
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,560
A piece of the Kun.

676
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,920
Panlong is a beautiful river.

677
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,680
These treasures

678
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,600
are really what your brother

679
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,000
gave birth to.

680
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Brother gave birth to a precious treasure.

681
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,920
These are just a talk.

682
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,520
Sister, it's bad.

683
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,800
What's wrong again?

684
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,960
The whole harem has been transformed.

685
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,600
The emperor has been in Fenglan Palace for more than ten days.

686
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,440
Yue Fei is so poor.

687
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,680
The emperor likes it.

688
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,040
Take them all away.

689
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,360
Okay. Yue Fei is so generous.

690
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,440
I'm so grateful.

691
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,400
These are all my treasures.

692
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,920
I'm so polite.

693
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,040
You want them all?

694
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,080
Leave me alone.

695
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,040
Father.

696
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,720
Mother.

697
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,400
Second brother.

698
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,040
I'm here to see you.

699
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,560
If Yue Fei didn't set up a trap

700
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,560
in Shili Poh back then,

701
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,720
my brother wouldn't have killed Shili Poh.

702
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,320
Mother will be in danger.

703
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,080
You marry and marry

704
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,400
and have no family to live with.

705
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,520
Don't worry.

706
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,080
Grandpa would have asked Yue Fei- palace takes from him

707
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,720
and made everyone in Yрам know all about your existence.

708
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,600
Yue Yu'er.

709
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,080
I willrone be a long life

710
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,800
to lonely young with sister.

711
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,520
I'm not afraid of the world

712
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,520
I'm not afraid of the world

713
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,520
I'm not afraid of the world

714
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,520
I'm not afraid of the world

715
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
I'm not afraid of the world

716
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,520
I'm not afraid of the world

717
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,520
I'm not afraid of the world

718
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,520
I'm not afraid of the world

719
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,520
I'm not afraid of the world

720
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,520
I'm not afraid of the world

721
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,520
I'm not afraid of the world

722
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
I'm not afraid of the world

723
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
I'm not afraid of the world

724
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
I'm not afraid of the world

725
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,520
Black, wet, and light weak

726
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,520
W spoonful

727
00:35:40,520 --> 00:36:00,540
Red,けど, and Guan Yue

728
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,520
I'm afraid of the world

729
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,540
Do not flatter

730
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,540
The more I live, the more I die

731
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,540
The more I get, the more I die

732
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,540
Love only comes when it's hot and cold

733
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,540
The soul is clear and the world is clear

734
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:22,540
The wind and the leaves are all over the place
