00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Come down.

4
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You climbed so high. Be careful of falling.

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Why didn't you ask me if I was running away from school today?

6
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You always have a leg cramp.

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It rained last night.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sure it's going to rain today.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You're really thoughtful.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
No wonder you're so cold to me.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Go.

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's not that easy to run away.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let me explain.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You keep saying that you're not hiding anything from me.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Is this what you call not hiding anything?

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I never hide anything from you.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Then why did you let him run away?

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
My lord, bad news.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Lord Zhang was kidnapped.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Just now,

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
the other party's martial arts are extremely high.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They're like guards in the palace.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hua Jing Heng.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Give me my brother.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I never kidnapped your brother.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You're not going to come back.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yuchi.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What do you mean?

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm saving you.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You think you can really hurt him?

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And I believe in His Majesty.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Xiao Shuo was definitely not kidnapped by His Majesty.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Reason.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If it's really a guard in the palace,

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
how could he leave His Majesty alone?

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Now the most important thing is to find Xiao Shuo.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If anything happens to Xiao Shuo,

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I will never give up.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't come.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't come.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Please summon a guard from the palace

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and pray for my Hazen.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What?

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Martial arts?

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,440
I will do as you say.

47
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
I dare not.

48
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,160
I know you are a man.

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,000
What you see today

50
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,560
is just a 14-year-old boy.

51
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,000
Your Majesty.

52
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,280
For a farmer,

53
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,160
he saw three or four

54
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,400
suspicious men

55
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,600
walking towards the mountain

56
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
with a child.

57
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,040
Uncle.

58
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,600
That child

59
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,240
is similar to the one we are looking for.

60
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,360
Uncle.

61
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,200
Yuezhi.

62
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,000
We are separated by two paths.

63
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,160
You go up the mountain.

64
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,320
I will go with His Majesty.

65
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,400
It's dark.

66
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,240
I'm afraid he has only seen Uncle for one year.

67
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,400
He may not recognize him.

68
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,880
The safety of Uncle is the most important.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,800
Uncle.

70
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,000
Uncle.

71
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,840
Uncle.

72
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,840
Uncle.

73
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,760
Uncle.

74
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,960
Uncle.

75
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,920
Good relief.

76
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,560
Revelation has drawn a sword.

77
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,240
Come.

78
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Yushu!

79
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Yushu!

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's the light bulb of the novel!

81
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Search separately!

82
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Search separately!

83
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Xiao Zhuang!

84
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Xiao Zhuang!

85
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Yang Guangpeng!

86
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Yang Guangpeng!

87
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Xiao Zhuang!

88
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Anjie!

89
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Brother Yue!

90
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Help me!

91
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Xiao Zhuang!

92
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Yang Guangpeng!

93
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
The novel!

94
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Go!

95
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Your Majesty, I'm here to thank you for saving my life.

96
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
No need.

97
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Please allow me to report all the reasons.

98
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
I'm tired.

99
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
If you want to do something, just tell me.

100
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
I'm guilty.

101
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
I shouldn't have deceived you.

102
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
After the Qilin Army found the novel,

103
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
I've been looking for it.

104
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
I only hope that it grows up safely.

105
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,560
It only wants to grow up in the room.

106
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,560
I know I've committed the crime of deceiving the king.

107
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
I don't dare to ask for forgiveness.

108
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Please punish me.

109
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,560
I only hope that you will be my Yun Shuo today.

110
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,560
I will never show up.

111
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,560
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,720
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,720
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,720
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,720
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,720
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,720
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,880
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,880
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,880
Your Majesty, it's a laugh and a cry.

130
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,880
It's because the rain hasn't stopped.

131
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,280
If not,

132
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,160
We can

133
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,760
never make it.

134
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,880
Never.

135
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,160
như once the nation is determined,

136
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,000
It will open the river and will flood over the river.

137
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,280
etap to learn and�� the yard of the land.

138
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,100
Fresh air will surplus

139
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,880
during the campaign at the Imperial battleground.

140
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,640
Perhaps Prince disgustingly regrets

141
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,120
doing all those

142
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,200
Jingting Convention.

143
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,080
I like it when you

144
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,680
can counteract with the spirit in the Sadistic.

145
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,440
the new policy

146
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,520
and new strategy

147
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,280
No matter where you are,

148
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,600
I want someone to be the first person to kick you out of the court.

149
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,200
From today on,

150
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,560
you and I will never understand each other.

151
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,200
The driver of Huo Jing Heng's car that day

152
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,360
was sure that Yun Shu was the Crown Prince.

153
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,320
Is this the thing you're talking about?

154
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,200
Who told him about this?

155
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,680
Why did he come here all of a sudden?

156
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,240
And that bandit.

157
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,120
How could he come here so suddenly?

158
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,040
Yun Shu was taken away.

159
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,920
He didn't kill anyone.

160
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,080
He didn't even send people to watch him.

161
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,480
Who was behind this?

162
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,720
So what?

163
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,600
No one should know about this.

164
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:14,640
Even this urban man

165
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,400
would think it should be it.

166
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,200
You know,

167
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,480
he hasIR incompetence in Amazon.

168
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,880
He knows about details.

169
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,880
Yi Qingyu.

170
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,880
Jiang Yunqing took someone to save Jiang Yunshuo

171
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
and ruined your plan.

172
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,880
If he didn't do it,

173
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,880
I'm afraid he would be more bold in the future.

174
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,880
Jiang Yunqing has been

175
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,880
secretly visiting Jiang Yunshuo these years.

176
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
He is

177
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,880
very careful.

178
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,880
But since he can guess

179
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,880
how difficult Jiang Yunshuo is,

180
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,880
he must know that I did it on purpose.

181
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,880
He even dared to

182
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,880
make a move.

183
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
It seems that

184
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,880
we can't use this to

185
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,880
force the King of the Regent and Huo Jinheng.

186
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,880
Jiang Yunqing.

187
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Okay.

188
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,880
There are three days left

189
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,880
this month.

190
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Three days left this month.

191
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Su.

192
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,880
Su.

193
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,880
Give it to me.

194
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,880
Give it to me.

195
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,880
What did I say?

196
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,880
The Prime Minister of Yue

197
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
will definitely not go to Yongqian Palace.

198
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
You won.

199
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,880
Your Majesty.

200
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Where is he?

201
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
He didn't come.

202
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
I think he went back.

203
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,880
He went home?

204
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,880
Okay.

205
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,880
I'll go to see him.

206
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Okay.

207
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Is he trying to test me?

208
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
If I don't agree with him,

209
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
will he return to the field?

210
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
Are you asking about the Prime Minister of Yue?

211
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
He asked Lord Liu to meet him.

212
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,880
I thought you were talking about the Prime Minister of Guo.

213
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,880
Why did I ask about that scoundrel?

214
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Go.

215
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,880
Tell the doctor to give him a month's bed.

216
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,880
Yes.

217
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,880
Your Majesty.

218
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
Lord Guo saw that everyone was

219
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
jealous of the new wine of the Consort of Yue.

220
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,880
He was so heartless.

221
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,880
He was just trying to make it up.

222
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
The Consort of Yue

223
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
treats Lord Guo

224
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
as her confidante.

225
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Of course.

226
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,880
She can be anything.

227
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
She's just a confidante.

228
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
Who doesn't have a confidante?

229
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
I have a lot of confidantes.

230
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
The one who embroidered flowers

231
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
the other day, what was her name?

232
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
What was her name?

233
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
Xia...

234
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,880
Xia Yun Shuang?

235
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Yes.

236
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
Let's go to her palace.

237
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
Yes.

238
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
The White Armor!

239
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,880
His Majesty has arrived!

240
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Your Majesty,

241
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Her Highness went to practice

242
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
with Consort Hui.

243
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Let's go.

244
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Your Majesty,

245
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,880
Her Highness went to find Zhao Jie Yu

246
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
to play chess.

247
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Your Majesty,

248
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Her Highness went to find

249
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
Lady Lan to blow the flute.

250
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
Your Majesty.

251
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
Which way should we go?

252
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
Let's try the way Her Highness did.

253
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
What's going on?

254
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Where are they?

255
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
They're coming.

256
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
I'm crying.

257
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
The most important thing is to tell them

258
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
that the three of them

259
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
are worth 30 yuan.

260
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Find someone to come.

261
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
Why is it her again?

262
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
They're coming.

263
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
You're so lucky.

264
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Today, I must get

265
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
the hairpin of Xia Yun Shuang

266
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
in my hand.

267
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
Remember, my left eye,

268
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
the word, the right eye,

269
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
the word, the left eye,

270
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
the word, the right eye,

271
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
the word, the right eye,

272
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
the word.

273
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Remember, the left eye...

274
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Why are you here?

275
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
Just because of this?

276
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
Isn't that too much?

277
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
I've been putting down my attitude

278
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
and went to the jade pot

279
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
to catch the ducks.

280
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
Even Lady Hong didn't take it seriously.

281
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
But she

282
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
has been maintaining her face.

283
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
The three of them are like

284
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
a family.

285
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
I'm an outsider.

286
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
How should I put it?

287
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
It sounds like

288
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
my son's sincerity

289
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
is for

290
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,880
dogs.

291
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Mother.

292
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
I've seen

293
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Yue Zhi's child.

294
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,880
I think I know

295
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,880
him well.

296
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
I'm not talking to him

297
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
in front of my mother.

298
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
I think this child

299
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
is not bad.

300
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Right?

301
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
He did this

302
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
because he had his reasons.

303
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,880
You have to be in this position

304
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
no matter what.

305
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
And he doesn't need it.

306
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
This one is good.

307
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
It's too small.

308
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Right?

309
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Well...

310
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
I'm not interested

311
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
in Yue Zhi's image.

312
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
I'm not interested

313
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
in him.

314
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
He doesn't need

315
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,880
to tell me who he's hiding from.

316
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
But

317
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
as an emperor,

318
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
you need someone

319
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
to help you.

320
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
I don't think this child

321
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
is for wealth.

322
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,880
No, it's for fame.

323
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,880
He's a good person.

324
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,880
You've chosen to use him.

325
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:10,240
Don't be so

326
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,880
stubborn.

327
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,880
You can't tell who's good to him.

328
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,880
I didn't know

329
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
he was used for so many years.

330
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Use your heart.

331
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
Change your heart.

332
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,880
Right?

333
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
Don't worry.

334
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
He won't let you down.

335
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,880
Go.

336
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Help me copy.

337
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
Who are you copying this time?

338
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
Feng Langgong?

339
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
Do you need to

340
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
get a copy of Ling'er in advance?

341
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
No.

342
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
This girl

343
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
is smart.

344
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
Go.

345
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Go.

346
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
Go.

347
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,880
Childe.

348
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
I've always listened to you.

349
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,880
Now, Yue Zhi

350
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
and Huo Jingheng

351
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,880
are separated.

352
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Please let them be.

353
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,880
They're separated.

354
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,880
It's your credit.

355
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
I didn't understand

356
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
your intention.

357
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
Please forgive me.

358
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
I hope you can forgive me.

359
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,880
Since you said

360
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
you didn't understand my intention,

361
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
you shouldn't have taken them

362
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
to save your brother.

363
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,880
But you guessed

364
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
where I put your brother.

365
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
It's really your own decision

366
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
to take them to save him.

367
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
I'm just worried that

368
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,880
even if I can't find Yun Shu,

369
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Yue Zhi might not think

370
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Huo Jingheng hid them.

371
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
I'm just worried about Yun Shu.

372
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Childe.

373
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
If I didn't think

374
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
Jiang Yun Shu was useful,

375
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
I would have killed him.

376
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Where did you

377
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,880
find him?

378
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
Childe.

379
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,880
It doesn't seem to hurt enough.

380
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
Childe.

381
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
Childe.

382
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
I beg you.

383
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Childe.

384
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Childe.

385
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Thank you, Childe.

386
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,880
I'll do my best, Officer Xue.

387
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
What did you say?

388
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,880
Princess Changping,

389
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
the new princess of Ning Dynasty,

390
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,880
is the daughter of the former empress?

391
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Absolutely.

392
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Impossible.

393
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
Jiang Yunqing's body

394
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
was taken back to Li State.

395
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
She was dead long ago.

396
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Could it be?

397
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
Ying.

398
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
Let's go to Ning City.

399
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
What are you going to do?

400
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
What are you going to do?

401
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
I'm going to pick the fruit.

402
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
A new fruit

403
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
that's unexpected.

404
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Your Majesty.

405
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
According to your order,

406
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
Prince Man has been sent to Qi City.

407
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
As you expected,

408
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Qi City is getting more and more raining.

409
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,880
Tell Prince Man

410
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
that the rain in Qi City

411
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
will not be heavy enough

412
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
in two days' time.

413
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
Yes.

414
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
I heard

415
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
that the new wine of Consort Yue

416
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
is popular these days.

417
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,880
She's always late.

418
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
I finally found her.

419
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
She's here.

420
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
So bad luck.

421
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
Yin Dudu

422
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
has been in the Palace of Phoenix for two days.

423
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
It's a long day.

424
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,880
We're just having fun.

425
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
I'm not tired of it.

426
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
I'm not qualified to be the palace's servant.

427
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

428
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
I really know my mistake.

429
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
All the bets are made.

430
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,880
You can go back to think about it.

431
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

432
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
Is it not good?

433
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
What's not good?

434
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,880
Is it the color of the city?

435
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Or the taste of the wine?

436
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Or the reputation?

437
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,880
Isn't it fishing for money?

438
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
The reputation is not good.

439
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,880
I'm not afraid of the reputation.

440
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
It's almost done, Your Majesty.

441
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,880
Look, it's almost full.

442
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880
Okay.

443
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,880
Then it's not bad.

444
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
Nothing to pretend.

445
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
The prince's voice is like this.

446
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,880
I can't use this voice.

447
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Let me see.

448
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,880
But the pulse is...

449
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
How about I give it to you?

450
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
Thank you, Mother.

451
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
Life is good.

452
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,880
Mr. Wang, we're leaving.

453
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Take care, Mother.

454
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
Mother gave it to him.

455
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
No.

456
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

457
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
I can't use it.

458
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
I...

459
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Why are they all playing cards in your palace?

460
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,880
It's not that everyone is free.

461
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,880
But I have to do something interesting.

462
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,880
The Empress Dowager has too many books.

463
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,880
I can understand it by reading it.

464
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,880
The Empress Dowager is so mean.

465
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
You have a lot of things, right?

466
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
No.

467
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
Mother left them for me.

468
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,880
By the way, I want to ask Tianzhao.

469
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Uncle.

470
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,880
You should call me uncle.

471
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Okay.

472
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,880
How about Tianzhao's uncle?

473
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,880
The imperial doctor said he needs to stay in bed for a month.

474
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,880
You're so worried about him.

475
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
You want to see him so much.

476
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
You can't wait a month.

477
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
It'll be fine in a month.

478
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,880
Can you ask the imperial doctor to make it in three months?

479
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,880
Or you can give him some of my brother's work.

480
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,880
Brother is so busy that he can't see anyone.

481
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,880
Du Tianzhao is so idle.

482
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
He's so annoying.

483
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
He's so annoying.

484
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,880
Since you don't want to see Du Tianzhao,

485
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,880
why didn't he stop you from coming here?

486
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,880
My good emperor.

487
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
Think about it.

488
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,880
Du Tianzhao came out of the Empress Dowager's palace.

489
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
He asked for something for the Empress Dowager.

490
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
He gave her something.

491
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Who dares to stop the old man?

492
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,880
Or you can ask my brother to come here.

493
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,880
Once my brother comes here, he'll be kicked out.

494
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,880
I can't arrange your brother.

495
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
It's your brother who arranged me.

496
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,880
I'll ask him to come here.

497
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
I'll ask him to come here.

498
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,880
You asked me to pretend to be deaf and mute.

499
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,880
You asked me to pretend to be blind.

500
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,880
Your Majesty is still angry with my brother.

501
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,880
Your brother has been taking care of Jiang Yunshuo.

502
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
You know that, right?

503
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
Jiang Yunshuo?

504
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,880
What's wrong with that little girl?

505
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
She's fighting in the school.

506
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,880
You know it.

507
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
You two brothers.

508
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,880
Why don't you tell me if I don't ask you?

509
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,880
I trusted her so much.

510
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
She's so meticulous.

511
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Would I give her a hard time?

512
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,880
She's so angry.

513
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,880
It sounds like you caught the husband and the illegitimate son.

514
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,880
How dare you!

515
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,880
I'm not Du Fu.

516
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,880
I'm the emperor.

517
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
I'm the emperor.

518
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
I can make the music pavilion the prime minister.

519
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
I'm so careful.

520
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
Okay.

521
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,880
Okay.

522
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Sit down and talk.

523
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
Come on.

524
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Anyway,

525
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,880
I heard that the prime minister can make the music pavilion.

526
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,880
I've never heard that the emperor can make the music pavilion.

527
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
Your Majesty.

528
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,880
If you really have a big heart,

529
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
just make up with my brother.

530
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
My brother is busy every day.

531
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
Busy?

532
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,880
But you seem to be hiding from him.

533
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,880
I'm not hiding from him.

534
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,880
I'm really busy.

535
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,880
I didn't run into you.

536
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,880
And I didn't hide from you.

537
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
I asked the great-uncle to invite you to dinner.

538
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
I've asked you several times.

539
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,880
You didn't come.

540
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
I...

541
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,880
Don't come next time.

542
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
I know.

543
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Just a meal.

544
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,880
Look at you.

545
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,880
I know.

546
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
I promise.

547
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
Eunuch Gui.

548
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

549
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,880
Send Yuechi to see me in the phoenix tower.

550
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
Go.

551
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
Your Majesty.

552
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
Why are you back?

553
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,880
I just got a report from the palace.

554
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,880
It said Li's crown prince, Yi Qingyun,

555
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
is visiting me.

556
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,880
He's waiting for me at the gate of the palace.

557
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,880
What a coincidence.

558
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
Okay.

559
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,880
I'll meet Li's crown prince at the phoenix tower.

560
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
Tell Yuexiang

561
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,880
not to come to the phoenix tower.

562
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,880
Go to the phoenix garden.

563
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,880
Yes.

564
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,880
Li's crown prince

565
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,880
is disturbing the reunion of his family.

566
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,880
It sounds like he's not a good person.

567
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
Your Majesty.

568
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
I'm late.

569
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
It's okay.

570
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,880
The crown prince said you're old friends.

571
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,880
So I asked you to come to talk about the past.

572
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
It's not really old friends.

573
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,880
But I had a meeting with the crown prince.

574
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
If Yuexiang said

575
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
you're old friends,

576
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,880
I would have been upset.

577
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
If Yuexiang said

578
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,880
you should have arrived at the imperial city.

579
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
Why didn't you come to see me first?

580
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
Your Majesty.

581
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
The Da Ning wind is strong.

582
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,880
It's really a shame.

583
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
I was distracted.

584
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,880
I was too busy.

585
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
I was catching the drug traffickers.

586
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,880
The crown prince and the guards were in a hurry.

587
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
They even fought with me.

588
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
I know I'm weak.

589
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,880
I saw the scene of the catch

590
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
when I just entered the city.

591
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,880
I didn't know who Yuexiang was.

592
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,880
The guards were in a hurry.

593
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
They protected my safety.

594
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,880
They fought with Yuexiang.

595
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,880
It was a misunderstanding.

596
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,880
I was carrying the drug.

597
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
If I was in a hurry,

598
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,880
please forgive me.

599
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,880
You were so polite.

600
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,880
I didn't offend you.

601
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,880
But I was defending several places around.

602
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,880
I couldn't stop the car.

603
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,880
How could the crown prince

604
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,880
disappear without a trace?

605
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,880
I was too weak.

606
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,880
I was sick.

607
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,880
I looked for a house

608
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
to support my family for a few days.

609
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
It was a big deal for me.

610
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Did you really see

611
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,880
no suspicious people

612
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,880
when you arrived at the imperial city?

613
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
I didn't

614
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
distrust the crown prince.

615
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,880
But the fugitive

616
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
escaped for one more day.

617
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,880
There was a hidden danger in the city.

618
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,880
You came from afar.

619
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,880
If anything happens,

620
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,880
I'll be very worried.

621
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
Your Majesty,

622
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,880
do you think I'm a man who protects the bandits?

623
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
Your Majesty is just worried about the bandits.

624
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
You hurt the crown prince.

625
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,880
But you never said you would protect him.

626
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
You're worried too much.

627
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,880
I misunderstood you.

628
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,880
I know I'm weak and weak.

629
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,880
I'm not a man of great power.

630
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
It's because my father is the only bloodline

631
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,880
that I have to find the crown prince.

632
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,880
Since there are bandits,

633
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,880
please arrange more people

634
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
in the courier station.

635
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,880
So that there won't be any misunderstanding

636
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
and the two countries won't be in a mess.

637
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
Eunuch Gui,

638
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
send the guest out.

639
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
Yes.

640
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
Please.

641
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
Your Majesty,

642
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,880
I saw it very clearly.

643
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,880
The man in the carriage in the basket

644
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
must be him.

645
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,880
There's Cao Ma inside.

646
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,880
Nianzi is blocking it.

647
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,880
But the eight of them are not leaving.

648
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,880
Then send someone to follow.

649
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,880
He wants to prove himself innocent.

650
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,880
Then we'll see

651
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,880
what the crown prince

652
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,880
is going to do.

653
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
We were

654
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,880
too late.

655
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,880
It's fate.

656
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
It's fate.

657
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,880
It's also unpredictable.

658
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,880
It's unpredictable

659
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,880
because I think

660
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,880
I won't let you down.

661
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,880
I won't let you down either.

662
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,880
There's still a long way.

663
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,880
Let's go.

664
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
Why are you waiting for me here?

665
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,880
Why hasn't the crown prince left the city?

666
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
You forgot that

667
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,880
I grew up in the Daning Palace.

668
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,880
It's been five years.

669
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,880
Now I'm walking,

670
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,880
I can't help but feel emotional

671
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,880
and compare it to the past.

672
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Although the scenery of Daning

673
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,880
hasn't changed,

674
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,880
it's still the same.

675
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,880
It's true.

676
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
But

677
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
though the country is different,

678
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,880
Prime Minister Yue is still

679
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,880
the same Prime Minister Yue.

680
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,880
I helped the previous dynasty

681
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,880
and never had a chance to interact with the crown prince.

682
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
I've only seen your dignity

683
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
a few days ago.

684
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
Why can't we

685
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
talk about the past?

686
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
The interaction between people

687
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,880
is not because they met a few times,

688
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
but because

689
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
their hearts

690
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,880
are connected.

691
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,880
If it weren't for you,

692
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,880
I couldn't have read

693
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,880
the new strategy.

694
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,880
The thunderous tactics that Prime Minister Yue mentioned in the book

695
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,880
I've learned a lot.

696
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,880
I really haven't written in the book

697
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,880
that the first position of the court

698
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,880
is not sincere, unfilial,

699
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,880
and unfaithful.

700
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,880
I'll just take Prime Minister Yue

701
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,880
as a man who praised me.

702
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
Today, I even

703
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,880
prepared a gift.

704
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,880
I know that Prime Minister Yue

705
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
has a sister whom he adores.

706
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,880
So I've specially

707
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,880
found a Hegu Mountain for Consort Yue.

708
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,880
The Shanbing is

709
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,880
the first Hegu Mountain in Li State.

710
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,880
It's very soft and tender.

711
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,880
What a pity.

712
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,880
My sister is a very cheerful person.

713
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,880
She doesn't like the things that ordinary women enjoy.

714
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,880
Thank you for your concern.

715
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
It's fine.

716
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
What about this?

717
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
This is...

718
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
That's right.

719
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,880
It's a long-lost

720
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,880
sword that can be used to kill.

721
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
I...

722
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
Can I touch it?

723
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Of course.

724
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,880
Are you sure that

725
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,880
Yuechi has taken the sword of the Crown Prince of Li State?

726
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
I saw it with my own eyes.

727
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Prime Minister Yue held the sword with both hands.

728
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,880
He held it with love and played it for a long time.

729
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,880
This little thing

730
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
is not a big deal.

731
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,880
Yuechi should be able to handle this little thing well.

732
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,880
Just keep it.

733
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,880
Maybe it will be delivered to me in a few days.

734
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
This Yi Qingyun

735
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,880
is really bold.

736
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,880
Captain.

737
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,880
Yes, Your Highness.

738
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
Keep an eye on him.

739
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
If there is any action,

740
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,880
report it to me immediately.

741
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
Yes.

742
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,880
Xiao Shuang.

743
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,880
Brother Yue, why are you here?

744
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,880
I'm here to take you home.

745
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
Home?

746
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
What home?

747
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
Back to Yue's Mansion.

748
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,880
I'm here.

749
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,880
Xiao Shuang, run.

750
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
Your Majesty, please allow me to go.

751
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,880
Your Majesty, I will not leave the caravan from today.

752
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,880
You two can live here in peace.

753
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,880
No matter where it is,

754
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,880
I just want to be by his side forever.

755
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,880
I want to spend a lifetime with him.

756
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,880
Qing'er.

757
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
What are you worried about?

758
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,880
Yes.

759
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,880
The blood of the previous emperor was left on Xiao Shuang.

760
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,880
But the result of the king's defeat is the result of the entry.

761
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,880
When the country was destroyed, he was still young.

762
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,880
He never participated in the affairs of the court.

763
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,880
Now he can't even live the life of a normal person.

764
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,880
These years I sent him to study,

765
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,880
taught him martial arts.

766
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,880
When he grew up,

767
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,880
he had already grown up well.

768
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,880
You are his only family.

769
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,880
Now you are back to his side.

770
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,880
His life is already complete.

771
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
Qing'er.

772
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,880
Although I don't know what happened today,

773
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,880
I came back.

774
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
But that day I met you in the palace.

775
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,880
I'm really happy.

776
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,880
I'm really happy.

777
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,880
We have paid enough for the past.

778
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,880
Now I just want to be with you,

779
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
with Xiao Shuang,

780
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
and Ling'er.

781
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,880
Let's start a new life again.

782
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,880
Think about it.

783
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,880
The End

784
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
Prime Minister Yue, you are here.

785
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,880
Why did the messenger come at this time?

786
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,880
The crown prince didn't listen to the emperor's permission,

787
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,880
so he came to my house.

788
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,880
This is not appropriate.

789
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,880
Prime Minister Yue,

790
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
the crown prince obeyed the etiquette.

791
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,880
So he ordered me to visit him on behalf of him.

792
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
The crown prince said

793
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
that last time he gave you the sand-bucket.

794
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,880
You didn't take it.

795
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,880
He didn't like it.

796
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,880
No, the crown prince ordered someone to find some other treasures.

797
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
He asked your son to take it.

798
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
This is too precious.

799
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
How can I take it?

800
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,880
The only son of Prime Minister Yue

801
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
said the same thing.

802
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,880
The crown prince said

803
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,880
that Prime Minister Yue can choose what he likes.

804
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
If he doesn't like it,

805
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,880
he can throw it out of the mansion.

806
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
Our crown prince is weak.

807
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
He can't afford to have so many soldiers.

808
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,880
The only way to get these things

809
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,880
is to go to your mansion.

810
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,880
I'm sorry.

811
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
I'm sorry.

812
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
I'm sorry.

813
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,880
No wonder you were so ugly just now.

814
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,880
How could you lose it?

815
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,880
The envoy should take all the treasures back.

816
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
Prime Minister Yue,

817
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
it's hard for me.

818
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,880
If I say these words,

819
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,880
the crown prince won't listen.

820
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,880
What does the envoy mean?

821
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,880
If Prime Minister Yue says it himself,

822
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,880
the crown prince will take over Prime Minister Yue.

823
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,880
I won't make it hard for you.

824
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,880
Fine.

825
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,880
Where do you want to meet me?

826
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,880
Your Highness,

827
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,880
you want to meet me?

828
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
You can tell me directly.

829
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,880
You're in such a big circle.

830
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,880
You want to give me

831
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,880
a thick hat?

832
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,880
You're carrying around

833
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,880
half of the royal city's precious incense.

834
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,880
If you take it,

835
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,880
it's a private thing.

836
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,880
If you lose it,

837
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,880
it's an insult to others.

838
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,880
If you don't force the prime minister

839
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,880
to retreat,

840
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,880
how can you come to see me easily?

841
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,880
At worst, I'll throw these boxes

842
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,880
into the wall.

843
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,880
I'll take them away.

844
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
I'll take them away.

845
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,880
At worst, I'll take these boxes

846
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,880
into the palace.

847
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
It can also show loyalty.

848
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,880
Yes.

849
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,880
Then why don't you do that?

850
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,880
If I don't do that,

851
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,880
there's a reason why I don't do that.

852
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
For example,

853
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,880
you're afraid that you can't show loyalty

854
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,880
even if you give it away.

855
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,880
The person who takes it

856
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,880
may not be happy.

857
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,880
It's better to return it directly

858
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,880
and just give it away.

859
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,880
Your Highness, please say it directly.

860
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
Yuchi,

861
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,880
I want you to follow me to Li State

862
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,880
and be the prime minister of Li State.

863
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,880
I don't care who wrote this love letter

864
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,880
and leave it to the wind to blow tomorrow.

865
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,880
I'm willing to sacrifice myself

866
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,880
and follow the star to follow the night.

867
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,880
If I can't get rid of the dust and dust,

868
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,880
let the world be the shadow of the wind.

869
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,880
I'm not born without a name.

870
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,880
I'm not born without a name.

871
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,880
I'm not born without a name.

872
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,880
Love is hot blood, cold blood,

873
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,880
soul is clear,

874
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
understanding in all things.

875
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,880
Like a machine,

876
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,880
the wind and leaves are not on the side.
