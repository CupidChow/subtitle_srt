1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If victory is not decided, let me fight

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The wind and moon are in the human world

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The young are known as the old

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The past is the past

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The old days are gone

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The past is gone

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The spring breeze is like a leaf

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The old days are gone

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The young are known as the old

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The past is gone

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Episode 30

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Do you think he doesn't like me?

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Is there really a man who doesn't like me?

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Impossible, you're beautiful

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But he doesn't want to look at me

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Maybe he's nervous

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're beautiful

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Can you say something useful?

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Didn't you just ask?

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If you want to go back to the princess, you don't have to ask

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
His Majesty is in the harem

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So he's not a woman

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But all the concubines don't care

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They can live together

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's weird

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
These concubines don't fight for favor

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What are they doing?

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's 128 taels

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't say it's for your face

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Why are you getting darker?

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Remember to open the window

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Open it

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't play with it

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Follow my steps

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's do it again

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Ready, jump

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I will avenge my father no matter what.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Your Highness, the Emperor was a powerful man.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He was skilled in martial arts. We...

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Even if I have to die,

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I will kill him.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Back then, my father sent troops to assist him.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But he abandoned his father at a critical moment.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He refused to send troops to save him.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Wicked woman.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If he had any humanity left,

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
he wouldn't have died.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Such a person doesn't deserve to live.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Your Highness, don't worry.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Maybe there's a chance to use you.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What is it?

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
His Majesty admires the one in the Palace of Phoenix,

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Consort Yue.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Consort Yue?

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Admire?

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
His Majesty is not easy to approach.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He approached Consort Yue

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and asked her to save him.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Sickly.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Why don't you two just poison me to death?

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Your brother came up with this idea.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He is really my brother.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Fine. Your Majesty, don't add to my food.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't dare to eat it.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't dare to eat it.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I always think

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
this is a good idea.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
How can we make it come true?

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You should eat more.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're going to get sick.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hurry up.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay.

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm really in your way.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm in your shoes.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You two, you two,

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
you must pay attention to my safety.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
One is your brother.

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The other is your...

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You still don't believe me?

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
One is my brother.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The other is my what?

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Tell me.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hurry up and eat.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I heard that

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Wenrou lives in the Quanyu Pavilion.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
When will His Majesty

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
pay the fees?

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I also heard that

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Wenrou is a beautiful girl

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
who is like a flower.

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
She is very kind

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
to His Majesty.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
She is very kind and caring.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's true.

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
She is not like you.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What's wrong with me?

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You are also kind.

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You are also kind.

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I've been staying up late

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and having a lot of trouble lately.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
My shoulders are sore.

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Can you help me massage them?

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
These days,

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I've been learning female skills.

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
My shoulders are sore.

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Your Majesty,

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
please help me massage them.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll help you.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Your Majesty,

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'll help you.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Xiaoyu,

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
let me do it.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm strong.

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Where does it hurt?

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Everywhere.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Is it okay here?

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You can do it harder.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Harder?

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay.

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
How is it, my dear?

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Very good.

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Xiaoyu.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Your Highness.

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm here.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
His Majesty left?

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What time is it now?

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Listen,

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I read another

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
very interesting book last night.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's a bit late.

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Your Highness,

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
let's have breakfast.

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
His Majesty asked someone

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
to warm you up.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay.

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Is Sister Lian'er here?

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm Wenrou.

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Greetings, Sister Lian'er.

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I haven't visited Lian'er in a few days.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So you are Wenrou.

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You are Wenrou.

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You are really very gentle.

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Actually,

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
you are older than me.

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Just call me Lian'er.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Lian'er is also a name.

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I like it at first sight.

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I didn't have anything difficult

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
to do when I visited you today.

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I just made a few local dishes in the north.

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Don't laugh at me if I don't do well.

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I won't.

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Did you make all these yourself?

156
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh my god.

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Lian'er hasn't had breakfast yet, right?

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's eat together.

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay.

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm not polite.

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This is also delicious.

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll have some.

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Thank you.

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll eat it later.

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay.

166
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll go have some.

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay.

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll go have some.

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay.

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Good bye.

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll go have some.

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay.

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll go have some.

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay.

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll go have some.

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Your Highness.

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I made some meat in the kitchen.

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I especially asked you to send it over.

179
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Your Highness, you're so nice to me.

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're nicer than my brother.

181
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's right.

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Eunuch Wang.

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Xiao Yue, go make some tea for Her Highness.

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes, Your Highness.

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I was saying

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,780
Since I was so gentle,

187
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,000
Consort Yue didn't even go out with me.

188
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,440
Everyone said that there's a little sister in the Palace of Phoenix

189
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,000
who's with Consort Yue every day.

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,800
So it's you who's gentle.

191
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,600
I'm like a mother to Ling'er.

192
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,300
And there's Empress Dowager and His Majesty's care.

193
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,400
There's really warmth in the house.

194
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,200
That's good.

195
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,400
Mother, don't be angry.

196
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,000
It's all Ling'er's fault.

197
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,000
Where's your mistress?

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,900
Her Highness and Infanta Wenrou are playing chess.

199
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,800
Empress Dowager is here too.

200
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Gentle again?

201
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,000
Didn't you say you went to see the flowers yesterday?

202
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,900
Infanta Wenrou comes every day.

203
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,200
She's almost here.

204
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,900
I'll make some new plum wine for you.

205
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,200
It's perfect to pair with the braised pork.

206
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,400
I'll make one for you.

207
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,800
Wait.

208
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,800
I'm borrowing wine to get married.

209
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,000
Because tomorrow, I'm going to the temple to pray.

210
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,800
I didn't know that you're so modest.

211
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,400
You even brought so much pork and pork knuckle.

212
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,600
I heard that you eat a lot too.

213
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Shut up.

214
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,400
You're only starting to borrow tomorrow.

215
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,100
Moreover,

216
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,600
wine is a common food.

217
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,800
Buddha's heart is full of it.

218
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,800
The next day.

219
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,000
Pour the wine.

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,400
Sir, we're going to close.

221
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,400
What are you rushing?

222
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,600
I don't have money.

223
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,400
I didn't give you money.

224
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,300
Master Badal.

225
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,000
Couldn't you have asked if you could drink?

226
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What's wrong?

227
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,200
Come on.

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Forget about him,

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,800
let's drink from the bowl.

230
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,120
I'm afraid of the music

231
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,840
Keep your voice down, my lord

232
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,880
I've arranged it

233
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,400
Tomorrow is the safe plan

234
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,280
Don't be afraid of the board tomorrow

235
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,640
I'm not afraid of anyone

236
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,280
I'm afraid

237
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,880
I'm afraid of the people

238
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Wen Rou

239
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,160
How is Wen Rou?

240
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,880
Come on, Shiuwa

241
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,080
It's a long way

242
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Why are you here?

243
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,360
Are you tired?

244
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,480
Have some water

245
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,240
Did you do what you promised me?

246
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,480
I

247
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,680
I

248
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,000
The matter of General Zhen Nan

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,320
Is it useful to take such a big risk?

250
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,240
Huo Jing Heng

251
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,760
Sit in his emperor's position

252
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,480
Is there a single move?

253
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,440
Shiuwa

254
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,400
Are you here to ask for trouble?

255
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,640
I won't take revenge for killing my father

256
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,840
I won't think about him

257
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,040
I should have stopped you at that time

258
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,280
I didn't expect

259
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,000
Why are you living in the palace?

260
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,480
My lord, my lord

261
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,520
Stop drinking

262
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,400
Are you going to leave tomorrow?

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,560
Yes

264
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,560
Yes

265
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,320
I can't stay in Qichen anymore

266
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,880
Leave tomorrow

267
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,200
Leave for the imperial city

268
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,280
It's not dangerous to go to the imperial city

269
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm going to find my Shiuwa

270
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,360
Can you find Shiuwa?

271
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,440
Can't find Shiuwa

272
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,240
I'm not so sure

273
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,720
If you出來

274
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,520
It's really hard to find a Shiuwa

275
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,480
What about it?

276
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,740
Your

277
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,160
Although it jumps down from the little horse

278
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,680
Can jump down from the high platform

279
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,920
Also can't hurt the vlog

280
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,120
That's good

281
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,840
We must protect Ling Er

282
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,000
Thats right

283
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,840
So that she won't have to explain to her father again.

284
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,800
Don't worry.

285
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,800
I've talked to the horse farm.

286
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,960
The horse is gentle and small.

287
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,320
Ling'er just needs to jump down.

288
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,680
Then people around will say

289
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,160
Yue Fei fell off the horse in a hurry.

290
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,000
He's badly injured.

291
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,040
I'll go with you.

292
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,240
I'll pretend to ride a horse.

293
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,120
It's a witness.

294
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,120
Okay.

295
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,480
But,

296
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,800
why Ling'er and Princess Wenrou

297
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,720
are so close recently?

298
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,160
They're so gentle everywhere.

299
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,640
I also think so.

300
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,480
Wenrou is always there.

301
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,120
And Ling'er

302
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,240
always mentions Wenrou in my ears.

303
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,400
She said she was so nice to others.

304
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,680
My sister is too uncompetitive.

305
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,360
Ling'er needs to compete?

306
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,800
I understand you very well.

307
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,160
Keep it.

308
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,160
Tell the people who should say it.

309
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,480
So what else is there to picture?

310
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,400
Someone can read it

311
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,680
but no one can see it.

312
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,700
Lin.

313
00:15:50,700 --> 00:16:05,220
You are almost there, just ram it up.

314
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,540
Will it hurt?

315
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,220
I don't think so.

316
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:15,520
Be careful.

317
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
Wen Rong, why are you here?

318
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
I heard you came to ride a horse. Come and have a look.

319
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
I'm good at riding. I'll teach you.

320
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Really?

321
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,520
So great!

322
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Learn something!

323
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
You went to the horse farm on purpose.

324
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,520
In the end, you sprained your ankle.

325
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Is it my fault?

326
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
Who knew that Chen Yao Jin would be killed halfway?

327
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
I didn't expect that Wen Rong would suddenly appear.

328
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
I'm sorry.

329
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
I didn't expect that.

330
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
I didn't expect that.

331
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,520
You two have been getting along well.

332
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
Although he ruined our plan this time,

333
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,520
it's a kind of love and hate.

334
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
You should be more careful.

335
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
In this world, besides your brother,

336
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
who else would treat you well?

337
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Me?

338
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
This is good.

339
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
You're so scared.

340
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
You're going to use your plan again?

341
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
I told you to prepare.

342
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
You're so easy.

343
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
I've already prepared.

344
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
I know you can't handle it.

345
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
I...

346
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Hurry up and tell me.

347
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
How am I going to die this time?

348
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
If you have something to report, please leave.

349
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
Your Majesty.

350
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
I have something important to report.

351
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,520
What is it?

352
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
I've been observing the world.

353
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,520
I found that since I entered the palace,

354
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
I've never had any strange phenomena.

355
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
I'm afraid that I'm in danger.

356
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
Your Majesty.

357
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
Su Jing.

358
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,520
If that's the case,

359
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
do you have a way to solve it?

360
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
There is a way.

361
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
It's just that...

362
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
I'm afraid that I can't solve it.

363
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
There is a record in the book.

364
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,520
If you want to solve this,

365
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
you need to

366
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
bury 50 concubines

367
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
in the palace

368
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
and offer three bowls of blood

369
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
to the heavens.

370
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
You need to do this for ten days.

371
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
There are 50 concubines

372
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
in the palace.

373
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
I've checked

374
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
all the birth dates of the concubines.

375
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Only Yue Fei

376
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
was born at noon.

377
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
Yue Fei?

378
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
This is really

379
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
a good luck.

380
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,520
Your Majesty, I think

381
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
that this matter can't be judged

382
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
by just one person.

383
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
There are all kinds of coincidences.

384
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
But...

385
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
Wei, you're too cautious.

386
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
Your Majesty, I think

387
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
that the royal family has believed in

388
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
the coincidences

389
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
and believed in the stars.

390
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
Your Majesty, Yue Fei

391
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
sacrificed himself.

392
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Yue Fei should understand

393
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
the safety of our family.

394
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
A small sacrifice?

395
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Why don't you sacrifice yourself?

396
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
Now, the royal consort is going to

397
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
die because of the Qing Tian Sword.

398
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
If it's a crisis, you can be responsible.

399
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
You mean

400
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
the Qing Tian Sword is going to be broken?

401
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
That's right.

402
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
Lord Zhang's ear is not fully healed yet.

403
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Why do you say that?

404
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
Si Bu Jiang.

405
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
This Yue Fei

406
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
is my beloved concubine.

407
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
But this matter is about the country.

408
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
It's related to

409
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
the people of the world.

410
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,520
As the king of a country,

411
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
I have to sacrifice myself.

412
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,980
Yue Fei should be released from the

413
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,520
hell for a few days.

414
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,520
Your Majesty, please think twice.

415
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Shut up.

416
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
I have something to say.

417
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
Wen Rou?

418
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
Why are you here?

419
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
Why is it her again?

420
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,520
Why is it her again?

421
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,520
I heard that

422
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
there's a rumor in the palace

423
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
that a woman born in the harem

424
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
is to be bloodshed.

425
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Not only Yue Fei is born in the harem,

426
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
I am also born in the harem.

427
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Yue Fei treats me like a sister.

428
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,520
I also know that she is

429
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
the one you love.

430
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
Please confer on me

431
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
as your concubine.

432
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
I am willing to be bloodshed.

433
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
I swear to the heavens.

434
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,520
What are you doing?

435
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
Your Highness,

436
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
it's a sin to see a snake.

437
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Please kill me.

438
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
And then give my blood

439
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
to the heavens.

440
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
Your Majesty's love is my love.

441
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
Your Majesty's love

442
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
is what I want to protect.

443
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,520
Let's go

444
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
Let's go

445
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
Let's go

446
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Let's go

447
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Raise your head

448
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
Let's go

449
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
Let's go

450
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
Let's go

451
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Let's go

452
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
Let's go

453
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
Mr. Yi

454
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,520
You are really a genius

455
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
I'm not a genius

456
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,520
I was so small that I couldn't find a place to stay

457
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
But I ended up in the capital

458
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,520
People die for money, birds die for food

459
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
You are a kind person

460
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
You are so gentle

461
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
This is my private affair

462
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
I don't care about private affairs

463
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
But you are so naive

464
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
Is Huo Jing Heng so easy to assassinate?

465
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
I can't tell you

466
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,520
Your revenge is really touching

467
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,520
You deliberately touched me

468
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,520
So I sent a message to you today

469
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,520
If you can prove this message is true

470
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,520
Not only can you get rid of Huo Jing Heng's left arm and right arm

471
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
You can also move his position

472
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
What message?

473
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,520
Do you know the moon?

474
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

475
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
How can I faint later?

476
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Just fall where there are many people

477
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,520
I will call someone to call the doctor

478
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,520
Remember, don't laugh

479
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
Don't believe me

480
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,520
Your Majesty

481
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Rise

482
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,520
The moon is here too

483
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
We are dancing together

484
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,520
Let's dance together

485
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Ok

486
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
Ling Er

487
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,520
The moon is here

488
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,520
What's wrong with her?

489
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
It should be the previous accident

490
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Hurry, call the doctor

491
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
Hurry

492
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
The moon is here

493
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
Ling Er

494
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
I think there is no problem this time

495
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Now the rumors in the palace

496
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,520
The moon is not a small miscarriage

497
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,520
I'm afraid I have to go to the lighthouse

498
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Yes

499
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
I have arranged everything outside the palace

500
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,520
I think it will be almost after a few more days

501
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,520
You must arrange the second one before the Empress Dowager returns to the palace

502
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,520
It was a simple thing

503
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
It's all because of this tenderness

504
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,520
Do you think her relationship with Ling Er is really so good?

505
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,320
Or love house,

506
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,520
house,

507
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,520
Your Majesty

508
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
Your Majesty

509
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
Your Majesty

510
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
She is gentle

511
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,520
She is taking the moon consort to the eight steps of Jingang Palace

512
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
Shen Zhi

513
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
Come back

514
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
The emperor is here

515
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
My Ling Er

516
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,520
You are so weak

517
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Why are you still in bed?

518
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
Don't be angry, Your Majesty

519
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,520
I have used many northern medicine for Ling Er

520
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,520
It's good for her health

521
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,520
If she continues to take medicine

522
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,520
Look at her face, so red

523
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,520
I have invited several doctors

524
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,520
They said her blood pressure is very high

525
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
Yue Fei

526
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
You

527
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
Are you really not feeling bad?

528
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,520
I

529
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,520
I am not feeling bad

530
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,520
Then

531
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,520
Thank you for your hard work

532
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,520
I will definitely take care of the person you love

533
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
I am very grateful

534
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
The sun and the moon can be seen

535
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,520
I just hope that the emperor can see it

536
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
Rong'er

537
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
And

538
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,520
Yue Chi was the one who pretended to be the moon consort

539
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
It seems that Ling Er was killed three times

540
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
They planned it secretly

541
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,520
But it was accidentally broken

542
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
I can't let Ling Er

543
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,520
Let Yue Fei die so easily

544
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
Something is wrong

545
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
Something is wrong with this gentle person

546
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,520
I think so too

547
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
I have arranged someone to investigate

548
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,520
It's not easy to make a decision now

549
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,520
It seems that in the palace, it's different to do this

550
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,520
Three days later

551
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,520
Mother will be back from the Li Buddha of the Cheng En Temple

552
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,520
I have an idea

553
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,520
But it's a bit risky

554
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,520
Tell me about it

555
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,520
The disease room needs a pavilion

556
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,520
It's easy to get out of the room

557
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,520
Why don't you just close it?

558
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
Close it?

559
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,520
Try not to be in the palace

560
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,520
So that Yue Fei's body problem can be solved easily

561
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520
I will just arrange a body guard to say

562
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,520
It's fine if the body is not seen

563
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,520
But I haven't thought about what kind of reason to arrange for Ling Er to leave the palace

564
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
It's better to have more people

565
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
You just said

566
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,520
The Empress Dowager will be back from the Cheng En Temple in three days

567
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
It's also good for the Shangyuan Festival

568
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,520
Yes, according to the custom

569
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,520
Mother will pray for the country in the Cheng En Temple every year

570
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
Isn't this a good opportunity to get out of the city?

571
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
Xiaohua

572
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,520
Xiaohua, come quickly

573
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
Sit

574
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
I am here

575
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
Xiaohua

576
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
You lost weight

577
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,520
Let me put it short

578
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
Tomorrow is the Shangyuan Festival

579
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,520
The emperor will go with the Empress Dowager to the Chengen Temple to meet the Empress Dowager

580
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,520
At night, the Ling Xiu Mountain outside the Chengen Temple will pray for the country in the name of the Kongming

581
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,520
It's quite a big scene

582
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
A bit of a slug

583
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,440
It's like Huo Jiang Heng's idea.

584
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,480
But the more you think about it, the more you'll be late.

585
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,360
They're afraid they'll create an accident and let Yue Fei die.

586
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,840
I'll just be on guard.

587
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,680
No.

588
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,160
This is a good opportunity that we can never have.

589
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,600
We have to turn our back on the attack.

590
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,160
Let's make a scene.

591
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,680
Yue Xiang, the Cheng'en Temple is a Buddha temple.

592
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,160
I don't think it's right to draw it like that.

593
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,480
Are these people?

594
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,480
It's not right to put the light here.

595
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,680
Trees. These are trees.

596
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,360
You two can look at it together.

597
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,080
Trees.

598
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:59,440
Tomorrow at dawn, the emperor will lead the concubines to the Cheng'en Temple.

599
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,120
I'll follow them and go to the Cheng'en Temple on my own.

600
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,560
At noon, the emperor will lead the concubines to the temple and meet with the Empress Dowager.

601
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,880
I've arrived.

602
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,240
I'll pretend to be a Buddha and wait in the Cheng'en Temple.

603
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,680
At noon, while everyone is resting,

604
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,240
Ling'er will go to the temple and change clothes and dress up.

605
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,600
At noon, the emperor will lead the concubines to the Cheng'en Temple and light the lanterns.

606
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,840
At noon, the sky is dark. I'll just walk past the crowd.

607
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,840
If someone asks, tell them that they're allergic to it.

608
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,240
I'll pretend to be a flower and fall into the cliff.

609
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,320
Yue Fei!

610
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,120
Yue Fei died on the spot.

611
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,120
I actually flew to the lowest point of the cliff.

612
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,920
There are not many trees in Lin Shou Mountain. I hid under the tree.

613
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,920
Ling'er was already taken down by the flying dragon.

614
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,520
Did you ask Ling'er about this? Is she willing to do it?

615
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,720
I'm willing.

616
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,520
I asked her once, but it didn't help.

617
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,520
Then, we can only let Ling'er go first.

618
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,320
Where is Dayun?

619
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,120
Dayun? Who is she?

620
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,520
I'm here to pray for the country and people.

621
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,320
Today, the emperor asked Concubine Zhong to pray with me.

622
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,120
If the gods know, it must be because our hearts are more sincere.

623
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,720
The Empress Dowager and His Majesty are merciful.

624
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,920
Don't come over. Don't come over.

625
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,720
What is the ancestors doing?

626
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,720
Everyone, stand up.

627
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
Stand up.

628
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
Stand up.

629
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
Stand up.

630
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,720
Don't move around.

631
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,120
Everyone's position is calculated according to the eight characters.

632
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,520
Move around freely.

633
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,520
Xiao Yang, I've been watching over you.

634
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,920
I'm scared.

635
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,120
I'm scared too.

636
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,720
I can't stand it anymore.

637
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,520
Ling'er, Ling'er, what's wrong with you?

638
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,520
I'm scared.

639
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,920
I'm scared.

640
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,320
I'm scared.

641
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,520
I'm scared.

642
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,520
Ling'er, Ling'er, what's wrong with you?

643
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,320
This... is Prime Minister Yue?

644
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,320
Why is it you?

645
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Why is Prime Minister Yue pretending to be Consort Yue?

646
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,920
Could it be that the Consort who has been walking around the palace is the Prime Minister?

647
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,920
What a drama. What a happy ending.

648
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,720
Is it still too late to jump off the cliff now?

649
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,920
How could this happen?

650
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,920
The Palace of the Deceased

651
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,120
Be quiet. The person who's turning around is dizzy.

652
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,920
I don't have the heart to be like you.

653
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,920
I don't want to wear useless costumes.

654
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,120
Rong'er, Rong'er.

655
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,920
How are you? Are you hurt?

656
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,520
If something happens to her, she'll come tonight.

657
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,720
I'm really worried about Rong'er's safety.

658
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,320
The Crown Prince and Brother Cao's layout is so clever.

659
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,720
Do you still have to worry?

660
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,320
I think the Emperor didn't make any decisions.

661
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,520
But it's okay.

662
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,320
It's okay.

663
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,520
Consort Yue is the news of Yue Chi's disguise.

664
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,920
I've already told them to let her go.

665
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,520
She's showing off under the guise of being a big shot.

666
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,520
She should be very lively tomorrow at the teahouse.

667
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,320
Yue Xiang has to be a person with a tail now.

668
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,520
As for the Empress Dowager and Huo Jing Heng,

669
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,720
they have their own problems.

670
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

671
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,320
His Majesty is here. He's waiting outside.

672
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,520
Who is it?

673
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,520
You're so annoying with this thing.

674
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,520
Who is it that made Mother angry again?

675
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,720
I'll go punish her.

676
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,320
Kneel!

677
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,520
Mother, I know I was wrong.

678
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,120
This time, it was just a trick to get Yue Xiang to stay.

679
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,720
A trick?

680
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,920
Your trick is to let a man out of the harem.

681
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,520
Do you know how they say you're a bad person?

682
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,120
Why are they all talking about me?

683
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,520
Why are they all talking about me?

684
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,520
No one is talking about Yue Xiang?

685
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,520
You're still talking back?

686
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,120
I'm only asking for your forgiveness.

687
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,520
I won't listen to your words.

688
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,520
What kind of forgiveness is that, Your Majesty?

689
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,120
You're hiding it from me now.

690
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,320
I'm old and I don't have good eyesight.

691
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,320
Can't you tell if it's a man or a woman?

692
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,920
You're not old.

693
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,320
I'm a man of great power and I'm the only one in the world.

694
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,520
Also, I'm not hiding it from you.

695
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,320
I just think that

696
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,520
with our mutual understanding,

697
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,320
we don't need to say much.

698
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,920
Right?

699
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,920
Since Mother is laughing, I'll...

700
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,520
Kneel!

701
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,720
Okay.

702
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,320
Kneel.

703
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,920
Be gentle.

704
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,720
Your Majesty, did the Empress Dowager bully you?

705
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,520
Of course not.

706
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,520
The Empress Dowager is the most ungrateful.

707
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,720
Enough.

708
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,120
It's good that you can help us.

709
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,720
But this time, Mother really let it go.

710
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,720
I thought I'd have to beat her up again.

711
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,120
You brought me here, didn't you?

712
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,520
To watch a play.

713
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,320
You can ask me 17 or 18 questions in one sentence.

714
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,520
You're really not tired.

715
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,520
Now, all the small-towners

716
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,520
are all pretending to be the bandits in the same round of the music hall.

717
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,920
Even the court's courtiers are also the same.

718
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,920
We're just one step away from the last fire.

719
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,720
The last fire?

720
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,920
How do you burn it?

721
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,920
Do you know that

722
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,720
the great man of great power, Wei Zi'ang,

723
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,920
is the head of the court.

724
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,520
Many people admire him for his politeness.

725
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,320
I've prepared a table for you. Please come in.

726
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,520
If he's willing to perform the music,

727
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,320
he'll surely make a big fuss.

728
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,920
He'll listen to you?

729
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,520
For the sake of the people's hearts,

730
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,920
he'll naturally listen.

731
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,520
Do you think that the current emperor

732
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,300
is really a

733
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
I don't think so.

734
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,920
I heard that he's made a lot of trouble in the palace.

735
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,520
Have you ever heard of him favoring someone?

736
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,920
How come it's so coincidental that he favored Consort Yue?

737
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
The past dynasty was full of favoritism.

738
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,720
Could he still be able to get back his favor?

739
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,120
The blood is flowing like a river.

740
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,320
The blood is flowing like a river.

741
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,720
The dream is like a dream.

742
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,720
I don't care who wrote this love letter.

743
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,520
I'll keep it until the day I die.

744
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,120
I'm willing to give up my life

745
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,920
to find the truth.

746
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,120
If I can't get my hands on the right person,

747
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,720
let the world be my witness.

748
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,720
I'm not born to be a nobody.

749
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,320
I'm not born to be a nobody.

750
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,520
I'm not born to be a nobody.

751
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,520
Love knows that passion can be cold,

752
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,920
but the soul is clear.

753
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,320
In all things,

754
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
there are both wind and lightning,

755
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,320
but the world is on the left.
