Is the Four Waters Pearl repaired?

Yes.

39
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,740
The resurrection of Dongfang Qingcang

40
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,280
is the fault of my oversight.

41
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,240
Please forgive me, my brother.

42
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,039
Dongfang Qingcang has resurrected for more than ten days,

43
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,020
but he hasn't returned to the Cangyan Sea

44

and stayed in Yujing.

After his identity was exposed,

46
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,179
he plundered an unknown fairy.

47
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,299
There must be something behind it.

48
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,300

and destroy the Cangyan Sea.

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,250
As the God of War in Shuiyuntian,

how dare you are you going to put yourself at risk?

Where do you place your duty to defend Shuiyuntian?

Brother, please forgive me.

56
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,110
It's because I was eager to kill the enemy.

57
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,870
I spoke too much.

58
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,810
Are you eager to kill enemy

59
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,540
or to save people?

60
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,980
Without my order,

Devour.

71
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,940
Since you know the Moon Supreme so well,

72
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,220
do you know what he likes to eat?

73
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,050
What Dongfang Qingcang likes to eat most

74
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,820
is a chubby little fairy with thin skin and tender meat

75
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,260
like you.

76
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,940
Boiled,

Little flower spirit, go!

People of your Moon Tribe

81
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,510
are so unreasonable.

82
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,990
If I didn't accidentally break into the Haotian Tower,

83
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,350
your Moon Supreme

84
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,190
would not know he would be closed for 30,000 years.

No, 300,000 years.

86
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,390
Not only do you not thank me,

87
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,230
but you even want to eat me.

88
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,710
You...

89
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,390
Do you have any humanity?

90
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,700
My lord accidentally fell into the tricks of your fairy realm.

91
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,740
That's why he was trapped.

92
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,110
How can a lowly fairy

93
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,270
be the savior of my lord?

94
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,710
Besides,

95
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,100
when did my lord say he wants to eat you?

96
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,110
Isn't the Devouring Immortal House

97
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,910
to eat us fairies?

98
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,790
The Immortal Devouring House

99
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,070
is just an ordinary bedroom.

100
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,310
Some places in Silent Moon Palace are called Immortal Slaying Pavilion.

101
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,860
Some are called Divine Slayer Ward.

102
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,380
They were all established when the first Moon Supreme was alive.

103
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,910
It refers to the auspicious meaning of

104
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,070
destroying the Shuiyuntian one day.

105
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:24,790
Really?

106
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,030
You didn't lie to me, did you?

107
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,030
I never lie.

108
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,260
My lord.

109
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,130
You may leave.

110
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,310
Yes.

111
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,230
My lord.

112
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,990
Orchid has settled down in her bedroom.

Is the doctors ready?

114
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,260
My lord, don't worry.

115
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,060
Everything is arranged.

116
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,580
After I studied it carefully,

117
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,430
I found that the Xilan Holy Seal really has a way to break it.

118
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,500
If I want to break the curse,

119
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,100
we can only kill one of them

120
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,990
with the ancient sword of Chengying.

121
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,240
Congratulations, my lord.

122
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,460
I don't know this book

123
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,060
was written tens of thousands of years ago.

124
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,900
The Chengying sword

125
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,660
was destroyed in the ancient war.

126
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,780
Even the fragments were scattered everywhere.

127
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,420
My lord, you may not know.

128
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,220
Although the Chengying sword has been destroyed,

129
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,330
the fragments are still traceable.

130
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,180
It is said that there is a piece under the Silver Lake.

131
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,260
I'll go find it now.

132
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,140
So this is what the fairies in the Shuiyuntian looks like.

133
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,700
Why does she look different from the one in the book?

134
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,900
Her appearance

135
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,610
is just average.

136
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,460
Yes.

137
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,980
Stop.

138
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,450
Stop touching me.

139
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,100
Who are you?

140
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,500
Why did my lord bring you

141
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,470
from Shuiyuntian?

142
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,210
How would I know?

143
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,380
Does he

144
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,550
like her?

145
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,940
Look at her.

146
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,700
Her face is ordinary.

147
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,820
Her power is not good at first glance.

148
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,180
How could my lord like her?

149
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,980
Exactly.

150
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,330
It's okay to be mocked in Shuiyuntian.

151
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,430
Why am I still being criticized

152
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,170
in the Cangyan Sea?

153
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,140
If the lord didn't like her,

154
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,910
why did he specifically order us to heal her

155
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,200
when he was busy taking over

156
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,550
the affairs of the Moon Tribe?

157
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,580
Look.

158
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,460
These

159
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,140
are the best elixirs in Silent Moon Palace

160
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,840
and are never used for outsiders.

161
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,750
I asked you to heal her.

162
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,880
What are you doing?

163
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,870
Greetings to my lord.

164
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,860
Leave us.

165
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,050
Yes.

166
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,060
Little flower spirit,

167
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,430
What?

168
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,100
Weren't you arrogant to me before?

169
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,380
Now you are afraid of me.

170
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,950
My lord, I was wrong.

171
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:31,860
No.

172
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,650
I hope

173
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,330
you treat me like you used to.

174
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
No, no, no.

175
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,030
It was my fault.

176
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,290
I won't do it again.

177
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:55,850
However.

178
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,670
Even if you are the Moon Supreme,

179
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,680
I have to say it.

180
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,230
Even if you took me away,

181
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,160
you can't take away my heart.

182
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,890
I won't like you.

183
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:06,730
Why?

184
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,150
No reason.

185
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,250
Because I already have someone else in my heart.

186
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,550
Changheng again?

187
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,550
Besides mentioning him,

188
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,810
would you say anything else?

189
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,290
Not really.

190
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,100
Anyway,

191
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,410
it's useless

192
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,840
even if you fall in love with me.

193
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,430
You can't force me.

194
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,230
Ridiculous.

195
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,960
How would I fall in love with you?

196
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,240
If you don't,

197
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,670
Moon Supreme lord,

198
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,770
why don't you just let me go?

199
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,030
Let you go?

200
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,170
Where can you go?

201
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,140
Don't forget

202
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,830
you are a fugitive from Shuiyuntian

203
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,010
and a spy of the Moon Tribe.

204
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,410
There's no place for you to stay.

205
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,170
You lied to me.

206
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,220
I never lied to you.

207
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,520
You are so stupid.

208
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,120
You...

209
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:58,970
Don't forget

210
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,660
I took you away

211
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,720
in front of everyone.

212
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,190
I'm afraid

213
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,120
you'll never be able to wash it off.

214
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,140
From now on,

215
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,150
you will be with me.

216
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,780
Understand?

217
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,730
Fix the Destiny Book

218
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,580
or you won't get out of this room.

219
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,830
This Destiny Book again?

220
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,930
You are a Moon Supreme.

221
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,640
Why do you have to

222
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,280
hold a mortal's Destiny Book every day?

223
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,330
What do you want?

224
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,420
Stop asking.

225
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,300
Just fix it.

226
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,670
I won't fix the Destiny Book.

227
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,390
I won't help the evil.

228
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,260
My lord.

229
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,400
His Highness Xunfeng requests to see you.

230
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,950
He said he wanted to return the sacred artifact of the Moon Tribe,

231
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,619
the You jade ring.

232
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,520
He is outside the hall now.

233
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,400
Let him in.

234
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,640
[Cangyan Sea, the main hall of the Silent Moon Palace]

235
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,630
Greetings to my lord.

236
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,530
Wait.

237
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,780
Let him submit it himself.

238
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,250
Yes.

239
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,840
What's up? Are you afraid that I will kill you?

240
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,150
You are my brother.

241
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,700
A man who did not hesitate to kill his father

242
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,090
for the position of the Moon Supreme.

243
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,060
How can you

244
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,300
show your mercy

245
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,730
to your brother?

246
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,790
When I'm not here,

247
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,220
the Cangyan Sea has no leader.

248
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,660
You are temporary as the Moon Supreme.

249
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,670
It's not seizing power.

250
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,820
I want to ask you on behalf of the people of the Cangyan Sea.

251
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,670
30,000 years ago.

252
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,020
Since you were not killed by the fairy realm,

253
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,580
why don't you go back to the Cangyan Sea to take charge of the situation?

254
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,300
As the Moon Supreme,

255
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,510
why do you sit idly

256
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,280
by knowing that there is civil unrest here?

257
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,310
Do you want to ask something about me?

258
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,280
I dare not.

259
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,790
I want you to solve my confusion

260
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,900
and give an explanation to the people of Cangyan Sea.

261
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,020
Why should I

262
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,250
tell you what I do?

263
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,480
I hope what you did

264
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,220
will be worthy of the sacred artifact of the Moon Tribe.

265
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,840
I'll leave.

266
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,450
My lord.

267
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,900
His Highness Xunfeng is so rude.

268
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,840
Is he disloyal?

269
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,080
Nothing.

270
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,030
He just wanted to kill me.

271
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,450
My lord.

272
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,490
I killed his beloved father.

273
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,610
It's not hard to predict that he wants to kill me.

274
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,270
But just him?

275
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,700
Besides, he didn't make any big mistakes.

276
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,460
It's still useful to keep him alive.

277
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,680
We can kill him

278
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,910
after he makes a mistake.

279
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes.

280
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,380
My lord.

281
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,070
The sacred artifact has returned to you now.

282
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,750
Wear it,

283
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,140
although it can't isolate

284
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,490
the conjoined damage from the Heart Curse with the Orchid,

285
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,750
it can get rid of the interference of the mind.

286
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,250
By the way,

287
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,710
is that little flower spirit still refusing to fix the Destiny Book?

288
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,300
Yes.

289
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,280
These days,

290
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,080
she kept saying she wanted to go back to Shuiyuntian.

291
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,520
Now she refuses to apply the medicine.

292
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,480
Nonsense!

293
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,660
How can she recover without the medicine?

294
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,350
If she don't recover,

295
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,410
how can she fix the Destiny Book?

296
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,850
Yes.

297
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,280
But I think

298
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,460
the wounds are not a big deal.

299
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,980
I'm afraid she's in a bad mood

300
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,070
and consumes her power.

301
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,050
I'm afraid that fix the Destiny Book is...

302
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,440
What should we do?

303
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,840
My lord, calm down.

304
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,910
The little flower spirit is as timid as a mouse.

305
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,080
It's her first time traveling.

306
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,560
So she will be nervous.

307
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,990
First time

308
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,470
traveling.

309
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,420
To find the best jade carpenter in Silent Moon Palace.

310
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,820
Yes.

311
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,570
I didn't expect that

312
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,630
even if I tried my best,

313
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,110
I still failed in the end.

314
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,200
My lord.

315
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,170
The Destiny Book of the god of war...

316
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,490
I've searched the Arbiter Hall.

317
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,560
My master's book is not there.

318
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,250
Dongfang Qingcang stayed with the fairy

319
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,390
in the Arbiter Hall these days.

320
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,250
Did he read the Destiny Book?

321
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,960
That's what I'm worried about.

322
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,030
During the Battle with the two races,

323
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,800
my master was hurt by his Hellfire.

324
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,030
The scars of Hellfire

325
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,790
will never disappear

326
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,800
no matter how reincarnated they are.

327
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,030
If Dongfang Qingcang saw the scars of Hellfire on the red spirit's body

328
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,050
through the book,

329
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,410
we can be sure that she is my master.

330
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,130
If Dongfang Qingcang knows

331
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,020
the primordial spirit of the God of War is still here,

332
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,000
he will try his best to retrieve her primordial spirit

333
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,210
into the Shuofeng sword,

334
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,810
and open 100,000 soldiers.

335
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,650
Then

336
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,710
the first God of War will turn into ashes.

337
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,230
Your 30,000 years of hard work,

338
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:37,770
wouldn't that be...

339
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,130
I did everything I could

340
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,810
to keep a petal of my master's primordial spirit.

341
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,450
I will never allow anyone

342
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,510
to disrupt my master's revival plan.

343
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,310
Inform the spies of Silent Moon Palace

344
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,820
to confirm if Dongfang Qingcang

345
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,420
knows the existence of the Destiny Book.

346
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,020
After confirmation,

347
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,160
we will try to snatch the goddess.

348
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:07,840
Yes.

349
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,870
[Cangyan Sea  Silent Moon Palace]

350
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,250
Flower sisters.

351
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,720
I beg you.

352
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,400
I know you are the Cangyan Sea's flower.

353
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,700
You don't know me well.

354
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,840
But for the sake of us all being flowers,

355
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,480
please help me this time.

356
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,570
Give me some pollen

357
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,500
to make those two brothers unconscious.

358
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,350
I swear

359
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,780
after I return to the Arbiter Hall,

360
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,460
I will make a tablet for you

361
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,890
and serve you well.

362
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,190
I beg you.

363
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:29,950
Brother.

364
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,440
You can't do anything.

365
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,880
Even if you can get out of this door,

366
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,980
there are countless guards outside.

367
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,400
You can't get out of the Silent Moon Palace.

368
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,230
Follow me.

369
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,280
My lord wants to take you to a place.

370
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,000
Hurry up.

371
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:21,230
Go.

372
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,480
I heard you want to run away.

373
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,920
No, no.

374
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,140
It's okay.

375
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,610
When you move in,

376
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,160
you won't want to run away anymore.

377
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,590
Moon Supreme lord.

378
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,400
I won't run around again.

379
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,200
Don't lock me up in the prison.

380
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,290
I'm afraid of the dark.

381
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,180
If you lock me up in the prison,

382
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,820
I'll go crazy.

383
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,130
Follow me.

384
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,890
Why is it so dark here?

385
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,190
I can't see anything.

386
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,760
Here is not a prison

387
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,320
but a dungeon?

388
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,240
Take a guess.

389
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,850
Moon Supreme lord,

390
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,280
please forgive me.

391
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,590
Don't lower yourself to my level.

392
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,140
I promise

393
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,940
I won't run away again.

394
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,570
Please.

395
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,760
Please send me back to the Devouring Immortal House.

396
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,970
Are you scared?

397
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,700
It's too late.

398
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,460
You'll have to live here from now on.

399
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,660
Follow me.

400
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,850
Where is this?

401
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,900
Why is it so dark?

402
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,160
Where are you taking me?

403
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,720
♫ Fall in love with your clear eyes ♫

404
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,850
♫ It's the most unforgettable scenery along the way ♫

405
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,060
♫ No one can ever replace what we've been through ♫

♫ Stories in the past play in my head ♫

411

♫ I will remember it to the end of my life ♫

Daqiang.

No, big devil.

427
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,010
Big wood.

428
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,430
Is this the Arbiter Hall?

429
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,050
♫ Blaze a way through brambles and thorns to search for you ♫

430

♫ Make light of traveling from afar for days with you ♫

431
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,750
Creeper, peach tree.

♫ I will never betray you even if I betray the world ♫

433
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,220
I'm coming.

434
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,170
Great.

435
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,270
There's no place like home.

436
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,950
I'm finally home.

437
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,130
From now on, you can see

438
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,980
such sunrises and sunsets every day.

439
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,040
You don't have to go to the roof of Yunzhong Water Pavilion.

440
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,310
Do you like it?

441
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,090
I specially built it for you.

442
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,790
All the houses, buildings,

443
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,090
every brick tile

444
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,530
are exactly the same as the Arbiter Hall in Shuiyuntian.

445
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,670
I thought you might miss home

446
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,850
because it's your first time traveling.

447
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,360
You can live here in the future.

448
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,720
Here is not Shuiyuntian.

449
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,070
Here is the Cangyan Sea.

450
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,440
Impossible.

451
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,540
This place looks exactly like Shuiyuntian.

452
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,220
How can it not be Shuiyuntian?

453
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,300
Creeper, Holly, Peach.

454
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,350
Come out!

455
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,690
You...

456
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,340
don't like it?

457
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,280
I like it.

458
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,760
Thank you, Moon Supreme lord.

459
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,580
Are you unhappy?

460
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,580
Tell me the truth.

461
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:17,930
Although...

462
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,920
Although it is very similar to the Arbiter Hall...

463
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,600
Yes.

464
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,700
Isn't it good?

465
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,110
The Arbiter Hall is so remote.

466
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,310
I can't see such beautiful sunrises

467
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,790
and these flowers and plants.

468
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,560
They are not my pets.

469
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,250
When I talk to them,

470
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,900
they won't answer me.

471
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,790
What are you trying to say?

472
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,960
I want to go back to my real home.

473
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,310
I told you

474
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,610
this is your home.

475
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,360
From now on,

476
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,330
you are not allowed to go anywhere.

477
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,330
I beg you, Moon Supreme lord.

478
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,460
I helped you hide your traces

479
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,760
in Shuiyuntian.

480
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,580
And I let you hide in the Arbiter Hall for so long.

481
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,970
I treated you well, didn't I?

482
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,450
But if you knew

483
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,500
I'm Dongfang Qingcang,

484
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,600
do you still help me?

485
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,420
No matter what,

486
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,900
we've been together for so long.

487
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,390
I will remember this friendship forever.

488
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,870
Even if I return to Shuiyuntian,

489
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,210
I will never tell anyone

490
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,270
about your traces.

491
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,080
Even if Lord Changheng asks me...

492
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,930
You always talk about Changheng.

493
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:08,900
What else do you have in your brain

494
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,610
besides Changheng?

495
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,100
I will not say it anymore.

496
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,900
Please

497
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,250
let me go back.

498
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,719
You still want to leave!

499
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,650
No matter what you want,

500
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:22,250
I can find it for you in the three realms.

501
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:22,880
Except you,

502
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,320
I didn't indulge anyone else.

503
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,699
Why are you still want to leave?

504
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,409
Why?

505
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,230
Little flower spirit,

506
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,710
let me tell you the truth.

507
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,640
There is no love

508
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,950
between you and me.

509
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,760
When we were in the Arbiter Hall,

510
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,450
I tolerated you

511
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,340
because of the Heart Curse.

512
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,450
Heart Curse?

513
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,590
This damn Curse mark

514
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,770
made me share your joy and sorrow.

515
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,790
That's why I have to

516
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,590
protect you

517
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,390
and take care of you.

518
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,990
But now,

519
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,320
I have the You jade ring.

520
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,960
It can isolate your mind.

521
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,690
Now you are captured by me.

522
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,290
I can finally

523
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,060
get rid of the weakness.

524
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,840
So

525
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,030
all your goodness to me

526
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,340
is fake?

527
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,310
You took me sunbathing.

528
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,580
You took over the morning dew to me.

529
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,430
And you made me flower soup.

530
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,130
It's all fake.

531
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:18,720
Yes.

532
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,240
Not only it's all fake,

533
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,830
I really think

534
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,390
it's disgusting

535
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,360
from my heart.

536
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,470
Keep an eye on her.

537
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,310
Without my order,

538
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,030
she can't leave here.

539
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:04,490
Yes.

540
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,140
Also,

541
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,450
find the fragments of the Chengying sword

542
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,130
under the Silver Lake.

543
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,830
I want to reestablish the Chengying sword.

544
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:16,970
Yes.

545
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,330
Dongfang Qingcang.

546
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,180
How long are you going to lock me up?

547
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,280
What kind of weather is this every day?

548
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,090
It's always thundering, windy, and raining here.

549
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,020
It's so cold that I can't sleep.

550
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,150
There's no sun

551
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,040
and no one to talk to.

552
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,140
Moon Supreme lord.

553
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,440
Dongfang Qingcang.

554
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,830
You're ungrateful.

555
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,090
You bully me like this.

556
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,660
Aren't you afraid of being laughed at by others?

557
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,790
Dongfang Qingcang.

558
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:44,540
Come out!

559
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,140
How is the little flower spirit?

560
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,980
Have she surrendered?

561
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,240
Not yet.

562
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,530
She shouts in the garden every day

563
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,150
and scolds you.

564
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:30,320
But nothing happened recently.

565
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,370
But it is said that

566
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,220
she started a hunger strike again.

567
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,060
She didn't eat anything.

568
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,410
She didn't eat anything.

569
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,220
Good.

570
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,570
She's gluttonous.

571
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,290
It seems that she will surrender soon.

572
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,030
My lord.

573
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,670
the fairy you brought back, she...

574
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,530
What's wrong with her?

575
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,680
She went on a hunger strike

576
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,170
and stood in the windy.

577
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,280
She is going to die.

578
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,760
Why don't you find doctors?

579
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,270
The doctors has gone.

580
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,360
But she refused them to treat her.

581
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,210
She said she won't live long.

582
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,180
And she has something important

583
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,690
to say to you.

584
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,290
Why did you go on a hunger strike?

585
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,380
Why did you freeze yourself?

586
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,810
Who asked you to drive away the doctors?

587
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,650
Do you want to die?

588
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,470
Moon Supreme lord.

589
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,180
I seem to be sick.

590
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,500
Listen.

591
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,180
I don't care about your life.

592
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,620
But your life belongs to me.

593
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,340
So before you fix the Destiny Book,

594
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,190
you have to take care of yourself.

595
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,950
Got it?

596
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,420
Yes.

597
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,140
Do you have anything important to tell me?

598
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,850
Go ahead.

599
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,300
Moon Supreme lord.

600
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,990
Can you go outside to talk with me?

601
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,300
Let's talk here.

602
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,610
No.

603
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,540
I can't say it here.

604
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,670
Stop!

605
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:46,690
Do you still want to be frozen?

606
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,240
Just say it here.

607
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,500
I have no time to waste with you.

608
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,090
Say it.

609
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,780
Louder!

610
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,790
I can't hear you.

611
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,160
What are you trying to say?

612
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:36,200
