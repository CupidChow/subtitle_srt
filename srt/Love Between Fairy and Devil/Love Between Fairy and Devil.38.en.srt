1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,910
Life, death, and sorrow.

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,950
Poverty, and wealth. Departure and reunion.

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,430
Every being in the world

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,030
can have thousands of fates.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,230
But there is only one for you.

7
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,310
Ultimately,

8
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,230
the one who can change her fate

9
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,110
is you.

10
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,510
In the past, I guarded the Arbiter Hall alone

11
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,510
when Master was away,

12
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,430
so I never felt lonely.

13
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,390
Then you suddenly came.

14
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,830
You took me to the sun

15
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,750
and made me porridge.

16
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,590
This is the flower soup I cooked for you.

17
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,870
Don't cry.

18
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,830
Why are you crying again?

19
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,550
Do you want to save her?

20
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,510
Or do you want to save Shuiyuntian?

21
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,300
If she is the best,

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,830
why did you remove her from the list?

23
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:33,950
Because

24
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,550
she is not worthy.

25
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:39,590
Why would I accept

26
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:40,990
a lowly spirit in my Fountain Palace?

27
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,830
How many people in this world can meet true love?

28
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,910
Countless people never meet the right person in their lifetime.

29
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,750
If they do,

30
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,430
they can't give up.

31
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,550
I am in love with her.

32
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,910
Not only will I keep my promise,

33
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,590
I will also prepare

34
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,710
a grand wedding in the three realms.

35
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,830
Let me down.

36
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,300
I won't.

37
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,389
Since we're going to be married…

38
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,100
You respect my choice.

39
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,030
We must live and die together,

40
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,710
share honor and disgrace.

41
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,420
No one is superior.

42
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,710
If I can't bear everything for her,

43
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,910
how can I let her

44
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,550
suffer alone?

45
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,190
Greetings, Moon Queen.

46
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,750
I've seen you wearing the clothes of the Fairies.

47
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,230
I've seen you wearing the clothes of the Moon Tribe.

48
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,990
And then I saw you in mortal clothes.

49
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,230
But the wedding dress tonight

50
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,710
is the most beautiful.

51
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,550
Master, you've had feelings

52
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,030
for me?

53
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,710
Yes.

54
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,100
Do you believe in miracles?

55
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,110
All things in this world

56
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,990
change rapidly,

57
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,910
except for love.

58
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,230
Why can't I love one person if I love the world?

59
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:56,990
Why do I have to choose between them?

60
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,590
The war between the two tribes is inevitable.

61
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,830
Do I have to sacrifice the one I love

62
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,750
for the sake of the people

63
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,750
with no other choice?

64
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,990
I don't accept it.

65
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,030
I do not.

66
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,710
As long as I kill myself with the Chengying Sword…

67
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,260
Orchid!

68
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,190
He will be safe.

69
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,710
If one day,

70
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,950
it'll cost you your life,

71
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,420
will you regret it?

72
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,510
Even if it means turning the world upside down.

73
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,030
Even if it's against the will of heaven.

74
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,710
No matter what the cost is.

75
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,950
I will

76
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,630
change her fate against heaven.

77
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,910
I've only known you for three months.

78
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,910
But it seems that we've known each other for 30,000 years.

79
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,430
Do you feel some deja vu tonight?

80
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,030
I know, I know.

81
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,710
Do you dare to turn around and look at me and say

82
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,900
you've never loved me?

83
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,940
Master, I'm sorry.

84
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,420
This world…

85
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,390
In this world,

86
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,150
everyone hates me.

87
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,150
What is true?

88
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:49,900
What is false?

89
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,710
Depends on me…

90
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,270
What I know is…

91
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,310
Worships me.

92
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,990
My love for Dongfang Qingcang is true.

93
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,350
-He… -Loves me.

94
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,710
Is truer than anything else.

95
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,110
I love the living.

96
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,830
I also love the one person.

97
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,350
It is my destiny to save the people,

98
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,990
not yours.

99
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,310
But it is my destiny

100
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,510
to save you.

101
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,670
Orchid,

102
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,310
I want you to stay with me forever.
