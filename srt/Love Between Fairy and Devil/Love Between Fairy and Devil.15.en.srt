4
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,980
Changheng.

5
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,260
Go back.

6
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,220
I'm afraid that I can't do it.

7
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,700
You ignored the restraining order again and again.

8
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,980
Who are you doing this for?

9
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,860
Orchid.

10
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,579
Do you really love her?

11
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:22,310
Yes.

12
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,790
I just want to save the one I love.

13
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,070
What's wrong with that?

14
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,870
Sinner Changheng.

15
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,950
You broke into the Spirit Lock Gate,

16
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,510
committed a crime of collusion

17
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,470
and violated the immortal rules.

18
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,380
You are deprived of the name of the God of War

19
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,310
and imprisoned in the Haotian Tower.

20
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,030
Who is it?

21
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,590
Black Dragon.

22
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,829
It's me. It's me.

23
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,030
What are you doing here?

24
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,990
It's already midnight.

25
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,390
Why are you sneaking around here?

26
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,310
Nothing.

27
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,190
I'm leaving now.

28
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,390
Stop!

29
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,430
Tell me.

30
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,670
Why are you wandering in the middle of the night?

31
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,990
What do you want?

32
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,550
Nothing.

33
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,060
Tell me.

34
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,310
What do I want?

35
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,470
I almost died during the day.

36
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,550
I'm just too scared to sleep at night.

37
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,230
I'm a woman.

38
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,990
I lost my parents when I was young.

39
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,310
I finally saved up some money

40
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,590
and opened a shop.

41
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,150
And I was cheated by Orchid.

42
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,630
That's why I come to her.

43
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,909
I want to make a living.

44
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,070
I didn't expect that

45
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,909
everyone here

46
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,710
all want to kill me.

47
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,150
What have I done wrong?

48
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,110
You're an orphan too?

49
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,740
Too?

50
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:57,950
You too?

51
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,870
I'm telling you.

52
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,750
I really thought

53
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,550
I wouldn't be able to escape.

54
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,580
I must be peeled and made a scarf by them.

55
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,710
What happened next?

56
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,470
Next?

57
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,310
Luckily, I was smart.

58
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,350
I pretended to be fooled by them

59
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,790
and pretended to behave.

60
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,950
Then I drugged their food

61
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,710
and it made them vomit for three days and nights.

62
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,230
Then I ran away.

63
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,550
Actually,

64
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,860
I was like you when I was young.

65
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,790
I had no parents

66
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,330
and wandered around.

67
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,440
Everyone pretended to be nice to me

68
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,230
and pretended to take me in.

69
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,550
peel my dragon bone and dragon skin to make medicine.

70
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,630
Later,

71
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,110
fortunately, my Lord saved me.

72
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,510
Otherwise, I would have been dead by now.

73
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,350
Black Dragon,

74
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,700
don't be sad.

75
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,140
That's how people are.

76
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,560
You can't believe

77
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,160
what they say.

78
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,710
They could sell

79
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,630
their parents and children

80
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,640
for money and benefits.

81
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,570
Let alone

82
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,460
people like us who have no one to rely on.

83
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,350
So...

84
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,080
I made up my mind then.

85
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,670
I will never be like

86
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,140
those who bullied me

87
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,280
and were full of lies and scheming.

88
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,510
I swear

89
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,020
I will be

90
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,000
the most trustworthy

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,050
and the most honest person in the world.

92
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,510
Why are you laughing?

93
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,270
Because you are so stupid.

94
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,810
Black Dragon,

95
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,320
what's wrong with you?

96
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,450
You were bullied

97
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,710
and you suffered so much.

98
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,320
You still want to be the most honest person.

99
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,490
Even if you do,

100
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,210
people will trample on your sincerity.

101
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,360
How can you be so cold-blooded?

102
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,950
I'm cold-blooded?

103
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,810
Yes.

104
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,700
I'm cold-blooded and heartless.

105
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,870
I'm not that lucky.

106
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,050
No one will save me.

107
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,360
I've been saving myself since I was a kid.

108
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,000
So I trust no one

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,300
except myself.

110
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,060
Besides,

111
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,370
instead of being cheated,

112
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,960
I'd rather cheat others.

113
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,900
In this world,

114
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,340
there's nothing more important

115
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,980
besides my life and money.

116
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,830
You are absolutely wrong and ridiculous.

117
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,710
There is no right or wrong

118
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,730
in this world.

119
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,910
All people are selfish.

120
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,710
I'd like to say

121
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,470
you're ridiculous

122
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,770
and you're absolutely wrong!

123
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,710
It's a waste of my time

124
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,710
talking to a scheming person like you.

125
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:33,810
Go back to your room.

126
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,990
Don't let me see you wandering in the palace

127
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,000
in the middle of the night.

128
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,470
Next time I see you,

129
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,020
you will be severely punished.

130
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:42,670
Go.

131
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,520
Fine.

132
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:10,760
Your Majesty.

133
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,180
Your Majesty.

134
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,120
How is Jieli

135
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,010
now?

136
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,740
Your Majesty,

137
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,500
Jieli has escaped to the Silent Moon Palace.

138
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,520
I ordered someone to watch out of the palace.

139
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,070
As soon as she leaves the palace,

140
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,790
we will catch her.

141
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,120
Got it.

142
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,030
Jieli.

143
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,050
Jieli.

144
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,350
Jieli.

145
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,340
You are the best and the most beautiful woman in the three realms.

146
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,840
Don't be angry, okay?

147
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,210
Jieli.

148
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,310
I know I was wrong.

149
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,790
Leave me alone.

150
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,890
Don't talk to me.

151
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,210
I'm afraid you'll cheat me again.

152
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:24,980
Jieli.

153
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,270
This is for you.

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,840
No.

155
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,810
I'll be killed.

156
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,220
I don't need treasures.

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,060
This is not an ordinary treasure.

158
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,440
It can help you escape from the palace.

159
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,120
This is called Bone Orchid.

160
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,050
Dongfang Qingcang was afraid that something would happen

161
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,020
before I fix the Destiny Book.

162
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,950
So he gave it to me to protect me.

163
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,260
It's transformed from the blood of the Moon Supreme's heart.

164
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,150
It is equivalent to the Moon Supreme.

165
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,080
I'll lend it to you.

166
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,380
When you leave the Silent Moon Palace,

167
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,970
no one would dare to stop you.

168
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:56,810
Really?

169
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,880
You lend such an important thing to me

170
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,730
for nothing?

171
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,870
Of course.

172
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,420
We are friends.

173
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,950
No, we are not.

174
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,780
Don't try to get close to me.

175
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,190
Are you trying to deny the debt you owe me?

176
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,240
Jieli.

177
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,790
I know you look tough but you are soft-hearted.

178
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,340
You are mean

179
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,480
but you are actually...

180
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,350
Enough.

181
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,000
You make me sick.

182
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,940
Let's go.

183
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,180
Wait.

184
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,900
You go.

185
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,950
I can't leave.

186
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,790
I promised Dongfang Qingcang

187
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,520
to help him fix the Love Tree.

188
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,900
I can't go back on my word.

189
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,380
You'd better fix your brain first.

190
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,430
After I died,

191
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,820
they will kill you next.

192
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,710
I will be fine.

193
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:36,970
No.

194
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,020
You have to send me out.

195
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,280
I'm afraid this treasure

196
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,000
is not as useful as you.

197
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,380
Everyone in the palace

198
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,270
has to do you a favor.

199
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,330
You must at least send me out of the Ninth Youxian County.

200
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,370
Fine.

201
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,460
Let's go.

202
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,310
Wait.

203
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,430
What now?

204
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,200
Dongfang Qingcang is connected to my mind now.

205
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,790
What if he doesn't wear the You Jade Ring?

206
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,140
I'm timid.

207
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,030
He will feel me when I'm nervous.

208
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,090
I'm with you.

209
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,510
I'll get you into trouble.

210
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,980
Leave by yourself.

211
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,750
That's easy.

212
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,000
This is my treasure.

213
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,980
In the whole three realms,

214
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,640
it is unique.

215
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,900
Put it on.

216
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,900
The Moon Supreme will not feel you again.

217
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,130
This is just an ordinary hairpin.

218
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,560
It doesn't even have pearl ornaments.

219
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,030
What's so special about it?

220
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,790
You know nothing.

221
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,600
This is not an ordinary hairpin.

222
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,110
This is a heart-hidden hairpin.

223
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,960
Back then,

224
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,640
the ancestor of the Moon Tribe, Yannv and the ancestor of the Fairies, Chonghua

225
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,580
were in love with each other.

226
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,540
But later,

227
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,100
the Moon Tribe were betrayed and expelled by the Fairies.

228
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,070
Yannv was so sad

229
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,410
and broke up with Chonghua.

230
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,300
So she decided not to let her lover

231
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,900
feel her feelings,

232
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,000
and made this heart-hidden hairpin.

233
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,940
It's an ancient treasure?

234
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,490
Of course.

235
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,760
Except for the Moon Tribe's sacred treasure, You Jade Ring,

236
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,770
this is the only treasure that can hide your mind

237
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,160
in the three realms.

238
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,960
When you wear it,

239
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,440
everything you think will be locked in the hairpin.

240
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,290
No matter how powerful the opponents are,

241
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,670
they can't sense anything.

242
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,480
This treasure

243
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,830
can deal with your Heart Curse.

244
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,500
Put it on.

245
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,250
To be clear,

246
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,520
I'm just lending it to you for a while.

247
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,440
When you get out,

248
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,470
you must return it to me immediately.

249
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:32,670
Let's go.

250
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,430
The sky.

251
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,110
The earth.

252
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,350
The air is free.

253
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,620
You're good.

254
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,430
The guards have to let you go

255
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,940
when they see you.

256
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,990
You have no idea.

257
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,960
I was so nervous just now.

258
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,810
Luckily, I have your heart-hidden hairpin.

259
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,320
Go.

260
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,820
Hush.

261
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,450
She is from Haishi City.

262
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,560
Take this.

263
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,650
It can protect you.

264
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,480
Go.

265
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,460
I took the Destiny Book.

266
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,720
It has nothing to do with Jieli.

267
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,230
Just come at me.

268
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,680
What are you waiting for?

269
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,560
Run!

270
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,600
It's the Fairy.

271
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,000
My Lord.

272
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,300
Please save Orchid.

273
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,310
She is...

274
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,260
The Destiny Book.

275
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,870
Lord Changheng.

276
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,800
You're awake.

277
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,850
How do you feel?

278
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,130
Lord...

279
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,280
Lord Changheng.

280
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,200
I didn't.

281
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,340
I told you

282
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,770
I'll take you back to Shuiyuntian.

283
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,080
Shuiyuntian?

284
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,310
What?

285
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,550
You don't even recognize the Arbiter Hall you used to live in?

286
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,470
Arbiter Hall?

287
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,910
I'm back to Arbiter Hall.

288
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,880
Yes.

289
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,760
You're home.

290
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,690
Lord.

291
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,410
By the way,

292
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,590
a Destiny Book was robbed by someone from Haishi City.

293
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,360
Is this

294
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,420
what you are talking about?

295
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,390
Yes.

296
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,200
This Destiny Book

297
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,130
is very important.

298
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,930
Fortunately, you got it.

299
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,200
Important?

300
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,730
Dongfang Qingcang took me to the Cangyan Sea

301
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,460
and did not hurt me.

302
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,850
It's not because I'm a spy of the Moon Tribe,

303
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,870
but he wanted me to fix the Destiny Book.

304
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,920
Lord, please check it.

305
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,730
What's the mystery behind it?

306
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,280
Why did the people of the Dongfang Qingcang and Haishi City

307
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,670
all want it?

308
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,720
This Destiny Book has been destroyed.

309
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,730
I can't figure it out.

310
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,460
We need to fix it to find out the truth.

311
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,720
I'll fix it now.

312
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,850
No hurry.

313
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,980
You just got hurt.

314
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,450
Don't use your power.

315
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,630
Take a rest.

316
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,310
I'm fine.

317
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,570
The sooner I fix it

318
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,790
and figure out the truth,

319
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,800
the sooner I can prove that I'm not a spy

320
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,320
and I didn't betray Shuiyuntian.

321
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,560
Your Majesty, how is it?

322
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,820
She is fixing it.

323
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,470
The fairy and the Destiny Book

324
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,320
have fallen into our hands.

325
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,170
Why bother

326
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,170
to disguise as Changheng?

327
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,710
If I didn't pretend to be someone she cares

328
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,150
and coax her to fix it willingly,

329
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,960
she would rather die than fix it.

330
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,700
It will be a waste of time.

331
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,040
Your Majesty,

332
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,970
Dongfang Qingcang is here.

333
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,320
So soon?

334
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,540
We are no match for him.

335
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,500
You should leave first.

336
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,050
No.

337
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,950
Everything is going well.

338
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,510
We can't make any mistakes.

339
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,520
But I...

340
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,820
The Destiny Book is not fixed yet.

341
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,420
We can't let the fairy find out that she is cheated.

342
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,520
Take some men

343
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,570
to stop him at all costs.

344
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,120
Yes.

345
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,960
Hand her over.

346
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,640
Who?

347
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,910
We don't have the one you are looking for.

348
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,480
How long will it take?

349
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,200
Soon.

350
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,520
[Thousand Dreamland]

351
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,530
This is an illusion.

352
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,670
There are endless changes.

353
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,400
If you want to break it with power,

354
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,290
you'll only fall into it.

355
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,940
Moon Supreme Lord,

356
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,500
even if you are powerful,

357
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,930
you won't find

358
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,170
that fairy.

359
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,760
It's just a trick.

360
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,530
How long can you hold me?

361
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,460
A moment is enough.

362
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,470
Xie Wanqing.

363
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,110
It's a mortal's name.

364
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,510
The Moon Tribe Slaying Festival

365
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,400
is to celebrate

366
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,250
the victory of the Fairies.

367
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,220
Shuiyuntian will celebrate the victory

368
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,450
the seal of the Moon Supreme

369
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,040
every day of the year.

370
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,380
Are you done?

371
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,200
Yes.

372
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,220
Thank you.

373
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,890
Give it to me.

374
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,990
Lord Changheng.

375
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,670
After you left Cangyan Sea,

376
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,520
you sent the fireflies back to look for me.

377
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,590
But I was locked up by Dongfang Qingcang.

378
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,230
He didn't allow me to reply.

379
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,040
Are you mad at me?

380
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,250
No.

381
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,560
I'm just worried about you.

382
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,500
Orchid, you want to run?

383
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,410
You're not Lord Changheng.

384
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,500
Who are you?

385
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,540
I didn't expect that

386
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,930
you could see me through.

387
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,240
This is an illusion.

388
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,970
I made the Arbiter Hall with my mind.

389
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,360
You can't escape.

390
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,130
Give me the Destiny Book.

391
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,350
Dongfang Qingcang.

392
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,280
He came to save me.

393
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,330
Save you?

394
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,060
He just wants the Destiny Book.

395
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,800
It's you.

396
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,560
You came to save me.

397
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,740
How dare you

398
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,850
catch my people?

399
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,860
That's impossible.

400
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,040
You can't find this place

401
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,960
in such a short time.

402
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,950
Who are you?

403
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,000
Why do you need the Destiny Book?

404
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,300
Since you don't tell me,

405
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,860
I will do it myself.

406
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,950
It seems that we've escaped from this fish tank.

407
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,940
Wait for me.

408
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,460
Moon Supreme Lord. Wait for me.

409
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,640
Thank you for saving me.

410
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,730
Why did you run away?

411
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,790
I told you

412
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,130
not to leave my sight.

413
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,640
How dare you run away with such weak power?

414
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,990
If I were late today,

415
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,250
you would have died, you know that?

416
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,560
I didn't run away.

417
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,440
I promised you

418
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,330
to fix the Love Tree.

419
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,210
I will keep my promise.

420
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,510
I won't run away.

421
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,980
I just want to help Jieli.

422
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,160
I don't care.

423
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,460
I'll say it again.

424
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,420
From now on,

425
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,360
you need to stay in my sight.

426
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,240
No matter where you are going,

427
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,330
you have to let me know.

428
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:50,960
Do you understand?

429
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,240
Yes.

430
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,020
Fog and snow are gone.

431
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:11,940
So it is.

432
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,530
Because the Soul Transformation Cauldron

433
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,630
refined evil spirit every day,

434
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,980
the grief and despair of the deceased

435
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,120
can't disperse.

436
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,140
That's why there was fog and snow

437
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,620
in Haishi City.

438
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,920
Now you've broken the Cauldron,

439
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,520
the fog disappeared.

440
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,360
That's great.

441
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,780
Moon Supreme Lord.

442
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,500
I'm fine.

443
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,340
I'm okay

444
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,690
and the Destiny Book is here.

445
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,690
Not only that,

446
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,080
I fix it.

447
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,750
Look.

448
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,620
Take a look.

449
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:51,830
Look.

450
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,150
It's really fixed?

451
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,030
Yes.

452
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,380
Didn't you want me to fix it?

453
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,100
How is it?

454
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,480
Are you happy?

455
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,470
Why did you fix it so fast this time?

456
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,820
I...

457
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,220
I just want to share your burden.

458
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,230
Tell me the truth.

459
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,400
Lord of Haishi City

460
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,080
is too cunning.

461
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,430
He pretended to be Lord Changheng

462
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,160
and asked me to fix the Destiny Book.

463
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,160
When I asked you to fix it,

464
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,670
you won't do it with all kinds of excuses.

465
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,990
You were quite motivated when you met Changheng.

466
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,140
Moon Supreme Lord, listen to me.

467
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,650
Listen to me.

468
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,580
Do you know

469
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,310
how I saw it through?

470
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,400
Do you remember

471
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,910
when you lived in the Arbiter Hall,

472
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,470
you broke my wooden stand?

473
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,980
But the wooden stand in this illusion

474
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,450
was intact.

475
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,500
That's why

476
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,100
I saw through his scheme.

477
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,110
Because only the two of us

478
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,340
know about this.

479
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:08,860
By the way,

480
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,500
the Lord of Haishi City said

481
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,600
there were thousands of illusions

482
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,160
and thousands of me.

483
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,640
How did you find me so soon?

484
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,790
Let alone these illusions,

485
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,150
even if he put you

486
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,500
in thousands of identical orchids,

487
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,600
I will find you in an instant.

488
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,590
So don't run away again.

489
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,530
Even if you run to the end of the Memory Loss River

490
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,740
and the edge of the world,

491
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,890
I can still find you.

492
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,480
Understand?

493
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,500
You...

494
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,880
Why are you crying again?

495
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,580
I'm so happy.

496
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,710
Back then,

497
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,400
my master said the same thing to me.

498
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,420
My master was

499
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,230
the most important person

500
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,360
to me.

501
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,880
And you...

502
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:42,980
[Xishan, Spirit-Shattering Abyss]

503
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,300
His Majesty was badly injured.

504
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,230
I came here

505
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,880
to ask for help from Evil God.

506
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:46,360
[Tai Sui]

507
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:45,600
He's protected by the evil spirits.

508
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,370
Who can hurt him?

509
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,670
Dongfang Qingcang.

510
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:52,090
Dongfang Qingcang?

511
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,730
I thought I won't have any opponent

512
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,020
in the three realms after Taiyi.

513
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,650
Now it seems

514
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,250
quite interesting.

515
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,930
Thank you for saving me.

516
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,560
Don't worry.

517
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,910
I...

518
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:39,280
I've found the reincarnation of the fairy, Xi Yun.

519
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,920
Soon,

520
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,810
she will be brought to the Spirit-Shattering Abyss

521
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,830
and help you break the realm.

[Cangyan Sea, Dark Pine Forest]

523
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,610
Where is this place?

524
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,420
Hunting camp.

525
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,480
Why are all hunters women?

526
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,540
There aren't many men here.

527
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,410
Are you still angry?

528
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,220
No.

529
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,950
Yes, you are.

530
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,980
Wooden Head.

531
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,540
I know I was wrong.

532
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,060
I won't run around anymore.

533
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,530
No matter where I go,

534
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,750
I will tell you.

535
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,500
Okay?

536
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,330
Eat.

537
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,390
How do you know I'm hungry?

538
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,710
You just fixed the Destiny Book

539
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,800
and got frightened.

540
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,890
Then you fainted.

541
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,460
You're useless.

542
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:54,930
It tastes good.

543
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,750
Where did you get this hairpin?

544
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,050
Jieli lent it to me.

545
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:09,970
It's nothing.

546
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:10,810
It's worthless.

547
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,650
What are you doing?

548
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,650
You are the Moon Supreme Lord.

549
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,650
You have everything in the world.

550
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,170
You won't try to rob

551
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,550
my stuff?

552
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,490
This heart-hidden hairpin was made by Yannv,

553
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,640
the founder of the Moon Tribe.

554
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,660
How come it is your stuff?

555
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,050
No.

556
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,980
I'll return it later.

557
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,320
If Jieli asks me to pay,

558
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,050
I can't afford it.

559
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,510
You can keep it,

560
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,650
but you can't wear it.

561
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,240
Take it off.

562
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,390
No.

563
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,070
Why?

564
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,250
It's nothing.

565
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,170
Why?

566
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,220
It's nothing.

567
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,480
Why?

568
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,070
Because...

569
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,910
Because I don't want you to know

570
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,330
what I'm thinking.

571
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,910
I know what you are thinking

572
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,590
so I can protect you in time.

573
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,980
What's wrong with that?

574
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,150
You almost lost your life

575
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,670
because of this hairpin.

576
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,230
I want to wear it.

577
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,240
Anyway,

578
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,550
you can't just come into my heart.

579
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,140
It's like you can't just break into someone else's house

580
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,610
without permission.

581
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,150
I can go

582
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,910
wherever I want.

583
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,550
I can have

584
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,640
whatever I want.

585
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,870
You...

586
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,450
Anyway, I insist,

587
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,920
not even you are the Moon Supreme Lord.

588
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,440
Even if I'm in danger one day,

589
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,780
you can't save me.

590
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,040
People have secrets.

591
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,280
But why can I do it in the past?

592
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,460
You didn't mind

593
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,180
I knew what you were thinking.

594
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,350
The past is the past.

595
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,030
What's the difference now?

596
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:12,120
