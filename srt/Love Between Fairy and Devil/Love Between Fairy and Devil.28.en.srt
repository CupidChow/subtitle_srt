4
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,060
Find a chance

5
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,300
to drop this blood

6
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,300
on Orchid's Bone Orchid.

7
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,539
Whose blood is this?

8
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,460
Will it hurt Orchid?

9
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,020
Don't ask anything you shouldn't know.

10
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,020
So,

11
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,660
you've been undercover for a long time.

12
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,740
Do you take her as your good friend now?

13
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:10,539
How is that possible?

14
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,220
I'm loyal to the pavilion master and His Majesty.

15
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,140
That's good.

16
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,900
Don't forget who you are.

17
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:20,940
Yes.

18
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:23,579
If your identity as a spy is exposed,

19
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:26,210
do you think Shangque will still love you?

20
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,820
Will Orchid still treat you with sincerity?

21
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,410
Yes, you're right.

22
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,340
If my memory serves right,

23
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,579
you have eaten up

24
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,220
the antidote His Majesty gave you, right?

25
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,180
Hurry!

26
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,110
Go ahead to have a look.

27
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:45,700
Who is it?

28
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,079
Jieli.

29
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:54,920
Jieli.

30
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,770
Why are you here?

31
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,930
Go check other places.

32
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,610
Yes.

33
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:01,970
Yes.

34
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:02,680
Hurry!

35
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,010
I came here to hide treasures.

36
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,080
Hide treasures?

37
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:11,760
Yes.

38
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,800
Hide treasures.

39
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,320
What treasure?

40
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,050
These.

41
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,970
You know

42
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,650
I have weak power and poor cultivation.

43
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,650
As an orphan,

44
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,560
I have been wandering and bullied since I was young.

45
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,840
If I get something good,

46
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,610
even a bite of buns,

47
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,329
someone will snatch it before I warm it up.

48
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,000
Not to mention being beaten.

49
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,610
I almost died several times.

50
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,960
So,

51
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,640
I developed a habit.

52
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,450
I don't carry any treasures with me.

53
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,000
Instead, I hide treasures wherever I go.

54
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,040
As the saying goes,

55
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,250
a clever rabbit has three burrows.

56
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:46,800
What do you think?

57
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,840
Smart, right?

58
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,890
Jieli.

59
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,610
Listen.

60
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,450
You don't have to hide anymore.

61
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,640
This is the Silent Moon Palace.

62
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,520
I'm here with you.

63
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,250
No one will hurt you.

64
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,760
You talk big again.

65
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,940
If I offend the lord one day,

66
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,290
and he sends me to dig stones around the Silver Lake,

67
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,730
how can you protect me?

68
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,170
Well,

69
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,640
I can go to the Silver Lake with you.

70
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,610
I’m strong.

71
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,920
I can dig more.

72
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,000
What's wrong?

73
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,360
I just think you are too nice to me.

74
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,730
If you find out I'm lying to you one day,

75
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,360
you won't be so nice to me.

76
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,050
No.

77
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,880
How many times have you lied to me?

78
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,010
Have I ever blamed you?

79
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,200
Even if you lie to me 100 times,

80
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,080
or a thousand times,

81
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,850
I'm willing to believe you.

82
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,920
Stop talking nonsense.

83
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,280
I'm serious.

84
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,200
I will pledge my loyalty to Your Majesty.

85
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,690
From now on,

86
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,520
you're a member of Liufang Pavilion.

87
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,600
You won't be bullied again.

88
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,810
This is Heart Eroding Pill.

89
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,440
If the poisoned doesn't take the antidote for three days,

90
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,480
the poison will come into effect

91
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,520
and cause death.

92
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,440
This is the antidote for three months.

93
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:49,480
The first task for you

94
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,280
is to take her out of the Silent Moon Palace.

95
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,720
Greetings to my lord.

96
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,340
Brother, are you going to the Mountain and Moon Festival

97
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,440
to meet the woman from Fairies?

98
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,840
My lord, please think twice!

99
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,740
Fairies are hypocritical and heartless.

100
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,960
They have evil intentions.

101
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,690
The woman is a jinx.

102
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,780
Please cut off your ill-fated relationship

103
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,170
and return to the palace.

104
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,020
Please cut off your ill-fated relationship

105
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,159
and return to the palace.

106
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,920
I can't bear to see you make more mistakes,

107
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,200
so I played this trick.

108
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,570
Even if I have to be punished,

109
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,280
I have no regrets.

110
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,520
His Highness Xunfeng

111
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,930
is devoted to the Moon Tribe.

112
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,570
Because of the woman from Fairies,

113
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,130
hundreds of thousands of our soldiers were unable to return.

114
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,560
She deserves to die.

115
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,010
But Your Majesty dotes on her.

116
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,660
She is a jinx.

117
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,340
She deserves to die!

118
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,890
She deserves to die!

119
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,440
She deserves to die!

120
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,050
She deserves to die!

121
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,370
She deserves to die!

122
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,690
That woman will only bring disaster.

123
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,840
If we can stop you from going your own way,

124
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,890
it doesn't matter if we die!

125
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,220
It doesn't matter if we die!

126
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,820
It doesn't matter if we die!

127
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,820
It doesn't matter if we die!

128
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,220
My lord, please think twice!

129
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,580
My lord, please think twice!

130
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,100
My lord, that woman can only bring disaster!

131
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,450
My lord, please think twice!

132
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,700
My lord, please think twice!

133
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,580
My lord,

134
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,700
please think twice!

135
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,679
My lord.

136
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,130
My lord.

137
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,560
My lord. My lord. My lord.

138
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,840
If I had never met Orchid,

139
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,240
no one would teach me how to forgive.

140
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,610
If you irritate me,

141
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,440
this is how you will end up.

142
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,120
Brother.

143
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,970
Xunfeng.

144
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,970
If Orchid hadn't found the truth of

145
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,880
Father's suicide,

146
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,740
you would have been executed by thunder

147
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,530
on the anniversary of Father's death.

148
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,800
If you still regard me as your brother,

149
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,480
you should regard her as your sister-in-law.

150
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,600
Sister-in-law?

151
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,050
You are serious about her.

152
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,640
You want to marry her?

153
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,080
Yes.

154
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,320
I love her.

155
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,320
I will not only meet her on Mountain and Moon Festival,

156
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,490
but also prepare

157
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,660
the grandest wedding within the three realms for her.

158
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,280
Raise your heads.

159
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,970
Since you all respect me,

160
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,690
from now on,

161
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,480
you should love her as much as you respect me.

162
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,280
You said that since she is from Fairies,

163
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,450
she must be wicked.

164
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,210
But you don't know she is nice and gentle.

165
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,240
She has never had any prejudice against the Moon Tribe.

166
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,650
She has treated us

167
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,570
with equal respect and love.

168
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,760
You said she is a jinx,

169
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,760
but you don't know she saved my life.

170
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,250
She looks weak and delicate,

171
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,410
but you don't know how brave she is.

172
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,250
She's the bravest woman within the three realms.

173
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,080
She won't bring disaster.

174
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,400
On the contrary,

175
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,280
only she

176
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,090
deserves to be the Moon Queen of the people in Cangyan Sea.

177
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,920
But

178
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,080
it's indeed my fault

179
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,360
to fail to bring back our hundreds of thousands of soldiers.

180
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,850
I am willing to bear the Bone Devouring Spike as punishment

181
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,080
and apologize to the soldiers and people of the Moon Tribe.

182
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,930
My lord.

183
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,250
Please think twice.

184
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,860
You can't do this!

185
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,160
Brother, please think twice!

186
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,770
My lord, please think twice!

187
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,010
My lord.

188
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,010
Once the Bone Devouring Spike enters your body,

189
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,010
every midnight till dawn,

190
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,970
the spike will flow in your body

191
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,050
and penetrate your organs.

192
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,760
The pain it brings

193
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,440
is like a thousand ants eating your flesh

194
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,450
and your bones being cut off.

195
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,840
Brother,

196
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,400
this is the greatest punishment in the Cangyan Sea.

197
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,050
I hereby swear in the name of the Moon Supreme Lord.

198
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,440
I won't remove the spike out of my body

199
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,000
until the hundreds of thousands of soldiers come back!

200
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,440
Are you satisfied

201
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,550
with this?

202
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,780
My lord.

203
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,050
-My lord. -My lord.

204
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,210
I also swore that

205
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,440
even if I die,

206
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,520
I won't let her down.

207
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,450
Whether you acknowledge her

208
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,760
or not,

209
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,020
my wife

210
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,440
will be her,

211
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,010
and only her.

212
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,750
♫ Waiting for the moment when the sky collapses and the ground cracks ♫

213
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,200
♫ When it collapses and shatters, open your eyes ♫

214
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,950
Again.

215
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,790
♫ There is nowhere to put the soul but only to land ♫

216

238
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,050

♫ Even time is suspended ♫

♫ Farewell Love ♫

251
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,440
Wooden Head.

252
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,530
Wooden Head. What's wrong with you?

253
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,530
Let go of me! Let go of me!

254
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,890
Let go of me, Shangque!

255
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,730
What are you doing?

256
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,960
Why did you kick me out?

257
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,920
My lord asked you to go back first.

258
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,460
I don't want to go back.

259
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,490
I want to see him.

260
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,210
Let me in.

261
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,240
Jieli!

262
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,490
Put me down.

263
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,460
Why?

264
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,380
Why can they all go in?

265
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,420
Put me down.

266
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,480
My lord has specifically instructed that

267
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,760
you're not allowed to go in.

268
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,280
Put me down.

269
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,850
This is the lord's order.

270
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,240
I can't disobey it.

271
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,520
Lady,

272
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,560
go back.

273
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,170
Shangque.

274
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,720
Don't give me speeches, okay?

275
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,170
Just tell me,

276
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,960
are we good friends?

277
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,260
Of course we are.

278
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,000
Okay.

279
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,420
Since we're friends,

280
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,320
tell me.

281
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,410
Wooden Head suddenly fainted in front of me.

282
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,100
You not only refused to tell me why,

283
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,940
but also kicked me out

284
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,740
and didn't let me see him.

285
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,170
How can you call yourself a friend?

286
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,560
Lady,

287
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,970
don't make it difficult for me.

288
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,410
I'm not.

289
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,850
Since he didn't want to tell me,

290
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,240
then you tell me.

291
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,520
What happened to him on earth?

292
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,610
Shangque.

293
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,930
We've known each other for so long.

294
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,840
I know

295
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,180
you are righteous and loyal

296
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,200
and never lie.

297
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,460
Please tell me what happened to him.

298
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,140
OK?

299
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,840
I'm really worried about him.

300
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,460
My lord...

301
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,650
He...

302
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,370
What's wrong with him? Tell me.

303
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,560
In order to go to the Mountain and Moon Festival with you,

304
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,960
he received nine Bone Devouring Spikes.

305
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,040
From then on,

306
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,010
every midnight,

307
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,710
those spikes will...

308
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,950
What will happen?

309
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,970
They will travel through his body

310
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,400
and penetrate his organs.

311
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,510
The pain is like a thousand ants eating the flesh

312
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,780
and bones being cut off.

313
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,170
He doesn't want you to go in

314
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,540
because he doesn't want you to see him

315
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,860
in pain.

316
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,410
Why

317
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,360
did he do this?

318
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,920
He said

319
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,720
he wouldn't remove the spikes out of his body

320
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,720
until the hundreds of thousands of soldiers come back.

321
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,080
This is the price he paid for being with you

322
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,130
and an explanation for the people of the Moon Tribe.

323
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,040
I see.

324
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,040
I'll wait for him here.

325
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,210
Hang in there, my lord.

326
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,730
Take some medicine. You'll be fine.

327
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,340
Please.

328
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,520
Hang in there, my lord.

329
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,260
My lord, take some medicine.

330
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,450
Ask them to leave!

331
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,160
Leave!

332
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,320
Yes.

333
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,330
Wooden Head, you are awake.

334
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:04,970
How are you?

335
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,280
Are you alright?

336
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,090
Follow me.

337
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,890
My lord.

338
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:51,610
Open it.

339
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,570
This is the fabric made of ancient dark spiders' threads.

340
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,020
The clothes made of it

341
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,000
will be invincible

342
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,890
and magic-proof.

343
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,450
This is a pearl made from mermaids' tears.

344
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,440
It's priceless.

345
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,180
This is the Yuehua Pill made by the Wuxian Clan,

346
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,320
who is best at healing in the Cangyan Sea.

347
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,720
The pill can detoxify poison within the three realms.

348
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,440
Wait.

349
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,760
Why are you showing me these?

350
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,410
You may leave.

351
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:27,810
Yes.

352
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:28,410
Yes.

353
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,650
This is the key to the Pavilion of Spiritual Treasures.

354
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,770
It can open all the treasure houses.

355
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,720
It is yours now.

356
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,600
Wooden Head,

357
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,090
don't think too much.

358
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,460
You don't have to give me these.

359
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,440
You won't die.

360
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,860
I've asked Shangque.

361
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,940
The Bone Devouring Spike only causes pain.

362
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,920
Calm down.

363
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,010
I

364
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,890
have something to tell you.

365
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,410
Well,

366
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,250
I also have something to tell you.

367
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,770
I’ll go first.

368
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,520
No.

369
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,000
Mine is more important.

370
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,800
I’ll go first.

371
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,090
What I want to say is more important than yours.

372
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,130
I made this myself.

373
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,920
Dongfang Qingcang.

374
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,480
Let me ask you.

375
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,320
Will you marry me

376
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,960
and be my husband?

377
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:53,760
I promise

378
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,810
I will treat you well.

379
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,080
In this life,

380
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,730
I will only love you.

381
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,560
No matter what happens,

382
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,250
I will always be with you

383
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,640
and never leave you.

384
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,600
You don't want to?

385
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,050
Brother,

386
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,720
you can't marry her.

387
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,320
The wife of the Moon Supreme Lord,

388
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,280
or the Moon Queen of the Cangyan Sea,

389
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,520
cannot be a woman from Fairies.

390
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,450
Since I can't stop you,

391
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,840
what about Yannv, our first ancestor?

392
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,490
When she was betrayed by Fairies

393
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,690
and crossed the Memory Loss River,

394
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,800
she set a rule that

395
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,050
the Moon Tribe is forbidden to intermarry with Fairies.

396
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,210
Anyone who insists on getting married

397
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,290
should enter

398
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,040
the Fuju Cave.

399
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:53,880
Brother.

400
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,520
Fairies are sinister and cunning.

401
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,960
They can't be trusted.

402
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,410
The reason why the Moon Tribe can survive

403
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,830
and not be wiped out

404
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,100
is that we never

405
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,710
forget hatred.

406
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,000
Hatred is the origin of the Moon Tribe.

407
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,180
Are you going to forget your origin

408
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,400
for a woman from Fairies?

409
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,330
Fairy woman,

410
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,940
my brother is about to cause a disaster,

411
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,130
but you don't care at all.

412
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,260
I can tell

413
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,880
you're not sincere at all.

414
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,890
Let me tell you the truth.

415
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,690
Besides that,

416
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,250
you also made my brother fall in love

417
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,800
and neglect his duty.

418
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,650
And because of the Heart Curse, your lives are connected.

419
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,280
It's you!

420
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,930
You put him in danger.

421
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,080
No.

422
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,680
I will never allow it.

423
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,290
I’ll order

424
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,250
to abolish this rule.

425
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,730
My lord,

426
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,160
this rule was set by our first ancestor Yannv.

427
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,480
We can't abolish it.

428
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,050
Yes, my lord.

429
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,520
Thousands of Moon Tribe people have been abiding by the ancestral rules.

430
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,100
There has never been a precedent.

431
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,890
I'll be this precedent.

432
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,680
If anyone dares to mention this again,

433
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,120
I will kill him.

434
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,560
Brother.

435
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,490
My lord.

436
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,460
Why are you here?

437
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:36,690
Go back.

438
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,690
My lord.

439
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,370
I'm willing to enter the Fuju Cave.

440
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,280
Why?

441
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,000
Because

442
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,360
I want to be with you.

443
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,770
You can be with me

444
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,450
without entering the Fuju Cave.

445
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,410
You don't need to suffer for me at all.

446
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,930
I do it for you,

447
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,080
but not entirely for you.

448
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,200
Since ancient times

449
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,320
when Yannv and Chonghua broke up,

450
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,600
the wars between Fairies and the Moon Tribe have never stopped.

451
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,810
We have been fighting

452
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,160
against each other.

453
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,020
I can't tell

454
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,360
whose hatred is deeper

455
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,930
than the other.

456
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,200
If we allow the hatred to keep going

457
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,600
and no one wants to stop,

458
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,160
tragedies will happen again.

459
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,690
My lord,

460
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:20,920
today,

461
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,930
I'm willing to sacrifice myself even if I'm weak.

462
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,650
Let the wheels of hatred

463
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:25,960
roll over me.

464
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,890
My status is not high.

465
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,850
I'm just an ordinary fairy.

466
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,280
I know I have no right to say

467
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,360
I can bear the punishment for the whole Fairies

468
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,400
and eliminate the hatred.

469
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,160
But I hope you can see my sincerity.

470
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,450
I'm willing to enter the Fuju Cave.

471
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:40,770
The first reason is that

472
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:42,500
I don't want

473
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,820
the person I love

474
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,490
to be accused of

475
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,450
quarreling with his brother

476
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,650
and fail to face his people

477
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,610
because of me.

478
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,450
Second,

479
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,400
if I'm too weak

480
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,480
to bear heavy tasks

481
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,850
and the hatred and pain of the Moon Tribe

482
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,800
for millions of years,

483
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,560
how can I say

484
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,450
I deserve

485
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,020
to be the Moon Queen

486
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,650
who stands beside the the Moon Supreme?

487
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,490
No matter what you say,

488
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,450
I will never allow anyone to hurt you.

489
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,680
No more discussion.

490
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,050
Wooden Head, tell me.

491
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,130
Why not?

492
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:17,820
Say no more.

493
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,480
I won't allow you.

494
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,690
You can bear the pain of the Bone Devouring Spike for me.

495
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,610
Why can't I enter the Fuju Cave for you?

496
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,810
That's not the same.

497
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,090
Why?

498
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:25,850
You are the Moon Supreme.

499
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:26,780
I am a fairy.

500
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,760
We could never be together.

501
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,180
Since we made this choice,

502
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,580
we have to pay the price

503
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,300
and be tested.

504
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,060
I can bear

505
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,700
all the cost

506
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,370
by myself.

507
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,610
No way.

508
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,040
You saw it just now.

509
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,210
If that's the case,

510
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:40,080
how could those people

511
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,140
accept me sincerely

512
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,770
and think I deserve you?

513
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,980
Think about it.

514
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,130
Your position

515
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,040
and the prestige as the Moon Supreme

516
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,090
were not inherited from your father.

517
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,480
You earned them

518
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,260
with the sword in your hand

519
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,570
by yourself.

520
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,580
Otherwise,

521
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,910
why did the people of the Moon Tribe only obey you

522
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,160
but not your brother, Xunfeng?

523
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,210
Similarly,

524
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,640
the honor of being the Moon Queen

525
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,010
can only be earned by myself.

526
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,490
You know I'm right.

527
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,400
Even so,

528
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,760
you've suffered a lot because of me.

529
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,600
You can't even return to you home.

530
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,970
How can I let you suffer again?

531
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,360
I'm not afraid.

532
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,420
Do you know what

533
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,810
the Fuju Cave is like?

534
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,260
You may suffer the torture unparalleled in the world.

535
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,090
No one knows it better than me.

536
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,930
When my father pulled out my seven emotions,

537
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,490
the Fuju Cave

538
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,240
is way more horrible than the Bone Devouring Spike.

539
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,260
Since ancient times,

540
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:00,900
I am the only person

541
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,210
who has come out of the cave alive.

542
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,210
I know.

543
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,850
You survived back then,

544
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,000
so I can too.

545
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,409
Don’t underestimate me.

546
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:14,600
I won’t allow it.

547
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,400
Do you remember

548
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,120
you asked me

549
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,280
why I don't want so many treasures

550
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,760
and what I really want?

551
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,199
Now I can answer you.

552
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:42,690
What I want is

553
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,480
your respect for my choice.

554
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:48,440
In the past,

555
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,110
you were the superior Moon Supreme Lord.

556
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,650
You made all the decisions yourself.

557
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:56,679
To kill me,

558
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,850
love me,

559
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,290
keep me,

560
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,210
or push me away,

561
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,800
you did whatever you want.

562
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,720
You never asked me about my thoughts.

563
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,440
But now we're going to be husband and wife.

564
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,850
We should change now.

565
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,720
There is no hierarchy

566
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,400
between a couple.

567
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,000
We should share weal and woe,

568
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,480
and be together even if we die.

569
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,850
No matter what happens,

570
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,130
we have to face it together.

571
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,250
But as for my own responsibility,

572
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,730
I should take it on my own

573
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,720
and make my own decision.

574
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,090
Can you respect me?

575
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,050
You came to me secretly.

576
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,440
What are you trying to do?

577
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,650
Xunfeng.

578
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,450
I know

579
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,360
you care about your brother as much as I do.

580
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,570
Since you know the Heart Curse,

581
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,920
and asked me to enter the Fuju Cave,

582
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,820
you must have a way to

583
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,880
prevent him from suffering with me,

584
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,720
right?

585
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,440
This is Dream of the Nine Mysteries,

586
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,810
an elixir passed down by the Wuxian Clan.

587
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,580
It is made of nine herbs

588
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,600
that have grown for tens of thousands of years.

589
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,920
If Brother take this medicine,

590
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,650
within three or five days,

591
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,050
no matter how painful,

592
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,730
he can't feel it.

593
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,800
Great.

594
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,290
But

595
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,120
I don't think he will drink it.

596
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,410
I can let him drink it.

597
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,250
If you drink it secretly...

598
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,490
if I do this,

599
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,610
I will be exposed.

600
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,680
By then,

601
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,080
you can come and see me get punished.

602
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,270
Wait.

603
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,000
I let you enter the Fuju Cave

604
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,520
just to make you give up.

605
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,880
If you don't want to

606
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,440
be his wife,

607
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,810
you won't have to suffer this.

608
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,170
Don't go there.

609
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,160
I was just trying to scare you.

610
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,080
I just wanted you to give up.

611
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,330
If you really enter the Fuju Cave,

612
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,170
my brother will never forgive me.

613
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,370
Xunfeng.

614
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,480
You love your brother, don't you?

615
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,640
Me too.

616
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,800
We have to take some responsibilities

617
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,090
and pay the price for love.

618
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,120
You take your own responsibility.

619
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,560
I will take mine.

620
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,170
You may stop here.

621
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,570
The wine...

622
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,490
Just drink it.

623
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,050
This should be the third time

624
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,600
you poisoned my wine.

625
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,800
You remember it clearly.

626
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,970
Do you remember

627
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,080
what you said?

628
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,810
You said

629
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,490
as long as it's the wine I give you,

630
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,090
no matter what's inside,

631
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,360
you will drink it.

632
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,600
This is not a promise.

633
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,440
But since you said it,

634
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,960
it's a promise.

635
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,480
I'm leaving.

636
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:34,560
