4
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:58,880
Tai Sui.

5
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,270
I know you're here.

6
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,750
Come out.

7
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,700
Dongfang Qingcang.

8
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,300
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

9
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,270
I told you long ago

10
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,940
you'd lose her forever.

11
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,310
Give me your immortal body and spirit.

12
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,420
Only I can help you get what you want.

13
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,280
I've been waiting for you for a long time too.

14
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,040
Good.

15
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,770
Then give me your immortal body.

16
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,579
You want it?

17
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,420
Take it.

18
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,390
You! What are you doing?

19
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,680
What are you doing?

20
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,740
This is the sea of your heart.

21
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,420
This is

22
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,570
where you and I will be buried.

23
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,460
Do you think

24
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,390
you can trap me here with your power?

25
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,730
I myself

26
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,960
may not be enough.

27
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,480
But

28
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,130
with the power she planted in my heart,

29
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,980
it'll be enough.

30
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,540
This…

31
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:53,850
This…

32
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:55,860
This is…

33
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,170
This is…

34
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,950
This is the power of the Goddess.

35
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,110
You can't get away from it.

36
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,430
Because she has left traces

37
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,160
all over the sea of my heart.

38
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,970
How dare you lie to me?

39
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,030
I only played a small trick

40
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,500
and you swallowed the bait.

41
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:24,970
Tai Sui.

42
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,320
Your delusions of grandeur

43
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,880
have fooled yourself after all.

44
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,170
Dongfang Qingcang.

45
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,430
I don't believe you!

46
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,950
I don't believe you have no delusions at all.

47
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,760
Dongfang Qingcang.

48
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,570
Are you crazy?

49
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,310
We could have lived the same life as heaven and earth

50
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,880
and become the heartless lord of the three realms.

51
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,610
But now you want to burn your spirit

52
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,340
for Xi Yun

53
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,770
and die with me?

54
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,130
Was it worth it?

55
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,540
The immortals will gloat at

56
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,530
our death.

57
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,140
You are the supreme being of the three realms.

58
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,250
Are you willing to

59
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,190
sacrifice yourself to save a bunch of nobodies?

60
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,000
Why would I not

61
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,100
die for her?

62
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,450
What about the wishes of your father and brother?

63
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,380
What about the revival of the Moon Tribe?

64
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,330
Are you going to give up all these?

65
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,470
They already have their own destinations.

66
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,000
Can you even give up Xi Yun?

67
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,900
Don't forget,

68
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,210
if we die,

69
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,670
Changheng will get Xi Yun

70
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,040
and they can be together forever and ever.

71
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,720
Dongfang Qingcang.

72
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,960
You can't fool me,

73
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,980
because I am you.

74
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,010
I know how much you hate

75
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,850
and how grudging you are in your heart.

76
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,260
If you didn't have delusions,

77
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,720
I wouldn't be here.

78
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,159
Our death

79
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,679
can bring her eternal peace.

80
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,990
I have no regrets.

81
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,950
Lord Changheng

82
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,260
guards Yujing and protects the living.

83
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,940
Goddess Xi Yun

84
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,170
cultivates all creatures with grace.

85
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,770
The two of them are a match made in heaven

86
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,200
who are bound for a marriage that lasts forever.

87
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,600
Heaven and Earth are the witnesses

88
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,360
of their vows.

89
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,870
All the gods felicitate them upon

90
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,510
the completed ceremony.

91
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,080
No, no.

92
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,860
You must still have a weakness.

93
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,560
You must still have a weakness.

94
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,910
It is a delusion to change the fate.

95
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,000
Dongfang Qingcang.

96
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,810
Do you really understand?

97
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:46,940
Do you really know

98
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,830
what price you have to pay?

99
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,950
I am an ancient evil god who is immortal and indestructible.

100
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,640
If you want to completely destroy me,

101
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,950
it's not enough to burn my primordial spirit.

102
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,790
I'm afraid of nothing.

103
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,060
Is that so?

104
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,630
Then your existence will be completely erased by the heaven's rules,

105
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,890
just like

106
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,910
you've never existed in the three realms.

107
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,530
Tai Sui.

108
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,760
These are

109
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,640
your fears,

110
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,490
not mine.

111
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,430
I have let go of everything.

112
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,240
There is nothing in this world

113
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,260
that can shake me.

114
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,200
But Xi Yun wouldn't remember

115
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,010
all that you've given to her.

116
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,970
All the happiness

117
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,770
and pain you have experienced.

118
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,760
Even the fight against fate.

119
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,910
However strong the love is,

120
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,680
she will forget it.

121
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,830
She will truly forget you forever.

122
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,390
Aren't you afraid of

123
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,290
all this?

124
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,570
I see.

125
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,630
So what?

126
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,680
Dongfang Qingcang.

127
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,620
This moment of your wavering

128
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,680
it'll be enough.

129
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,430
Tai Sui has regained the immortal body.

130
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,700
He is in Spirit-Shattering Abyss.

131
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,900
Why would this happen?

132
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,580
Yeah, what's going on?

133
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,840
Dongfang Qingcang.

134
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,850
He is not Dongfang Qingcang.

135
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,740
He is Evil God Tai Sui.

136
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,800
No way.

137
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,810
He has a strong mind.

138
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,830
How could he possibly be controlled by Tai Sui?

139
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,340
That's impossible.

140
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,490
What Chidi said

141
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,880
is true.

142
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,900
When the ancient gods and Goddesses Wu Qi

143
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,500
joined forces to seal Tai Sui, the evil and killing,

144
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,400
violent and evil spirits in the ancient barbaric era

145
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,080
were also suppressed under Xishan.

146
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,930
If he lifts the seal

147
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,820
and releases them all,

148
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,560
the people of the three realms

149
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,330
will be flooded with calamities,

150
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,600
and back to the barbaric wilderness

151
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,400
All immortals,

152
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,640
let's work together to suppress it.

153
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,720
Let me go.

154
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,120
Orchid.

155
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,130
Come back.

156
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,380
Orchid, come back!

157
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,110
The Evil God Tai Sui has taken over Dongfang Qingcang's immortal body

158
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,520
and is soon going to restore the power.

159
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,340
Orchid has just transformed into a human.

160
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,570
She hasn't fully recovered the power of the Goddess.

161
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,740
There is no chance of victory for her.

162
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,460
It's too dangerous.

163
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:44,850
Goddess.

164
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,770
Come back now!

165
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,520
Now that this has happened,

166
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,990
we can only try our best

167
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,330
to hold down the seal

168
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,680
and buy her time.

169
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,500
We Moon Tribe soldiers

170
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,470
come to help Shuiyuntian

171
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,030
to kill the Evil God Tai Sui

172
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,440
by the order of the Moon Supreme Dongfang Qingcang.

173
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,780
Your Highness Xunfeng.

Surely not.

178
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,340
This is not for the sake of someone.

Glazed Fire?

196
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,730
It is the fire of compassion that has been lost since ancient times.

197
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,290
The person needs to be tempered by emotions and sufferings

198
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,320
and still keep the original heart.

199

can harness it.

It's all in the past.

344
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,790
You treat me like a good friend.

345
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,780
I also consider you my buddy in life.

346
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:21,850
Your buddy in life?

347
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,540
Let me ask you.

348
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,050
Are Xiao Run and Qu Shui

349
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,270
buddies?

350
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,240
Of course they are.

351
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,560
Are Lord Changheng and the Moon Supreme Dongfang Qingcang

352
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,990
confidants?

353
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,790
Of course they are.

354
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,640
Since this kind of affection

355
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,830
can go beyond status,

356
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,130
and racial difference,

357
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,270
why can't it

358
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,190
break gender gap?

359
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,520
Fairy Danyin is right.

360
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,140
What about you?

361
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,450
You really

362
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,050
will no longer be the God of War?

363
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,620
Now that the three realms are at peace,

364
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,210
I just want to travel around the world

365
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,470
as a loose immortal.

366
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,330
The position of God of War is now vacant.

367
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:07,920
I'm expecting you to

368
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:08,969
come and get it.

369
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:11,909
Don't worry.

370
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:13,929
It won't take long.

371
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,550
For the most narrow-minded and jealous people,

372
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,440
love makes them grow

373
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,409
to be tolerant

374
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,710
and responsible.

375
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,600
I see.

376
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:25,860
Do it this way.

377
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,989
Thank you for your hard work.

378
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,540
Yes, my lord.

379
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,239
Your Highness Xunfeng has become more and more sophisticated.

380
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,710
You look quite like the previous Moon Supreme.

381
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,690
I've been holding the position

382
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,449
for my brother for 500 years.

383
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,679
I wonder

384
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,650
when he'll come back.

385
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,130
If he really can't come back,

386
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,520
you and I will have to

387
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,940
take on the responsibility

388
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,250
to protect all of this,

389
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,140
so that the Moon Tribe

390
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,940
can remain peaceful

391
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,870
and prosperous.

392
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,090
For the most deceitful person,

393
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,430
Love

394
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,610
makes her sincere and reliable.

395
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,250
Have you learnt the lesson?

396
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,600
I see.

397
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,620
I'll never lie again.

398
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,090
Be careful.

399
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:32,930
Good girl.

400
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,120
You're not orphans anymore.

401
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,050
From now on,

402
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,560
I'll take care of you.

403
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,360
So don't lie and cheat anymore.

404
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,720
You have to be a decent person from now on.

405
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,770
Got it?

406
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:46,580
Aunt Jieli.

407
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,760
Were you also an honest child when you were a child?

408
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,680
When I was a child…

409
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,280
I used to misbehave

410
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,330
and make mistakes too.

411
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,970
But now I'm all right.

412
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,400
I'm honest and upright.

413
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,530
And I don't lie.

414
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,250
Aunt Jieli is right.

415
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:04,930
You should

416
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,610
listen to her from now on.

417
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,540
Where did you go?

418
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,790
Bad Black Dragon.

419
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,880
Did you go drinking again?

420
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,620
I didn't.

421
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,090
You didn't?

422
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:25,760
You've been drinking.

423
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,350
You must have been drinking.

424
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,110
You must have been drinking.

425
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,650
-I didn't. -You must have been drinking.

426
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,700
You did.

427
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,380
You just don't admit it.

428
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,160
Bad Black Dragon.

429
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,320
For someone who makes a momentary mistake

430
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,120
and goes astray,

431
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,430
love can hold him

432
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,400
before he finally falls into the abyss

433
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,750
and make him come to his senses.

434
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,950
Look. It's a cloud whale.

435
00:36:58,990 --> 00:36:59,570
Love

436
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,430
can make a heartless person

437
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,450
understand compassion and love

438
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,660
♫ Fall in love with your clear eyes ♫

439
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,360
and even give up everything for the one he loves,

his life.

[Love Between Fairy and Devil]
