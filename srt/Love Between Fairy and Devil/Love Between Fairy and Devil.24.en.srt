[Episode 24]

4
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,780
You're so excited about getting married to Changheng

5
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,460
that you can't fall asleep?

6
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,100
Don't... don't forget that it's all fake.

7
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,740
Fake.

8
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:58,300
I don't care if it's fake or not.

9
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,900
I only marry the woman I like.

10
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,050
As for others,

11
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,730
I will not even look at them,

12
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,410
not to mention proposing a marriage.

13
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,940
Moon Supreme Lord.

14
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,460
Moon Supreme Lord.

15
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,100
Why didn't you even take a stand?

16
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,020
Moon Supreme Lord, wait.

17
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:31,860
Moon Supreme Lord.

18
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,100
Moon Supreme Lord.

19
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,060
At a time like this,

20
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,660
can't you take care of the overall situation?

21
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,610
What time is it?

22
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,340
Are you so eager to marry Xiao Yun?

23
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:40,860
Wait.

24
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,220
I should say Changheng.

25
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:42,620
I…

26
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,740
I'm trying to save both of their lives.

27
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,620
Besides,

28
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,690
don't you also want the plan to succeed?

29
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,660
My plan will not be built on a marriage.

30
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,579
I'm not as casual as you are.

31
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,460
Who are you calling casual?

32
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:58,900
My lord.

33
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,020
My lord.

34
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,300
Lady Wanqing is here.

35
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,780
She's outside right now.

36
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,700
Why is she here?

37
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,100
She said

38
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,420
she's come to propose

39
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,540
to My lord

40
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,650
Just in time.

41
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,580
That's right.

42
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,380
Just in time.

43
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,340
I'll go tell her

44
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,420
to give up the idea now.

45
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,370
No! No!

46
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,210
Moon Supreme Lord,

47
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,460
I'm begging you.

48
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,490
Wooden Head, stop there.

49
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,820
I'm telling you.

50
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,780
Go with me to see Lady Wanqing later.

51
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,380
And

52
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,700
don't say a word.

53
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,579
How dare you command…

54
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,220
Not even one of you can make me relieved.

55
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,890
Sir, I've come to meet you.

56
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,220
Ma'am, there is no need for that here.

57
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:19,779
Hurry up.

58
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:20,540
Please have a seat.

59
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,620
I'm sorry to bother you

60
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,180
uninvited.

61
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,060
I wonder if you

62
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,850
will blame me for being rash?

63
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,730
Of course not.

64
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,610
We are more than happy

65
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,540
that you're here.

66
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,290
But sir.

67
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,140
Why didn't you turn around and look at me?

68
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,820
And why didn't you say anything?

69
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,540
My brother is

70
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,140
easily shy.

71
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,020
Lady Wanqing.

72
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,740
Have some tea.

73
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,780
That's right.

74
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,580
You're a gentleman.

75
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,860
I've been straightforward

76
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,020
about the reason for my visit.

77
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,980
I wonder what you think.

78
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,220
Will you dislike me

79
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,100
for being a mere street woman?

80
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,500
If you have any reluctance in your heart,

81
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,900
you must tell me.

82
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,820
How could he dislike you?

83
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,700
Ma'am.

84
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,659
I should tell you.

85
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,659
Before you came,

86
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,100
my brother and I were also discussing

87
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,380
about proposing marriage to you.

88
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,380
I didn't expect you

89
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,700
to come first.

90
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,170
Really?

91
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,690
Of course it's true.

92
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,500
Brother, why are you staring at me?

93
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,060
Didn't you just say you wanted to

94
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,620
marry Lady Wanqing

95
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,180
as my sister-in-law

96
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,220
with big dowry and eight palanquins?

97
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,060
Now that she's here,

98
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,860
why are you so shy?

99
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:06,940
Lady Wanqing.

100
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,980
Look

101
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,780
how my brother

102
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,060
is blushing.

103
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,820
I just wanted to tell you my feelings.

104
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,940
Even if I hadn't won your love,

105
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,700
I'd have no regrets.

106
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,460
It turns out

107
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,610
it's not just that I'm in love,

108
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,620
you have the same feelings too.

109
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,580
The savings I've made over the past ten years

110
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,940
have all been used to pay for my life.

111
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,540
Although these three pieces of silk

112
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,860
are not worth big money,

113
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,980
they were weaved with my own hands

114
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,500
since I've met and missed you.

115
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,020
This would be my dowry.

116
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,980
It's as plain as snow.

117
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,780
Although I was a street girl,

118
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,930
I've never fallen.

119
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,290
I hope you'll accept it.

120
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,220
This is my birth date and horoscope.

121
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,890
Although there is no parental order or matchmaker's agreement,

122
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,380
the rituals must be followed.

123
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,700
Sir.

124
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,360
Brother, take it.

125
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,260
I'll take it.

126
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,690
The birthdate

127
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,659
should be mutually exchanged.

128
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,620
I took the liberty of coming today...

129
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,260
You haven't written it yet.

130
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,860
I'm sorry I didn't think it through.

131
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,620
Tomorrow night

132
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,180
I'll enjoy the moon in the lake.

133
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,220
If you finish it,

134
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,300
come and have a few drinks with me.

135
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,420
I asked you not to say anything.

136
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,980
You really didn't say a word.

137
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,420
You are quite cooperative.

138
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,660
Why are you staring at me again?

139
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,180
Who said so aggressively

140
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,780
he wanted Lady Wanqing to give up the idea?

141
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,580
How come you kept silent

142
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,730
while she was here?

143
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,700
Half-refusing, half-compromising.

144
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,130
And you accused me of wanting to get married.

145
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,700
I think you also want to marry her.

146
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,740
I've been searching for him all these days.

147
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,540
I never thought

148
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,220
the man of my dreams is your brother.

149
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,660
It's a great destiny.

150
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,460
Lady Orchid.

151
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,220
You look unhappy.

152
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,620
Do you have something on your mind?

153
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,220
No, nothing.

154
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,100
Of course I'm happy for you

155
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,780
seeing you and

156
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,290
your love are getting married.

157
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,420
It's just…

158
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,300
Just what?

159
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,740
Lady Wanqing.

160
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,540
Actually, I...

161
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,820
I have a friend

162
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,260
who

163
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,220
maybe,

164
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,340
probably

165
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,980
fall in love with

166
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,060
a man…

167
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,090
Love is love.

168
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,740
How can there be a maybe?

169
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,380
Okay.

170
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,700
Then it's the case.

171
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,300
She has a crush on someone.

172
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,260
But she can't be with him

173
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,820
because of their status.

174
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,140
What do you think she should do?

175
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,060
Why do you ask this question, Lady Orchid?

176
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,060
I'm a woman from the Royal Academy.

177
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,860
In terms of status,

178
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,380
I am already the humblest.

179
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,500
But I wouldn't give up the man I love

180
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,930
because of my status.

181
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,140
She doesn't have to worry about it, Lady Orchid.

182
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,860
But the status I'm talking about

183
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,460
is much more fatal than yours.

184
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,180
If

185
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,140
two families are deadly rivals,

186
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,420
neither could tolerate the other.

187
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,820
But a person of this family…

188
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,940
But a person of this family

189
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,820
falls in love with someone of the other family.

190
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,060
Now that a battle is around the corner,

191
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,420
they have to separate.

192
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,970
Then these two people

193
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,860
must be the biggest fools in the world.

194
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,100
Why?

195
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,420
If they give up their heart's desire

196
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,220
for something other than themselves,

197
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,140
what can they be but fools?

198
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,180
If it were an ordinary person, it would be fine.

199
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,460
But the one she likes

200
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,500
has a great mission on his shoulders

201
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,160
that he can't give up.

202
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,610
What should they do then?

203
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,380
Do you mean

204
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,140
yourself?

205
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,180
No, no.

206
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,740
Lady Wanqing.

207
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,220
Please answer me.

208
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,020
Can you?

209
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,300
My answer remains the same.

210
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,780
How many people in this world can meet their true love?

211
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,460
How many people

212
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,420
can never meet that person in their lifetime?

213
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,220
If they do,

214
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,060
they can't give up.

215
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,210
[River Villas]

216
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,340
My lord.

217
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,820
It's already midnight.

218
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,850
Aren't you going to rest?

219
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,140
She said “also”.

220
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,140
What does that mean?

221
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,740
When she left, she said

222
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,020
“And you accused me of wanting to get married.

223
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,700
I think you also want to marry her.”

224
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,460
Does the word “also” mean

225
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,170
she really wants to marry Changheng?

226
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,210
My lord, you haven't said a word at night.

227
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,780
This is what you've been thinking about?

228
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
Why don't you go ask Fairy Orchid?

229
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,980
I don't need to ask her.

230
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,300
What does it matter to me

231
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,780
if she wants to marry or not?

232
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,460
Even if I do ask her,

233
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,420
what else can I do?

234
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,700
Shangque.

235
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,340
I'm here.

236
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,060
In your opinion,

237
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,740
how am I

238
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,340
compared with Changheng?

239
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,300
How can Changheng be compared to My lord?

240
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,100
And My lord,

241
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,500
you've never asked such a question either.

242
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,770
I've never really thought

243
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,780
that I would worry about not being able to compete with others.

244
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,340
When Changheng

245
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,620
was the God of War,

246
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,380
he was no match to me

247
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,540
in terms of strength,

248
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,660
strategy,

249
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,820
and spirit.

250
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,020
Now that he's become a mortal,

251
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,620
he's even more stupid and dumb,

252
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,940
eating his head off.

253
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,610
Why does Orchid still want to marry him?

254
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,340
Do you think she's out of her mind?

255
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,540
That's not true.

256
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,180
She's not smart either.

257
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,770
She cares for Changheng

258
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,220
and protects him

259
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,020
from anyone's bullying.

260
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,340
Even if he is now

261
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,060
a mortal with no power at all,

262
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,940
she still…

263
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,690
Am I

264
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,140
that inferior to Changheng?

265
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,570
Who do you really like?

266
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,420
Moon Supreme Lord,

267
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,700
or Lord Changheng?

268
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,580
Why are you asking this

269
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,380
all of a sudden?

270
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,020
Tell me.

271
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,620
Can we not talk about this?

272
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,770
Haven't we had enough troubles lately?

273
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,780
Just tell me.

274
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,620
Are you…

275
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,980
really in love with

276
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,900
Moon Supreme Lord?

277
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,860
Do you want me to

278
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,380
send a message for you?

279
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,980
Don't talk nonsense.

280
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,860
Didn't I tell you already?

281
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,500
When I was still unformed,

282
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,060
I was in love with Lord Changheng.

283
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,940
What about now?

284
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,500
Now…

285
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,940
I don't like Dongfang Qingcang anyway.

286
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,180
I'm not the kind of person who constantly changes his mind.

287
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,170
What's wrong with a little change?

288
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,540
Mortals can only live for a few decades and change their mind.

289
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,980
We can both live 100,000 years.

290
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,420
If we stay the same

291
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,300
and always like the same person,

292
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,780
that would be boring.

293
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,260
What about you?

294
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,780
You were always pestering Shangque before.

295
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,100
Now all you talk about is Qu Shui.

296
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,180
Have you changed your mind

297
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,220
and been in love with Qu Shui now?

298
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,180
That's nonsense.

299
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,500
I don't like Qu Shui.

300
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,180
Then you must like Shangque.

301
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,260
They are both just

302
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,940
my companions for good time.

303
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,220
I don't like either of them.

304
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,020
Anyway, I should tell you.

305
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,690
Qu Shui

306
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,580
is only a man in this life.

307
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,850
After he succeeds in the reincarnation,

308
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,140
he will become Fairy Danyin.

309
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,180
He'll be a female.

310
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,340
I know, I know.

311
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:37,780
My lord.

312
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,660
Orchid has gone to sleep.

313
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,850
My lord, you've heard

314
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,740
everything she said just now?

315
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,660
Do you want me to

316
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,380
repeat it?

317
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,370
I'm not deaf.

318
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,900
My lord, you don't have to be so frustrated.

319
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,300
A girl

320
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,540
often says things she doesn't actually mean

321
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,340
when facing the person she likes.

322
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,100
What she says and what she thinks in her heart

323
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,540
may be completely opposite.

324
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,540
What do you mean?

325
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,860
I mean,

326
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,780
for example,

327
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,370
if she says she's not angry with you,

328
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,780
in fact, it means she is.

329
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,700
If she says it's nothing

330
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,580
and wants to be alone for a while,

331
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,540
then it means something is wrong

332
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,540
and she wants you to stay with her.

333
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,660
If she says she doesn't want a gift,

334
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,060
it means she does.

335
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,740
And

336
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,180
if she says she doesn't like you,

337
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,620
actually it means

338
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,940
she may do.

339
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
There is this kind of thing?

340
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,380
So how can I tell

341
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,580
which statement is true

342
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,700
and which is not?

343
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,210
Well…

344
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,860
A girl's mind

345
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,820
is the most difficult to guess.

346
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,420
Well…

347
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,410
I can't say.

348
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,970
This is so complicated

349
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,260
that even My lord is at a loss.

350
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,500
I see.

351
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,420
My lord, you and Orchid

352
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,859
are heart-connected, right?

353
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,500
It's just that

354
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,780
you're wearing the Jade Ring

355
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,500
and Orchid is wearing the Heart-Hidden Hairpin,

356
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,050
so you can't read her mind.

357
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,619
If you take off the Jade Ring

358
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:18,260
and then replace Orchid's Heart-Hidden Hairpin,

359
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,220
you'll know what she's thinking

360
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,980
without trying to guess.

361
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,340
Is what you said just now

362
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,620
a lie too?

363
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:54,940
What lie?

364
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,300
You said to Fairy Orchid

365
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,820
that you don't like me.

366
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,620
You mean this?

367
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,500
You said girls always say what they don't mean.

368
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,060
Maybe it's not true that

369
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,620
Fairy Orchid says she doesn't like My lord.

370
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,940
Then you said you don't like me.

371
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,660
Is it

372
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,610
also a lie?

373
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,260
No.

374
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,340
I'm not like other girls.

375
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,780
I mean it

376
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,780
when I say I don't like you.

377
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,260
Why?

378
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,940
You wouldn't understand if I told you.

379
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,900
I'm going to bed.

380
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,540
Wait, Jieli.

381
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,620
You used to tease me all the time,

382
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,700
calling me stupid.

383
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,380
And you wouldn't talk to me seriously.

384
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,780
Then why don't you tell me today?

385
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,420
If you don't tell me,

386
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,540
how do you know I don't understand?

387
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,060
Actually, you're not stupid.

388
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,380
You're just

389
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,860
too straightforward and clean-hearted.

390
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,540
You're not like me.

391
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,540
What's the difference?

392
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,580
I think my heart and your heart

393
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,500
are the same.

394
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,250
I don't have a heart at all.

395
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,340
My heart and soul

396
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,340
were taken to a pawnshop and sold for a living

397
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,220
when I was starving and freezing.

398
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,940
Who do I like or dislike?

399
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,780
To me,

400
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,900
feelings are just a passing flicker.

401
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,380
It's not worth believing in.

402
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,580
Then what do you believe in?

403
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,780
Money.

404
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,460
I only believe in money.

405
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,620
I just want to make money and be rich,

406
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,730
have my own big house,

407
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,220
big stores,

408
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,300
and big business,

409
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,380
have branches

410
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,930
across the whole three realms,

411
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,980
so that I can feel safe.

412
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,340
As for the rest,

413
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,130
I don't want to think about it.

414
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,380
I won't like anyone

415
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,980
in my life at all.

416
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,780
Do you understand?

417
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,860
I don't.

418
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,770
I knew you wouldn't understand.

419
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,700
Stupid Black Dragon.

420
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,300
Don't think about it.

421
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,260
Go to bed early.

422
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,820
Dongfang.

423
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,700
Dongfang.

424
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,340
Dongfang.

425
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,500
Dongfang.

426
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,260
Why are you here so early in the morning?

427
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,500
It's a beautiful day,

428
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,420
a good time to go for a walk.

429
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,100
I'm going to

430
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,420
take Lady Orchid out for a walk

431
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,260
and spend some time with her.

432
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,620
I've already agreed your marriage.

433
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,260
Why do you still have to spend time together?

434
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,020
Dongfang, you're wrong on this.

435
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,780
You see?

436
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,300
Although it's said that elder brothers are like fathers,

437
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,340
the important matter of marriage

438
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,770
needs to be approved by Lady Orchid herself.

439
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,650
She knows very little about me.

440
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,260
I should at least

441
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,460
let her get to know me first.

442
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,580
Absolutely…

443
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,340
Lady Orchid.

444
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,420
Ma'am, there are sugar cakes over there.

445
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,980
Ma'am, do you want a sugar cake?

446
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,820
It's hot!

447
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,660
Why is it so hot?

448
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,020
You can't grab it with your hands anymore.

449
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,820
Figure out a way.

450
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,500
You're really stupid.

451
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,020
Forget it.

452
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,860
I'm not hungry.

453
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,620

You're the biggest idiot in the Three Realms.

683
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,100
Fairy Danyin

684
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,650
let the sinful immortal escape from Haotian Tower,

685
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,020
committing a serious crime.

686
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,100
According to the Immortal Law,

687
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,980
you shall be stripped of your immortal bone and sent down to Shenshui Hall,

688
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,220
staying in mortal world forever.

689
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:44,420
Your Highness.

690
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,620
Danyin is young and reckless.

691
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,100
It's all because I didn't teach her well.

692
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,340
I wish to suffer on behalf of my daughter.

693
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,140
I hope that Your Highness…

694
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,180
Danyin.

695
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,340
Would you like to take the blame and make a success of it?

696
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,820
At Your Highness's command.

697
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,900
Go back to Yunmengze.

698
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,940
Kill the first God of War's reincarnated body.

699
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,540
Destroy his spirit

700
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,740
and stop Dongfang Qingcang

701
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,140
from unlocking the100,000 moon tribe soldiers.

702
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,540
No way.

703
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,090
Nonsense!

704
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,130
Don't be rude!

705
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,180
Please think twice, Your Highness.

706
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,220
Lord Changheng

707
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,380
is closely related to the fate of the First God of War.

708
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,500
If you kill the First God of War,

709
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,700
if

710
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,580
Lord Changheng thus

711
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,100
also fails in his reincarnation,

712
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,370
he will be destroyed and scattered.

713
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,820
Changheng dared to escape from Haotian Tower

714
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,180
and go to Shenshui Hall to go through the reincarnation

715
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,660
to save the moon tribe spy,

716
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,860
repeatedly breaking the rules of heaven,

717
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,460
ignorant of the Heaven's Rules.

718
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,100
Even if he comes back alive,

719
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,140
he'll still be a sinner of Shuiyuntian.

720
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,460
30,000 years ago,

721
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,620
the first God of War also sealed 100,000 moon tribe soldiers with his life

722
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,660
for the peace in Shuiyuntian.

723
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,660
Since Changheng is the God of War,

724
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,500
he should take the responsibility.

725
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,820
Your Highness, please

726
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,940
take back the order

727
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,460
and spare Lord Changheng's life.

728
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:18,700
I would rather

729
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,780
have my own immortal bone removed.

730
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,060
Your Highness is merciful.

731
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,060
Danyin

732
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,460
will not fail to fulfill her mission.

733
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,520
Now go.

734
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:55,890
