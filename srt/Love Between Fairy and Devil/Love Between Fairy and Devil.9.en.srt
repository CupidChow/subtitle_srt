[Episode 9]

4
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,780
Why do I feel so bad?

5
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,020
I knew we would be apart.

6
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,930
I shouldn't have let him stay in the first place.

7
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,539
I shouldn't have promised him

8
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,580
to stay in Arbiter Hall for so long.

9
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,860
Forget it.

10
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,380
It's better to leave.

11
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,700
He'll be safe.

12
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,070
I'm so sleepy.

13
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,530
My Lord,

14
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,050
she has recovered.

15
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,100
So the reason she can't totally recover is

16
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,900
because she's worried about my safety?

17
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,450
Shangque.

18
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,820
Tell me.

19
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,340
If she'd known I was Dongfang Qingcang

20
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,820
from the beginning,

21
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,340
would she have changed her mind about the Moon Tribe

22
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,300
and risked her life to save me?

23
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,220
Well...

24
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,579
Forget it.

25
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,340
I don't even know that myself.

26
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,300
Why should I ask you?

27
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,860
My Lord.

28
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,970
Why don't we

29
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,579
let her fix the Destiny Book now?

30
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,780
Let her sleep first.

31
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,740
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

32
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,740
Yes.

33
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,620
Little flower spirit.

34
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,860
This Bone Orchid is transformed from my heart blood.

35
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,380
To repay you,

36
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,340
I'll give it to you.

37
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,060
When you're in danger,

38
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,860
it can protect you.

39
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,380
From now on,

40
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,820
no one can hurt you

41
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,380
even if I'm not by your side.

42
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,500
My Lord, Changheng is here.

43
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,860
Changheng?

44
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,260
Why did he come to Haishi City?

45
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,900
I don't know why.

46
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,060
However,

47
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,300
the news of evil spirit

48
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,650
in Haishi City

49
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,900
has spread in three realms.

50
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,450
I'm afraid he's here

51
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,860
because he got the news.

52
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,620
Lord, what should we do?

53
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,460
Since he's here,

54
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,100
we should meet him.

55
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,530
Yes.

56
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,780
The God of War in Shuiyuntian

57
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,090
came to Haishi City

58
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,220
to buy something

59
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,140
or sell something?

60
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,140
I came here

61
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,900
to ask you something.

62
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,690
Lord of Haishi City,

63
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,420
do you recognize this?

64
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,740
Evil spirit?

65
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,980
Yes.

66
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,140
Not long ago, it hurt a fairy in Shuiyuntian.

67
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,900
As far as I know,

68
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,740
the evil spirit is related to Haishi City.

69
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,260
People in Haishi City only talk about business

70
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,220
and never make enemies.

71
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,580
It seems that

72
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,620
you're suspecting Haishi City.

73
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,540
The evil spirit first appeared in Haishi City.

74
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,850
Then Liufang Pavilion was in chaos

75
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,620
and suffered casualties.

76
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,860
Why is that?

77
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,140
Do you know

78
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,260
that information in Haishi City

79
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,409
costs money?

80
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,740
However,

81
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,940
I can make an exception for Lord Changheng.

82
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,220
Why?

83
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,940
The sudden appearance of evil spirit

84
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,180
caused the chaos in Haishi City

85
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,100
all because of a mysterious man

86
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,380
who trespassed in Haishi City.

87
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,659
A mysterious man?

88
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,540
That mysterious man has unfathomable power.

89
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,220
He not only brought the evil spirit to Haishi City,

90
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,660
but also destroyed the foundation of Haishi City.

91
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,780
Recently, Haishi City has been chaotic.

92
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,460
You mean

93
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,100
this evil spirit was produced by that mysterious man?

94
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,820
Dieyi.

95
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,300
Hellfire?

96
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:34,980
That's right.

97
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,860
Among the three realms,

98
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,490
except Dongfang Qingcang, the Moon Supreme,

99
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,540
who was sealed 30000 years ago,

100
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,650
no one can manipulate Hellfire.

101
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,700
Sorry for my offense today.

102
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,340
I'll apologize another day.

103
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,780
Goodbye.

104
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,180
By the way,

105
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,100
when the mysterious man left Haishi City,

106
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,820
he took a Shuiyuntian fairy with him.

107
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,580
Who?

108
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,380
It is said to be

109
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,490
a nameless orchid plant spirit.

110
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,620
Thank you.

111
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,220
My Lord,

112
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,610
why did you tell Changheng

113
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,450
about Dongfang Qingqing?

114
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,020
Dongfang Qingqing has incredible power.

115
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,860
If he stays by the fairy's side,

116
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,179
we can't do anything.

117
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,179
But if we join hands with Changheng,

118
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,820
we might be able to defeat him.

119
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,140
I drank too much last night.

120
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,940
Oh no.

121
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,900
I'm going to be late for the ceremony.

122
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,460
My Lord,

123
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,380
shouldn't we stop her

124
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,780
and let her fix the Destiny Book?

125
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,380
Today is the ceremony of assigning posts.

126
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,930
Today is also the day she becomes a fairy.

127
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,060
But...

128
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,980
what does this have to do with fixing the Destiny Book?

129
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,700
She has been waiting a thousand years for this day.

130
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,540
I don’t want to disappoint her.

131
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,060
My Lord,

132
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,620
someone is here.

133
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,300
It’s Changheng.

134
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,560
I didn't planed to kill him,

135
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,140
but he's courting death.

136
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,940
Dongfang Qingcang.

137
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,580
It's really you.

138
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,860
Let’s begin.

139
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,340
There are many fairies in Shuiyuntian.

140
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,860
After the war between two tribes,

141
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,020
according to fairies' real bodies

142
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,820
Lord Dong divided them into eight immortal system

143
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,340
(Heaven, Earth, Thunder, Water, Fire, Wind, Lake, Mountain).

144
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,900
You have passed the immortal examination.

145
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,380
Today, the Great Turtle will check

146
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,180
your real bodies

147
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,540
and assign posts to you.

148
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,460
Yes.

149
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,380
Fairy Yuanwu.

150
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,060
Thunder, Fengbo Hall.

151
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,180
Fairy Orchid.

152
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,660
It turned out to be an old friend.

153
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,370
An old friend?

154
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,340
Xuanwu, my ancient god,

155
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,540
do you know me?

156
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,620
Yes.

157
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,940
I read that

158
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,460
you know all living creatures in this world.

159
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,340
You are special.

160
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,890
Me? Why?

161
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,660
Joy and sorrow, parting and reunion.

162
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,460
All living beings in the world

163
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,540
have thousands of fates.

164
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,770
But you only have one fate.

165
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,220
God, I don't understand what you mean.

166
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,700
When you understand,

167
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,570
you'll begin to bear your destiny.

168
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,060
What destiny?

169
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,900
My old friend,

170
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,980
take care.

171
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,420
It's been so long.

172
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,020
What's going on?

173
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,340
What's taking so long?

174
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,940
Is everything okay?

175
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,050
The result is overdue.

176
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,260
Why is there nothing?

177
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,540
She isn't a plant spirit?

178
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,100
Yes.

179
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,420
I don't know.

180
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,380
So she should be in Lake or Mountain.

181
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,810
Why can't she be identified?

182
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,700
This has never happened before.

183
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,420
Aunt Sansheng,

184
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,740
is there any problem?

185
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,420
Fairy Yuanwu.

186
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,380
One more time, please!

187
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,140
There it is.

188
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,460
What's wrong with Orchid?

189
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,730
Fairy Orchid.

190
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,660
Try it again.

191
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,060
What happened?

192
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,980
What happened?

193
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,010
What is that?

194
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,100
She is not a fairy?

195
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,340
What happened?

196
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,660
Sansheng,

197
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,380
check her real body.

198
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:58,980
Yes.

199
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,700
What is this?

200
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,660
I've never seen it before.

201
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,530
What is this?

202
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,820
What is this?

203
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,460
Strange. I've never seen it before.

204
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,460
So what is this?

205
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,420
I'm an orchid plant.

206
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,930
How is that possible?

207
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,220
Your real body is not an orchid plant.

208
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,500
And you're not in the eight immortal system of Shuiyuntian.

209
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,260
Orchid isn't a fairy?

210
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,260
If you're neither an immortal nor a human,

211
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,140
you're from the Moon Tribe.

212
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,220
-The Moon Tribe -The Moon Tribe

213
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,380
The Moon Tribe.

214
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,420
How could I be from the Moon Tribe?

215
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,340
Master told me

216
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,420
I was an orchid seed

217
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,900
she brought from Yunmeng Lake.

218
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,100
And she planted me in Arbiter Hall.

219
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,140
Aunt Sansheng,

220
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,820
you saw me transform.

221
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,780
I'm not from the Moon Tribe.

222
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,940
That orchid seed must be your disguise.

223
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,140
Guards!

224
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,569
I'm not from the Moon Tribe.

225
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:13,900
I'm an orchid plant.

226
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,020
There must be a mistake.

227
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,339
Well...

228
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,329
This is...

229
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,020
That's...

230
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
Hellfire!

231
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,260
Dongfang Qingcang, where are you escaping?

232
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,780
Escape?

233
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,820
I just don't want to destroy

234
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,020
her Arbiter Hall.

235
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,060
Hellfire?

236
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,780
It's indeed Dongfang Qingcang's Hellfire.

237
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,380
I don't know what happened.

238
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,660
Tell me, where is Dongfang Qingcang?

239
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,660
Where is Dongfang Qingcang?

240
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,540
I don't know.

241
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:36,980
Do you want to die?

242
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,650
I know what you want to ask.

243
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,900
But the most important thing now is to catch Dongfang Qingcang.

244
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,700
Go tell Lord Yunzhong.

245
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,980
Where is Dongfang Qingcang?

246
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,340
Orchid.

247
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,460
Tell us.

248
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,210
If you don't tell us, you'll die.

249
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,740
Her real body is unknown.

250
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,370
I think she's a spy from the Moon Tribe.

251
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,140
I'm not from the Moon Tribe.

252
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,260
I'm not a spy.

253
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,980
I don't know.

254
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:25,260
Why would Dongfang Qingcang's Hellfire protect you?

255
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,840
I really don’t know.

256
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,770
How dare you

257
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,030
hurt my girl?

258
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,190
Dongfang Qingcang.

259
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,190
You are Dongfang Qingcang?

260
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,260
You lied to me.

261
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,170
I never lied to you.

262
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,780
Why did you save me?

263
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,620
I told you

264
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,100
your life is mine.

265
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,620
With me,

266
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,340
no one can hurt you.

267
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:48,900
No!

268
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,700
If anyone dares to stop me,

269
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,300
I will destroy Shuiyuntian

270
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,700
and kill everyone.

271
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,860
I'll avenge

272
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,380
the shame of

273
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,700
the seal for 30000 years and

274
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,740
the oppression of Cangyan Sea.

275
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,620
Put her down.

276
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,340
How dare you

277
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,700
stop me?

278
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,780
Get out of my way.

279
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,260
I won't let you take her away.

280
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,660
I don't want to kill you today.

281
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,020
Step aside.

282
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,660

My Lord,

330
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,580
she was poisoned

331
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,300
by Lord Yunzhong's Xuanshuang Whip.

332

And the clod Memory Loss River

00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,260
You want to take me to the Cangyan Sea?

347
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:22,930
The Moon Supreme.

348
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:23,790
I'm sorry.

349
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,750
I was wrong.

350
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,440
I shouldn't have listened to rumors and made fun of you.

351
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,620
I even asked you to do chores.

352
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,680
I also said

353
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,110
you paid no attention to hygiene.

354
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,210
I'm sorry.

355
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,850
I even said you're a homeless dog.

356
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,840
The Moon Supreme,

357
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,360
if there's nothing else to do,

358
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,000
I'll take my leave.

359
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,600
You don't have to see me off.

360
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,540
I can go back to Shuiyuntian myself.

361
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,180
Back to Shuiyuntian?

362
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,390
You are a traitor now.

363
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,960
Do you want them to kill you?

364
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,390
I'm not a traitor.

365
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,420
I'm not a traitor.

366
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:18,960
I will

367
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,470
explain to them.

368
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,980
I'm not a traitor.

369
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,080
Shuiyuntian is my home.

370
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,910
I want to go home.

371
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,790
I want to go home.

372
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,890
Shuiyuntian is my home.

373
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:05,160
I want to go home.

374
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,790
That's over.

375
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,960
I'm not a traitor.

376
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,790
My Lord.

377
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,640
Highness Xunfeng

378
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,780
is fighting with Kings of Southern and Northern Youxian County

379
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,250
in Wind Plain.

380
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,590
Now they have conquered the Silver Lake

381
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,510
and is heading towards the Ninth Youxian County.

382
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,950
How long can Xunfeng last?

383
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,290
I'm afraid

384
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,180
he won't survive tonight.

385
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,170
Kings of Southern and Northern Youxian County have always been ambitious

386
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,270
and covets the position of the Moon Supreme.

387
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,320
They didn't dare to do anything

388
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,880
because they were afraid of your power.

389
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,650
But since you were told dead,

390
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,590
Highness Xunfeng became the new Moon Supreme.

391
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,560
Kings of Southern and Northern Youxian County

392
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,450
kept starting civil war

393
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,920
to replace him.

394
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,090
If we go back late,

395
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,650
Highness Xunfeng may be...

396
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:27,860
Go to Wind Plain.

397
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:28,570
Yes.

398
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:07,800
Keep your eyes open

399
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,280
and have a look.

400
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,750
I'm not that kind of guy

401
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,810
who can be beaten up

402
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,910
or killed

403
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,510
by you immortals.

404
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:45,150
