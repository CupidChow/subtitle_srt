[Episode 21]

4
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,880
The music is what I've been waiting for.

5
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,400
What music?

6
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,000
Why can't I hear it?

7
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,530
The music...

8
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,760
I've never heard

9
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,810
the music before,

10
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,170
but it seems that I've heard it

11
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,320
a million times.

12
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,360
Well...

13
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,320
Do you know

14
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,450
the player?

15
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,730
No.

16
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,760
I don't know who the player is.

17
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,090
It's bustling outside.

18
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,680
Although I'm not going,

19
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,000
you don't need to stay here.

20
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,410
Go and have fun.

21
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,690
Thank you, my lady.

22
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,880
I'll be right back.

23
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,290
Jieli.

24
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,320
What's wrong?

25
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,210
Where is Orchid?

26
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,490
She's missing.

27
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,329
Look for her!

28
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,920
Yes.

29
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,690
Forget it.

30
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,570
It's too troublesome.

31
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,690
I'll move away all the people on the street.

32
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,130
No.

33
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,670
My lord.

34
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,970
My lord.

35
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,840
We've agreed that

36
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,320
we don't use magic in Lu City.

37
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,360
My lord, calm down.

38
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,130
It may disturb the fate of the Chidi women.

39
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:50,840
You can't do that.

40
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,450
My lord,

41
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,600
although Orchid's magical power is weak,

42
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,850
it's more than enough

43
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,890
for her to deal with the mortals in Yunmeng Lake.

44
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,810
I'll go and look for her now.

45
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,960
If she is in any danger,

46
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,320
I will throw you both into the Memory Loss River.

47
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,130
Yes.

48
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,160
Let's go.

49
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,890
She was heartbroken and about to end her life.

50
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,810
She met her Mr. Right who understood her so well.

51
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,160
If my guess is right,

52
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,730
the place where the first God of War will experience the hardships tonight

53
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,040
is Life Ending Pavilion.

54
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,280
She met Lord Changheng and

55
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,530
fell in love at first sight.

56
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,640
I have to keep watch.

57
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,320
I can't let Wooden Head disturb them.

58
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,400
Xie Wanqing.

59
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,360
That's Life Ending Pavilion.

60
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,210
It’s time.

61
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,680
My lord.

62
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,240
Dongfang Qingcang appeared in Lu City.

63
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,290
I'm afraid

64
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,200
he will disturb the first God of War's hardship experience.

65
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,810
What Dongfang Qingcang aims to do

66
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,640
is to take my master's primordial spirit

67
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,400
and unlock 100,000 soldiers of the Moon Tribe.

68
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,250
So before the hardship is completed,

69
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,480
or before the wedding night on the Flora Day,

70
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,650
he won't take any action.

71
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,250
Over 30,000 years,

72
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,200
I've been guarding her

73
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,690
to avoid any problem during her hardships.

74
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,970
I finally found the Goddess of Xishan.

75
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,140
This is the last life of my master.

76
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,800
So,

77
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,080
you must be careful

78
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,400
and make sure everything goes well.

79
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,970
After this life,

80
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,130
my master can go back with me.

81
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,120
Yes, my lord.

82
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,770
I have no regret.

83
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,290
Hearing the flute on the night the Lantern Festival.

84
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,210
She met her Mr. Right who understood her so well.

85
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,560
She plans to end her life on the night of the Lantern Festival.

86
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,650
Her Mr. Right will stop her.

87
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,690
But why hasn't

88
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,520
the Mr. Right shown up yet?

89
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,490
Stop!

90
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,370
Stop!

91
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,240
Stop!

92
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,760
Stop!

93
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,560
Get out of the way!

94
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,530
Over there!

95
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,040
Stop!

96
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,520
Don't run!

97
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,480
Stop! Stop!

98
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,159
-Don't run. -Here. Here

99
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:41,880
Move!

100
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:44,930
Don't run!

101
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,680
Stop!

[Life Ending Pavilion]

103
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,030
Where are you going?

104
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:16,960
Wait. Wait.

105
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,650
We are on familiar terms with each other.

106
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,080
Why do you have to do this?

107
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,000
Give me the jade.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,680
Hand it over!

109
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,850
No, no.

110
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,370
I was born with this jade.

111
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,300
I can't give it to you.

112
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,980
How about this?

113
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,280
When my father calms down,

114
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,170
I'll

115
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,640
pay you double.

116
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,430
OK?

117
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,370
I don't care who you are.

118
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,500
How dare you play tricks in our casino?

119
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,210
No. I can't give you.

120
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,140
You have to

121
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,270
suffer a lot.

122
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,700
I can't give it to you.

123
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,580
Mr. Xiao,

124
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,670
-you are so rich. -I have to give it to my destined lover!

125
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,820
You don't have to suffer this for a jade.

126
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,820
Give it to me.

127
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,060
How dare you bite me?

128
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,770
Beat him!

129
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,320
Beat him!

130
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,620
Stop!

131
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,550
It's perfectly justified

132
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,730
to pay the debt.

133
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,990
Where did this wild girl come from?

134
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,500
You'd better mind your own business.

135
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,250
Leave!

136
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,720
Let him go.

137
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,230
Otherwise,

138
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,820
don't blame me for being rude to you.

139
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,430
She's a heroine.

140
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,310
What?

141
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,360
Do you want to show off your bravery?

142
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,380
Attack!

143
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,010
Go!

144
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,309
Stop!

145
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,980
Within the three realms,

146
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,660
you, as a woman,

147
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,590
are not able to kill me.

148
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,640
Is it you?

149
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,090
We...

150
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,120
Have we met before?

151
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,220
Never.

152
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,440
The music...

153
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,220
Was the music just now

154
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,160
from you?

155
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,170
What music?

156
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,580
It's you.

157
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,610
It must be you.

158
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,840
Why did I feel hate,

159
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,950
respect,

160
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,760
and concern

161
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,250
at the same time

162
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,790
when I saw you?

163
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,300
It's like I've been entangled with you for ages.

164
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,320
I think I was waiting for you.

165
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,380
You're drunk.

166
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,570
I'm drunk.

167
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,870
Look at this muddy world.

168
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,730
Everyone is drunk.

169
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,500
I was just dreaming.

170
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,190
At this moment,

171
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,740
I should wake up from my dream.

172
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,500
You can't die.

173
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,250
We met in our previous life.

174
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,250
Who are you?

175
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,450
How could this happen?

176
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,090
Where is the Mr. Right?

177
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,270
He should have appeared.

178
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,150
Are you okay?

179
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,860
Have we

180
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,380
met before?

181
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,940
No. No. No.

182
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,860
No. No.

183
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,620
Young master,

184
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,170
you must have mistaken me for someone else.

185
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,220
Since you are fine,

186
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,100
I shall take my leave.

187
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,920
No, I can't be wrong.

188
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,590
I...

189
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,070
Last month,

190
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,010
we met at the Mansion of Duke Zhongyi.

191
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,800
At that time,

192
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,740
the wife of Duke Zhongyi was training with female generals.

193
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,170
You knocked off my hair bun.

194
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,050
What?

195
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,190
What female generals?

196
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,320
I've never heard of it.

197
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,670
How forgetful I am!

198
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,070
It's rare to see such a beautiful technique.

199
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,090
You must be the legitimate heir of the magician of Liuyun Theatre.

200
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:49,760
Half a month ago,

201
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,320
I watched your performance.

202
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,160
Young master,

203
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,210
you must be mistaken.

204
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,010
We've never seen each other in this life.

205
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,740
I remember now.

206
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,380
There is a beautiful fairy in my dream.

207
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,940
She looks very similar to you.

208
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,040
You and I

209
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,460
must have a relationship in heaven.

210
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,910
Heroine, wait.

211
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,340
I haven't asked your name yet.

212
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,260
Where do you live?

213
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,480
What’s your name?

214
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:26,890
Heroine.

215
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,360
Heroine.

216
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,580
It's almost midnight.

217
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,210
Why is the lord still wandering here?

218
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,850
Why isn't he going to meet Xie Wanqing?

219
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,620
After the night of the Lantern Festival,

220
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,170
the fate will be changed.

221
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,850
I was worried about your safety

222
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,950
and looking for you everywhere.

223
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,260
But you're here to meet Changheng secretly.

224
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,780
Changheng?

225
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,460
Isn't Lord Changheng at Shuiyuntian?

226
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,560
You got the wrong person.

227
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,480
You are still lying to me.

228
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,920
Do you really think I am a three-year-old child

229
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,640
who will be fooled by your tricks?

230
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,110
That day at the Life Ending Pavilion,

231
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,070
I found

232
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,750
Changheng was also experiencing hardships there.

233
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,160
Everything you said and did

234
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,840
is just covering up for Changheng.

235
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,770
Even so,

236
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,180
I would rather believe it when you said

237
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,320
the Bone Orchid I gave you is priceless.

238
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,450
But you...

239
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,550
Yes.

240
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,850
I lied to you.

241
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,690
What about you?

242
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,670
Why did you come to Lu City?

243
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,270
You said you came to hang around with me.

244
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,950
In fact, you are here to take the spirit of the first God of War,

245
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,570
right?

246
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,720
How did you know?

247
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,660
Jieli told you?

248
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,880
She didn't say anything.

249
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,860
I guessed it according to the fate poem.

250
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,100
How smart you are, the head disciple of the Arbiter!

251
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,570
Since you are so good at guessing,

252
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,870
did you know long ago about

253
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,130
Changheng's hardship experience?

254
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,060
I...

255
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,300
Good. Very good.

256
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,660
No wonder you came to Lu City without permission,

257
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,130
and claimed that you wanted to hang around with me.

258
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,520
So you had a plan.

259
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,360
I didn't.

260
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,830
I knew it not long ago.

261
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,600
This is a rare opportunity.

262
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,160
I'm going to kill Changheng now

263
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,310
and get rid of a big trouble for Cangyan Sea.

264
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:17,940
No.

265
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,860
You can't kill him.

266
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,460
Lord Changheng is Mr. Right!

267
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,190
What did you say?

268
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,660
Xiao Run, the second son of the Xiao family,

269
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,500
was betrothed to Xie Wanqing before birth,

270
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,970
and then offered a lot of money to propose.

271
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,650
They both

272
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,910
showed up at Life Ending Pavilion tonight.

273
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,120
There must be no mistake.

274
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,310
If you kill him on impulse,

275
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,480
Xie Wanqing's fate

276
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,790
will change too.

277
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,880
It's because of you.

278
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,440
What do you mean?

279
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,540
If, as you said,

280
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,760
Changheng is the Mr. Right in the poem,

281
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,240
then the reason why he didn't show up on time

282
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,420
is because he wasted time

283
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,380
pushing and pulling

284
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,560
with you

285
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,820
and thus changed the fate.

286
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,710
If I hadn't stopped Xie Wanqing,

287
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,730
she would have died.

288
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,660
What?

289
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,880
You stopped Xie Wanqing?

290
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,270
Why are you so nosy?

291
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,910
It’s not her fate.

292
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,830
If I didn't stop her

293
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,920
and let her die,

294
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,560
there would be no turning back.

295
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,580
Oh no no no.

296
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,770
They've missed the destined time.

297
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,570
They should have fallen in love tonight,

298
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,550
but they didn't meet each other.

299
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,110
If things don't happen according to the fate poem,

300
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,130
the two of them would fail in the hardship experience,

301
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,700
and their primordial spirits will perish.

302
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,370
[Everlasting Orchid]

303
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,490
Run,

304
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,890
after going home today,

305
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,860
you look as if you lose your soul.

306
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,210
You've been staring at the blank paper

307
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,440
for the whole night.

308
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,079
You don't understand.

309
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,310
If I don't draw until I am fully prepared,

310
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,160
I would offend that heroine.

311
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,440
Run,

312
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,050
It's 1 a.m.

313
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,240
After school tomorrow,

314
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,250
you need to go to Life Ending Pavilion

315
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,010
to visit Lady Wanqing.

316
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,859
Rest early.

317
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,930
I won't go to Life Ending Pavilion tomorrow.

318
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,220
It's not Lady Wanqing.

319
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,520
I was wrong.

320
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,390
That heroine

321
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,400
is actually the fairy in my dream.

322
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,470
Another girl?

323
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,120
What do you mean?

324
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,020
It's different this time.

325
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,030
I can feel

326
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,260
that heroine is the fairy in my dream.

327
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,570
I was born with this jade.

328
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,580
I was born for her.

329
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,400
Run, take your time.

330
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,510
Who are you?

331
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,070
You are Fairy Danyin.

332
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,680
Are you a thief?

333
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,110
Help!

334
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,530
Help!

335
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,120
Help!

336
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,710
Qu Shui!

337
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,060
Thief! Thief!

338
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,070
Qu Shui!

339
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,770
Who dares to break into Xiao's mansion at night?

340
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,180
I came to Lu City.

341
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,650
You also came to Lu City.

342
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,330
You and I are destined to meet.

343
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,560
You bandit, I'll beat you!

344
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,290
Stop!

345
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,220
Let him go!

346
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,660
Young master,

347
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,750
you must be mistaken.

348
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,890
There is a beautiful fairy in my dream.

349
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,320
She looks very similar to you.

350
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,460
You and I

351
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,970
must have a relationship in heaven.

352
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,080
Why isn't he back yet?

353
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,490
How did it go?

354
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,330
Did it go well?

355
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,900
It's easy to erase

356
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,860
a mortal's memory.

357
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,020
No.

358
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,780
The problem has not fully solved yet.

359
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,430
Even if Xiao Run's memory of meeting me was erased,

360
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,570
he still hasn't met Xie Wanqing.

361
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,800
You...

362
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,020
Why are you looking at me?

363
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,670
Orchid, you are in charge of fixing the Destiny Book.

364
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,810
No one knows hardship experience better than you.

365
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,900
Hurry up and find a way!

366
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,520
Let me get it straight.

367
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,620
On the night of the Lantern Festival,

368
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,880
the God of War Changheng,

369
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
or Xiao Run,

370
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,610
was destined to meet

371
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,990
Chidi woman Xie Wanqing

372
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,710
at Life Ending Pavilion,

373
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,530
and save Xie Wanqing who would fall off the building,

374
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,870
and they would fall in love with each other.

375
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,780
But because Wooden Head and I were careless,

376
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,540
they missed each other.

377
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,450
Because of you two,

378
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,130
their fates

379
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,480
deviated from the...

380
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,160
Fate poem.

381
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,910
Yes. Yes. Yes.

382
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,670
Fate poem.

383
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,570
If they didn't meet, they wouldn't be in love.

384
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,000
If they were not in love, they wouldn't get married.

385
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,350
If so,

386
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,660
Xie Wanqing won't be able to be killed by Xiao Run

387
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,380
on the wedding night.

388
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,350
I have a question.

389
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,490
Since Changheng wanted to marry her,

390
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,080
why would he kill her?

391
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,680
I'm also curious about this.

392
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,490
Lord Changheng is a person who values love and loyalty.

393
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,510
Why would he kill Xie Wanqing?

394
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,140
Yes.

395
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,800
There is someone who values love and loyalty in the fairy realm?

396
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,690
This is the first time I've ever known it.

397
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,490
My lord,

398
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,960
Changheng is a mortal now.

399
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,680
A mortal is able to value love

400
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,660
and loyalty.

401
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,090
Don't stray from the point.

402
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,350
These are not important.

403
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,980
Anyway,

404
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,380
if nothing in the fate poem happens now,

405
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,850
then the hardship experience of Changheng and Chidi Woman

406
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,990
will be a failure.

407
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,720
Their primordial spirits

408
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,480
will vanish.

409
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,360
Am I right?

410
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,850
Accidents before the hardship are not terrible.

411
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,240
What's important is the hardship experience.

412
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,890
If they are destined to love each other,

413
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,490
it doesn't matter how they meet.

414
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,670
I see.

415
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,900
You understand too?

416
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,660
No.

417
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,920
Then why did you say that?

418
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,260
I was trying to enliven the atmosphere.

419
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,880
So what do you know now?

420
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,610
Think about it.

421
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,380
As long as they get married on the Flora Day,

422
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,690
the fate poem will still come true,

423
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,000
and the hardship experience will succeed.

424
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,470
So our main task now

425
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,910
is to make them fall in love before that.

426
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,230
But they already missed the best opportunity.

427
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,700
How can we make them fall in love?

428
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,870
You don't understand.

429
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,340
Xiao Run and Xie Wanqing

430
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,020
are a match made in heaven.

431
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,240
This little setback

432
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,050
can't tear them apart.

433
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,220
Look.

434
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,250
Xiao Run doesn't value fame and fortune at all.

435
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,680
He refused to follow his family's arrangement.

436
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,620
Xie Wanqing doesn't value wealth and splendor.

437
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,600
She refused to care about the worldly taste.

438
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,030
They both refused to do anything against their will.

439
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,130
Aren't they a perfect match?

440
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,260
So now,

441
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,860
as long as they meet,

442
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,490
fate will naturally lead them

443
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,420
to fall in love at first sight.

444
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,690
There's no time to lose.

445
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,820
I'll go find Xiao Run

446
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,330
and ask him to meet Xie Wanqing.

447
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,000
Don’t go.

448
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,350
I went to erase Xiao Run’s memory

449
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,950
to avoid more troubles.

450
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,090
If you go there rashly,

451
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,350
it would be a waste of time.

452
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,170
Exactly.

453
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,770
The relations between mortal men and women should be developed naturally.

454
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,250
Orchid, it's not appropriate for you to go find Xiao Run.

455
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:33,920
Exactly.

456
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,560
Since you want to be a mortal,

457
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,540
you must follow the rules of mortals.

458

As for Xie Wanqing,

461
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,690
Orchid and I will take charge of her.

462
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,950
After getting along with them,

463
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,220
we'll find a way to let them meet.

No.

We can't do this.

Why?

You're afraid that I'll take Changheng life, aren't you?

He has no power.

473
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,850
If I kill him,

474
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,030
I'm not different from those hypocrites

Are you sure you won’t hurt him?

477
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,820
The hardship is more important now.

478
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,300
I don't have time to waste energy in the mortal world.

519
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,600
Those royal descendants

520
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,950
and noble ladies of noble families

521
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,760
always recite poems and play grass games on the banquet.

522
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,570
It happens every year.

523
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,540
I'm tired.

524
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,520
Decline for me.

525
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,240
Yes.

526
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:32,410
Wait.

527
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,970
Get the best gardener in Lu City for me.

528
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:50,600
Yes.

529
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,620
Run! Run!

530
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,050
Run.

531
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,540
Why are we sleeping in the yard?

532
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,150
By the way,

533
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,190
a thief seemed to break in last night.

534
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,260
I was so scared that I...

535
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,150
And then?

536
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,160
I passed out.

537
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,650
Run, are you alright?

538
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,000
I'm fine.

539
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,430
But I feel that

540
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,660
I forgot something important.

541
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,030
Run.

542
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,240
Don't scare me.

543
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,300
Did you hurt your brain

544
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,810
when you fought against the thief?

545
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,090
Or

546
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,990
did you come across ghosts?

547
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,880
In broad daylight,

548
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,640
it's impossible to see ghosts.

549
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,040
What time is it now?

550
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,940
It should be

551
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,410
7 a.m. now.

552
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,070
Hurry up! Hurry up!

553
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,910
Pack up!

554
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:28,540
If my old man knows

555
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,680
I missed school time,

556
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,640
I will be skinned by him.

557
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,270

It's too late.

561
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,830
What are you doing?

562
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,400
Where is this painting from?

563
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,210
You painted it yourself yesterday.

564
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,300
You forgot?

565
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,940
We are really late!

566
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,250
This must be drawn in my dream.

567
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,350
The woman in the painting

568
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,070
must be the fairy in my dream.

569
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,000
Qu Shui!

570
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,140
I know everything.

571
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,950
Know what?

572
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,420
I know what she looks like.

573
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,610
I finally know.

574
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:16,000
Qu Shui, I finally know.

575
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:21,170
Dark Golden Glory is the best among the Top 10 Peonies.

576
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,970
It's the most delicate.

577
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,110
Since the day I planted it,

578
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,580
I've been taking care of it every day.

579
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,720
I've invited countless gardeners,

580
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,570
but no one can make it bloom.

581
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,210
Lady Orchid, you are an excellent gardener.

582
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,850
Now it has buds.

583
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,870
Don't worry.

584
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,300
I'll make sure it blooms before the Spring Banquet.

585
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,620
I heard that Lady Orchid

586
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,760
is renowned as the head of flower fairies in Jinling.

587
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,650
It shows that the rumor is true.

588
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,150
I'm... I'm flattered.

589
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,980
I've heard that Jinling is full of talented people.

590
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,790
Lady Orchid, don't be modest.

591
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,700
Actually, I'm just an ordinary person.

592
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,550
I accepted your invitation

593
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,570
for personal reason.

594
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,960
If I can accompany you to the Spring Banquet,

595
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,520
maybe I can meet a fated person.

596
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,550
A young gentleman will be attracted by beautiful ladies.

597
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,100
This is a good thing.

598
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,910
If you can meet someone you like,

599
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,550
it will be good.

600
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,440
Do you have someone

601
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,860
in your heart?

602
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,460
Maybe my destined one

603
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,100
is the moon in the sky.

604
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,920
The moon in the sky

605
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,220
is bright and clear,

606
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,660
and it always hangs in the sky.

607
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,790
It's untouchable.

608
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,730
Xie Wanqing's dream lover

609
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,370
is really Lord Changheng.

610
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,720
It is the year of Guichou in terms of the Chinese lunar calendar.

611
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,810
On one of those late spring days,

612
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,080
we gather at the Orchid Pavilion, which is located in Shanyin County, Kuaiji Prefecture,

613
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,380
for dispelling bad luck and praying for good fortune.

614
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,150
The attendees of the gathering are all virtuous intellectuals.

615
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,080
Run, the teacher is coming.

616
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,050
This is...

617
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:29,850
It's you.

618
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,180
You are

619
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,190
the rich merchant who bought the Night Stream Building

620
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,750
with a box of gold.

621
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,950
It's him.

622
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,830
It's him.

623
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,800
Silence!

624
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,050
This is Mr. Dongfang.

625
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,690
He will be your classmate from now on.

626
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,040
I haven't finished yet.

627
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,050
What else can you say?

628
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:00,810
Let the class begin.

629
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,200
Look at his vibe.

630
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,220
So impressive.

631
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:06,810
Yes.

632
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,280
Okay.

633
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,840
Let's continue to review.

634
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,660
Mr. Dongfang,

635
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,790
you really have a

636
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,520
impressive presence.

637
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,150
Nice to meet you.

638
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,810
My name is widely known because of my money.

639
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,110
These mortals

640
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,240
are so boring.

641
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,440
Mr. Dongfang

642
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,120
is really extraordinary.

643
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,420
Stop whispering!

644
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,640
You two,

645
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,230
get out!

646
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,390
Mr. Dongfang.

647
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,310
I’m talking to you.

648
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,570
How dare you talk to me like that?

649
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,450
Calm down, sir.

[Rectification, Cultivation, Contemplation, Diligence]

651

Brother Dongfang.

652
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,350
There is a football match

653
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,699
in the west of the city.

654
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:23,290
Why don't we go and have a look?

655
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,310
School is not over yet.

656
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,650
Someone must be guarding the front gate.

657
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,880
I have a good plan.

658
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,489
You two stay here.

659
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,830
Go!

660
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:34,840
Go!

661
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,639
Go!

662
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,230
Brother Dongfang, hurry up!

663
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:52,980
No one is here.

664
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:54,580

665
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,900
Brother Dongfang, hurry up!

666
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,790
Brother Dongfang!

667
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,290
I'm coming.

Hurry up.

669

Come on.

670

Be careful.

Be careful.

672
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,830
I can't believe I just crawled into a dog hole with Changheng hand in hand.

673
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,050
What did you say?

674
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:34,480
Nothing.

675
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,780
Who is sneaking around?

676
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,380
Let's go.

It's...

It's almost lunchtime.

682
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,700
Have you eaten?

683
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,630
Mr. Xiao,

684
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,110
you've been idling about

685
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,960
and fooling around all day long.

686
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,390
You're stubborn.

687
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,580
You don't focus on your studies at all.

688
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,890
Today, you even crawled into the dog hole.

689
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,230
You've humiliated yourself.

690
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,170
If it weren't for your father's sake,

691
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,220
