Daqiang. Daqiang.

00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,780
Daqiang. Daqiang.

8
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,300
Why are you so flustered?

9
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,540
Do you know why I'm so happy?

10
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,700
Lord Changheng praised me.

11
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,580
Didn't you go there to cancel the result?

12
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,540
Things have changed.

13
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,620
Everyone said I deserved it.

14
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,020
And Lord Changheng praised me.

15
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,660
He said I'm a role model for all fairies

16
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,579
of Shuiyuntian.

17
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:26,500
He even gave me the Firefly Stone.

18
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,940
What a coincidence.

19
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,060
Why did the fireflies fly to my garden

20
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,460
at Arbiter Hall

21
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,810
and nibble my flowers?

22
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:37,100
Does this mean

23
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,260
I'm destined to be with Lord Changheng?

24
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,620
You're unpredictable and unsteady.

25
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,540
Lord,

26
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,180
is there anything wrong?

27
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,460
It's odd.

28
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:18,980
The Heart Curse

29
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,420
should have let us share our joy and sorrow.

30
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,980
She was so excited

31
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,260
about the praise from Changheng

32
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,020
and chance to serve him.

33
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,980
But I...

34
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,060
felt uncomfortable.

35
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,820
I didn't expect the spell of Xilan

36
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,579
to be this odd.

37
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,300
We can't be unguarded.

38
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:42,300
But my lord,

39
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:46,180
since the little flower spirit has been in a good mood,

40
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,700
she will soon regain her energy

41
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,060
and fix the Destiny Book.

42
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,660
There's no need to rush.

43
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,380
Although she's getting better,

44
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,980
she has only recovered 70%.

45
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,860
Don't be anxious to fix the Destiny Book.

46
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,340
Yes.

47
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,460
Sweep all the fallen leaves.

48
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,770
Put that flower pot there.

49
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,260
Yes.

50
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,450
What are you doing

51
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,700
Fairy Yulin?

52
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,060
The recruiting list of Fountain Palace hasn't been announced.

53
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,100
Why are you

54
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,820
sweeping the floor and moving the flower pots here?

55
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,620
What's the difference?

56
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,500
I got the second place in the exam.

57
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,340
The recruitment is a sure thing.

58
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,100
Yulin,

59
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,890
did you fry your brain during the exam?

60
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,500
You're just here to work.

61
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,780
Do you really think you're the hostess?

62
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,060
As an outsider,

63
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,020
it's none of your business.

64
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,140
Give it back to me.

65
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,540
Why are you

66
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,020
sneaking around here?

67
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,740
Qingchuan.

68
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,220
This...

69
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,300
How dare you steal the stone from Lord Changheng?

70
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,260
What are you talking about?

71
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,780
Lord Changheng gave it to me personally.

72
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,420
It's not dark yet. Why are you already talking in your sleep?

73
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,700
It's fine that Lord Changheng gave it to me.

74
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,340
He doesn't even know you.

75
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,650
How could he give you things for no reason?

76
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,580
You knew nothing!

77
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,620
Lord Changheng told me himself that

78
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,780
the Firefly Stone is destined to be mine.

79
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,100
Give it back to me!

80
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,860
You're caught red-handed. How dare you deny it?

81
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,580
-Qingchuan, bring Lord here.-Stop arguing,

82
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,340
two fairies.

83
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,340
-Confront me if you dare. -Give it back to me!

84
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,220
Stop arguing.

85
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,900
Just now,

86
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,580
Yulin and I had a quarrel.

87
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,420
It's not a big deal.

88
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,500
Sorry to offend you.

89
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,380
Please forgive me, Lord Yunzhong.

90
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,700
It's about Changheng.

91
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,659
Of course it's a big deal.

92
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,620
Danyin.

93
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:58,940
You said Yulin

94
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,060
stole the Firefly Stone of Changheng?

95
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,900
Is it true?

96
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,140
Yulin said

97
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,260
this Firefly Stone was given by Lord Changheng.

98
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,180
Maybe I misunderstood her.

99
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,660
Yes.

100
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,050
Is that true, Yulin?

101
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,250
Yes, it was a gift from Lord Changheng.

102
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,900
I didn't steal it.

103
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,180
Please investigate it, Lord Yunzhong.

104
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,540
That's not true.

105
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,380
Brother,

106
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,450
the Magical Firefly Stone is beneficial to cultivation.

107
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,700
I always wear it with me,

108
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,020
and never gave it to anyone.

109
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,420
Yulin,

110
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,900
deceiving Lord Yunzhong is

111
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,020
as serious as stealing.

112
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,020
Two crimes shall be punished together.

113
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,420
You will be dismissed

114
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,460
and demoted to a lower immortal.

115
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,620
Understand?

116
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,220
I...

117
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,900
I didn't lie to you.

118
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,660
I was just afraid that

119
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,340
people would gossip about Lord Changheng.

120
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:12,860
That's why...

121
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,540
Stop talking nonsense.

122
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,300
Brother,

123
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,180
I don't even know Fairy Yulin.

124
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,300
She lied

125
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,660
to get away with the crime of theft.

126
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,970
According to our fair law,

127
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,500
she needs to be removed from the post of the Buyusi.

128
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,380
and sent to reflect on her mistakes.

129
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,620
Yulin,

130
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,820
considering your mother has been doing her job well,

131
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,580
and has always abided by her duties,

132
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,580
I'll give you one last chance.

133
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,060
Did you steal

134
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,380
the Firefly Stone,

135
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,620
or Changheng gave it to you?

136
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,860
He gave it to me.

137
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,020
In that case,

138
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,220
take her down.

139
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,290
Remove her immortal bones

140
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,340
and get her out of Shenshui Hall.

141
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,300
Go.

142
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,260
I'm innocent.

143
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,900
Brother,

144
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,090
Although Yulin has done bad deeds and violated the heaven's rules,

145
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,130
she doesn't deserve this penalty.

146
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,740
Please withdraw your order.

147
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,460
Lord Yunzhong, please spare her this time.

148
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,140
At worst,

149
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,690
forbid her to work at the Fountain Palace.

150
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,340
Dad, please help her to beg for mercy.

151
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:45,820
Enough!

152
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,370
Since when fairies in Yujing

153
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,700
have no manners at all?

154
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,660
They don't understand.

155
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,340
Neither do you?

156
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,970
As the younger son of Lord Dong,

157
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,740
and the God of War at Shuiyuntian,

158
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,260
you must not make any mistakes.

159
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,300
Have you heard?

160
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,900
Yulin seems to have committed

161
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,660
a serious crime.

162
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,890
Her immortal bones will be removed, and she will be forbidden to reincarnate forever.

163
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,100
What did she do?

164
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,540
I don't know.

165
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,410
I don't know.

166
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,620
I heard several senior immortals pleaded for her,

167
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,740
but all in vain.

168
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,220
Why did she commit such a big crime?

169
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,820
Yes.

170
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,740
,What did she do?

171
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,540
Who knows?

172
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,780
I don't know.

173
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,300
I've never heard of it before.

Yulin saw that things got out of hand,

she didn't want to be punished for stealing,

192
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,220

if she stole it,

196
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,700
it would be a matter of poor morality.

But if it was given by me,

199
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,020
it meant she had an affair with me.

200

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,500
The Orchid of Arbiter Hall who lured the beast with herself,

344
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,380
and saved all the fairies

345
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,380
during the exam,

346
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,380
do you remember her?

347
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:21,930
Yes.

348
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,260
Of course I do since she's the first place.

349
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,620
She is the champion,

350
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,340
but is refused by the Fountain Palace, why?

351
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,220
You worried too much.

352
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,100
Then why did you only eliminate her?

353
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,770
It's because...

354
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,740
she doesn't deserve it.

355
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,780
Really? But I heard

356
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,540
you praised her before.

357
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:59,180
You said she was brave, intelligent, pure and kind.

358
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,260
Even so,

359
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,370
she is just an ordinary orchid

360
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,420
in Yunmeng lake.

361
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,140
If it weren't for the fate of Arbiter,

362
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,340
she wouldn't have had the chance to come to Yujing

363
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,380
and enlighten herself here.

364
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,620
Moreover,

365
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,420
her immortal root has been damaged.

366
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,130
She is not qualified to practice.

367
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,660
It's fine if she joins the army

368
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,420
to train.

369
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,420
Why would I receive

370
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,980
a lowly elf

371
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,370
who is even weaker than the fairy servant?

372
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,460
Now you know why

373
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,090
Changheng wouldn't take you in, right?

374
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,770
Brother,

375
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,540
don't worry about such trivial matters.

376
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,860
The most important thing now

377
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,580
is to find the evil spirit

378
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,620
and the mastermind.

379
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,620
Go ahead.

380
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,540
There is a sinful immortal sneaked into Shuiyuntian recently.

381
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,860
The God of War, Changheng,

382
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,580
you're ordered to investigate it thoroughly now.

383
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,610
If you find anyone suspicious,

384
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,220
kill him immediately.

385
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:30,860
Yes.

386
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,700
Daqiang, I'm fine.

387
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,900
You don't have to accompany me.

388
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,260
Don't try to lie to me.

389
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,180
I know

390
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,700
you want to cry.

391
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,500
Why should I cry?

392
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,740
Fairy Danyin was right.

393
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,620
I, a nameless

394
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,500
and weak Orchid

395
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,100
finally passed the exam.

396
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,740
I should have celebrated with fireworks.

397
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,020
What should I cry for?

398
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,620
Right, I'll go to Taotao

399
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,540
and let her perform the scattering flowers.

400
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,980
Don't force yourself to be strong.

401
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,140
I can feel

402
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,420
your thoughts and feelings.

403
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,580
You don't have to bear them in front of me.

404
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,860
In everyone's mind,

405
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,420
I'm just an unknown wild grass.

406
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,220
Those fairies look down on me.

407
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,700
They don't even know I'm an orchid.

408
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,540
I thought only Lord Changheng

409
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,620
considered me the same as them.

410
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,740
You don't know how happy I was

411
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,180
when he praised me.

412
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,900
I knew.

413
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,260
But I didn't expect that

414
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,540
in Lord Changheng's mind,

415
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,460
I'm different from them.

416
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,540
He looks down upon me too.

417
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,980
Changheng is blind.

418
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,220
He doesn't know who's nice to him.

419
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,100
Don't criticize Lord Changheng.

420
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,580
You still want to protect him?

421
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,180
Forget it.

422
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,770
You are different from them.

423
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,340
Daqiang.

424
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,100
Do you look down on me?

425
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,500
I said so

426
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,380
because

427
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,260
you are much more precious

428
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,860
than them.

429
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,500
Precious?

430
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,780
To me,

431
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,820
you are as precious as my life.

432
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,730
You've said that many times.

433
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,380
I'm going to take it seriously if you keep saying that.

434
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,100
No.

435
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,060
I don't believe it.

436
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,660
You dare to question me?

437
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,260
Forget it.

438
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,260
It's okay if you don't believe me.

439
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,260
But don't cry.

440
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,020
If you cry,

441
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,180
I will feel sad too.

442
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,390
[Arbiter Hall]

443
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,290
Is anyone in the palace?

444
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,660
We are ordered to search here.

445
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,050
Is anyone in the palace?

446
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,580
We are ordered to search here.

447
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:04,820
Let's enter the palace.

448
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,620
Daqiang, no!

449
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,530
Don't disturb plants.

450
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,660
And don't destroy anything.

451
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,660
Yes.

So...

467
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,490
I understand. I know. I see.

468
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,740
I didn't push you away

469
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,260

486
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,780
My chest is so stuffy.

487
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,890
What's wrong with her again?

488
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,180
Shangque.

489
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,250
Yes.

490
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,780
Have you found the heart-hidden hairpin

491
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,580
I asked you to find?

492
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,400
Please forgive me.

493
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,800
The heart-hidden hairpin has disappeared

494
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,180
since the civil unrest of the Moon Tribe.

495
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,340
Until now,

496
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,620
it has never appeared.

497
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,260
Without the heart-hidden hairpin,

498
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,220
how long do I have to

499
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,340
bear with her changeable thoughts?

500
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,140
I have a lot on my plate.

501
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,980
How can I be disturbed by her all the time?

502
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,220
My lord, please forgive me.

503
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,460
Forget it.

504
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,420
When I return to the Cangyan Sea

505
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,540
and retrieve the holy token of the Moon Supreme.

506
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,620
I can also block these distractions.

507
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,380
But I've tried so hard,

508
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,500
why can the little Orchid

509
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,900

510
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,060
Why can't she be fully healed?

511
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:18,300
My lord,

512
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,380
I think

513
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:20,940
that little Orchid

514
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,820
always wanted to serve Changheng by his side,

515
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,740
but failed to make it.

516
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,450
I think

517
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,140
that 10% of unrecoverable magical prowess

518
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,380
has caused her mental illness.

519
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,060
I think

520
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,140
this mental illness

521
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,300
must be related to Changheng.

522
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,460
What indeed are

523
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,170
this Changheng's advantages?

524
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,000
Why is she so fond of him?

525
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,300
Orchid.

526
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,380
Fairy Danyin.

527
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,460
It's dangerous now, you know?

528
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,620
You power is so weak.

529
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,060
How dare you wander around alone?

530
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,170
The soldiers are searching everywhere.

531
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,340
Don't you know?

532
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,690
Are they still looking for the sinful immortal?

533
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,940
Not a sinful immortal!

534
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,940
It's the Moon Tribe!

535
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,580
The Moon Tribe?

536
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:09,860
Yes.

537
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,180
Recently, someone of the Moon Tribe has sneaked into Yujing.

538
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,300
No one knows where he is hiding.

539
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,980
Logically, Shuiyuntian is strictly guarded.

540
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,240
How could the Moon Tribe get in?

541
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,860
Could it be that someone of the Moon Tribe escaped

542
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,300
from the Haotian Tower?

543
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,980
Isn't a sinful immortal in the Haotian Tower?

544
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,340
My father told me that

545
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,740
except sinful immortals,

546
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,980
there are also the ones of the Moon Tribe in the Haotian Tower.

547
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,420
The Moon Tribe?

548
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,500
Daqiang, you're here.

549
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,180
Have a seat please.

550
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,610
It's not easy for me to pass the exam.

551
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,420
So we should celebrate it.

552
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,980
Let me offer you a drink.

553
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,610
Come here.

554
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,860
This is the Immortal Liquor my master hid.

555
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,860
Have a taste.

556
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,659
Let me ask you.

557
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,290
What is the tree hole

558
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,460
on the tree of Destiny Books?

559
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,900
Didn't you hear my answer

560
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,420
on the day when Danyin came?

561
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,540
That's not a tree hole.

562
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,850
It's the Tianji Mirror.

563
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,530
It can predict the future.

564
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,340
Predicting the future?

565
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,460
Is it accurate?

566
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,860
Why do you all ask about this?

567
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,179
Just answer my question.

568
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,420
It's accurate.

569
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,460
Nothing went wrong before.

570
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,860
Why did I ask about this?

571
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,450
What does it have to do with me

572
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,700
whether she can marry Changheng.

573
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,100
No.

574
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,180
What I truly cared about was not the wedding,

575
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,220
but the spell.

576
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,380
If this spell can't be broken,

577
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,300
I can't allow her to marry Changheng.

578
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,940
Otherwise,

579
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,020
Shuiyuntian

580
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,540
will control my weakness.

581

582
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,260
The first cup.

583

Thank you for saving my life so many times.

584

585

It's really fine liquor.

586
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,780
Then drink it.

587
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,580
I mean,

588
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,620
since it's fine liquor,

589
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,580
you should drink much.

590
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,290
Look, I've finished mine.

592
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,540
Thank you for the morning dew and flower soup

And this blanket.

I also took it for you.

you are not a sinful immortal,

when you are by my side at Arbiter Hall.

I'm not lonely at all and feel very happy.

It's been a long time since someone accompanied me like this.

616
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,020
People in the fairy realm say that

617
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,380
the Moon Tribe if full of bad people.

618
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,020
But after I met you,

619
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,100
I think you're not bad at all.

620
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,300
Not all people in the Moon Tribe are bad.

621

Right?

Now, Shuiyuntian is apprehending danger in every sound.

626
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,690
Once your identity as a Moon Tribe is discovered,

627
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,300
you will die for sure.

628
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,420
So you fed the medicine to me and made me unconscious?

629

If you were obedient,

630

I wouldn't have done that.

if what you did is found by others?

634
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,730
If you are found to collude with the Moon Tribe,

635
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,620
you will be imprisoned at least,
