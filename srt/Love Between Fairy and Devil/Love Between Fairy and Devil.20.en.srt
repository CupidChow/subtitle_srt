00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,340
I heard

5
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,280
up ahead is the Changle Street

6
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,940
where mortals drink flower wine.

7
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,620
Since we want to be mortals,

8
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,900
we can't miss this good thing.

9
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,090
What is drinking flower wine?

10
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,660
The flower refers to a woman.

11
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,060
Drinking flower wine

12
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,500
is drinking in the brothel.

13
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,889
Find a beautiful lady

14
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,380
to sing and have fun with her

15
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,090
I don't think it's a good idea.

16
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,180
Indulging in pleasure will bungle matters.

17
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,100
Bungle matters?

18
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,420
What matters?

19
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,460
We came to Lu City

20
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,700
for relaxation,

21
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,380
didn't we?

22
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:27,780
That's right.

23
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,820
Exactly.

24
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,329
Look.

25
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:34,620
Our landlord has given the order.

26
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,020
Our first priority today is to have fun.

27
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,460
Today, we must drink all over the street.

28

where is this place?

40
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,140
This is Life Ending Pavilion where Lady Wanqing lives.

41
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,020
You don't know?

42
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,450
I just arrived in Lu City.

43
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,300
Who is Lady Wanqing?

44
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,100
She is the most beautiful courtesan

45
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,780
on Changle Street in Lu City.

46
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,180
Her mastery of Six Art is unmatched in the world.

47
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,860
She is even more beautiful

48
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,020
than the fairies in heaven.

49
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,540
Absolutely true.

50
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,540
Have you seen

51
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,380
the fairies in heaven?

52
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,340
I'm not talking nonsense.

53
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,060
Lady Wanqing came to Changle Street

54
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,860
at the age of 15.

55
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,780
Her magnificent dance

56
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,340
made a hundred flowers bloom.

57
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,780
This thing spread all over Lu City.

58
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,460
Even kids knew that.

59
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,860
It sounds like

60
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,980
she is indeed a fairy.

61
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,220
But now,

62
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,180
only noble families

63
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,610
can see Lady Wanqing.

64
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,260
I'm afraid we'll never see her.

65
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,780
If I'm lucky to see her dance again,

66
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,220
I shall die without regret.

67

That's Lady Wanqing's Flora Letter.

No.

Why is he here?

91

No.

92
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,690
He wasn't born in the Immortal Pond.

93
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,170
He seems to be a mortal.

94
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,450
Why does he look exactly like Lord Changheng?

95

Magical Firefly Stone.

96
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,250
He's Lord Changheng.

97
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,000
Is he also

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,720
experiencing hardships in the mortal world?

99
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,440
Oh no.

100
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,070
If Dongfang Qingcang finds him,

101
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,460
he will kill him.

102
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,680
Then he'll fail in experiencing hardships

103
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,640
and turn into ashes.

104

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,200

108
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,880
Lady Wanqing is coming.

Hurry up.

110
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,710
Let's go and have a look.

111
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,820
Why is there Hellfire on Xie Wanqing?

112
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,170
30,000 years of hardship experience.

113
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,900
High immortal was hurt by Hellfire 30,000 years ago.

114
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,910
So Xie Wanqing is the reincarnation of the first God of War?

115
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,650
It seems he has already known.

116
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,000
What does he want to do

117
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,850
with the primordial spirit of the first God of War?

118
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,620
No matter what he wants to do,

119
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,179
I must stop him

120
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,770
and protect the first God of War.

121
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,600

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,020
I think I ate something bad today.

Oh, it's him.

136
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,940
The devil incarnate.

137
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,700
Who is he?

138
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,430
Xiao Run, the second son of the Xiao family.

139
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,440
He's the top playboy in Lu City.

140
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,490
He is ignorant,

141
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,170
and enjoys himself all day.

142
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,610
He isn't eligible for being here.

143
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,870
Without knowledge

144
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,380
he can only shout vulgarly.

145
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,810
How can he understand

146
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,110
the delicate part of the dance?

147
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,790
It turns out Lord Changheng is called Xiao Run in this life.

148
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,870
Mr. Wang presented

149
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,260
5,000 liangs of gold.

150
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,960
Mr. Su presented

151
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,320
ten rolls of jade-green brocade

152
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,120
ten rolls of brocade with cloud patterns

153
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,840
and ten rolls of brocade with landscape paintings.

154
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,250
Mr. Li presented a case of jewelry.

155
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,670
Jieli, what are you doing?

156
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,850
Why are you so surprised?

157
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,660
Money, Orchid.

158
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,390
Do you know how much those things cost?

159
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,380
Did you use Yunmeng Lake money?

160
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,480
Of course.

161
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,120
When I look at jewelry,

162
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,650
I feel refreshed.

163
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,880
If I can sleep with gold.

164
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,150
I'll feel better.

165
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,730
Mr. Xiao

166
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,450
presented a royal red coral tree.

167
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,930
A gift from the emperor?

168
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,730
A royal gift!

169
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,130
It's from the emperor.

170
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,050
Do you know the emperor?

171
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,660
He is equivalent of the Moon Supreme in Yunmeng Lake.

172
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,140
So that is a unique and priceless treasure.

173
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,790
Mr. Xiao presented priceless treasure.

174
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,680
No one can match him.

175
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,660
So he can be the guest of Lady Wanqing.

176
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,550
I have to see

177
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,060
who Mr. Xiao is.

178
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,070
Mr. Xiao,

179
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:14,780
this way, please.

180
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:17,890
Thank you.

181
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,030
Thank you.

182
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,970
I can't believe he can simply give the royal gift.

183
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,230
My goodness.

184
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,750
What now?

185
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,220
Bone Orchid is missing.

186
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,890
What?

187
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,360
Bone Orchid is missing.

188
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,160
I was wearing it just now.

189
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,560
I don't know why it suddenly disappeared.

190
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,610
Don't worry.

191
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,040
Bone Orchid obeys my orders.

192
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,510
I will summon it back.

193
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,220
No.

194
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,450
Don't use any magic.

195
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,410
Have you forgotten?

196
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,500
Life is destined.

197
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,510
We can't disturb them.

198
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,030
Otherwise, these mortals will turn into ashes.

199
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,500
Shangque.

200
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,850
Help me find it.

201
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,030
Find it.

202
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:58,880
Yes.

203
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,420
You must find it for me.

204
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,470
Because Bone Orchid

205
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,070
is priceless to me.

206
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,210
I found it.

207
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,300
What are you doing in Yunmeng Lake?

208
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,360
I...

209
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,590
I'm here to accompany you.

210
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,650
[Life Ending Pavilion]

211
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,010
Mr. Xiao.

212
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,110
Hi, Lady Wanqing.

213
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,580
Who are you?

214
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,140
No descendant of the nobility in Lu City

215
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,360
dares to be so rude to our ma'am.

216
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,090
Ma'am.

217
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,610
I'm Xiao Run.

218
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,220
You met me at the Xiao Mansion when we were young.

219
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,770
Do you remember?

220
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,160
No.

221
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,340
Our fathers were classmates.

222
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,850
They were officials in the same court.

223
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,580
The deceased emperor

224
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,680
betrothed you to me before birth.

225
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,190
Do you remember this?

226
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,340
Ten years ago,

227
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,900
my father suffered from political strife.

228
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,490
In the Xie family,

229
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,140
men were exiled to the harsh place in the North,

230
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,740
women were forced to be prostitutes in Royal Academy.

231
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,520
I'm a convicted person.

232
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,200
You don't have to mention

233
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,460
that old practice of marriage.

234
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,410
Ma'am,

235
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,340
you're wrong.

236
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,490
Although the Xiao family and Xie family have changed,

237
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,170
a gentleman must keep his promise.

238
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,440
Since we are engaged,

239
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,490
I can't break my promise.

240
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,150
I'm here today to proposed you

241
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,080
with a royal red coral tree.

242
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,850
Wanqing.

243
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,800
Why didn't you agree

244
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,520
such a good marriage?

245
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,740
His father

246
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,420
has a successful official career.

247
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,270
His brother has won three matches in succession

248
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,780
and is favored by the emperor.

249
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,850
It's rare for Xiao Run to have such kind intention.

250
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,910
If you agree,

251
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,080
you will enjoy a rich and noble life

252
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,890
in the future.

253
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,230
Do I have to say yes

254
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,200
if he wants to marry me?

255
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,690
This playboy wants to marry me,

256
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,820
but he doesn't know

257
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,790
my heart has never been in this world.

258
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,230
I'm not like him.

259
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,490
Wanqing,

260
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,550
with your current status,

261
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,560
why are you still so picky

262
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,120
like a royal daughter?

263
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,260
Not to mention a wealthy family like the Xiao family,

264
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,020
you won't be the head wife

265
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,750
in an ordinary family.

266
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,060
Listen to me.

267
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,280
You're not young anymore.

268
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,970
I've gone through this.

269
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,610
In this field,

270
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,750
everyone loves the new and loathes the old.

271
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,140
Others think this is a great favor.

272
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,240
But in my opinion,

273
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm just going to live in another cage.

274
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,780
Tongyun.

275
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,710
Mr. Xiao,

276
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,860
this cup of tea is enough for our relationship.

277
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,880
Thank you for your love.

278
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,680
Please leave.

279
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,900
Since you don't want to say yes today,

280
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,960
I'll come another day.

281
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,390
Mr. Xiao...

282
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,490
Mr. Xiao.

283
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,170
My ma'am made this tea herself.

284
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,850
He just gulped down it.

285
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,530
He's really a vulgar person.

286
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,200
Tongyun.

287
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,380
Ask someone to return that royal coral tree

288
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,850
to Mr. Xiao.

289
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,890
My ancestors!

290
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,770
Go now.

291
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,380
If you really refuse this marriage,

292
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,520
you will...

293
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,690
Don't worry, Mother.

294
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,079
I have my own plan.

295
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,520
I already have the best choice in my heart.

296
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,040
Is there anyone

297
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,140
richer than the Mr. Xiao who wants to marry you?

298
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,280
Get out of my way. I'm here to find Mr. Xiao.

299
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,079
Cricket, why are you here?

300
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,890
Didn't I ask you to do homework at home?

301
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,070
Bad news. Master found out.

302
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,840
He got so angry in the study.

303
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,470
Three teacups were broken.

304
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,570
It's not the first time I've played hooky.

305
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,620
Take it easy.

306
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,390
No. It's about the coral tree.

307
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,560
Let's go.

308
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:48,640
Be careful.

309
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,190
Let's go.

310
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,110
Hurry up.

311
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,250
When they leave,

312
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,510
you sneak to the backyard

313
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,440
and ask Grandmother to save me.

314
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,160
Don't be so clumsy.

315
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,830
Be careful.

316
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,350
If my father finds out,

317
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,360
he will kill me.

318
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,590
Do you hear me?

319
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,210
Father!

320
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,310
Fight!

321
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,630
Gambling, soliciting prostitution.

322
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,930
That's fine.

323
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,730
Bastard!

324
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,460
Today, you even stole the royal coral tree

325
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,110
for Lady Wanqing.

326
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,780
Father.

327
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,870
Let me explain.

328
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,890
You put the coral tree over there

329
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,320
and pray every day and night.

330
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,450
I'm really afraid that if you continue,

331
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,090
you won't be able to straighten your back.

332
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,770
Father, I'm worried about you.

333
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,080
Stop quibbling.

334
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,640
Father.

335
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,990
Lady Wanqing has

336
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,370
brought back the coral tree.

337
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:03,820
How many times?

338
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,250
Master, more than 30 times.

339
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:06,840
Get up.

340
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,650
Go back to sleep.

341
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,870
Go to school tomorrow morning.

342
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,940
Lady Wanqing?

343
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,530
She's just a prostitute.

344
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,720
Father.

345
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,190
You can't say that.

346
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,900
Don't say it.

347
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,630
My engagement with her

348
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,930
was arranged by the deceased emperor.

349
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,540
If I don't fulfill this promise,

350
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,300
I'll commit a grave crime of deceiving emperor.

351
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,320
Bastard!

352
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,670
That was a joke

353
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,430
of the deceased emperor.

354
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,780
If you're really going to marry her,

355
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,620
our Xiao family will be a laughing stock

356
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,060
in Lu City.

357
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,120
If everyone in Lu City knows

358
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,880
our Xiao family is the greatest snob

359
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,650
in the world,

360
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,410
we'll really be a laughing stock.

361
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,090
Everything I did

362
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,190
is for our Xiao family.

363
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,830
In this world,

364
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,970
you can't find a son as loyal and filial as me.

365
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,870
Father,

366
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,090
you always taught me

367
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,690
to read the books of sages

368
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,790
and become a scholar like my brother.

369
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,090
If I'm like you,

370
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,350
well-read

371
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,120
but so hypocritical,

372
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,850
I would rather be an illiterate commoner.

373
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,730
Unfilial son! Unfilial son!

374
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,190
Come here.

375
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,240
Master, calm down.

376
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,040
Hit me.

377
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,090
-I'm tough. -Come here

378
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,390
# -And you don't need to feel sorry. -I'll hit you.

379
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,270
Come here.

380
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,380
You two are really close.

381
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,850
If you want to be punished together,

382
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,770
I'll do it for you.

383
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,700
As a man,

384
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,790
I'll answer for what I did myself.

385
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,500
Don't hit Crickets.

386
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,220
You have an iron backbone.

387
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,780
From now on,

388
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,590
you won't have monthly salary anymore.

389
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,110
Father, I was wrong.

390
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,420
Run,

391
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,690
if you let your father scold,

392
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,950
you won't lose anything.

393
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,140
Why did you say those nonsense

394
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,570
and make your father angry?

395
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,260
My father

396
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,830
is hypocritical.

397
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,920
Look.

398
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,470
He showed his true colors at the critical moment.

399
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,340
Run,

400
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,230
do you really want to marry Lady Wanqing?

401
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,540
You don't like her.

402
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,640
She is noble-minded and elegant.

403
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,130
She didn't change her nature in the brothel.

404
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,230
She's a heroine.

405
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,840
I don't love her

406
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,610
but we're friends.

407
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,380
If she agrees,

408
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,190
I will treat her well in the future.

409
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,560
Besides...

410
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,490
Since I was young,

411
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,050
I've been dreaming of a fairy.

412
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,230
She has a good temperament,

413
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,710
just like an orchid in the valley.

414
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,810
She's quite similar to Wanqing.

415
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,710
Tell me.

416
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,560
We're destined

417
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,730
to get marry, right?

418
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,930
[Life Ending Pavilion]

419
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,820
Take care.

420
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,450
Take care.

421
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,900
What's wrong?

422
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,830
Are you still drunk?

423
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,220
Nothing.

424
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,450
After walking all day

425
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,380
without flying,

426
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,890
my legs are sore.

427
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,660
It's not easy to be a mortal.

428
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,290
Let me carry you.

429
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,400
No, thanks.

430
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,710
I'm not tired all of a sudden.

431
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,430
Really.

432
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:03,880
Jieli.

433
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,990
What are you doing?

434
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,710
Brother Shangque.

435
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,600
I'm tired too.

436
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,580
Carry me on your back,

437
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,340
Brother Shangque.

438
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,520
Why are you running?

439
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,170
-By the way... -By the way...

440
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:40,930
You go first.

441
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,710
You first.

442
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,500
You said

443
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,020
there's no love between us.

444
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,710
Then why did you say

445
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,760
the Bone Orchid is priceless

446
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,310
in your heart?

447
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,630
Well...

448
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,860
Are you lying to me?

449
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,780
No.

450
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:14,740
Then you lied to me before?

451
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,500
No.

452
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,470
In the future,

453
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,820
if you really attack Shuiyuntian

454
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,670
and kill the Fairies,

455
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,440
you'll be my enemy.

456
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,080
What were you trying to say?

457
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,570
Are you really not angry with me?

458
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,300
Angry?

459
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,850
In the past,

460
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,700
if I had said

461
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,000
or done something against you,

462
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,360
you would have been angry with me

463
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,660
and lost your temper

464
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,810
saying I'd kill you.

465
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,580
Did I treat you like this before?

466
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,800
Yes.

467
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,860
But these days,

468
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,840
I said something you don't like,

469
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,770
managed you,

470
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,780
and even lost the Bone Orchid.

471
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,260
But you haven't been like before.

472
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,920
Are you really not mad at me?

473
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,310
My lord,

474
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,370
what are you thinking?

475
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,640
You've been sitting here without moving a muscle

476
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:09,940
since you came back.

477
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,750
Do you think

478
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,440
I'm abnormal lately?

479
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,220
You've always been wise.

480
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,400
Nothing is abnormal.

481
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,490
Not that.

482
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,450
I've been distracted recently.

483
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,170
I can't concentrate.

484
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,890
Especially for Orchid.

485
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,580
Sometimes I should be angry,

486
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,640
but I can't get angry.

487
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,700
I even wanted her to make me angry.

488
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,890
But she...

489
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,680
She used to be noisy.

490
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,780
But now,

491
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,290
she doesn't want to

492
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,220
spend a second with me.

493
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,830
She became quiet.

494
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,010
But I feel...

495
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,940
Tell me.

496
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,210
What happened to me?

497
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,500
If you say so...

498
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,720
Orchid.

499
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,020
Orchid. Wait for me!

500
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,470
Orchid.

501
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,950
I have the same symptoms recently.

502
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,220
But I don't know

503
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,650
the specific reason.

504
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,830
What?

505
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,430
Xiao Run is Lord Changheng?

506
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,070
# 嘘

507
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,370
Be quite.

508
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,780
He's Lord Changheng you've been talking about?

509
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,810
Currently, Lord Changheng is experiencing hardships.

510
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,900
Do you remember?

511
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,010
You once asked me about the hardship experience of the high immortal.

512
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,060
Yes.

513
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,330
You said there were many dangers in the hardship experience.

514
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,930
If he can't complete the hardship experience,

515
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,440
he will turn into ashes.

516
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,360
That's right.

517
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,920
Don't tell anyone about this.

518
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,390
If Dongfang Qingcang knows it,

519
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,280
Lord Changheng will die.

520
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,840
Don't worry. I won't say anything.

521
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,040
But... Lord Changheng should have been

522
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,420
in Shuiyuntian,

523
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,850
why did he come to the mortal world to experience hardships?

524
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,810
I don't know.

525
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,500
Maybe it's related to the first God of War.

526
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,810
Wait.

527
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,790
Who is the first God of War?

528
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,060
Lady Wanqing we met today is the first God of War.

529
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,580
I guess she is the first God of War

530
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,310
who sacrificed herself for Shuiyuntian.

531
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,080
She is Chidi Woman.

532
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,050
Chidi Woman?

533
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,830
I seem to have heard of this name.

534
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,350
No, no, no.

535
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,700
But she died

536
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,120
30,000 years ago.

537
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,300
Why is she still alive?

538
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,110
I don't know why.

539
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,210
I only know

540
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,850
Dongfang Qingcang wants her primordial spirit.

541
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,630
Why does he want her primordial spirit?

542
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,480
Whatever it is,

543
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,360
it must be

544
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,000
bad for Shuiyuntian.

545
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,600
Jieli. What should we do

546
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,810
if it is true?

547
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,850
Forget it.

548
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,870
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

549
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,090
Tomorrow is the Lantern Festival.

550
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,560
We should have fun.

551
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,650
The Lantern Festival.

552
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,670
On the night of the Lantern Festival, she will meet her Mr. Right.

553
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,400
Xie Wanqing will meet her desitined lover

554
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,250
on the night of the Lantern Festival.

555
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,590
That means she will meet her Mr. Right

556
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,610
tomorrow night.

557
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,250
Mr. Right.

558
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
By the way,

559
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,930
Xiao Run and Xie Wanqing

560
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,700
were engaged to each other.

561
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,130
Today, he proposed to her with priceless gift.

562
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,590
Mr. Right is Lord Chengheng.

563
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,250
[Xishan Spirit-Shattering Abyss]

564
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,640
What time is it in Yunmeng Lake now?

565
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,620
You haven't recovered.

566
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,470
Don't act rashly.

567
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,780
We're almost there.

568
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,980
Lantern Festival night in Yiyou year.

569
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,440
I'm going to accompany her.

570
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,900
This is the Lantern Festival.

571
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,120
You haven't seen it, have you?

572
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,880
-We need to find Chidi Woman as soon as possible. -I haven't seen.

573
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,740
I must see her experience hardships.

574
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,380
Yes.

575
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,070
There's an acrobatic show.

576
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,080
Let's take a look.

577
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,370
Okay.

578
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:38,960
Don't go.

579
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,210
What's so interesting about magic?

580
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,190
Let's go and look at

581
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,030
mortals' magic.

582
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,350
That's right.

583
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,240
We should travel around

584
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,460
in Lu City.

585
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,360
I'll go and explore the way with Shangque.

586
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,880
I'll go too.

587
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:01,520
No.

588
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,990
Why are you going?

589
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,130
You stay here.

590
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,190
It's enough for Shangque and me to explore the way.

591
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,820
Let's go.

592
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,960
Jieli!

593
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,170
Let's go.

594
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:10,550
Jie...

595
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,880
Let's go.

596
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,820
What are you looking at?

597
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,130
Stupid Black Dragon.

598
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,020
You've served him for 30,000 years.

599
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,820
Why are you still so clueless?

600
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,710
What do you mean?

601
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,310
The Lantern Festival is so lively.

602
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,570
It's a beautiful day.

603
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,420
Don't you want Lord

604
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,680
to be alone with Orchid?

605
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:45,740
But...

606
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,010
Why don't

607
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,150
we spend some time together?

608
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,230
I don't want to be alone with you.

609
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,670
We're here to explore the way.

610
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,370
Wait for me.

611
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,580
Why are you leaving?

612
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,720
Wait for me!

613
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,640
Stop!

614
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,350
Young master.

615
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,190
Buy a flower.

616
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,960
Fresh lilies and peonies flowers

617
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,050
are beautiful.

618
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,690
It looks better on the lady's head.

619
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,630
I don't want it, little girl.

620
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,430
Young master.

621
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,310
Buy one.

622
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,410
I wish you two a harmonious union lasting a hundred years.

623
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,500
Only a hundred years?

624
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,380
A hundred years is not enough.

625
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,730
Ten thousand years, one hundred thousand years, a million years.

626
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,040
OK. Have one.

627
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:33,960
Thank you, young master.

628
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,720
Turn around.

629
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,340
Alright.

630
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:17,850
I...

631
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:22,300
I just saw men in the mortal world

632
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,600
putting on flowers for women.

633
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,040
Since you want to be a mortal,

634
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,590
you should look more like a mortal.

635
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,409
Sir,

636
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,690
are you here

637
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,420
just to relax?

638
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,690
Or is there something else?

639
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,360
Nothing.

640
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,840
Are you lying to me?

641
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,550
No.

642
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,400
I'm just here to relax.

643
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,610
Why do you ask this?

644
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,650
Nothing.

645
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,780
I just want to ask.

646
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,530
Since you're so worried,

647
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,380
I promise you

648
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,490
I won't lie to you again.

649
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,860
But you...

650
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,050
don't lie to me again,

651
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:44,410
okay?

652
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:46,930
Okay.

Let's stop here.

673

That's enough.

Take a break in the tea room on the second floor.

675
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,630
No.

676

Let's continue.

677
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,200
I remember clearly that

678
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,850
you have no cash with you now.

679
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,360
If you keep gambling,

-you'll lost your face. -Come on, let's continue.

Cricket,

how many years have you been with me?

685
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,230
I have no parents since childhood.

686
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,820
Since you brought me back,

687
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,550
I've been following you

688
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,020
for at least 11 years.

689
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,450
Over the past decade,

690
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,710
have we eaten and slept together?

691
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,660
Do I treat you as my brother?

692
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,420
Do I treat you well?

693
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,520
Of course.

694
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,130
Good brother.

695
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,490
Lend me your last month's salary.

696
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:58,850
One more time.

697
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,780
It's really the last time.

698
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,290
I'll give you 40% interest.

699
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,440
50% interest.

700
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,550
No, Run.

701
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,220
You...

702
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,550
You're really a slowpoke.

703
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,810
Take it out.

704
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:16,990
I really can't.

705
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,590
If you don't give it to me,

706
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,360
I'll tell my father

707
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,000
you took me to go whoring,

708
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,840
gamble and drink.

709
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,940
Then he'll break your legs.

710
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:26,850
Big or small?

711
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,040
Give it to me.

712
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,520
Give it to me.

713
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:41,940
Four, five, six. Big.

714
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,320
Come on.

715
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,030
Come on. Make way.

716
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,700
One more time.

717
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,120
Big.

718
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,380
Mr. Xiao.

719
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,520
Do you think our gambling house

720
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,910
is for charity?

721
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,220
Take away your money.

722
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,730
Don't force yourself if you can't afford it.

723
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,210
Not enough?

724
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:55,840
I...

725
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,350
spent a lot

726
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,610
in your gambling house.

727
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,210
The past is the past.

728
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,900
Tonight's stakes have been accumulated till now.

729
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,870
Your bet is not enough.

730
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:06,680
Bravo.

731
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:10,750
I bet this.

732
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:11,970
Run.

733
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,140
We can leave if we lose.

734
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,780
Don't bet the jade.

735
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,580
Leave me alone.

736
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,600
Is this jade enough?

737
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,780
Yes.

738
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,750
Come on.

739
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,380
Come on.

740
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,350
Place your bets.

741
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,740
Big or small?

742
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,340
Big, big, big.

743
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,310
One, two, three. Small.

744
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,090
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

745
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:35,570
I'll count to three.

746
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:36,960
Take it and run.

747
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,390
One, two,

748
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:40,780
three.

749
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,550
Catch him!

750
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,560
Don't let him escape!

751
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,950
Don't let him run away.

752
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,200
Let's split up.

753
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,830
See you at home.

754
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:55,650
Catch them.

755
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,290
You've been sitting here all night.

756
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,970
Aren't you going to the lantern market?

757
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,580
It's lively outside.

758
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,640
There are many circuses and lion dancing.

759
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,810
So noisy.

760
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:28,110
It's so boring.

761
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:32,730
How about going back and having a rest.

762
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,030
Don't catch a cold.

763
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,840
I'm waiting.

764
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,540
Who are you waiting for?

765
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,670
I don't know.

766
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:51,210
How long will you wait?

767
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,380
I don't know.

768
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,540
You must be drunk.

769
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,060
Ma'am.

770
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,250
You've enjoyed the moon and the wine.

771
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,590
Go back and rest.

772
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:14,100
I've seen everything in my life.

773
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,440
Precious horses and priceless fur coats.

774
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,890
I've experienced everything in the word.

775
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,680
But I still feel

776
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,460
I'm waiting for something missed.

777
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,050
You're waiting for your Mr. Right

778
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,350
who understands you?

779
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,320
I don't know.

780
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,350
Ma'am,

781
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,440
-Let's go back and rest. -Hush

782
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,460
I've been waiting for the music.

783
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:05,530
