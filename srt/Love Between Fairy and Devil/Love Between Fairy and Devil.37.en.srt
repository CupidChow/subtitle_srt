00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,750
Recently, people have been so bold

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:19,830
to inquire about

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,510
my marriage life with Orchid.

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,430
Fine.

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,910
Since she doesn’t mind,

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,590
I’ll say something.

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:29,830
In a blink of an eye,

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,950
I’ve been married with Orchid for 300 years.

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,910
In the past 300 years,

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,110
we lived in Shuiyuntian for some years,

12
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,630
we lived in Cangyan Sea for some years.

13
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,350
Occasionally, we would sneaked to Lucheng City.

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,260
Speaking of which,

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,630
we were the happiest in Lucheng City.

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,420
No one knows us there.

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,310
We played with grass,

18
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,510
and flew Kongming Lanterns.

19
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,900
We were like the most common couple

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,030
in the world.

21
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,430
With her by my side,

22
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,990
I'm at ease.

23
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,300
Even if there are many obstacles in the future,

24
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,860
as long as we hold each other's hands,

25
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,670
we will not be afraid of anything.

26
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,230
By the way,

27
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,390
it's our wedding anniversary

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,870
in a few days.

29
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,710
I’m thinking about

30
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,789
how to give her a surprise.

31
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,550
All right.

32
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,470
That’s all.

33
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,710
I have to cook flower soup

34
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,150
for Orchid.

35
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,950
Tomorrow morning, when she finishes eating, we'll go sunbathing.

36
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,270
Recently,

37
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,630
Orchid is not getting enough sunlight.

38
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,150
She's getting lazy again.

39
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,990
Wake up.

40
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,030
Just a few more minutes.

41
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,830
It's already dawn.

42
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,710
I need more sleep.
