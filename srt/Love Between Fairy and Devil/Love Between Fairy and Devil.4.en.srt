[Episode 4]

4
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,259
What are you doing?

5
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:54,860
Come with me.

6
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,260
Little sinful immortal.

7
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,580
Chang...

8
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,100
Lord Changheng.

9
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,420
Lord Changheng, don't kill me.

10
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,420
How dare you

11
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,780
escape from prison?

12
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,620
You should be executed according to the law.

13
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,380
Chang... Changheng.

14
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,660
Orchid.

15
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,700
You know little sinful immortal is stay with you,

16
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,940
but you didn't tell me.

17
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,660
And you hid him in the Arbiter Hall.

18
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,820
I... I...

19
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,220
Stop it.

20
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,060
I'm disappointed in you.

21
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:55,820
No.

22
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,860
It's the feeling

23
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,780
of fear.

24
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,900
It's been a long time.

25
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,940
Luckily it was a dream.

26
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,380
Wake up.

27
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,260
Sleep for another 7.5 minutes.

28
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,380
It's already morning.

29
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,140
I want to sleep more.

30
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,940
Get up quickly and fix the Destiny Book.

31
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,010
Leave me alone.

32
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,620
If you feel bored in the morning,

33
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,460
go to the greenhouse

34
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,020
and count all my flowers.

35
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,780
Let me sleep in peace, OK?

36
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,820
I have no time to waste with you.

37
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,580
Now...

38
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,380
One.

39
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,860
Two.

40
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,370
Three.

41
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,500
What's going on?

42
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,540
What magic did this little flower spirit do?

43
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,140
If you feel bored in the morning,

44
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,980
go to the greenhouse

45
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,500
and count all my flowers.

46
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,180
Let me sleep in peace, OK?

47
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,700
Nine.

48
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,970
Ten.

49
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,220
Eleven.

50
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,140
Twelve.

51
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,210
Fourteen.

52
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,340
Fifteen.

53
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,860
Shangque.

54
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:47,940
Shangque.

55
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,340
My Lord, what can I do for you?

56
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,260
Fifteen.

57
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,620
Sixteen.

58
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,740
Seventeen.

59
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,660
My Lord, are you

60
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,860
counting flowers?

61
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,940
What do you mean?

62
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,260
I'm meditating

63
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,580
to recuperate my soul .

64
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,770
You're indeed my Lord.

65
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,100
Your cultivation base has reached the state of perfection,

66
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,740
but you still won't slack off.

67
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,940
With the ruled by you,

68
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,980
the demons revive the Cangyan Sea and unifying the three realms

69
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,820
is just around the corner for the demons.

70
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,940
I remember that the Xilan clan

71
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,860
recorded all the secrets

72
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,860
in the Book of Xilan.

73
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,420
The method of deciphering the seal of Xilan

74
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,340
should be in it.

75
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,780
Do you know where the Book of Xilan is now?

76
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,260
I know.

77
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,450
The Book of Wulan was lost in Yunmeng lake

78
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,540
and founded by our clan.

79
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,180
Now it is placed in the secret cabinet of our clan

80
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,100
under strict control.

81
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,490
For the past 30,000 years, I...

82
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,810
Go get it now.

83
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:52,580
Hurry.

84
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,180
Yes.

85
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,180
Eighty...

86
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,450
Eighty-eight.

87
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,620
My Lord.

88
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,700
The Book of Xilan is here.

89
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,220
My Lord.

90
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,940
I see.

91
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,050
Since the Heart Curse is formed,

92
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,980
I will share the same joy and sorrow,

93
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,340
the same death and injury with the curse-caster.

94
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,090
And our body and mind will be connected

95
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,340
as one

96
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,540
person.

97
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,340
No matter what I do,

98
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,450
she will not be affected.

99
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,020
But what she feels

100
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,700
will be added to me one by one.

101
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,140
If someone wants to kill me,

102
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,299
just kill her.

103
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,419
That means...

104
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,380
she is my biggest

105
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,940
weakness now.

106
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,700
Once the curse-caster starts the command

107
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,100
with the Xilan Holy Seal,

108
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,820
I can't disobey.

109
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,780
How cruel.

110
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,180
Am I going to be held

111
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,420
by this grass

112
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,260
in the future?

113
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,060
My Lord.

114
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,970
My Lord, please calm down.

115
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,820
In my opinion,

116
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,460
In my opinion this Xilan curse is strange and despicable,

117
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,380
but that little flower spirit doesn't seem to know

118
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,540
she is from the Xilan clan.

119
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,100
Even if she accidentally cast the curse,

120
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,580
she doesn't know how to use it.

121
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,780
Forget it.

122
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,740
When she fixes the Destiny Book,

123
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,380
I will be able to find

124
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,740
the reincarnation spirit of the Chidi woman,

125
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,980
unlock 100,000 demon soldiers

126
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,380
and destroy the fairy realm.

127
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,700
It's just a Xilan curse.

128
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,540
I'll be able to solve it by then.

129
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,940
Yes.

130
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,860
I'm so sleepy.

131
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,020
Little sinful immortal.

132
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,450
Why are you here?

133
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,500
8,452.

134
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,540
What 8,452?

135
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,780
Your greenhouse

136
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,900
has 8,452 flowers.

137
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:16,740
You...

138
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,900
Did you really count the flowers in the greenhouse?

139
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,780
Yes.

140
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,660
Is it because of what I said?

141
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,580
I just say it casually.

142
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,180
How could you take it seriously?

143
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,380
Why are you so naive?

144
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,100
Remember,

145
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,900
every word you say

146
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,100
is very important to me.

147
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,860
You can't talk like that in the future.

148
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,020
Well, I'm just

149
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,930
an ordinary grass.

150
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,300
No one

151
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,780
takes my words seriously.

152
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,940
Since my master went travelling,

153
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,140
no one cared about me.

154
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,860
So you don't have to...

155
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,660
Forget it.

156
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,660
Good.

157
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,020
Go and fix Destiny Book.

158
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,660
Fix Destiny Book?

159
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,220
What does it matter to him

160
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,820
whether I fix Destiny Book or not?

161
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,540
He's not my master.

162
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,700
Why does he care about me?

163
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,100
He must want to make a conversation.

164
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
It's rare to have some free time these days. I won't do it.

165
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,700
I'm hungry. I'm going to have breakfast.

166
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,020
Breakfast?

167
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,420
Do you still know to eat breakfast?

168
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,300
Do you know it's 9 o'clock now?

169
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,380
You don't do anything to practice

170
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,460
and don't do the right thing.

171
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,700
Waking up so late everyday,

172
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,140
do you still want to pass the immortal examination?

173
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,340
What do you know?

174
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,330
If you don't sleep well, how can you be energetic?

175
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,100
Sleeping is the first priority for those who practice.

176
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,940
In the three realms,

177
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,540
I have never seen

178
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,540
a lazy woman like you.

179
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,180
You...

180
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,500
See? See?

181
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,220
Right?

182
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,060
How can you have strength if you don't eat enough?

183
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,780
Eating is the first priority for people who practice.

184
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,850
Is it good?

185
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,660
The food outside

186
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,500
is better than the food inside.

187
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,420
It is better

188
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,940
to have freedom in the right way.

189
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,980
Am I right?

190
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,540
By the way,

191
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,180
we've known each other for so long.

192
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,660
I still don't know who you are

193
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,820
and what your name is.

194
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,140
My name.

195
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,450
Dongfang...

196
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,380
Qing...

197
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,650
Did I catch a cold in Haishi City yesterday?

198
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,340
What did you say your name was?

199
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,780
Dongfang Qiang.

200
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,460
Don't be upset

201
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,900
if I say it.

202
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,900
The surname of Dongfang is the same as

203
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,300
the surname of the dead big devil Dongfang Qingcang.

204
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,580
It's not good.

205
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,140
The dead Dongfang Qingcang?

206
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,740
Yes.

207
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,820
Don't you know?

208
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,860
You don't even know the Battle with Demons,

209
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,340
Haven't you ever read books?

210
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,450
It is important to fix the Destiny Book.

211
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,740
Forget it.

212
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,940
Don't care about this lazy and ignorant little flower spirit.

213
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,300
Qiang, I'm not talking nonsense.

214
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,620
Dongfang Qingcang

215
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,060
is really evil.

216
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,700
Our fairy realm suffered a lot

217
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,180
from him back then.

218
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,300
So, the words "Dongfang"

219
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,740
is very unlucky and ominous

220
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,540
in the entire Yujing.

221
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,540
No, in the entire Shuiyuntian.

222
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,260
Really?

223
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,020
Don't be sad.

224
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,260
The surname is given by your parents.

225
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,700
You can't choose.

226
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,860
You're already very lucky.

227
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,660
At least you have a surname.

228
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,180
I'm an orchid.

229
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,500
I have no parents

230
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,100
and no name.

231
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,300
Don't you have a name?

232
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,220
Everyone calls me orchid.

233
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,780
Although you are unlucky

234
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,500
to have the same surname as that devil,

235
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,980
you look much prettier than him.

236
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,900
You little flower spirit.

237
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,620
You're short-sighted

238
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,340
and only a thousand years old.

239
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,500
Have you really met the strongest in the three realms,

240
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,180
the great devil Dongfang Qingcang?

241
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,580
I've never seen him.

242
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,580
But it's written in the book.

243
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,290
That Dongfang Qingcang

244
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,020
has green face and fangs.

245
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,540
His long hair drags the floor,

246
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,820
and his hair is full of lice.

247
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,260
I heard that he did not brush his teeth

248
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,580
and take a bath for thousands of years.

249
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,740
It's so disgusting

250
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,980
to spit out bad breath.

251
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,300
It's my fault.

252
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,460
I shouldn't talk about these disgusting things

253
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,340
while you're eating.

254
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,410
What I want to say is,

255
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,180
in short,

256
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,100
you are much better than him.

257
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,740
Do I have to thank you?

258
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,660
No, no.

259
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,820
If you really remember my kindness,

260
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,220
go back to

261
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,260
where you should go.

262
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,460
It's better than anything.

263
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,700
Since you know the Moon Supreme so well,

264
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,700
do you know what he likes to eat?

265
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,980
What Dongfang Qingcang likes to eat most

266
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,500
is a chubby little fairy with thin skin and tender meat

267
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,380
like you.

268
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,580
The little fairy he ate

269
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,540
were either 10,000 or 8,000.

270
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,660
Boiled,

271
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,540
roasted,

272
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,140
fried, steamed,

273
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,060
and

274
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,970
eaten row.

275
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,820
Thirty thousand years ago,

276
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,860
the Battle with Demons was extremely fierce.

277
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,700
The former God of War, Chidi woman,

278
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,410
was brave and unparalleled,

279
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,300
trying her best

280
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,300
to seal 100,000 demon soldiers with death.

281
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,420
Inspired by the heroic and fearless spirit

282
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,100
of the God of War,

283
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,420
fight against the enemy bravely.

284
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,980
They beat Dongfang Qingcang to the ground

285
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,300
with a blue nose and a swollen face,

286
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,540
kneeling and begging for mercy.

287
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:10,660
Enough!

288
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,940
What are you doing, Daqiang?

289
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,660
With a blue nose and a swollen face,

290
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,579
kneeling and begging for mercy.

291
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,530
Is this what the history books of Shuiyuntian write?

292
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,780
Are you struggling with this?

293
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,220
Of course, not that much in the book.

294
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,700
Distorting the historical facts,

295
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,180
no wonder you can't even

296
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,100
pass a small immortal examination.

297
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,500
What do you know?

298
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,180
There is only a little bit of boring stuff

299
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,540
in the history books.

300
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,060
If I want to pass the immortal examination,

301
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,620
I have to use these rhetorical devices

302
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,100
to describe the intense situation vividly

303
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,730
at that time.

304
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,980
Did you

305
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,260
make up all these details?

306
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,340
Yes.

307
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,580
I made it up.

308
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,100
How is it?

309
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,260
Is it vivid?

310
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,980
Why does a little grass

311
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,210
watch these fighting things all day long?

312
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,100
Read another paragraph.

313
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,060
Yes.

314
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,380
Soon, the festival is coming.

315
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,740
I'll listen to you.

316
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,140
Change to a book without fighting things.

317
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,740
This festival is to celebrate the war between the two races

318
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,580
and the victory of the immortal race.

319
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,580
Shuiyuntian will celebrate

320
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,860
the victory of the Battle,

321
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,420
the festival of the devil's execution on this day.

322
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,420
What are you doing?

323
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,020
You scared me.

324
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,980
Daqiang.

325
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,820
you don't have to work so hard to make holiday pastries,

326
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,580
Holiday

327
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,380
pastries?

328
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,620
Yes.

329
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,060
It's okay if you don't know how to make it.

330
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,020
Let me teach you.

331
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,020
Take your time.

332
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,820
Look.

333
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,580
Put the glutinous rice like this

334
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,100
and pound it hard with your hands.

335
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,220
Put the glutinous rice like this

336
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,340
and pound it hard like a pile of mud.

337
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,740
Then we can make a pastry later.

338
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,500
Look.

339
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,450
Look, look.

340
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,780
See?

341
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,020
Be careful.

342
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,300
Be careful.

343
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,380
It's hot.

344
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,940
Why is it so hot?

345
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,740
Don't grab it with your hands anymore.

346
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,460
You don't even know how to do it.

347
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,340
So stupid.

348
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,340
What do you know?

349
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,340
The next step is the important one.

350
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,260
It's really looks like.

351
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,060
Like what?

352
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,820
Dongfang Qingcang.

353
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,980
Look, he has a green face and fangs,

354
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,420
showing his teeth and claws.

355
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,340
So funny.

356
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:50,980
Yes.

357
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,660
This

358
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,340
is the Shuofeng sword

359
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,820
of the God of War, Chidi woman.

360
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,740
Thrust it in against the Dongfang Qingcang's here.

361
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,660
Then stir and stir.

362
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,860
Stop!

363
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,250
I mean

364
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,500
you are wrong.

365
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,900
The Chidi woman killed herself with Shuofeng Sword.

366
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,140
You don't have to be so rude.

367
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,020
Isn't it enough that

368
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,140
the meaning and plot are almost the same?

369
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,420
How can it be almost the same?

370
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,180
Chidi woman has never

371
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,540
really defeated Dongfang Qingcang.

372
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,900
Fine.

373
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,060
Whatever you say.

374
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,420
By the way,

375
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,140
didn't you say

376
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,340
you don't know what the Battle between the two races is?

377
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:54,940
How do you know

378
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,940
these trivial details?

379
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,300
These are not trivial details.

380
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,140
Forget it.

381
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,250
Just now, I've read all the books you put there

382
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,620
when you went to

383
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,570
get your stuff.

384
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,420
And the torn portrait

385
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,650
in the book.

386
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,300
Who is that?

387
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:27,860
Why are you panicking?

388
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,940
I'm not.

389
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,250
I...

390
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,460
You... I...

391
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,820
I feel so hot.

392
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,060
By the way,

393
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,380
I haven't had time

394
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,100
to dry my master's liquor yet.

395
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,220
I have to go drying liquor.

396
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,180
Little flower spirit,

397
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,260
How much longer do you want to

398
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,420
dilly-dally about fixing the Destiny Book?

399
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,890
My Lord, are you alright?

400
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,570
I've wasted the whole day

401
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,250
with little flower spirit.

402
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,820
Fixing the Destiny Book was postponed to tomorrow.

403
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,540
My Lord, please calm down.

404
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,900
Now the Destiny Book of Chidi woman's soul

405
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,980
is in your hands.

406
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,780
Now it's a easy thing.

407
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,690
There is no need to rush.

408
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,440
The little flower spirit doesn't know the power of the Xilan Curse,

409
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,460
but she also played me like a fool.

410
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,020
If she knows,

411
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,020
I will become her maid.

412
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,290
In the three realms,

413
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,020
I don't believe

414
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,130
there is no way to break it.

415
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,460
Shangque.

416
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:37,900
Yes.

417
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,260
Go get the heart-hidden hairpin.

418
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,740
You must be careful

419
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,020
and not to be noticed.

420
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,460
I will try my best to do it.

421
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,540
Once I break the curse,

422
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,060
I will kill this little flower spirit.

423
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:57,540
Wait.

424
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,540
Prepare some water. I want to take a bath.

425
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,620
Yes.

426
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,170
The Arbiter Hall

427
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,580
has not been so lively for a long time.

428
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,580
Although Daqiang

429
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,250
always loses his temper

430
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,180
and is stupid.

431
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,220
And he always talk about himself.

432
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,980
But I don't think he is bad.

433
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,020
Although his power is stronger than me,

434
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,340
he should be just like that.

435
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,020
He probably did not make a big mistake.

436
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,460
It's a pity that he has been in the Haotian Tower

437
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,020
for so long.

438
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,020
Now he can

439
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,820
live a day of freedom.

440
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,060
You've been resting for so long.

441
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,380
Why can't you fix it?

442
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,860
Why are you staring at me?

443
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,940
If you stare at me like this,

444
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,140
how can I focus?

445
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,460
I don't watch you. Just fix it.

446
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,260
Are you alright?

447
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,820
I'm fine.

448
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,730
I'm good at fixing the Destiny Book.

449
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,900
But this Destiny Book is too bad.

450
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,500
I've never fixed such a broken Destiny Book.

451
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,780
It's a bit hard.

452
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:42,860
Hello?

453
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,420
My Lord,

454
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,570
the little flower spirit's power was badly consumed.

455
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,860
I think it is because when she was in Haotian Tower,

456
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,130
she almost touched the seal

457
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,100
and consumed her power.

458
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,660
Now,

459
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,620
we are forcing her to fix the Destiny Book.

460
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,660
Then she fainted.

461
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,700
With her current condition,

462
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,740
when will she be able to fix it?

463
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,820
My Lord.

464
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,700
The Destiny Book is made of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

465
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,210
It contains the karma of everything.

466
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,140
If we want to fix it, we need...

467
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,820
-What do you want to say? -First...

468
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,340
Before she fully recovered,

469
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,260
I am afraid there is no way to fix it.

470
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,060
When will she fully recover?

471
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,140
One day?

472
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,220
Two days?

473
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,300
Do you want me

474
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,180
to wait for ten days and a half months?

475
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,340
My Lord,

476
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,460
I know a little about Chinese medicine.

477
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,250
The little flower spirit is from Xilan clan.

478
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,380
She must have a special physique.

479
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,420
All I know is that she needs to have a good rest now.

480
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,220
As for when she will fully recover,

481
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,580
I don't know.

482
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,300
Not to mention ten days and a half months,

483
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,180
it is possible

484
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,460
for three

485
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,740
or five years

486
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,820
and a hundred years.

487
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,970
Lord,

488
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,380
even if you have great power,

489
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,260
you can't keep spending it like this.

490
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,170
I know what to do.

491
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,500
Go back to your work.

492
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,170
You don't have to stay with me.

493
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,060
Lord.

494
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,260
I don't understand.

495
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,180
Who is this Immortal Pill made for?

496
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,620
What medicine

497
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,220
is worth all your effort?

498
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,250
What he guards

499
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,180
but his sincerity.

500
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,780
Sincerity?

501
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,540
A child of several thousand years old

502
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,180
should not inquire about things that should not be.

503
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,490
Lord,

504
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,340
you can't stay here forever.

505
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,300
How about I guard it for you?

506
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,140
Don't worry.

507
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,740
I will never ruin your business.

508
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,060
Qingchuan,

509
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,450
I finally

510
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,930
come back to the fairy realm.

511
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,980
Why don't we find a place to have some tea?

512
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,940
Tell me.

513
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,940
What interesting things

514
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,660
have been happening in Yujing recently?

515
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,060
But...

516
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,180
Let's go.

517
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,740
Lord Ronghao, let go of me!

518
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,100
I want to stay with my lord.

519
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,790

00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:10,980
You're awake.

521
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,660
Don't get up.

522
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,940
You're badly injured.

523
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,580
You can't move.

524
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,620
Unfortunately, my power is weak.

525
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,180
I can only help you stop the bleeding first.

526
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,300
Thank you, fairy.

527
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,340
Sorry to bother you.

528
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,340
Actually, I'm not a fairy.

529
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,060
I just transformed into a fairy.

530
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,700
I don't even have a name.

531
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,970
Do you have a name?

532
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,420
Don't you know me?

533
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,340
I don't know anyone

534
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,060
except my master.

535
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,700
I don't have any friends.

536
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,580
Lord Changheng.

537
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,820
I will also take the immortal examination.

538
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,940
I will enter the Fountain Palace.

539
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,340
My Lord, you can't

540
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,130
move karma without permission and disturb heaven's rules.

541
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,540
You will have the possibility of losing your soul.

542
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,740
Disturb heaven's rules?

543
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,050
I have disturbed a lot of heaven's rules.

544
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,370
My Lord.

545
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,300
Only Arbiter can pry into the secret of the Destiny Book.

546
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,900
It's hard to find her now.

547
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,060
The success and failure

548
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,300
still depends on that disciple of Arbiter,

549
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,290
the little flower spirit.

550
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,450
I need to find a way to break

551
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,290
it.

552
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,540
and can not stay in Shuiyuntian for long.

553
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,060
I'm afraid

554
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,700
you can only

555
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,900
look after her by yourself.

556
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,220
Forget it.

557
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,250
It's easy

558
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,060
to raise a grass.

559
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,300
Xilan Grass

560
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,540
was born in the secret realm of Xilan

561
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,260
It likes warmth and avoids severe cold.

562
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,380
Likes a place with partial shade,

563
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,340
and avoids sun exposure.

564
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,660
And it likes the first rays of sunshine

565
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,100
from the east in the morning,

566
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,700
except for the Vernal equinox, Tomb-Sweeping Day and during Grain Rain,

567
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,610
you can't move its roots.

568
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,180
If it is dry and lacks water,

569
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,860
the roots will shrink and dry out

570
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,620
and the leaves will be burnt and curled.

571
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,340
Then it grows and develops badly.

572
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,780
The spiritual wisdom is hard to open.

573
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,140
Xilan holy grass is pure and pure.

574
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,500
If a soul is born,

575
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,940
it needs to be watered with rootless water.

576
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,260
The best time of the day is from 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.

577
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,300
Avoid over-watering

578
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,620
to prevent waterlogging and rotten roots and leaves.

579
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,020
What is rootless water?

580
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:01,700
Saliva,

581
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:02,940

582

tears?

583
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,699
The rootless water

584
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,500
is born in the morning dew.

585
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,380
It's morning dew.

586
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,540
Ridiculous.

587
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:24,179
Do I have to pick it up for her drop by drop?

588
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,860
Impossible.

But the Destiny Book...

591

I would have killed her long ago.
