4
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,940
I'll hang those.

5
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,210
I'll put it here.

6
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,660
Take it slowly.

7
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,340
I'm coming.

8
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,370
Okay. Go over there.

9
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,820
Take this.

10
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,980
Tighten it up.

11
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,310
Here.

12
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,590
Let me do it for you.

13
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,410
Look what I got.

14
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,190
Don't wear it.

15
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,430
You're just a young girl.

16
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,550
Those flowers are not for anyone.

17
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,900
Why not?

18
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,710
Is there something special about them?

19
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,550
This is Frost Salt Flower.

20
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,710
In our tribe,

21
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,620
only widowed women wear it.

22
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,460
So you are all...

23
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,060
All these years,

24
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,980
those kings are always fighting each other,

25
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,330
all men went to the battlefield.

26
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,820
Every time when an obituary comes,

27
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,740
there will be one more woman wearing the flower.

28
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,620
Now,

29
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,050
almost every woman in our tribe is wearing them.

30
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,780
I'm so sorry

31
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,060
for mentioning your sad story.

32
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,820
It doesn't matter.

33
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,500
A few years ago,

34
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,700
I cried day and night.

35
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,140
But what's the use of crying?

36
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,220
You lost your husband.

37
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,290
But you have to live.

38
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,300
Here, it's for you.

39
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,540
Flowers can be revived,

40
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,260
but not humans.

41
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,260
I really hope their families come back home too.

42
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,420
Stop running or you'll fall again!

43
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:33,540
My Lord. ## 尊上(My Lord,/My Lord.)

44
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,220
My Lord. ## 尊上(My Lord,/My Lord.)

45
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,500
My Lord. ## 尊上(My Lord,/My Lord.)

46
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,060
My Lord.

47
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,140
My Lord.

48
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,290
My Lord.

49
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,540
My Lord.

50
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,850
Why don't you bow to me?

51
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,940
I have a few questions for you, my Lord.

52
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,130
I will bow to you,

53
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,300
after I got my answers.

54
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,220
Granny Tie.

55
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,060
If you offend the Lord,

56
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,820
our whole tribe will die.

57
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,580
Ask away.

58
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,140
My Lord, ## 尊上(My Lord,/My Lord.)

59
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,420
where have you been in the past 30,000 years?

60
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,860
The Cangyan Sea has become a wasteland.

61
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,060
My people has suffered so much.

62
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,580
Everyone was displaced

63
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,860
and has lost their family.

64
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,659
My Lord. ## 尊上(My Lord,/My Lord.)

65
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,580
Where have you been all the time without us?

66
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,060
My Lord, please have mercy. ## 尊上饶命(Please spare her life./My Lord, please have mercy./Please spare my life.)

67
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,620
My mother-in-law is just old and confused.

68
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,620
She's talking nonsense.

69
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,460
We'll take her back now.

70
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,760
-Please have mercy!
-We'll drag her out now.

71
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,580
Please spare her life. ## 尊上饶命(Please spare her life./My Lord, please have mercy./Please spare my life.)

72
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,300
Please spare her life. ## 尊上饶命(Please spare her life./My Lord, please have mercy./Please spare my life.)

73
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,659
Have mercy!

74
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,420
Let her finish.

75
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,650
For so many days and nights

76
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,780
we've been waiting for you to come back

77
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,490
and save us from this agony.

78
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,940
And you didn't show up.

79
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,540
Now,

80
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,220
my husband and my son

81
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,340
both died on the battlefield.

82
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,540
But you returned.

83
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,580
My Lord, ## 尊上(My Lord,/My Lord.)

84
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,220
I've seen you a long time ago.

85
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,460
When you were little ## 你小的时候(when you were little,/When you were little)

86
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,700
you were about this tall.

87
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,659
Your father brought you here to hunt

88
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,610
and stayed overnight in our tribe.

89
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,940
My grandson is the same age as you.

90
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,420
He hunted rabbits with you.

91
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,740
Then he joined the army

92
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,140
and went to war with you.

93
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,820
and was sealed in the Xuanxu Realm for 30,000 years.

94
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,740
Now you came back.

95
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,220
But he didn't.

96
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,300
My Lord, look.

97
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,740
She is my daughter-in-law.

98
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,860
My son is gone forever.

99
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,460
But her son can come back.

100
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,060
I know I offended you, my lord.

101
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,460
And I will die for sure.

102
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,860
I'm old.

103
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:33,770
I've lived long enough.

104
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,940
But even if I die today,

105
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,420
you have to promise me

106
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,460
that you will bring them back

107
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,260
just like the way you took them away.

108
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,020
Please spare her life. ## 尊上饶命(Please spare her life./My Lord, please have mercy./Please spare my life.)

109
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,100
Please spare her life. ## 尊上饶命(Please spare her life./My Lord, please have mercy./Please spare my life.)

110
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,659
Please spare her life. ## 尊上饶命(Please spare her life./My Lord, please have mercy./Please spare my life.)

111
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,980
Please spare her life. ## 尊上饶命(Please spare her life./My Lord, please have mercy./Please spare my life.)

112

Please spare her life. ## 尊上饶命(Please spare her life./My Lord, please have mercy./Please spare my life.)

113
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,220
Please spare her life. ## 尊上饶命(Please spare her life./My Lord, please have mercy./Please spare my life.)

114
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,500
Please spare her life. ## 尊上饶命(Please spare her life./My Lord, please have mercy./Please spare my life.)

115
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,740
Please spare her life. ## 尊上饶命(Please spare her life./My Lord, please have mercy./Please spare my life.)

116
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,060
Why didn't you explain back then?

117
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,260
You didn't mean to abandon them.

118
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,620
And you work so hard for the whole Moon Tribe.

119
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,820
You've never slacked off.

120
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,060
Why?

121
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,820
No reason.

122
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,020
Can't you tell me?

123
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,650
Why should I tell you?

124
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,980
Didn't you say

125
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,900
that people should have secrets.

126
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,420
But this is different.

127
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,490
Actually, I envy you.

128
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,460
The old lady said that

129
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,420
when you were little, ## 你小的时候(when you were little,/When you were little)

130
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,940
your father would take you hunting and camping.

131
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,580
While I'm just a small grass

132
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,980
with no parents.

133
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,140
I never knew what it's like

134
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,580
to have a parent.

135
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,180
The great war is coming.

136
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,180
And there's still no way

137
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,860
to counter the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow of the Fairies

138
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:56,820
Yes.

139
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,940
We're here today to discuss

140
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,460
how to deal with it.

141
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,340
My Lord, ## 尊上(My Lord,/My Lord.)

142
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,180
I have an idea.

143
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,100
Please forgive me, my Lord. ## 尊上恕罪(Please forgive me, my Lord./Please forgive me.)

144
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,420
Please forgive me. ## 尊上恕罪(Please forgive me, my Lord./Please forgive me.)

145
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,260
Young Master, ## 少尊(Young Master,/Young Master.)

146
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,700
why are you so immature?

147
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,820
If you disturb the Lord's military affairs,

148
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,490
you will be branded and lose your tongue.

149
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,330
My Lord, ## 尊上(My Lord,/My Lord.)

150
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,620
please spare Young Master this time.

151
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,470
[The Old Moon Supreme]

152
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:50,660
Come on.

153
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:19,900
What are you looking at?

154
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,300
I'm looking at your expression.

155
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,980
This is the first time

156
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,780
I've seen you like this.

157
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,900
What are you thinking?

158
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,140
Nothing.

159
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,180
You were saying?

160
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,700
I was saying...

161
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,380
I envy you.

162
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,180
What's there to envy?

163
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,940
In my opinion,

164
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,100
it's better to be like you,

165
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,380
born in the nature, without any attachment.

166
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,180
You don't understand, Wooden Head.

167
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,820
It's really lonely to be like this.

168
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,180
It's better to have attachments.

169
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,340
I told you already

170
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,260
attachment of love will only be a burden.

171
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,780
Why are you laughing?

172
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,340
You're saying things you didn't mean.

173
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,380
What do you mean?

174
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,650
When I first arrived at Cangyan Sea,

175
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,260
everyone said that

176
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,780
the Moon Supreme's power is sovereign.

177
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,100
Anyone who offended you for any reason,

178
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,820
will die.

179
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,260
But back then,

180
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,420
that old lady scolded you in your face like that.

181
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,900
Yet you didn't punish her.

182
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,980
I think

183
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,930
is because you were touched

184
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,860
by her love and attachments to her families.

185
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,900
Right?

186
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,540
Nonsense.

187
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,900
She is old and dying.

188
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,820
I just couldn't bear it.

189
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,460
You couldn't bear it?

190
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,700
That stand for sympathy and compassion in seven feelings.

191
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,100
But you've removed all seven feelings.

192
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,060
How could it be?

193
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,220
Could it be...

194
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:15,650
[Dongfang Qingcang's Sea of Heart]

195
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,260
It really sprouted?

196
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,740
Last time I was here,

197
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,020
it was a withered tree.

198
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,420
I can't believe it really sprouted.

199
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:25,970
Look.

200
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:26,900
I told you.

201
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,820
I could cure your love tree.

202
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,020
Father! ## 父尊(Father./Father!)

203
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,060
Father! ## 父尊(Father./Father!)

204
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,300
Father. ## 父尊(Father./Father!)

205
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,460
You promised to play football with me today.

206
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,140
From now on,

207
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,380
you will not touch it ever again.

208
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,970
Throw away the wooden sword.

209
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,140
You will use this to practice from now on.

210
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,100
Now!

211
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,060
After returning from Memory Loss River for days,

212
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,580
I have this nightmare every night.

213
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,420
Is my recovery of seven feelings

214
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,180
really speeding up?

215
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,180
Wooden Head! Wooden Head!

216
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,820
I heard that you didn't sleep well these days.

217
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,740
So I prepared this just for you.

218
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,460
Smell it. Does it smell good?

219
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,740
This is orchid.

220
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,380
But this is not any ordinary orchid.

221
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,500
I made it with my primordial spirit.

222
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,260
It will guarantee

223
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,500
that you'll sleep till dawn.

224
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:26,970
Take it away.

225
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,740
But your Love Tree has just recovered.

226
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,580
How dare you mention it to me?

227
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,090
I endured the suffering in Hell

228
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,500
so that I can remove my feelings.

229
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,140
Because of you,

230
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,580
my feelings returned nowadays.

231
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,940
Isn't my suffering all in vain?

232
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,060
I have to be ruthless

233
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,100
to kill all over the world and lead the Moon Tribe.

234
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,420
What do you want me to do with my responsibilities?

235
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,540
I just

236
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,940
don't want to see you in pain.

237
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,140
I was never in pain.

238
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,140
It's all because of you.

239
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,300
Ever since you showed up,

240
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,859
my suffering began.

241
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,819
Why must you act on your own and meddle with me?

242
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,240
Don't let me see your face again.

243
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,380
So this is the legendary Pavilion of Spiritual Treasures.

244
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,490
You let me in so easily?

245
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,620
This is indeed the Moon Supreme's treasure.

246
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,140
The silk from Yunmeng lake.

247
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,420
The Dragon Pearl from the Memory Loss River.

248
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,100
The fairy jade from Shuiyuntian.

249
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,220
I'm rich!

250
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,100
I can't believe I will live to see this day.

251
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,940
Who's there? Halt!

252
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,650
Don't you know me?

253
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,740
You don't even know me?

254
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,220
How can you work in the palace?

255
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,580
Do you at least know the Orchid Fairy?

256
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,500
Of course.

257
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,900
She's a distinguished guest of our Silent Moon Palace.

258
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,180
Our Lord's favorite.

259
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,060
I am Fairy Orchid's sworn sister.

260
00:18:59,180 --> 00:18:59,540
Step aside.

261
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,460
Cut the crap.

262
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,780
I told you,

263
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,060
I'm tired of these dishes,

264
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,970
you will not bring these to me again.

265
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,620
My Lord, please calm down.

266
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,620
The old chef must have forgotten

267
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,220
to tell that to the new chef,

268
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,460
so they accidentally presented them.

269
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,380
The chef has changed.

270
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,940
Have you forgotten?

271
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,100
A few days ago, you ordered to let a group of people

272
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,780
out of the palace to reunite with their family.

273
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,060
The old chef was also among them.

274
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,060
You may leave.

275
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,500
Yes.

276
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,100
My Lord, ## 尊上(My Lord,/My Lord.)

277
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,340
what worries you lately?

278
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,490
My seven feelings are recovering.

279
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,460
What...

280
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,340
Kneel!

281
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,260
My Lord,

282
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,290
we were searching the Pavilion of Spiritual Treasures

283
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,500
and we've found a thief.

284
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,380
These are the treasures she's stolen.

285
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,580
She claims that she is the sworn sister of Fairy Orchid.

286
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,780
I dare not act rashly.

287
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,060
I'm here to report to you, my Lord.

288
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,500
It's you again.

289
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,820
I haven't settled with you

290
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,020
for cajoling Orchid into running away.

291
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,860
Now you're casting your eyes on the Pavilion.

292
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,780
My Lord, I'm innocent.

293
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,860
The Bone Orchid was lent to me by Fairy Orchid.

294
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,260
I gave it back to her ages ago.

295
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,380
I just arrived today and didn't know my way around.

296
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,570
I got into the Pavilion by accident

297
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,980
and saw some rare things.

298
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,100
So I thought I'd take some to amuse Fairy Orchid.

299
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:23,940
My Lord. ## 尊上(My Lord,/My Lord.)

300
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,180
Are you sure she likes these?

301
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,970
O-Of course.

302
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,340
Silk and jade and such.

303
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,740
Those are the best things to make a girl happy.

304
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,820
Since she likes it,

305
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,820
give them to her.

306
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,370
Thank you, my Lord.

307
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,740
Also,

308
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,580
if she wants anything else,

309
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,660
tell her to take as many as she likes.

310
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,460
Yes.

311
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:57,940
Wait.

312
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,460
Did you cry?

313
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,140
Father asked me to use the iron sword.

314
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,940
I can't carry it.

315
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,740
My hands are rubbed raw.

316
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,340
Carrying an iron sword

317
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,740
means you grew up,

318
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,020
and you've become a Iron Blood Warrior of the Moon Tribe.

319
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,220
It's a good thing.

320
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,970
Don't cry.

321
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,860
Young Master. ## 少尊(Young Master,/Young Master.)

322
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,980
Look what it is.

323
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,260
You're a fast learner.

324
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,460
If you are not to be the Moon Supreme

325
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,700
you'd have become a top carpenter in the future.

326
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,700
Really?

327
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,580
But father said

328
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,660
I can only be the Moon Supreme in the future.

329
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,860
I have to fight back the Shuiyuntian

330
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,020
and kill many people.

331
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,180
You don't want to be the Moon Supreme?

332
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:23,660
I do.

333
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,680
I want to revive the Cangyan Sea

334
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,980
and lead the Moon Tribe to live a good life.

335
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,180
I want to fulfill Father's expectations

336
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,290
and make father proud of me.

337
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,130
That's it.

338
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,200
No matter you're a Moon Supreme

339
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,820
or a carpenter,

340
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,740
you have to be a strong person.

341
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,090
Do you know who this statue is?

342
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,700
This is the founder of our Moon Tribe,

343
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,020
the first Moon Supreme,

344
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,620
Yannv.

345
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,460
She led our ancestors

346
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,660
to cross Memory Loss River

347
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,300
and put down roots in the Cangyan Sea.

348
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,780
And we prosper ever since.

349
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,140
Look.

350
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,140
She has many scars.

351
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,420
Every one of them is a token of glory.

352
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,860
You will be a Moon Supreme

353
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,940
just like her in the future

354
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,700
and lead our tribe back to glory.

355
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,700
And this, will be your first scar.

356
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,460
My Lord, please calm down.

357
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,710
I will take this thief right away and interrogate her.

358
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,580
Let's go.

359
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,260
No need.

360
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,820
Kill her on the spot.

361
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,940
Please spare my life. ## 尊上饶命(Please spare her life./My Lord, please have mercy./Please spare my life.)

362
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,900
I was negligent.

363
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,060
Punish me if you want.

364
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,100
Are you disobeying my order?

365
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,260
My Lord. ## 尊上(My Lord,/My Lord.)

366
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,100
Please, Moon Supreme.

367
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,250
Don't kill Jieli.

368
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,500
Step aside.

369
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,260
Moon Supreme Lord, ## 月尊大人(Moon Supreme Lord/Moon Supreme Lord,)

370
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,540
listen to me.

371
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,620
It was my idea to escape last time.

372
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,020
I also asked her

373
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,700
to steal from the Pavilion.

374
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,860
It's all my fault.

375
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,540
Don't...

376
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,460
Don't blame her.

377
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,300
Step aside.

378
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,860
She's my one true friend.

379
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,180
I can't watch her die.

380
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:11,980
Besides,

381
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,260
I've already made you unhappy.

382
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,020
You don't want to see me anymore.

383
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,820
If you want to kill, then kill me.

384
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,860
My Lord.

385
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,330
My Lord. ## 尊上(My Lord,/My Lord.)

386
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,420
My Lord. ## 尊上(My Lord,/My Lord.)

387
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,390
His Highness Xunfeng is shouting in the prison.

388
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,180
He said that

389
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,050
he wanted to pay respects to the late Moon Supreme.

390
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,690
I'm here to ask you.

391
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,620
Burn the wood sculpture.

392
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,340
Yes.

393
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,420
Jieli.

394
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,820
Jieli.

395
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,740
Are you alright?

396
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,020
You...

397
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,860
Why are you looking at me like this?

398
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,940
It was your idea

399
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,860
to steal this time.

400
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,820
Don't blame me for getting you in trouble.

401
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,100
I won't admit it.

402
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,380
Little Orchid. ## 小兰花(Little Orchid./Orchid.)

403
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,140
Although I've lived thousands of years,

404
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,610
and met many people,

405
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,660
but you are the number one fool I know

406
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,540
in the Three Realms.

407
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,700
How dare you pay respects to Father

408
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,820
after doing something so stupid?

409
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,940
I want to kill you to avenge Father.

410
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,540
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

411
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,540
You want to kill me?

412
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,460
It's not a big deal.

413
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,460
I can forgive you.

414
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,530
But you colluded with the Lord of Haishi City

415
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,500
and betrayed your people.

416
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,820
You refined evil spirit with their pain and hatred

417
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,580
and caused countless clansmen

418
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,780
lost their primordial spirits

419
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,820
and leave them restless.

420
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,380
This is unforgivable.

421
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,940
Nonsense!

422
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,980
Winner takes all.

423
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,580
If I lose, just kill me.

424
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,860
Why bother accusing me of all the charges?

425
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,220
You are my brother.

426
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,970
You should know better than anyone

427
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,380
whether I need a charge

428
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,740
to kill someone.

429
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,180
He never told me

430
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,500
where the evil spirit came from.

431
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,180
So you are not the mastermind behind all this?

432
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,180
Although I hate your guts,

433
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,100
I am also Father's son.

434
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,140
They are my people, too.

435
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,230
Why would I do something that

436
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,100
will hurt my people?

437
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,020
You led the wolf in and let others manipulate you.

438
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,740
How foolish!

439
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,220
Dongfang Qingcang. ## 东方青苍(Dongfang Qingcang,/Dongfang Qingcang.)

440
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,340
You are the one to talk.

441
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,980
Everything started because of you.

442
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,060
If it wasn't for revenge,

443
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,380
I wouldn't have been blinded by that vile man.

444
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,540
Dongfang Qingcang, ## 东方青苍(Dongfang Qingcang,/Dongfang Qingcang.)

445
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,180
Father values you so much

446
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,420
and devoted all his life to you.

447
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,460
But you killed your father with your own hands

448
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,450
just to become Moon Supreme.

449
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,140
Dongfang Qingcang, ## 东方青苍(Dongfang Qingcang,/Dongfang Qingcang.)

450
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,340
why on earth did you kill Father?

451
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,420
He is your Father,

452
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,860
not mine.

453
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,490
Pass my order.

454
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,260
In three days,

455
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,690
the traitor, Xunfeng,

456
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,460
will be executed by lightning.

457
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,980
This is just what I wanted. ## 正合我意(Just what I wanted./This is just what I wanted./Exactly what I wanted.)

458
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,220
Just what I wanted. ## 正合我意(Just what I wanted./This is just what I wanted./Exactly what I wanted.)

459
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,500
Exactly what I wanted. ## 正合我意(Just what I wanted./This is just what I wanted./Exactly what I wanted.)

460
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,620
My Lord, ## 尊上(My Lord,/My Lord.)

461
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,700
should we postpone the execution?

462
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,340
Why?

463
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,850
Because three days later,

464
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,260
it will be the anniversary of the late Moon Supreme's death.

465
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,770
No need to delay.

466
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,420
Execution on the anniversary of death.

467
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,140
Isn't it a good way to help them love each other?

468
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,420
Yes.

469
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,060
Don't you know healing magic?

470
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,460
Why don't you heal yourself?

471
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,700
With my weak power,

472
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,420
it's fine to keep flowers and plants.

473
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,740
But I'm still far from healing people.

474
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,700
It's for healing.

475
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,260
It won't take long to cure you.

476
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,500
No, no, no.

477
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,620
I don't have money.

478
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,340
I already owed you a lot.

479
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,140
If I keep buying things on credit,

480
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,580
I won't be able to pay you back.

481
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,180
It's free.

482
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,060
This is a gift for you.

483
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,900
It's free.

484
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,620
The sun is rising from the west today.

485
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,380
Jieli, are you alright?

486
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,220
If you don't take it,

487
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,540
I'll take it back.

488
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,780
I'll take it.

489
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,740
Thank you.

490
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,460
Give it to me.

491
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,180
Seriously.

492
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,220
Listen carefully.

493
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,220
Don't think that I'll be your slave

494
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,900
just because you saved me.

495
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,940
You made me suffer so much before.

496
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,580
We're even at most.

497
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,900
Okay, be careful.

498
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,700
Thank you, Jieli.

499
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,820
The Moon Supreme is so strange.

500
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,740
You stole so many treasures from him before,

501
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,179
and he didn't even blink.

502
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,810
This time, he suddenly got so angry

503
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,739
just because of a tiny wooden sculpture.

504
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,260
I've asked Shangque.

505
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,699
I was unlucky this time

506
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,380
and offended the Lord.

507
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,460
Do you know?

508
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,900
That wooden sculpture was carved by the Lord

509
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,139
and the maid who took care of him when he's little.

510
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,060
Unexpectedly,

511
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,659
the late Moon Supreme killed

512
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:28,820
the maid later.

513
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,780
He killed her?

514
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,659
Why?

515
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,500
Who knows.

516
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,580
Then the wooden sculpture went missing.

517
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,380
Who would have know that

518
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,580
it was taken into the Pavilion by someone who doesn't know.

519
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,659
And with some dumb luck, I brought it out.

520
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,940
What are you thinking about now?

521
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,699
By the way,

522
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:57,500
Shangque said ## 觞阙说(Shangque said/Did Shangque said)

523
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,610
that the Lord's been in a foul mood

524
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,100
ever since he came back from Memory Loss River few days ago.

525
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,420
You better avoid him these days.

526
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,340
Did Shangque said ## 觞阙说(Shangque said/Did Shangque said)

527
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,740
that after coming back from Memory Loss River,

528
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,180
the Lord's temper suddenly got worse?

529
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,620
Yes.

530
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,940
He said earlier that he'll forgive Prince Xunfeng.

531
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,780
But just now he gave the order

532
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,380
to execute Xunfeng by lightning on the anniversary

533
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,220
of the late Moon Supreme's death three days later.

534
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,900
Have you arranged the execution

535
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,380
of Xunfeng in public?

536
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,260
Yes.

537
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,500
Moon Supreme Lord ## 月尊大人(Moon Supreme Lord/Moon Supreme Lord,)

538
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,460
I know you don't want to see me now,

539
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,220
but I have a question for you.

540
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,290
I'll leave after that.

541
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,860
I promise I won't bother you.

542
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,560
Let the Fairy in.

543
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,460
Yes.

544
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,380
Moon Supreme Lord ## 月尊大人(Moon Supreme Lord/Moon Supreme Lord,)

545
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,100
Don't be mad

546
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,500
if I asked the question.

547
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:18,720
Ask away.

548
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,330
Did Xunfeng collude with the Lord of Haishi City on purpose?

549
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,420
He was tricked by the Lord of Haishi City.

550
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,890
In that case,

551
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:33,860
Moon Supreme Lord, ## 月尊大人(Moon Supreme Lord/Moon Supreme Lord,)

552
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,340
can you show mercy

553
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,660
and spare his life?

554
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,100
After all, you are his family.

555
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,580
His dead father

556
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,540
is his family.

557
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,620
Has your father

558
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,700
ever loved you?

559
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,500
Never.

560
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,300
How is that possible?

561
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,900
The late Moon Supreme loved Prince Xunfeng so much.

562
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,020
Why did he treat you...

563
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,970
Could there be some misunderstanding?

564
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,300
He indulged and doted on him.

565
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,020
But what about me?

566
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,100
No matter what I do,

567
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,820
I can't make him laugh.

568
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,220
Even when he found out that I have the gift

569
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,340
and could be the only one who can master Hellfire,

570
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,980
he never smiled at me once.

571
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,900
He even looked at me and said,

572
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,940
"Why you?"

573
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,100
Why did he say that?

574
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,220
Because sooner or later,

575
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,090
the son he hates will replace him.

576
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,540
No.

577
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,540
I don't think it's like that.

578
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,060
Do you know why he removed my seven feelings?

579
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,100
Because tools only need to be sharp.

580
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,740
And love can only be a burden.

581
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,090
In order to remove all the love,

582
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,780
he tortured me again and again.

583
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,460
He even risked his own life to achieve his goal.

584
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,700
But he would never see

585
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,050
that the Love Tree he destroyed ## 他要让我杀了他(that the Love Tree he destroyed/He wanted me to kill him.)

586
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,140
at the cost of his life

587
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,780
is now resurrected.

588
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,220
Don't you think

589
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,100
it's ridiculous?

590
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,460
Wait.

591
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,260
Why did the late Moon Supreme

592
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,860
say that?

593
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:29,780
I already told you,

594
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,090
the Lord has been very ill-tempered lately.

595
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,260
Why are you still barging into the tiger's den?

596
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,780
Exactly.

597
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,220
Orchid. ## 小兰花(Little Orchid./Orchid.)

598
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,220
You've got some nerve!

599
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,130
Do you know that if children cried at night in Cangyan Sea,

600
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,580
you just mention the Lord's name to them,

601
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,300
and they would stop immediately.

602
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,700
He even killed his own father.

603
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,780
Don't you want to live?

604
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:55,140
So that's what everyone thinks of him.

605
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,060
Of course not.

606
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,740
During Xunfeng's reign as Moon Supreme,

607
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,400
there was continuous civil unrest in Cangyan Sea.

608
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,500
But once our Lord came back,

609
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,700
he ended the war and dispute immediately.

610
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,590
The Lord's powerful and majestic presence

611
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,270
poses a strong rival

612
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,110
for your people in Shuiyuntian.

613
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,490
But for our Moon Tribe,

614
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,160
it is our hope to protect our peace.

615
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,060
Why did you ask that?

616
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,420
I just think

617
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,110
that the Cangyan Sea and Dongfang Qingcang

618
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,920
are different from what the rumors said.

619
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,860
There might be something hidden

620
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,700
behind all those horrible stories in the past.

621
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,300
But

622
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,120
the Lord killed his father in public.

623
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,780
What could be hidden?

624
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,380
He wanted me to kill him. ## 他要让我杀了他(that the Love Tree he destroyed/He wanted me to kill him.)

625
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,650
The Love Tree he destroyed at the cost of his life

626
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,360
is now resurrected.

627
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,630
He and his father are...

628
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,410
No.

629
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,030
There must be something behind this.

630
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,370
Shangque,

631
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,060
tell me exactly what happened

632
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,530
when the Moon Supreme killed his father.

633
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,750
Don't miss a single detail.

634
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:15,010
[Love Between Fairy and Devil]
