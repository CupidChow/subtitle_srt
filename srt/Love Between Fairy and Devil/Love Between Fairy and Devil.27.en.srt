Just leave.

5
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,320
If you break into Cangyan Sea again,

6
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,000
I will not forgive you.

7
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,760
You too.

8

If we meet on the battlefield someday...

11

We will eventually have a winner.

12
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,550
Yes.

13
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,660
You and I have to settle the score.

14
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,950
I wish

15
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,060
we could go back to the days in Lucheng City.

16
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,910
Orchid,

17
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,710

♫ Every decision I make for you ♫

25

I dared to love and hate. I could follow my heart.

36

I made many vows to you.

62
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,890
All my words are sincere.

63
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,740
Even if I'm Changheng now,

64
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,890
they still count.

♫ Tramp over hill and dale to search for you ♫

76

♫ Blaze a way through brambles and thorns to search for you ♫

Your Highness.

Shangque.

130
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,160
What's the matter, Your Highness?

131
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,610
After I went back,

132
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,410
I was worried every night.

133
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,140
Is there a way that

134
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,030
can lift my brother's Heart Curse?

135
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,790
If I knew it, would I hurt my brother?

136
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,590
Of course you won't.

137
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,530
Then why are you hesitating?

138
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,350
Actually,

139
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,160
the only way to break the curse

140
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,440
is to kill Orchid

141
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,820
with the ancient sword of Chengying.

142
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,050
But as you know,

143
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,110
I've been searching for it in the three realms under the order of the Lord.

144
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,910
But I still couldn't find the last fragment.

145
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,680
Even if we know how to lift the curse,

146
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,730
it's useless.

147
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,260
So that's why

148
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,370
you went to search for the fragments of Chengying sword.

149
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,380
Yes.

150
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,620
Your Highness,

151
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,320
have you found the last fragment?

152
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,420
No.

153
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,590

154
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,390
Take a look.

155
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,530

Hi, have a look at the love locks please.

157
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,010

160
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:13,880
Have a look.

161

Look at them.

165
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,360
Why are there so many love lock sellers suddenly?

166
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,000
The streets are lively too.

167
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,380
Yes.

168
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,810
Seven days later

169
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,200
is the Mountain and Moon Festival once in a thousand years.

170
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,300
Mountain and Moon Festival?

171
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,290
Do you see the moon-shaped mountain?

172
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,760
Every 1,000 years,

173
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,180
the full moon in Cangyan Sea

174
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,360
will meet it.

175
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,250
By then,

176
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,720
the full moon will be fully inserted

177
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,150
in the mountain.

178
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,950
If they meet,

179
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,220
will it be a bigger full moon?

180
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,320
This is the origin of the Mountain and Moon Festival.

181
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,190
What does it have to do with buying the love locks?

182
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,540
Why does everyone buy the locks?

183
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,760
I don't know.

184
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,020
Maybe it's a new custom

185
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,830
in the past 30,000 years here.

186
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:01,930
Jieli.

187
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,850
Orchid.

188
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,250
My lord.

189
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,420
Good.

190
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,360
No wonder I haven't seen you all day.

191
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,120
So you went on a date with the Lord?

192
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,690
Jieli.

193
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,870
My lord.

194
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,040
What are these?

195
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,590
You bought two locks?

196
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,210
Why did you buy them?

197
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,350
You have no idea, my lord.

198
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,690
It is said that

199
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,670
if couples who are in love

200
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,630
carve each other's name

201
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,440
on the love lock,

202
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,910
and hang them on the bridge of love

203
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,670
on the night of the Mountain and Moon Festival

204
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,360
when the Mountain and Moon meet,

205
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,180
then they will be...

206
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,590
What will they be?

207
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,930
They will be together forever and ever.

208
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,390
Really?

209
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,130
It's just nonsense.

210
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,640
It's just some groundless saying

211
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,110
without evidence.

212
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,170
It's not strained at all.

213
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,550
How wonderful it is.

214
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,480
I won't be interested in those activities

215
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,290
to cheat kids.

216
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,390
Neither am I.

217
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,110
So the Mountain and Moon Festival

218
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,420
is the lovers' festival

219
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,190
in Cangyan Sea every 1,000 years.

220
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,950
I grew up in the Haishi City.

221
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,170
I didn't even know

222
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,640
there was such a festival in our Moon Tribe.

223
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,940
I almost missed it.

224
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,150
Brother Shangque.

225
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,920
Are you available at the Mountain and Moon Festival?

226
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,330
I wonder if you have any instructions that day, my lord?

227
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,170
My lord,

228
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,390
please lend me Shangque

229
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,940
at the Mountain and Moon Festival.

230
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,880
Approved.

231
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:02,800
Thank you, Lord.

232
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,600
Thank you, Lord.

233
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,480
Great.

234
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,490
Just leave.

235
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:08,600
Go.

236
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,130
I'll look around.

237
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,180
Look at those merchants.

238
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,730
They are not good at doing business at all.

239
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,710
They're all selling locks.

240
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,090
How much can they earn though?

241
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,700
Let's set up a stall

242
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,090
to sell sharp gravers.

243
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,910
What?

244
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,210
Think about it.

245
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,470
On the day of the Mountain and Moon Festival,

246
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,110
almost all lovers in the Cangyan Sea will come.

247
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,670
So all of them will be

248
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,560
our potential buyers.

249
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,450
By then,

250
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,860
we can also sell some rouge, cosmetics and ornaments

251
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,960
with high price.

252
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,350
In such a romantic atmosphere,

253
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,080
men will not hesitate to spend money for women.

254
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,150
You'll be in charge of purchasing and running errands.

255
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,950
I'll be responsible for attracting customers.

256
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,420
We'll make a fortune.

257
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,100
I'm going to be rich.

258
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,980
So you're not going to

259
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,340
admire the moon with me?

260
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,190
Are you crazy?

261
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,450
How can you miss the chance to earn money

262
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,380
but to admire the moon?

263
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,870
Don't worry.

264
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,840
Your benefit is guaranteed.

265
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,690
If you come to help me,

266
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,340
I'll give you 10% of the profit.

267
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,750
What? Is it too little?

268
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,310
Then 15% of the profit.

269
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,330
That's not what I mean.

270
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,060
20%.

271
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,830
You're still not satisfied?

272
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,920
Black Dragon!

273
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,520
Boss.

274
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,740
You wanna buy the lock, Miss?

275
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,670
Show me your most beautiful locks please.

276
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,340
They are all here.

277
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,350
Pick one.

278
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,540
So beautiful.

279
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,940
So beautiful.

280
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,000
Sir, do you want a lock?

281
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,480
What kind of locks do you want?

282
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,710
Lower your voice.

283
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,540
The style doesn't matter.

284
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,060
I want the hardest and strongest one.

285
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,570
Okay, I got it.

286
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,080
The stronger the better.

287
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:39,920
Okay.

288
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,270
I'll take this.

289
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,610
No. No.

290
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,370
I'll take these two.

291
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,170
Okay.

292
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:51,890
They cost one stone.

293
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,170
See you.

294

What is it?

300
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,940
Since the fairy is related to your life,

301
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,870
she should be strictly guarded.

302
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,090
Nothing must go wrong.

303
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,450
Why did you still

304
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,170
take her around?

305
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,660
Why do you indulge her so much?

306
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,680
As long as I am with her,

307

how can things be wrong?

you can't use Hellfire now.

You're not like before.

311
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,560
I will recover in a few days.

312
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,870
And my Hellfire will be recovered soon.

313

Brother,

314
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,310
that fairy will be a disaster sooner or later.

315
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,090
Since you know how to break the curse,

316
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,140
why don't you reforge the Chengying sword and kill her

317
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,070
to prevent any trouble?

318
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,690
Not to mention the last piece of Chengying sword couldn't be found,

319
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,420
even it's successfully reforged,

320
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,600
I won't kill my beloved one.

321
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,320
Beloved one?

322
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,260
You keep saying

you're ashamed of the 100,000 soldiers in Xuanxu realm.

as the one you love!

but me.

The primordial spirit of the Chidi woman has been destroyed.

329
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,120
I will find another way to unseal them.

At this point,

00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,380
On the day you and the Chidi woman completed your hardships,

338
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,650
Rong Hao used the evil spirit to trap me.

339
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,830
Rong Hao?

340
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,090
You mean

341
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,360
the evil spirit that hurt you was from Rong Hao?

342
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,450
Yes.

343
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,270
Are you sure?

344
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,200
Of course.

345
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,010
Rong Hao must be closely related with that Lord of Haishi City.

346
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,490
Yes.

347
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,430
The Lord of Haishi City captured me in the Thousand Dreamland

348
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,780
and transformed out of the Arbiter Hall.

349
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,250
He even imitated Lord Changheng

350
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,670
and asked me to fix the Destiny Book.

351
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,310
He must have been to Shuiyuntian.

352
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,420
Otherwise, how could he be so familiar with the Arbiter Hall?

353
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,390
And he was so good at imitating Lord Changheng.

354
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,860
It was so alike.

355
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,550
Could it be that Lord Rong Hao told him?

356

[Crane Pavilion]

358
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,380
You're here.

359
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,980
I've been waiting for you for three days.

360
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,290
I knew you would find me.

361
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,850
I wonder

362
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,370
who is the one waiting for me?

363
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,590
Is it that carefree

364
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,610
and open-minded Lord Rong Hao,

365
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,160
or the Lord of Haishi City,

366
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,720
who is cunning

367
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,700
and plays tricks

368
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,200
in order to manipulate the fairy realm and the Moon Tribe?

369

[Crane Pavilion]

370
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,270
When did you start suspecting me?

371
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,350
I never suspected you.

372
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,280
But I don't know

373
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,560
how do you get the evil spirit to trap Dongfang Qingcang.

374
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,300
And why did the Lord of Haishi City, who has never been to Shuiyuntian

375
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,610
turn into me,

376
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,920
and created a fake Arbiter Hall

377
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,350
to cheat Orchid.

378
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,860
How do you explain

379
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,830
all these things?

380
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,830
Why?

381
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,140
That day,

382
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,710
when you insisted to save Orchid in Cangyan Sea,

383
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,070
you should have already known the answer.

384
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,640
If I could save my master,

385
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,040
what do you think I would do?

386
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,150
You will definitely fight to death.

387
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,210
Even if you will be betrayed by all the people,

388
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,310
or go against the law of heaven,

389
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,080
You'll do anything you can.

390
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,510
Do you know where this place is?

391
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,390
Once,

392
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,080
there was a mortal child.

393
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,390
He was born blind.

394
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,610
He had no parents.

395
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,750
He could only make a living

396
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,600
by playing the flute.

397
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,540
That year,

398
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,890
the winter in Yunmeng Lake

399
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,030
was freezing cold.

400
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,920
That blind child

401
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,440
hadn't found food for three days.

402
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,170
His body was freezing.

403
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,740
Only his fingers could move.

404
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,550
He sat there,

405
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:10,000
kept blowing the flute.

406
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,250
Gradually,

407
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,850
he lost consciousness.

408
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,410
He thought

409
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,430
he might be frozen to death.

410
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,360
But when he woke up,

411
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,050
he saw a person.

412
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,820
Yes.

413
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,550
He could see the world.

414
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,060
The first thing he saw

415
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,120
was a very dazzling

416
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,390
and beautiful lady.

417
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:54,230
But she looked so sad.

418
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,400
That blind child

419
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,840
is you.

420
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,440
Before I met my master,

421
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,260
I lived in endless darkness.

422
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,990
After my master died,

423
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,300
she took away all the brightness in my heart.

424
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,600
There's only

425
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,610
a hollow skin left.

426
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,710
To revive her, I became hollow-minded

427
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,630
who only knows killing and fighting.

428
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,340
And the Lord Rong Hao you know,

429
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,030
who is easy-going

430
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,880
and carefree

431
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,100
is just a mirage

432
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,660
outside this body.

433
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,390
Did you really kill

434
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,960
the 3,000 soldiers?

435
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,590
That day,

436
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,120
although I could save half of the primordial spirits of my master,

437
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,520
the 30,000 years of hardship experience

438
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,950
made her fragile primordial spirit

439
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,420
weaker.

440
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,230
Only the evil spirit

441
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,620
can stabilize her primordial spirit.

442
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,910
So I set up the Haishi City,

443
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,590
and instigated the internal strife of the Moon Tribe

444
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,870
to absorb plenty of spirits of the Moon Tribe

445
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,590
and refine the evil spirit.

446
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,720
But after Dongfang Qingcang returned to the Cangyan Sea,

447
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,820
I couldn't do anything to the Moon Tribe.

448
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,700
I could only...

449
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,430
The late God of War was upright

450
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,490
and tried her best to protect the people.

451
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,830
If she knew

452
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,270
you kept killing your fellows to make her resurrection

453
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,740
how would she feel?

454
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,380
People?

455
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,380
How can the people compare to her?

456
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,620
I just want my master to come back to life.

457
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,680
As long as I can see her again,

458
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,120
even if I will be killed by her,

459
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,590
I still feel no regrets.

460
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,270
We've known each other for ten thousand years.

461
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,680
You were my best friend.

462
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,200
But now I realize

463
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,590
I know nothing about you.

464
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,160
How foolish I am.

465
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,240
For the past 30,000 years,

466
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,970
on each anniversary of my master's death,

467
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,120
I would go to the monument to condole with her.

468
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,870
And the only person I met there

469
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,360
was you.

470
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,690
Changheng.

471
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,590
For the past 30,000 years,

472
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,480
I've been disguising

473
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,880
and lying.

474
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,460
But being friends with you is something I did

475
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,230
from the bottom of my heart.

476
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,040
I trust you.

477
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,690
I know you trust me too.

478
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,310
In order to save Orchid,

479
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,200
you are isolated and betrayed by others.

480
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,630
You and I are the same.

481
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,510
Otherwise,

482
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,370
how could we be friends?

483
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,850
But you've committed a crime.

484
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,870
Your sin is unforgivable.

485
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,520
Let's go.

486
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,460
I'll go back with you.

487
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,560
Li Yuan.

488
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:53,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

489
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,980
The matter of the sinner Rong Hao

490
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,700
is related to the three realms.

491
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,340
Each of his sin is horrifying.

492
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,570
He needs to be interrogated carefully.

493
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,810
Put him in the karma jail for now.

494
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,740
You are asked to strictly guard him.

495
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,760
Don't let anything go wrong.

496
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,640
Yes.

497
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,810
Although you committed a serious crime for the sake of a traitor,

498
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:46,250
you did a great job catching the criminal, Rong Hao.

499
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,550
She is not a traitor.

500
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,290
At this point, you are still stubborn

501
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,300
and disregarding the overall situation.

502
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,640
The overall situation

503
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,930
is just your big picture.

504
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,410
In your eyes,

505
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,670
our mother and I,

506
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,180
and your closest relatives

507
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,500
are all chess pieces on your overall situation.

508
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,550
You...

509
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,070
Why are you still pretending?

510
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,060
The power of Heaven is like millions of soldiers.

511
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,980
At the Memory Loss River,

512
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,420
I have openly defied you.

513
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,310
If you didn't kill me,

514
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,870
how will you rule the fairy realm in the future?

515
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,920
Besides,

516
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,150
if I die,

517
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,910
you can completely get rid of

518
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,180
the shame of our mother's sin of running away.

519
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,320
Isn't that a win-win situation?

520
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,930
Changheng,

521
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,870
do you really think I won't kill you?

522
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,610
Since I'm back,

523
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,540
I am ready to be killed.

524
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,990
Just for a traitor who colluded with the Moon Tribe,

525
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,090
you truly desire to die?

526
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,940
She's not a traitor!

527
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,080
I have been obeying the rules since childhood.

528
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,860
My long life

529
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,540
is like the frozen Northernmost Ocean

530
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,220
doesn't have any waves.

531
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,790
Until I met Orchid,

532
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,340
my world has colors.

533
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,440
Now she has someone in her heart,

534
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,130
and is willing to stay at Cangyan Sea.

535
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,930
The rest of my life is too long.

536
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,500
I really don't know how to spend my days.

537
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,160
Only after I die,

538
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,560
you can defend your authority.

539
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,910
In the three realms,

540
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,050
only you

541
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,280
can compete with that Dongfang Qingcang.

542
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,440
You are the God of War of Shuiyuntian.

543
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,960
How can you abandon your duties?

544
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,970
Changheng,

545
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,040
as long as you admit your mistake to me,

546
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,840
and be punished in front of everybody...

547
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,510
No need.

548
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,010
I'm tired of war.

549
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,570
From now on,

550
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,060
I won't fight for you anymore.

551
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,150
Fine.

552
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,630
I...

553
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,400
grant your wish.

554
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,080
Before I came here,

555
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,060
I've seen the fate of Changheng in this life.

556
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,570
The hardship he is supposed to experience

557
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,540
is not to kill Xie Wanqing.

558
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,600
In this life,

559
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,120
he should die for the one he cares.

560
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,070
Lord Changheng has successfully experienced hardships.

561
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,550
It meant I was the one he cared about.

562
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,530
But

563
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,670
the one he cared about was Cricket,

564
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,850
not Danyin.

565
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,610
Besides,

566
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,100
Lord Changheng loves Orchid.

567
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,179
One of the two weddings Tianji Mirror predicted

568
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,690
has come true.

569
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,969
Will the second wedding come true as well?

570
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,150
If he knows that Orchid

571
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,500
might be the Goddess of Xishan

572
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,440
who is his fiancée.

573
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,219
If I tell him,

574
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,409
there will be no turning back.

575
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,219
They will definitely get married.

576
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,739
But if I don't tell him,

577
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,350
no one will know that Orchid is a goddess.

578
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,870
Will Lord Yunzhong punish Lord Changheng

579
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,960
for committing a crime of collusion?

580
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,730
He'll has to be sent to the fairy guillotine.

581
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:51,730
Not necessarily.

582
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,340
After all, they are siblings.

583
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,310
No matter what, Lord Yunzhong will care about his sibling.

584
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,430
Fairy Danyin, bad news!

585
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,870
Fairy Danyin!

586
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,190
Lord Changheng offended His Majesty.

587
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,050
He...

588
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,480
What's wrong with him?

589
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,710
Tell me.

590
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,060
He's sentenced to a crime of committing a crime of collusion.

591
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,040
Seven days later,

592
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,560
he will be executed at the fairy guillotine.

593
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,540
Wooden Head, time to take the medicine.

594
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,610
You haven't recovered yet.

595
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,460
Why are you using your power again?

596
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,910
I've recovered 60%. I'm fine.

597
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,090
You start to act tough since you only recovered 60%.

598
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,840
Take the medicine.

599
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,550
Are you still worried

600
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,440
about your Hellfire?

601
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,230
In order to purify the primordial spirit,

602
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,160
you've wasted much of your energy and power.

603
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:30,100
You need to recuperate first.

604
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,200
We still don't know how to unseal the soldiers.

605
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,980
If my Hellfire can't be restored,

606
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,170
how can I protect the people of Cangyan Sea?

607
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,740
I'm afraid that I'm going to give birth the baby.

608
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,970
I'll get someone to deliver the baby for you.

609
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:33,730
You can't go.

610
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,690
You can't go.

611
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,080
I'm a woman from the Moon Tribe.

612
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,430
Our child

613
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,980
can't be found.

614
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:42,380
I'm fine.

615
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,050
Xing Luo.

616
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,060
But...

617
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,790
But...

618
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,140
What should we do with our child?

619
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,380
Neither the Moon Tribe nor the fairies will accept her.

620
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,740
I'm afraid

621
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,330
she'll need to hide all her life.

622
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,220
No, she won't.

623
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,140
No, she won't.

624
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:03,920
Xing Luo.

625
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,520
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

626
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,310
There's a trace of the Moon Tribe nearby.

627
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:10,980
Search!

628
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,340
Xing Luo.

629
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,580
Star Luo, are you alright?

630
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,940
Lord Rong Hao.

631
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,870
She is a member of the Moon Tribe?

632
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,570
Lord Rong Hao.

633
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,990
have you seen a woman of the Moon Tribe

634
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,370
who is about to give birth?

635
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,020
A woman of the Moon Tribe?

636
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,760
I think I saw a pregnant woman

637
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,810
went that way.

638
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:03,440
Thank you.

639
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,110
Let's go.

640
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,330
Thank you for saving our lives.

641
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,350
You should leave now.

642
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,820
Go.

643
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,630
I didn't expect that Rong Hao is the Lord of Haishi City.

644
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,520
He's about to be interrogated.

645
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,460
What if he leaks the identity of Danyin?

646
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,510
Father, please save Changheng.

647
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,710
Danyin.

648
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,260
This is...

649
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,450
Father, why do you have something from the Moon Tribe?

650
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,440
Don't make a fuss.

651
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,250
This is just something I got

652
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,590
when I was on patrol.

653
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,360
Why didn't you submit it after it was confiscated?

654
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,800
It's a complicated matter. I forgot.

655
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,490
Father, tell me.

656
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:05,010
Lord Changheng will be executed in seven days

657
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,730
for committing a crime of collusion,

658
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,900
is it true?

659
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,670
Yes.

660
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,450
Lord Yunzhong

661
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,770
doesn't even show mercy to the Lord Changheng.

662
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,880
If he knows

663
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,240
you've been keeping the stuff from the Moon Tribe with you,

664
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,100
you'll get in big trouble.

665
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,310
Father.

666
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,000
You must be careful.

667
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,770
My dear daughter.

668
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,380
Don't worry.

669
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,180
I will be fine.

670
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,000
I won't let anything happen to you, too.

671
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,890
Father.

672
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,280
What's wrong?

673
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,740
I'm fine.

674
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,110
Xing Luo.

675
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,040
I'm sorry.

676
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,190
Not only did I fail to protect you,

677
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,090
but also your only belongings.

678
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,950
But I have no choice.

679
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,430
For the safety of our daughter,

680
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:52,990
I can't let her identity

681
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,710
be exposed.

682
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,950
Xing Luo.

683
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,620
I'm sorry.

684
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,910
Why is this black dragon's name

685
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,290
so hard to curve.

686
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:32,720
It's eight times harder than

687
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,780
the work Orchid does for the Lord.

688
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,740
Pavilion Master.

689
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,380
Greetings, Pavilion Master.

690
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,230
Lord,

691
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,530
I just received a report

692
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:57,580
there was a suspicious movement.

693
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,350
I'm afraid someone has sneaked into the palace.

694
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,410
Go.

695
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:11,360
Find a chance

696
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,490
to drop this blood

697
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,630
on the Bone Orchid worn by Orchid.

698
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,780
Whose blood is this?

699
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:19,550
Will this hurt Orchid?

700
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:27,700
