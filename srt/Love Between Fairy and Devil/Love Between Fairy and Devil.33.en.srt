4
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,259
Her primordial spirit is very fragile.

5
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,740
Once the stripping process is interrupted,

6
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,500
she will be in danger of falling apart.

7
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,820
And the stripping process is unbearably painful.

8
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,860
No matter what, you must persevere.

9
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,140
You must not have any distractions.

10
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,340
Do you hear me?

11
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,140
This is nothing

12
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,380
compared to what she went through for me.

13
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,420
Let's start.

14
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,150
Hang in there.

15
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,280
You're almost there.

16
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,630
Dongfang Qingcang.

17
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:04,550
What's wrong with you?

18
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,200
Dongfang Qingcang.

19
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,610
The first God of War, the Chidi woman, has come back to life.

20
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,480
I have to go back to Shuiyuntian.

21
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,530
Stay at Xishan

22
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,740
and guard her transformation.

23
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,640
I'll be back soon.

24
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,200
No need for you to tell me.

25
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,090
I will guard her with my life.

26
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,600
♫ Fall in love with your clear eyes ♫

27

By the way,

45
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,200
I forgot to tell you.

46
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,510
I saw your master.

47
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:10,380
♫ I will never betray you even if the world does ♫

48
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,650
And I know where she lives.

49
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,010
Don't you miss her a lot?

50
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,160
Grow up.

51
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,630
Grow up fast.

52
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,310
When you come back,

53
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,660
I will take you to visit her, okay?

54
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,380
Your master also knew that I made a mistake.

55
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,570
She was also pissed

56
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,510
♫ Every decision I make for you ♫

57
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,550

♫ The story goes on and on ♫

60
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,880

♫ Stories in the past play in my head ♫

63
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,180

Are you still blaming me

85
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,580
and angry with me?

86
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,790
I've been watching you for so long.

87
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,440
Why do you only grow six leaves?

88
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,690

I'm sure you can grow the ninth leaf.

99
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,510
I'll get some dew for you.

100
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,490
Wait for me here.

101
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:19,880
Old friend,

102
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,000
we meet again.

103
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,860
God Xuanwu.

104
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,200
It's been a long time.

105
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,210
It seems that

106
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,220
you have found your destiny.

107
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,810
Thank you for your guidance.

108
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,710
I'm ready.

109
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,770
If you wake up as the Goddess Xi Yun,

110
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,220
you'll have nothing to do with

111
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,110
all the past events of your life as Orchid.

112
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,720
Can you really let go of all the sorrow and happiness?

113
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,660
You once instructed me about the mission of the Goddess.

114
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,930
But I was too ignorant

115
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,820
to understand it at that time.

116
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,800
Now

117
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,070
I've seen what I should have seen

118
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,470
and lost

119
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,620
what was meant to be lost.

120
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,110
Now I understand what love and pain really are,

121
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,430
what to pick up

122
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,860
and what to put down.

123
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,890
From now on,

124
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,870
I will no longer indulge in private sorrow and joy.

125
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,040
I will take up the mission of blessing all beings in the three realms.

126
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,050
I once said

127
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,070
you are gifted

128
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,790
and are more extraordinary

129
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,390
than all generations of Goddesses.

130
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,280
I never understood

131
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,380
this.

132
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,350
The Goddesses of all generations

133
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,660
have been guarding Xishan all their lives.

134
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,890
Although they believed in the same mission as you,

135
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,550
they failed to see all beings in the end.

136
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,480
But you

137
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,620
have traveled all over Shuiyuntian,

138
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,480
Yunmeng Lake and Cangyan Sea.

139
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,710
You have more than a mission for all beings,

140
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,940
but also true love.

141
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,380
You'll create

142
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,850
a new

143
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,200
and fascinating world

144
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,800
as the first Goddess did.

145
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,030
Go.

146
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,510
Ma'am!

147
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,500
From now on,

148
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,020
you'll be an ordinary spirit in the three realms.

149
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,080
Even if you and your relatives meet up,

150
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,760
you will not know each other.

151
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,610
There will be no Goddess in this world.

152
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,320
Orchid.

153
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,740
Orchid.

154
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,670
Who are you?

155
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,940
You're still angry with me.

156
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,910
I lied to you

157
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,160
and hurt you before.

158
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,990
I've done so many bad things,

159
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,760
making you sad

160
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,140
and letting you down.

161
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,910
You should be angry with me.

162
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,430
What are you talking about?

163
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,280
I don't understand.

164
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,020
Orchid.

165
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:54,840
Stop there.

166
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,950
You're a strange person.

167
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,630
I don't know you at all.

168
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,100
But you keep following me

169
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,860
and saying ridiculous things.

170
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,040
That's so rude.

171
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,170
Orchid.

172
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,940
I know you're still pissed.

173
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,200
You can beat me, scold me.

174
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,420
You can even stab me.

175
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,890
If one stab doesn't work, then two.

176
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,090
If two doesn't work, then ten.

177
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,530
As long as you can relieve your anger.

178
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,810
But don't ignore me like this.

179
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,490
I am Xi Yun,

180
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,200
the Goddess of the Xilan clan,

181
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,250
not Orchid as you call me.

182
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,200
Orchid.

183
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,500
Orchid.

184
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,860
It's okay if you don't want to talk to me.

185
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,080
I will always be here to guard you

186
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,850
until the day you forgive me.

187
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,490
God Chidi,

188
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,100
Fairy Danyin has come to pay her respects.

189
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,700
My lord.

190
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,520
Orchid has lost her memory.

191
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,320
The moment she was reborn,

192
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,800
she said she didn't know me at all.

193
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,980
She also claimed that she is not Orchid.

194
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,340
Could it be that the fairy

195
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,550
said that on purpose

196
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,900
out of anger?

197
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,140
At first, I thought so too.

198
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,619
But Orchid is innocent and simple.

199
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,390
The feelings are all over her face.

200
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,980
Whether she is happy

201
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,119
or sad,

202
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,710
I can tell it at a glance.

203
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,230
Even if she's angry with me,

204
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:28,099
she can always find an excuse in the least time

205
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,620
to forgive me.

206
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,300
But the way she looks at me now

207
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,360
is either cheerful or sad,

208
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,670
it's like she's looking at a stranger.

209
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,390
I feel like…

210
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,980
I feel like she's not angry at all.

211
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,720
She just...

212
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,620
She just doesn't care about me anymore.

213
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,750
My lord.

214
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,890
Don't get too upset.

215
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,600
The fairy may just have a momentary trauma.

216
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,150
When her spirit is restored,

217
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,160
it'll probably be fine.

218
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:36,930
It's good for her to forget about it.

219
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:41,390
Think about it.

220
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,120
I have wronged her, lied to her.

221
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,420
I made her suffer so much

222
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,380
and broke her heart.

223
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,850
Now

224
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,870
she has lost these memories,

225
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,470
the bad memories

226
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,950
would be taken away too, right?

227
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,360
This must be God's will

228
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,480
to bring everything back to square one,

229
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,760
so that I can start over with her.

230
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,160
Shangque.

231
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,010
How do you think

232
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,660
I make her fall in love with me again?

233
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,270
My lord, you picked morning dew and cooked flower soup for the fairy

234
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,090
in Shuiyuntian,

235
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,100
helped her with the immortal exam

236
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,200
and took her to see the sunrise.

237
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,680
The fairy was very touched by all these.

238
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:35,860
By the way,

239
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,710
you also built

240
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,970
an exactly identical Arbiter Hall.

241
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,480
Go on.

242
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,460
Later,

243
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,060
the fairy saved you

244
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,500
and tried to restore your emotional root, my lord.

245
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,670
I think that at that time the fairy

246
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,970
had already fell in love with you.

247
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,300
Okay.

248
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,000
Then I will do the same things

249
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,810
again for her.

250
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,830
Umm.

251
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,140
[Arbiter Hall]

252
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,380
What does this mean?

253
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,200
Goddess,

254
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,210
I mistook you for an old friend of mine.

255
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,600
I'm sorry to have intruded on you.

256
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,330
Today, I have moved the hall here

257
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,470
as a token of reparation.

258
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,050
I quite like it here.

259
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,760
Since the Goddess likes it here,

260
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,830
why don't you

261
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,640
live here?

262
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,050
Now that Xishan is in ruins,

263
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,680
you have no one to look after you.

264
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,250
It's fate

265
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,420
that I mistook you this time.

266
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,330
If you don't mind,

267
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,430
I am willing

268
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,180
to be your servant.

269
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,990
I wonder if the Goddess will allow me.

270
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,580
What is your name?

271
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,100
My name is

272
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,650
Daqiang,

273
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,860
an immortal

274
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,800
of Shuiyuntian.

275
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,950
You're lying.

276
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,430
You are not a member of Shuiyuntian.

277
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,510
Goddess,

278
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,880
why did you say that?

279
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,280
Have you seen me somewhere?

280
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,530
You have no immortal aura on you.

281
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,400
You are not an immortal.

282
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,680
But Xilan clan has been neutral for generations,

283
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,160
never involved in any disputes between immortals and the Moon Tribe.

284
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,590
We treat all beings in the three realms equally.

285
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,280
I don't care if you are an immortal or not.

286
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,120
Since you want to be my servant,

287
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,900
you can stay.

288
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,260
Thank you, Goddess.

289
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,920
Greetings, Goddess.

290
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,360
What is it?

291
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,160
Your spirit is still weak

292
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,340
at the beginning of your transformation.

293
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,480
I've specially made flower soup

294
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,610
with flowers and honey.

295
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,290
It's good for your cultivation

296
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,590
and strengthening of spirit.

297
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,760
And the morning dew

298
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,020
is rootless water.

299
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,290
It's the best for your herbaceous spirit.

300
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:01,810
By the way,

301
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,540
I'm afraid that the coldness of the night

302
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,220
would hurt your body.

303
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,480
So it's already warmed up.

304
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,260
I've also added seven kinds of nectar

305
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,980
and six kinds of grass.

306
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,490
You managed to

307
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,170
get the water.

308
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,520
I can't casually drink it like this.

309
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,700
What?

310
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,140
Do you have to beat a drum and take a bath before drinking it?

311
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,300
The water looks tasteless.

312
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,390
I'll get some nectar

313
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,860
and put it in.

314
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,270
That's not necessary.

315
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,860
I'm on Inedia.

316
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,510
I don't have any cravings for food and drink.

317
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,820
Besides, I've never liked sweet food.

318
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,290
Take it away.

319
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,280
What are you waiting for?

320
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,880
I know you mean well.

321
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,440
But don't act on your own anymore.

322
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:04,440
I see.

323
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,310
Drink it.

324
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,490
No.

325
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,140
My lord, you made this for the fairy.

326
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,020
I

327
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:42,190
dare not.

328
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,600
She doesn't want it.

329
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,650
Just drink it as I told you.

330
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,520
Orchid is right.

331
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,220
She's a god now.

332
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,820
The gods don't need such mundane food.

333
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,960
I have to use other methods

334
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,690
to impress her.

335
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,220
Come on.

336
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,660
Think it over for me.

337
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,290
What else did I do

338
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,390
to impress her in the first place?

339
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,770
The fairy enjoys company.

340
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,570
She was always happy

341
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,580
when you were with her.

342
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,790
What again?

343
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,580
I don't want to leave you alone.

344
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,810
So I'm here to accompany you.

345
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,710
I'm a quiet person by nature.

346
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,890
I don't like the hustle and bustle.

347
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,200
I only feel comfortable when I'm alone.

348
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,880
I never feel lonely.

349
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,560
You may go.

350
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,410
I'll just stay here and meditate.

351
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,380
I won't disturb you.

352
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,490
You've been acting strange all day.

353
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,000
What do you want?

354
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,430
Nothing.

355
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,270
I was just overwhelmed by your beauty

356
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,040
the moment I met you.

357
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,520
I wanted to memorize every word you…

358
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,240
Goddess.

359
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,140
You are really very important

360
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,400
and special to me.

361
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,540
Although I am a Goddess,

362
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,480
I'm just a grass with spiritual wisdom,

363
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,040
like all the others in the three realms.

364
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,480
There is nothing special about me.

365
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,410
I don't think I'm that important.

366
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,000
Wait.

367
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,960
I still have something to say.

368
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,580
Since you said

369
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,810
you'd remember everything I say,

370
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,780
do remember,

371
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,430
I don't like to be served by others.

372
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,110
Don't bother me anymore.

373
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,700
I've tried the morning dew and flower soup.

374
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,470
I've tried companionship too.

375
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,370
I've told her everything

376
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,790
she used to like to hear.

377
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,780
Right.

378
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,720
I can still see the sunrise with her.

379
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:41,880
My lord.

380
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:43,650
What?

381
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,830
What better way have you come up with?

382
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,160
My lord.

383
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,510
I think

384
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,820
the Goddess may no longer be

385
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,600
Fairy Orchid.

386
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,000
That's not true.

387
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,230
You've been with the Goddess for a few days.

388
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,200
I've also observed it for a few days.

389
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,590
The Goddess's expressions, likes and dislikes,

390
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,850
style of behavior

391
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,700
are completely different from Fairy Orchid…

392
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,210
Shut up.

393
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,340
I saw with my own eyes her spirit

394
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,640
turning into an orchid seed.

395
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,820
I planted it with my own hands

396
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,590
and watched her day and night.

397
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,530
So how can she not be Orchid?

398
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:33,960
My lord.

399
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:34,550
I'm going to sleep.

400
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,230
Tomorrow morning, I still have to

401
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,620
watch the sunrise with her.

402
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,980
Right.

403
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,530
It's only 6 o'clock in the morning.

404
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,710
Orchid probably hasn't woken up yet.

405
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,520
What are you doing?

406
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,480
Greetings, Goddess.

407
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,140
I told you

408
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,520
not to disturb me.

409
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,330
But you're peeping outside the door.

410
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,220
Forgive me, Goddess.

411
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,440
I just want to

412
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,840
invite you

413
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,810
to Xishan's Shaking Light Peak

414
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,200
to watch the sunrise.

415
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,710
I've already checked it out.

416
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,220
It's the highest point on Xishan,

417
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,460
which has the most open and spacious view.

418
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,220
Sunrise?

419
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,260
Do you know it's already 7 o'clock?

420
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,160
What's wrong with the hour?

421
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,130
Every day at a quarter past dawn

422
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,610
when the first rays of the morning sun cover Xishan,

423
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,840
I will meditate at the Shaking Light Peak

424
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,060
and soak in the essence of the sunrise.

425
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,370
You just returned from there?

426
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,440
A practitioner of spirituality should be diligent and disciplined,

427
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,960
so as not to be as lazy as you are.

428
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:07,430
My lord.

429
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,120
Eat something.

430
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,620
She really doesn't seems to be

431
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,949
Orchid.

432
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:33,719
Orchid is a glutton,

433
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,900
who likes to have fun

434
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,920
and sleep in.

435
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:39,719
She is timid,

436
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,360
afraid of the dark

437
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,040
and being alone,

438
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,239
but also loves to pretend to be strong.

439
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,139
She suffered

440
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,370
so much for me.

441
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,310
But she still smiled to me.

442
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,250
But the Goddess is different.

443
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,110
The Goddess doesn't like the flower soup,

444
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,040
nor does she like dew water either.

445
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,100
She doesn't need my company either.

446
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,160
She doesn't even like to sleep anymore.

447
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,470
She won't smile at me anymore.

448
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,200
I'm useless around her,

449
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,150
as if I can only disturb her.

450
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:32,940
Shangque.

451
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,690
Orchid used to ask me

452
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,020
to smile more often.

453
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,870
When you are happy, you should smile.

454
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,860
When you are sad, you should smile even more.

455
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,750
Because once you smile,

456
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,810
you won't feel sad anymore.

457
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,340
She is not right.

458
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,360
Dongfang Qingcang.

459
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,150
Since Orchid has been reborn,

460
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,920
it's time for you to leave Xishan.

461
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,640
You hurt her so much.

462
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,580
Now she doesn't want to recognize you,

463
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,480
why do you still stay here and bother her?

464
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,830
She's not Orchid anymore.

465
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,000
What are you saying?

466
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:35,850
She is

467
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,510
not Orchid anymore.

468
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,070
So you are Changheng, the youngest son of Lord Dong.

469
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,460
Nice to meet you.

470
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:56,730
Yes.

471
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,740
I am Changheng.

472
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,980
I can't believe it's been 30,000 years

473
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,160
since I was sealed away by my clan to avoid disaster.

474
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,130
During these days,

475
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,440
I feel like a lifetime ago

476
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,540
whenever I think about it.

477
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,110
The marriage between you and I

478
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,750
has been delayed for more than 30,000 years.

479
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,150
Now that I've regained my senses,

480
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,420
it's time for the marriage

481
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,190
to be settled.

482
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,520
Goddess,

483
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,750
why did you suddenly mention this?

484
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,470
Our Xilan clan

485
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,610
and the Lord Dong lineage in Shuiyuntian

486
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,090
have protected the peace of the three realms.

487
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,890
This has been the contract for generations

488
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,700
since the ancient times.

489
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,760
It's also the destiny

490
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:43,850
for us to get married.

491
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,120
After we are married,

492
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,760
it'll be our

493
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,230
unescapable responsibility

494
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,290
to guard the three realms and protect the living.

495
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,480
You're pleased, aren't you?

496
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,480
Why should I be pleased?

497
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,910
Orchid has forgotten

498
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,380
all about me.

499
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,950
She only remembers that she is a Goddess with whom you have a marriage contract.

500
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,670
I'm sure

501
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:33,030
you will soon be able to marry her as you wish.

502
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:48,740
Dongfang Qingcang.

503
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,340
What kind of person do you take me for?

504
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,480
Do you think I'm happy

505
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,740
seeing her now?

506
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,720
You love her.

507
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,890
Don't I feel the same?

508
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,360
But at least

509
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,840
you can be with her.

510
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,540
Do you know what you're talking about?

511
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,160
I gave up on her that day in Cangyan Sea

512
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,630
and entrusted her to you.

513
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,430
But what did you do?

514
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,480
Did you protect her well?

515
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:19,780
Dongfang Qingcang.

516
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,660
Listen to me.

517
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,810
I hope Orchid can come back

518
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,750
just like you.

519
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,230
God Chidi, you're so powerful.

520
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,870
As the God of War of Shuiyuntian,

521
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,590
you've never lost a battle.

522
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,350
Besides, you're also the most merciful and just,

523
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,200
considerate of the people.

524
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,500
And you never kill innocent people.

525
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,140
I've been reading history since I was young,

526
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,440
so I admire you the most.

527
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,000
God, now that you've returned to life

528
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,050
and I get to talk to you,

529
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,070
it's like a dream for me.

530
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:11,010
