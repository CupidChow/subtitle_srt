[Love Between Fairy and Devil]

3
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,000
[Episode 30]

4
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,940
So beautiful.

5
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,460
Fairy,

6
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,220
look how beautiful this fabric is.

7
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:51,580
It suits you.

8
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,340
I want this.

9
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,860
Take the Fairy's measurements.

10
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,020
The fabric for the wedding dress is ready.

11
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,250
The wedding is coming.

12
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,450
Only the phoenix crown is not ready.

13
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,020
Have you prepared it?

14
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,580
Phoenix crown?

15
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,260
Actually,

16
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,810
all the other things for the wedding are prepared by the Silent Moon Palace.

17
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,390
Only the phoenix crown for the Moon Queen

18
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,240
needs to be prepared by yourself.

19
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,669
I should prepare it myself?

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,670
Yes.

21
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,780
Previous Moon Queens all came from well-known families

22
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,000
of Cangyan Sea.

23
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,640
The wedding phoenix crown

24
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,570
represents their families.

25
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,590
What do you mean?

26
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,480
Are you looking down on orphans?

27
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,490
Or do you look down on the new Moon Queen because she is not from a prominent family?

28
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,880
Please forgive us.

29
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,350
We didn't mean that.

30
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,110
Jieli.

31
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,120
Don't get mad.

32
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,710
They're just answering questions.

33
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,760
Stand up, please.

34
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,530
Sit down.

35
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,880
Phoenix crown?

36
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,329
No problem.

37
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,630
I can prepare the phoenix crown myself.

38
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,810
How are you going to prepare it?

39
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,490
I don't have such valuable thing like the

40
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,670
phoenix crown in my treasure collection.

41
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,770
I've made up my mind.

42
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,870
I can weave the phoenix crown

43
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,140
with fresh flowers and tender grass.

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,320
It costs little, and it's beautiful.

45
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,920
It won't be worse than the previous ones.

46
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,010
What do you think?

47
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:05,680
It's too ordinary.

48
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,410
Don't you feel embarrassed?

49
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,630
How can it be embarrassing?

50
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,700
Do you remember

51
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,460
the flowers in my garden?

52
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,060
Back then,

53
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,030
when I first came to Cangyan Sea,

54
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,550
Wooden Head built the Arbiter Hall for me

55
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,160
and planted those flowers for me.

56
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,350
The flowers will bloom in a few days.

57
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,290
I'll make the best phoenix crown with them.

58
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,290
Fairy,

59
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,510
you really don't know

60
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,900
your own origin?

61
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,240
I don't know.

62
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,720
But it doesn't matter anymore.

63
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,030
I don't want to know

64
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,040
who I was before.

65
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,510
I only know

66
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,350
from now on,

67
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,660
I'll be Dongfang Qingcang's wife.

68
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,550
Yes.

69
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,810
The Moon Queen of

70
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,730
Cangyan Sea

71
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,870
is much more distinguished than those aristocrats.

72
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,300
Speaking of which,

73
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,570
you should urge the lord.

74
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,540
He has been busy recently.

75
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,180
We've been trying to take his measurements

76
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,950
and make the wedding clothes for him,

77
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,370
but we didn't see him.

78
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:13,850
By the way,

79
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,610
please take Jieli's measurements.

80
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,959
She's getting married soon.

81
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,260
Make her a wedding dress too.

82
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:18,810
Yes.

83
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,730
No, no.

84
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,620
Why not?

85
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,630
We are sisters.

86
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,890
Sisters should share

87
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,940
weal and woe.

88
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,530
Hurry up.

89
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,320
I really don't want it.

90
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,520
I said I don't want it.

91
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:33,970
Jieli.

92
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:39,760
Jieli.

93
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:42,950
Jieli.

94
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,000
Jieli.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,140
Jieli, what's wrong?

96
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,060
Orchid,

97
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,360
stop being so nice to me.

98
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:50,180
I'm not a good friend at all.

99
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,150
I pretended to be close to you

100
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,210
because I wanted to cheat you into buying my medicine.

101
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,810
Actually your immortal root can't be cured.

102
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,750
You're stupid.

103
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,050
You always trust me.

104
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,580
You scared me to death.

105
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,750
Just because of this?

106
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,150
This is already an old story.

107
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,250
Besides, it's good to tell me the lie.

108
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,810
Everyone said

109
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,490
my immortal root couldn't be cured.

110
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,710
Only you said there was hope.

111
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,220
Hearing that,

112
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,650
I felt more relieved

113
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,860
since there was hope.

114
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,430
I was willingly deceived by you.

115
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,040
You're really the biggest fool within the three realms!

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,260
So is Shangque.

117
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,280
Shangque and I,

118
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,580
who is more stupid?

119
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,720
You're both stupid.

120
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,430
Smile.

121
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,030
Don't move.

122
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,580
Open your arms.

123
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,260
You've lost weight.

124
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,070
Your back is not as straight as before.

125
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,590
Have you been tired recently?

126
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,350
I promised you

127
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,120
I won't lie to you again.

128
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,130
The war is coming.

129
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,160
This time,

130
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,430
it is the greatest war between the Moon Tribe and Fairies.

131
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,320
If we can't stop them in the Xuanxu Realm,

132
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,460
they can head straight into

133
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,100
the Ninth Youxian County.

134
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,780
Now the number of the Moon Tribe

135
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,460
is only 80,000.

136
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,400
Besides,

137
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,550
I have lost the Hellfire.

138
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,820
How many days do we have until the war?

139
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,470
Three to five days.

140
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,350
That's enough.

141
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,280
What?

142
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,010
Enough time to marry me.

143
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,950
Didn't you set the wedding date

144
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,090
ten days after that day?

145
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,560
It'll be three days from now.

146
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,360
Orchid.

147
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,280
Changheng has been pardoned by Lord Yunzhong

148
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,250
and restored as the God of War.

149
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,580
We can keep our wedding

150
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,760
as simple as possible.

151
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,110
No need to be extravagant.

152
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,330
No need to invite guests.

153
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,520
Let's have the simplest feast

154
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,880
and ask Shangque and Jieli

155
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,140
to be our witnesses.

156
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,070
You're not a member of the Moon Tribe.

157
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,400
You don't have to stay here.

158
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,210
But you have to make a new wedding outfit anyway.

159
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,310
Otherwise, it's not proper.

160
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,290
Orchid.

161
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,360
Besides no lies to me,

162
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,820
do you remember what else you promised me?

163
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,780
Have you forgotten?

164
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,330
I haven't.

165
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,169
No matter what happens,

166
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,620
we have to face it together.

167
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,520
In two days,

168
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,960
I'll be your wife.

169
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,970
Cangyan Sea is my home.

170
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,790
I'm not going anywhere.

171
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,570
Why did you do this to me?

172
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,810
Wooden Head.

173
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,750
Wooden Head.

174
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,330
Why did you do this to me?

175
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,570
Why did you do this to me?

176
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,810
Why did you do this to me?

177
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,790
Don't go.

178
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,380
Why did you do this to me?

179
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,570
I'm gonna kill you.

180
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,750
Why did you lie to me?

181
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,840
Didn't you say I am the one you love most?

182
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,690
Why her?

183
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,910
Don't abandon me.

184
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,080
Don't go.

185
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,720
Don't leave me alone.

186
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,410
Why did you lie to me?

187
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,670
Lady Wanqing,

188
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,640
you are still alive.

189
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,650
I'm gonna kill you.

190
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,550
I'm gonna kill you.

191
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,520
Lady Wanqing,

192
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,030
who are they?

193
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,130
They are me.

194
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,020
But they are also not me.

195
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,820
They and I

196
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,460
are just memories of one life.

197
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,700
What do you mean?

198
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,010
There's no time to explain.

199
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,320
In this place,

200
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,080
I can only stay sober for a moment.

201
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,520
Run!

202
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,650
Don't get swallowed by them.

203
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,200
Remember,

204
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,850
the loss of your life is the gain of mine.

205
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,030
If I can come back to life,

206
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,590
you will die.

207
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,400
All the secrets are...

208
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,540
Why her?

209
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,300
Lady Wanqing,

210
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,770
Lady Wanqing,

211
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,540
Wooden Head.

212
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,100
Wooden Head. Help me!

213
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,360
Wooden Head!

214
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,910
Wooden Head! Where are you?

215
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,010
Wooden Head!

216
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,350
Help me!

217
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,400
-I'm here. I'm here. -Wooden Head.

218
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,090
It's okay.

219
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:24,990
-Wooden Head. -It's okay.

220
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,580
Dongfang Qingcang.

221
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,040
Who's there?

222
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,010
You're finally here.

223
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,230
What is this place?

224
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,050
This is the most secretive

225
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,690
and darkest corner in your heart.

226
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,210
And I am

227
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,010
the owner of this place.

228
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,910
You're playing tricks.

229
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,580
This is just an illusion.

230
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,740
I'll break the spell

231
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,500
and find out your real body.

232
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,120
You can't kill me.

233
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,020
If you can still manipulate the Hellfire,

234
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,620
you might be able to dispel the evil spirit

235
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,470
and escape from here.

236
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,610
But now,

237
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,980
you can't do anything.

238
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,570
You are too weak

239
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,220
to trick me.

240
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,400
Then,

241
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,170
why didn't you tell her about the Bone Orchid?

242
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,160
Shut up!

243
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,080
You are too angry.

244
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:17,490
People with choices won't be so angry.

245
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,140
You must be

246
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,120
very painful now.

247
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,220
If you choose your lover,

248
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,020
the whole Moon Tribe will be destroyed.

249
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,280
If you choose your tribe,

250
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,930
your lover will die.

251
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,580
This is the saddest thing

252
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,130
in the world.

253
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,220
But

254
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,330
I can save her

255
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,840
and teach you how to release the 100,000 soldiers.

256
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,290
As long as you cooperate with me,

257
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,140
your tribe and your lover

258
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:49,650
will no longer be a either-or choice.

259
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,450
Did you have a nightmare again?

260
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,930
Just now,

261
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,400
I had a nightmare too.

262
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,580
I dreamed of Lady Wanqing.

263
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,430
In my dream,

264
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,730
there were many people

265
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,500
who look exactly like her.

266
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,630
She also said

267
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,150
the loss of my life is the gain of hers.

268
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,090
If she comes back to life, I'll die.

269
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,490
She said all the secrets were...

270
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,050
It's just an ordinary dream.

271
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,390
Don't take it too seriously.

272
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,990
No.

273
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,670
This dream is real.

274
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,440
Do you want to hear the nightmare I just had?

275
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,920
I just dreamed that

276
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,700
you turned into

277
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,260
a fat pig.

278
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,710
We didn't have much time.

279
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,900
The embroidery on the wedding dress is not too delicate.

280
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,320
What a pity.

281
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,710
It's good enough.

282
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,180
Thank you very much.

283
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,860
Don't say that.

284
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,080
By the way,

285
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,170
starting from tomorrow,

286
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,600
you can't be called Fairy anymore.

287
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,490
You should be called the Moon Queen.

288
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,600
Fairy, have some tea.

289
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,190
Leave it.

290
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,150
Orchid.

291
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,580
Lord Changheng.

292
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,510
What are you doing here?

293
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,390
I'm taking you home.

294
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,660
My lord, please behave yourself.

295
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,930
The Moon Supreme Lord and I

296
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,730
will get married tomorrow.

297
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,250
Cangyan Sea is my home now.

298
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:45,380
No.

299
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,200
You are not marrying him.

300
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,880
Lord Changheng,

301
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,230
I've made myself clear

302
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,990
at the riverside of the Memory Loss River.

303
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,760
That's not what I meant.

304
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,480
Orchid,

305
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,000
don't you always want to know your origin

306
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,680
and who you are?

307
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,280
I finally know it now.

308
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,119
Let me tell you.

309
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,040
I don't want to know.

310
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,640
I appreciate

311
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,270
your kindness.

312
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,290
It doesn't matter

313
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,140
who I was before.

314
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:13,569
I only know

315
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,420
I'll be Dongfang Qingcang's wife

316
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,440
and the Moon Queen of Cangyan Sea.

317
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:19,910
Now,

318
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,510
the war between the Moon Tribe and Fairies is coming.

319
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,400
You should go back now.

320
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,040
It's inappropriate

321
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,800
for you and I

322
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
to meet.

323
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,200
Follow me.

324
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:37,930
What are you doing?

325
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,230
Lord Changheng.

326
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,220
Lord Changheng.

327
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,430
Let go of me!

328
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,490
Where are you taking me?

329
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,300
Lord Changheng.

330
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:53,930
Let go of me!

331
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,060
Orchid, calm down!

332
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,840
Where am I?

333
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,350
This is the ruin

334
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,570
of the Xilan Clan after it was destroyed.

335
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,720
Everyone that has learned the history knows that

336
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,200
during the war 30,000 years ago,

337
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,200
the Xilan Clan was killed by the Moon Tribe.

338
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,280
This ruin

339
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,470
is soaked with the blood of the Xilan people.

340
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:25,810
Orchid.

341
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,700
Your name

342
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,100
is Xi Yun.

343
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,900
Your real identity

344
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,080
is the Goddess of Xishan.

345
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,310
The Moon Tribe is your enemy.

346
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,160
Your parents and your people

347
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,720
were all killed by them.

348
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,920
But...

349
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,940
I don't know them.

350
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,980
What did you say?

351
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,420
I said

352
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,820
I don't know these Xilan people.

353
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,940
Just now,

354
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,210
I tried hard to feel

355
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,720
the sadness of this land.

356
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,030
But I've only felt this sadness

357
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,430
in another place.

358
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,450
That's how war is.

359
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,220
Many people die

360
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,190
because of war.

361
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,050
The extermination of a clan keeps happening.

362
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,270
The hatred will never stop.

363
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,080
But the pain

364
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:58,960
only goes to those

365
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,060
who want to live.

366
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:01,900
Orchid,

367
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,870
why don't you understand?

368
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,050
Although you don't know

369
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,520
or don't remember

370
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,190
your parents and your people,

371
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,290
they died because they wanted to protect you.

372
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,800
Lord Changheng.

373
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,610
I am Orchid,

374
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,950
not the Goddess of Xishan.

375
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,720
It's like when

376
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,020
you are in Lucheng City,

377
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,620
you are Xiao Run, not Changheng.

378
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,390
Xiao Run doesn't need to bear

379
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,070
the burden of Changheng,

380
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,620
because they are not the same person.

381
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,470
In this world,

382
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,000
what is real and what is fake?

383
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,350
I only know

384
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,260
I love Dongfang Qingcang.

385
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,770
It's real.

386
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,370
He loves me.

387
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,260
It's also real.

388
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,450
It's realer than anything.

389
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,390
That's enough.

390
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,610
But...

391
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,590
Old friend,

392
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,770
we meet again.

393
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,620
God Xuanwu.

394
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,510
It seems that

395
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,320
you already know your name.

396
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,130
Am I

397
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,270
really the Goddess Xi Yun?

398
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,120
Tomorrow's wedding is not your destiny.

399
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,960
Why?

400
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,390
You are the Goddess of Xishan.

401
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,330
Your love is selfless and inclusive.

402
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,610
You are destined to take your responsibility.

403
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,890
You are destined to cease hatred and protect the people.

404
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,820
Why?

405
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,570
I don't understand.

406
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,220
Cease hatred and protect the people?

407
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,560
What does it have to do with

408
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,740
being Dongfang Qingcang's wife?

409
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,010
Why can't I love someone and love the people at the same time?

410
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,530
Why must you force me to make a choice?

411
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,410
I'm not convinced.

412
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,670
Old friend,

413
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,320
you came too early.

414
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,950
You haven't seen

415
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,410
what you are supposed to see.

416
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,520
You haven't lost

417
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,120
what you are supposed to lose.

418
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,510
Leave.

419
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,500
We'll meet again.

420
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,240
Did you meet God Xuanwu?

421
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,750
Have you changed your mind?

422
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,610
I won't follow the so-called destiny

423
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,000
or fate.

424
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,890
I am Orchid,

425
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,150
not the Goddess Xi Yun.

426
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,200
I need to find him.

427
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,360
The war is coming. There's a gap in military strength.

428
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,460
Dongfang Qingcang has no Hellfire now.

429
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,720
The Moon Tribe will eventually be defeated.

430
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,500
You will be in danger if you go back now.

431
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,000
Orchid.

432
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,070
I can't let you go back.

433
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,800
Lord Changheng.

434
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,750
Are you really going to stop me?

435
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,260
My lord,

436
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,360
you are the God of War.

437
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,600
I am just a grass whose immortal root has been broken.

438
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,610
If you insist on stopping me,

439
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,630
there's nothing I can do.

440
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,900
But I will never give in.

441
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,590
Just like that day at the riverside of Memory Loss River,

442
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,130
even if I would be killed by thousands of Spirit-Vanishing Arrows,

443
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,940
I would never turn back.

444
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,270
Thank you, my lord.

445
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,150
That day,

446
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,810
Dongfang Qingcang saw what Danyin saw too.

447
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,890
He knows you're the Goddess Xi Yun.

448
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,820
But he didn't tell you anything.

449
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,260
If he really loves you,

450
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,060
why would he hide it?

451
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,040
You said he loves you.

452
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,800
Realer than anything.

453
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,990
Why did he put you in danger?

454
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,050
Orchid!

455
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,010
My lord.

456
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,020
My lord.

457
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:41,990
I know it.

458
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:43,670
My lord.

459
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,230
Fairy was taken away by Changheng.

460
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,600
Why aren't you worried?

461
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,380
She will come back.

462
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,320
Will Changheng allow Fairy to come back?

463
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,170
Yes.

464
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,970
Because I know them well.

465
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,540
One

466
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,230
was my best friend.

467
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,960
The other

468
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,950
was the woman I wanted to marry.

469
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,830
After tomorrow,

470
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,400
you will be the sinner who destroys the Moon Tribe.

471
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,430
And I didn't stop you.

472
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,830
I am a sinner too.

473
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,430
But

474
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,370
you don't care, do you?

475
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,060
As long as you can spend time with her...

476
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,740
I've decided to sacrifice her.

477
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,380
Wooden Head.

478
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,270
Wooden Head.

479
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,090
Where are you?

480
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,170
What are you doing?

481
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,390
Take her down!

482
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,440
Go.

483
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,490
Let go of me!

484
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:43,830
Let go of me!

485
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,140
Let go of me!

486
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:45,980
Xunfeng.

487
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,940
Let go of me!

488
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,870
Let go of me!

489
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,340
Let go of me!

490
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,410
Xunfeng.

491
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,560
I know you don't like me.

492
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,980
But how dare you do this to me?

493
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,500
Aren't you afraid of the Moon Supreme...

494
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,340
You're wrong.

495
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,370
I respect you very much.

496
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,860
Then why did you do this?

497
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,080
Now,

498
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,380
the war is coming.

499
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,440
The lord is worried about the war.

500
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,540
You are not helping him,

501
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,140
but you're picking on me here.

502
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,100
Why?

503
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,530
You're wrong again.

504
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,810
I was ordered to imprison you

505
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,460
to help my brother.

506
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,430
You're crazy.

507
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,320
I want to see him.

508
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,150
My brother won't see you.

509
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,590
Keep an eye on her.

510
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,050
Yes.

511
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,330
Xunfeng, what are you doing?

512
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,290
Let me out!

513
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:53,760
Xunfeng,

514
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,220
Dongfang Qingcang.

515
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,670
Dongfang Qingcang.

516
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:10,900
My lord,

517
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,750
didn't you stop marching around

518
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,920
and getting involved in wars?

519
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,180
Why

520
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,990
did you get the armor back?

521
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,780
Where is Orchid?

522
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,760
Don't worry.

523
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,120
She's recuperating in Silent Moon Palace.

524
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,350
When the war starts,

525
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,010
she will sacrifice her life.

526
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,480
If you want to start the war now,

527
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,300
I will fight to the end.

528
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,380
Since the war between the Moon Tribe and Fairies is inevitable,

529
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,610
I will lead the fairy army

530
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,680
to bring back the Goddess of Xishan.

531
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,550
So whether you are willing or not,

532
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,530
this war

533
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,960
will happen.

534
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,630
And you

535
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,400
will get involved.

536
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,980
You are destined to join the war.

537
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,030
Because we are the same.

538
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,630
I have no choice.

539
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,070
You also have no choice.

540
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,590
The weather is usually fine here.

541
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,570
Now it's quite interesting.

542
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,400
It's just lightning.

543
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,250
I'm not afraid.

544
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,990
The food is so greasy.

545
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,840
I hate all of them.

546
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,540
Xunfeng has gone too far.

547
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,180
He remembers what I hate to eat so clearly.

548
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,910
Is the food ordered by Dongfang Qingcang?

549
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,010
He knew I was locked up here.

550
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,370
Why didn't he come to save me?

551
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,510
I know it.

552
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,310
He must have his own difficulties,

553
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,740
so he has to secretly convey his affection.

554
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,000
Luckily, I'm smart.

555
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,290
Is there any signal in the food?

556
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,520
There is none.

557
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,040
But given his personality,

558
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,390
I don't think he will make things implicit.

559
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,620
It doesn't make sense.

560
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,300
Wooden Head,

561
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,920
don't try to fool me this time.

562
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,950
You have to give me a good reason

563
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,090
so that I will consider

564
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,610
forgiving you.

565
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:22,830
-Open it. -Yes.

566
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,610
What's that sound?

567
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,340
Wooden Head is here.

568
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:35,730
Stop!

569
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,200
Stop!

570
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,470
Xunfeng, are you crazy?

571
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,950
You keep bullying me with false orders.

572
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,970
Aren't you afraid that the Moon Supreme Lord will get angry?

573
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,190
My brother said

574
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,630
you don't need to make the phoenix crown.

575
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,070
You don't need these flowers here.

576
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,330
How did you...

577
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,380
That's right.

578
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,770
You are wondering how I know

579
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,090
what you and my brother have said privately, right?

580
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,630
Of course he told me himself.

581
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,530
He also asked me

582
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,250
to remove these flowers.

583
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,290
That's impossible.

584
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,660
I don't believe it.

585
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,270
I heard you're not sleeping well these days.

586
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,540
So I prepared this orchid for you.

587
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,680
But this is not an ordinary orchid.

588
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,870
I made it with the power of my primordial spirit.

589
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,430
Add this in.

590
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:28,980
Is it enough?

591
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,030
This is the ancient sword of Chengying.

592
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,050
Only by killing you with it

593
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,160
can the Heart Curse be broken.

594
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,220
This sword was broken into

595
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,980
countless pieces.

596
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,170
Every fragment of the sword

597
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,360
was found by my brother

598
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,580
from the three realms.

599
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,440
When the war between the Moon Tribe and Fairies starts,

600
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,970
my brother will kill you

601
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,240
with this sword.

602
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,910
Let's go.

603
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,000
Jieli.

604
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,580
Jieli.

605
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,010
what's going on?

606
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,310
I also want to ask you.

607
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,909
What's wrong with the lord?

608
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:10,920
Why did he lock you up out of the blue?

609
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,179
The palace is also heavily guarded.

610
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:14,320
It's so frightening.

611
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,889
Is it really his order?

612
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,570
Orchid.

613
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,170
Don't be sad.

614
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,699
Where is he?

615
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:31,620
I want to see him.

616
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,179
No.

617
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,750
I sneaked into the palace to visit you.

618
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,429
It's already risky.

619
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,270
If I let you out...

620
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,030
Jieli.

621
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,550
You've seen

622
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,469
everything I've been through

623
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,820
with Dongfang Qingcang.

624
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,880
He promised me

625
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:48,969
no matter what happens,

626
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:50,350
we will face it together.

627
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,290
I don't know what is happening now,

628
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,469
but I know he must be in a difficult situation.

629
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,600
Take me to him.

630
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,440
I beg you.

631
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,790
But Orchid.

632
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,430
The lord treated you like this.

633
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,790
Does it mean that he doesn't love you anymore?

634
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,020
Impossible.

635
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:07,820
Jieli.

636
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,090
Take me to meet him.

637
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,560
I'll give you the antidote to the Heart Eroding Pill for three more days.

638
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,240
Three days later,

639
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,630
if you fail to bring out the Goddess of Xishan,

640
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,500
the poison will kill you and your man.

641
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,380
Also,

642
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,400
he will suffer a more painful death than you.

643
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,050
Go.

644
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,100
Jieli.

645
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,540
What are you doing?

646
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,840
Where are you taking her?

647
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,310
Move.

648
00:35:58,850 --> 00:35:59,320
Jieli.

649
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,460
I know you want to save Fairy,

650
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,390
but the lord has made his decision.

651
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,940
You can't disobey his order, Jieli.

652
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:08,850
Jieli,

653
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,110
come back with me.

654
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,250
Jieli.

655
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,340
Jieli.

656
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,560
Well done.

657
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,770
People from Haishi City.

658
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:33,840
Jieli.

659
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,700
They forced you, right?

660
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,100
Don't be afraid.

661
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,610
I'll protect you.

662
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,690
Jieli!

663
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,200
Where is his antidote?

664
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,880
Hand her over first.

665
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,260
I don't trust you.

666
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,860
Give me the antidote first.

667
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,130
You

668
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,570
don't deserve to make conditions.

669
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,230
Yes, I don't deserve to,

670
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,830
but the Gold Eroding Powder does.

671
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,020
I stole it from the Moon Supreme Lord's Pavilion of Spiritual Treasures.

672
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,190
Among the three realms,

673
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,670
only this can break the Bone Orchid.

674
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,360
You are asking for death.

675
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,420
My life is cheap.

676
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,390
I betrayed my lover

677
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,570
and my sister.

678
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,540
Where else can I stay within the three realms?

679
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,140
Do you think I'm afraid of death?

680
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,870
I don't know why you need the Bone Orchid.

681
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,840
But since you value it so much,

682
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,240
I'll make sure you never get it.

683
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,000
Stop!

684
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,180
Sugar powder?

685
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,710
How dare you lie to me?

686
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,390
What?

687
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,000
She ran away?

688
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,500
Yes.

689
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,970
General Shangque has gone after her.

690
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,690
Where is my brother now?

691
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,330
The lord is in the training ground.

692
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,090
Report!

693
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,950
The Shuiyuntian Army is gathering at the area around the Memory Loss River, the Northernmost Ocean,

694
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,840
and the border of the southern regions.

695
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:13,560
Father,

696
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,050
when the Ninth Youxian County was about to collapse

697
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,270
and you had to remove my emotions,

698
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,710
did you feel the same way?

699
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,370
The war between the Moon Tribe and Fairies

700
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,460
is inevitable.

701
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,770
For my people,

702
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,210
do I have to sacrifice my beloved?

703
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,310
Is there no other choice?

704
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,870
I’m not convinced.

705
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,640
I knew

706
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,650
you would come to me again.

707
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,730
Stop your tricks.

708
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,980
Why do you think I showed up?

709
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:06,940
Because

710
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,210
you have made your choice.

711
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,870
Nonsense!

712
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,550
Do you really think

713
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,950
the evil spirit only represents massacre and hatred?

714
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,720
I was born in ancient times.

715
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,110
I am everywhere.

716
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,630
I'm the darkest and the most intense desire

717
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,530
hidden in everyone's heart.

718
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:32,770
Dongfang Qingcang, you are the one who summoned me.

719
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:33,490
Shut up.

720
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,080
Shut up.

721
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,910
You know it so clearly.

722
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,800
Except me,

723
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,220
there is no other way

724
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,910
to protect your lover and your people.

725
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,090
Only I

726
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,270
can give you the perfect solution.

727
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,080
So that you don't have to make a choice.

728
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,250
Only I

729
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:54,400
am the cure for all your pain.

730
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,250
Shut up.

731
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,110
Dongfang Qingcang.

732
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,100
What happened?

733
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,700
I am really worried about you.

734
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,080
Is this

735
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,320
the evil spirit?

736
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,830
That's right.

737
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:36,990
The evil spirit is the most evil thing within the three realms.

738
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,060
It matches my noble status.

739
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,900
It can help me

740
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,580
restore my army of 100,000.

741
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,140
Brother, please don't.

742
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,200
The evil spirit is extremely vicious.

743
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,710
If something goes wrong,

744
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,090
it will invade the soul.

745
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,320
Only cowards will fear sharp blades.

746
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:53,870
My body is intact

747
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,180
and my primordial spirit won't vanish.

748
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,280
Controlling the evil spirit

749
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,380
is easy to me.

750
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,970
No one can stop me.

751
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,530
Impossible.

752
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,360
Impossible.

753
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,930
So many innocent people were killed by the evil spirit.

754
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,450
You saw it with your own eyes.

755
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,150
You even cleansed

756
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,620
the primordial spirits that can't rest in peace.

757
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,020
You care about the people.

758
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,670
And you are kind and merciful.

759
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,380
Why would you...

760
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,280
Kind and merciful?

761
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:36,380
Ridiculous.

762
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,000
I am the supreme lord within the three realms.

763
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,590
What?

764
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,360
Because of the Heart Curse,

765
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,750
our lives are codependent.

766
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,150
So I have to pretend to be nice to you.

767
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,120
You took it seriously.

768
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,010
That's not true.

769
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:55,660
You told me

770
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,180
the same lie before.

771
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:01,070
I won't trust you again.

772
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:03,430
You're not that kind of person.

773
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,430
Changheng took you away

774
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,030
to tell you

775
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,620
your real identity, right?

776
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,530
I knew you were the Goddess of Xishan long ago.

777
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,140
I pretended to be nice to you

778
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:27,620
to take advantage of your power and

779
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,980
recuperate the primordial spirit of the Chidi woman in the Bone Orchid.

780
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,290
When her primordial spirit is complete,

781
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,100
you will die.

782
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:37,910
From the very beginning,

783
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,260
I have planned everything.

784
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,700
You thought I gave you the Bone Orchid because I liked you?

785
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:45,210
Foolish.

786
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,120
The Bone Orchid will consume your life

787
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,430
until you die.

788
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,520
Remember,

789
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,830
the loss of your life is the gain of mine.

790
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,100
If I can come back to life,

791
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,150
you will die.

792
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,920
All the secrets are in...
