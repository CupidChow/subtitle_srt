00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,220
It's stopped.

5
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,020
You indeed make this thunder and lightning gale on purpose.

6
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,420
How dare you set me up?

7
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,500
Although I have minimum power,

8
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,900
luckily, I am wise.

9
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,790
Don't waste your efforts.

10
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,730
You can't swap our bodies just by doing this.

11
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,090
Could it be…

12
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,660
Lightning.

13
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,580
That's right.

14
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,480
There must be lightning to swap our souls.

15
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,100
Fortunately, I figured it out

16
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,100
a little bit earlier than you.

17
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,020
It's just a little trick.

18
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,630
What's so hard about it?

19
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,660
It's just lightning.

20
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,500
I'll just summon it up again.

21
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,180
Can do nothing about it, right?

22
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,430
Can't use your magic power anymore, right?

23
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,660
I thought you were so arrogant just now.

24
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,860
I...

25
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,700
I’m not afraid to tell you

26
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,620
that no matter how powerful you are,

27
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,700
You!

28
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,440
as long as you’re inside this loser body of mine,

29
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,579
you'll be unable to do anything.

30
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,310
I'm unable to do anything.

31
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,180
What's to be proud of?

32
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,040
Thank you.

33
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,380
Swap it back now,

34
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,700
or I'll kill you right now.

35
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:13,940
You!

36
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,140
How dare you be rude to my lord?

37
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,380
Shangque, how dare you!

38
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,100
My lord.

39
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,660
This fairy has offended Heaven's authority.

40
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,579
What should we do to her?

41
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,140
Lock up

42
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,820
this audacious little fairy.

43
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,500
Yes.

44
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,490
How dare you!

45
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,940
Let go of me!

46
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,880
Do you know who I am?

47
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,750
Greetings to my lord.

48
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,590
Get up.

49
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,540
You don't have to kneel, get up.

50
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,060
So, being the Moon Supreme seems dignified.

51
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,010
No wonder Dongfang Qingcang

52

always looks like he's a great man.

Greetings to my lord.

00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,700
Get up, get up.

55

00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,140
Please move to the main hall to attend the ceremony.

59
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,860
Ceremony?

60
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:41,400
What ceremony?

61
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,890

65
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,420
Today is the ceremony held by the ministers

66
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,500
for your return to the Cangyan Sea

67
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,060
and officially taking over the Moon Tribe.

The ministers are all waiting for you in the main hall.

69
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,970
I just have to pretend to be the Moon Supreme.

70
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,730
Let me fool them first.

71
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,260
I remember now.

72
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:13,730
Let's go.

73
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,020
Let me guess,

74
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,810
is the main hall on the left, or right?

75
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:22,970
My lord.

76
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,610
You, lead the way.

What are you waiting for?

78
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,260
Hurry up and go.

79
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,190
Yes.

Please rise.

87
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,380
To congratulate my lord on regaining control of the Moon Tribe,

88
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,289
I have prepared a great gift.

89
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:34,980
Bring him up.

90
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
He is…

91
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,750
My lord.

92
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:52,620
For 30,000 years,

93
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,780
the Fairies have repeatedly invaded the Moon Tribe.

94
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,380
They've been trying to kill us.

95
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,100
Recently, they've sent spies to Cangyan Sea

96
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,650
to spy on the military.

97
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,780
You said he's from the Fairies?

98
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,420
That's right.

99
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,540
This man is the leader of the spies.

100
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,660
Now he's captured by me.

101

This is my welcome ceremony.

What are you doing here with a fairy?

104
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,150
I'm presenting the spy

105
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,580
to follow the ancient ritual of making a fairy sacrifice to our flag

106
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,300
and celebrating my lord's return

107
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,100
with the blood of the fairies.

108
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,450
Please do it, my lord.

109
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,260
You asked me to kill him?

110
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,340
I mean,

111
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,300
this is a great day.

112
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,540
It’s not good to see blood, is it?

113
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,900
My lord.

114
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,220
On such a joyous occasion,

115
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,780
what could be a better boost to our morale

116
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,740
than my lord's victory over a fairy?

117
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,010
My lord, please kill the fairy to boost the morale of the army.

118
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,620
I mean,

119
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,140
if you're willing to submit to the Cangyan Sea.

120
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,500
I will spare your life.

121
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,700
How's that?

122
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,260
Surrender.

123

How dare you!

124
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,360
How dare you desecrate my lord?

My lord.

126
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,690
No need to talk to him anymore.

127
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,060
Kill him.

128
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,860
Kill! Kill! Kill!

129
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,740
Good.

130
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,580
You have the courage and grace.

131
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,060
I'll satisfy you.

132
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,140
Someone!

133
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,340
Take him away.

134
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,170
No need, what kind of trick are you trying to play?

135
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,550
As a member of the Fairies,

136
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,250
I am loyal to Shuiyuntian.

137
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,860
I’d rather die than surrender to your Moon Tribe people!

138
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,820
Although we are at odds with Shuiyuntian,

139
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,340
we also admire a true, resolute warrior.

140
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,880
If you become a traitor today,

141
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,100
I'd have beheaded you on the spot.

142
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,780
But you're willing to die and not give in.

143
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,050
That has changed my mind.

144
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,020
Bring him back to Shuiyuntian.

145
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,900
My lord.

146
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,380
I am the Moon Supreme of the Three Realms.

147
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,460
Today, if I kill

148
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,810
a true warrior who has no power to fight back,

149
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,540
wouldn't Three Realms hold me to ridicule if word got out?

150
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,100
If I want to kill,

151
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,780
I will do it on the battlefield

152
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,390
righteously.

153
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,100
You can go now.

154
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,260
Go back and tell your Lord Yunzhong,

155
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,340
when we meet in future battles,

156
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,770
I will not be lenient.

157
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,860
Take him away.

158
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,220
Yes.

159
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:51,630
Yes.

160
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,500
Oh my god.

161
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,980
These people are so scary,

162
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,980
fighting and killing,

163
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,020
fierce and vicious.

164
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,880
It doesn’t seem easy to be the Moon Supreme.

165
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,500
My lord.

166
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,820
You still have some business to finish.

167
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,540
Do you want to…

168
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,900
What did you say?

169
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,500
I'm tired.

170
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,820
I need to go back and rest now.

171
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,340
Yes.

172
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,820
Stop there!

173
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,100
I want to see the Moon Supreme.

174
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,090
People from Shuiyuntian are so daring

175
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,660
that you're still thinking of

176
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,770
throwing yourself at my lord even now.

177
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,810
What a pity.

178
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,300
How could my lord like such

179
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,020
a mediocre woman?

180
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,510
Yes.

181
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,460
Let go of me.

182
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,070
How dare you tease me?

183
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:00,980
Damn you!

184
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,540
Open the door!

185
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,700
My lord, take a good rest.

186
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:26,690
Wait.

187
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,350
Who are they?

188
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:31,900
My lord.

189
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,780
They are your guards.

190
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,980
I know my lord is very powerful.

191
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,100
But you've just returned to the Cangyan Sea.

192
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,980
Everything is still in turmoil.

193
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,820
I'm afraid there might be a hidden plot.

194
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,380
So I've specially arranged…

195
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,860
With so many men in my bedroom,

196
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,620
how can I possibly rest?

197
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:47,820
Yes.

198
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,040
Stand down.

199
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,550
Yes.

200
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:49,980
Yes.

201
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,300
I am in his body.

202
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,300
How can I go back to Shuiyuntian?

203
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,210
How will people believe that Dongfang Qingcang

204
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,160
swapped bodies with a little fairy?

205
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,980
What should I do?

206
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,220
Even if they do,

207
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,420
how can you prove that you are not from the Moon Tribe,

208
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,980
nor a spy of the Moon Tribe?

209
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,500
My lord.

210
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,370
Oh my god.

211
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,740
My lord.

212
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,900
My lord.

213
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,060
My lord.

214
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,070
My lord.

215
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,500
After all, she is the woman brought back by the Moon Supreme.

216
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,220
If you kill her…

217
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,060
If we don’t kill her

218
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,460
and she tells on us to the Moon Supreme later,

219
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,650
neither of us can survive.

220
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,220
My lord.

221
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,060
My lord.

222
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,380
We are here to serve you in bed.

223
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,460
All of you, get out.

224
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,579
My lord.

225
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,260
Let me serve you, my lord.

226
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,860
Out of the way! Out of the way!

227
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,380
Get out of the way!

228
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:32,780
Stand down.

229
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,340
Stand down.

230
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,220
Yes.

231
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,860
Yes.

232
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,340
Why didn't my lord

233
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,940
let us serve him?

234
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,340
That's right.

235
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,540
He threw me out.

236
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,340
That's odd.

237
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,300
We shouldn't have come here.

238
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,540
What’s going on?

239
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,400
Lord Shangque.

240
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,960
Lord Shangque.

241
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,460
We went to the bedchamber to serve my lord just now.

242
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,540
But unexpectedly,

243
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,220
my lord threw us out.

244
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,100
You are my lord's only former minister.

245
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,290
You must know my lord.

246
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,980
Have we done something wrong

247
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,260
that angered my lord?

248
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,260
What you don't know is

249
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,540
my lord has never been close to women.

250
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,820
If you are not called in the future,

251
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,420
don't go serve yourselves.

252
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,180
Lord Shangque.

253
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,420
My lord invites you into the room.

254
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:29,580
Now?

255
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:30,940
Yes.

256
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,100
I heard it too.

257
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,940
Is it true?

258
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,500
Is that true?

259
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,770
That's impossible.

260
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,380
Is that true?

261
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,770
Shut up!

262
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,330
If you dare to talk nonsense again,

263
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,550
I'll cut off your tongues.

264
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,660
Greetings to my lord.

265
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,380
Come here.

266
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,020
I'm willing

267
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,080
to die for you, my lord.

268
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,380
I just want to ask you something about the old days.

269
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,700
Why do you look so reluctant?

270
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,930
What does my lord want to ask me?

271
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,150
Let me ask you.

272
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,260
In your eyes,

273
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,090
what kind of person did I use to be?

274
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,150
Did I have any special hobbies

275
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,460
and preferences?

276
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,770
How did I act in general?

277
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,770
Tell me what you think of me.

278
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,580
You can say anything you want.

279
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,260
Why is my lord asking this?

280
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,180
In fact, I suffered some injuries

281
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,740
during the battle.

282
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,180
My memory has been affected.

283
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,800
I can't remember many old things.

284
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,450
Has my lord's magic power been damaged?

285
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,640
Magic power?

286
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,530
Of course, it's damaged.

287
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,300
In fact, the day in Wind Plain,

288
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,450
I used up all my strength

289
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,730
to deter Xunfeng and the others.

290
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,680
Now, my power is intermittent.

291
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,940
I'm afraid I'm no match for the Two Fatuous Kings of the North and South.

292
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,560
My lord.

293
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,430
Does anyone else know about this?

294
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,460
If there is someone else who knows,

295
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,340
I'll go and silence him.

296
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,220
Silence him?

297
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,530
Is it so serious?

298
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,010
No, you're the only one who knows now.

299
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,660
I'm afraid my lord has forgotten.

300
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,020
The Cangyan Sea has always admired the strong.

301
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,260
The two Fatuous Kings of the North and South have surrendered to my lord

302
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,780
for the exact fear of your great power.

303
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,620
If they knew that my lord's power is damaged,

304
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,380
they would turn against you

305
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,220
and take your place.

306
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,180
In that case,

307
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,560
my lord, you'll be

308
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,580
in an even more dangerous situation.

309
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,060
What about your power?

310
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,020
Can you defeat them?

311
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,290
Can you protect me?

312
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,340
I can't win

313
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,140
if I fight alone.

314
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,460
Um...

315
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,340
Why are you here?

316
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,380
What are you waiting for?

317
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,090
Help.

318
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:37,900
My lord.

319
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,340
You!

320
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,420
Get out.

321
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,130
How did you get out of the Wind Prison?

322
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,870
I’m going to make out with the Moon Supreme now.

323
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,320
Are you going to watch from here?

324
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,250
You can’t leave!

325
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,260
Help! Help!

326
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,860
I'm leaving.

327
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,180
Help! Help! Help!

328
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,660
Get up.

329
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,340
Don’t come up.

330
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,860
Help! Help!

331
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,860
I said there should be lightning.

332
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,380
You've kissed and hugged me.

333
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,270
Are we swapped back?

334
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,890
Why don't you just accept the reality

335
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,380
and keep the status quo for now?

336
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,700
Keep the status quo?

337
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,060
You are getting used to it so fast.

338
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:02,950
That's right.

339
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,460
You can even use my body

340
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,980
to find a man to sleep with.

341
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,740
You should be happy.

342
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,720
Should I look for you

343
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,960
rather than someone else?

344
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,500
That's right.

345
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,980
You always pretend to be

346
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,340
so proud and aloof.

347
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,780
I didn't realize you had a lot of women.

348
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,540
Have I ever had a woman?

349
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,580
Yes, you do.

350
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,420
When I say no, I mean no.

351
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,420
You're still pretending.

352
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,580
What is there to deny?

353
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,860
I don't need to prove my innocence to you.

354
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,460
That's right.

355
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,260
Anyway, you’ve already said

356
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,780
you don't have any love for me.

357
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,860
Your affair is none of my business.

358
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,770
I'm not even interested.

359
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,180
It’s good that you know.

360
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,220
You still have the energy to bicker with me.

361
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,220
Are you aware of the situation you and I are in?

362
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,980
Stupid woman.

363
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,990
You've been pretending to be me all day.

364
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,620
Didn't you notice?

365
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,660
Once someone finds out

366
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,820
I've swapped bodies with you

367
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,660
and I'm

368
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,140
a powerless loser now,

369
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,100
you and I will both die.

370
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,660
It's just a fluke

371
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,620
that you're still alive.

372
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,780
You’re scaring me on purpose,

373
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,380
right?

374
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,060
So, what should we do now?

375
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,300
Swap back.

376
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,660
I told you

377
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,730
there is no lightning now.

378
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,290
I have great power.

379
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,900
Now that you've taken my body,

380
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,100
you can't even make a mere lightning bolt…

381
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,740
That's right.

382
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,420
I'll try.

383
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,580
What a loser!

384
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,700
It's not the first day for you to know this.

385
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,460
You can't call up lightning

386
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,700
either now, don't you?

387
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,490
Don’t just accuse me.

388
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,460
Think of a way yourself.

389
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,380
I had watched the sky when I came.

390
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,580
Three days later,

391
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,380
there will be thunder and lightning.

392
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,300
At that time lightning will show up.

393
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,860
But

394
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,460
within these three days,

395
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,700
you must be careful with your words and actions.

396
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,700
Do as I tell you to do.

397
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,420
Remember,

398
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,250
if you reveal a flaw in front of anyone,

399
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,140
you and I will both die without a burial place.

400
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,540
Understand?

401
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,740
Are you sure about this?

402
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,460
Come on.

403
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,060
I beg you.

404
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,340
Don't be shy.

405
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,380
All of you, get out.

406
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,740
No need to serve me.

407
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,460
All of you, get out, please.

408
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,460
You said the Destiny Book

409
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,660
was carried by Dongfang Qingcang?

410
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,420
I saw it clearly.

411
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,140
I couldn't be mistaken.

412
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,580
Your Majesty.

413
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,300
I think Dongfang Qingcang has already confirmed through the destiny book

414
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,100
that the red spirit

415
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,380
is the reincarnation of the first God of War.

416
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,980
But why didn't he just take the spirit

417
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,260
and unseal 100,000 soldiers?

418
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,060
Something must be in his way.

419
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,820
It seems that if we want to retrieve the destiny book and the fairy,

420
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,500
we must first get rid of Dongfang Qingcang.

421
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,760
But he is very powerful.

422
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,760
We are

423
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,780
no match for him.

424
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,720
Profound as his power is,

425
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,810
he can't resist the erosion of the evil spirit.

426
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,620
The evil spirit has boundless power.

427
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,580
But Dongfang Qingcang is alert and suspicious by nature.

428
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,980
All of our spies

429
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,620
have been cleared out by him.

430
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,140
No one can get close to him.

431
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,340
There is one more person who can help me.

432
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:40,020
[Cangyan Sea, Dark Pine Forest]

433
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,420
Your Highness, sorry to keep you waiting.

434
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,970
Hold your head high.

435
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,460
Show imposing

436
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,380
and condescending manners.

437
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,940
How’s that? How’s that?

438
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,460
Watch your eyes.

439
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,500
When you don't know how to deal with people,

440
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,660
just stare at them coldly

441
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,860
and make them feel intimidated.

442
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,860
Like this.

443
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,300
What are you laughing at?

444
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,100
I just think

445
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,500
it's funny to see

446
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
my face

447
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,700
looking so terrifying.

448
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,140
I'm just a little fairy.

449
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,500
I basically nod and bow to people.

450
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,480
I don't know how to be imposing,

451
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,120
not to mention condescending.

452
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:07,410
I'm tired.

453
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,970
Fine.

454
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,100
You just have to remember.

455
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,380
You should be afraid of no one

456
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,650
and trust no one.

457
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,020
What about Shangque?

458
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,580
Isn't Shangque your confidant?

459
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,140
You can’t trust him either?

460
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,580
I only trust myself.

461
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,740
If I were you,

462
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,540
I would tell Shangque

463
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,460
about the body swap,

464
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,900
so that we can work together.

465
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,660
I'm sure we'll find a way to swap our bodies back.

466
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,700
How naive!

467
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,260
The strong is admired in the Cangyan Sea.

468
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,050
If word of the body swap got out,

469
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,420
I'm afraid everyone would want to challenge you

470
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,040
to become the new Moon Supreme.

471
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,460
You can’t activate the power in my body.

472
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,620
Not to mention Shangque or Xunfeng,

473
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,900
even a mere moon warrior

474
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,380
can easily kill you at that time.

475
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,180
I don’t think so.

476
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,300
I think

477
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,780
Shangque is quite affectionate to you.

478
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,690
He would never betray you.

479
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,740
What do you know?

480
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,420
I just know.

481
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,500
You don't know the human heart.

482
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,450
You don't know feelings.

483
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,290
So you don't know.

484
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,180
Wooden Head.

485
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,620
Let me ask you.

486
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,940
Is it ruled

487
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,820
in Cangyan Sea

488
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,300
that the stronger winner

489
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,820
must kill the loser?

490
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,660
There is no such rule.

491
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,000
Why did you ask?

492
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,430
Nothing.

493
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,030
I'm just asking.

494
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,450
Tell me.

495
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,540
You asked me to say it.

496
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,830
Don’t turn your back on me if I do.

497
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,500
I just think it's strange.

498
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,870
If you didn't have to kill him,

499
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,420
why did you kill your father

500
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,700
after you won him?

501
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,290
Lord of Haishi City came here late at night.

502
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,580
What for?

503
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,940
I heard that Dongfang Qingcang has come back from the dead

504
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,940
and returned to the Cangyan Sea.

505
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,360
I'm worried about Your Highness.

506
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,780
That's why I dropped by.

507
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,860
I was ordered

508
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,100
to be the Moon Supreme to quell crises.

509
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,800
Even if Dongfang Qingcang is concerned about this,

510
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,100
he can't find any reason to kill me.

511
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,580
30,000 years ago,

512
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,300
if the Wind Warriors led by Your Highness

513
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,780
had helped in time,

514
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,860
Dongfang Qingcang wouldn't have been left alone on the battlefield.

515
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,900
If Dongfang Qingcang had pursued the case,

516
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,730
claiming Your Highness had been disobedient,

517
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,900
how will Your Highness defend yourself?

518
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,220
But

519
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,500
Your Highness and Dongfang Qingcang

520
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,060
are flesh and blood relatives.

521
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,180
If Your Highness can proactively show kindness

522
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,020
and put aside your hatred,

523
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,180
maybe Dongfang Qingcang will forget about the past.

524
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,260
After all, 30,000 years have passed.

525
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,940
Your Highness should have let go of

526
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,460
the hatred of your father's death.

527
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,500
It's unforgivable whatsoever.

528
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,140
How can I just let go of it?

529
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,460
Even if I lose my life,

530
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,780
I shall kill him with my own hands

531
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,340
to console my father's spirit.

532
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,540
Your Highness, why bother?

533
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,180
From the day he killed my father,

534
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,620
our fates have been sealed.

535
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,900
Either he dies or I die.

536
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,420
Back then, it was Your Highness who helped me build Haishi City.

537
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,740
I will always remember this kindness.

538
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,300
Now

539
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,660
Now if Your Highness has made up your mind,

540
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,500
I will do everything I can

541
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,540
to help you achieve your wish.

542
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,940
I’m afraid it won't be easy

543
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,490
to kill him.

544
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,980
Your Highness, do you not trust me?

545
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,020
Has Your Highness forgotten that

546
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,740
over 30,000 years ago,

547
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,020
it was me who helped Your Highness

548
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,220
plan the counterbalance between the two Fatuous Kings of the North and South

549
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,970
to save the Nine Mysteries.

550
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,580
Now

551
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,680
I can also help you kill Dongfang Qingcang

552
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,200
to avenge the death of your father.

553
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,350
Fortunately,

554
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,110
you've been planning in secret all these years.

555
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,280
If it weren't for your foresight

556
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,670
and maneuvering,

557
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,040
I'm afraid the foundation built by my predecessor

558
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,870
would have been taken away

559
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,670
by the two Fatuous Kings of the North and South.

560
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:25,040
It's just that Dongfang Qingcang is very powerful

561
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,270
and ruthless.

562
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,989
Without the means to kill him in one blow,

563
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,040
you must not act rashly

564
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,980
and alert him.

565
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,550
I will help you kill Dongfang Qingcang.

566
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,830
But

567
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,190
we have to consider this in the long run

568
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:47,920
and wait for the right opportunity.

569
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,400
Father.

570
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,760
Only by killing him

571
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,510
will I be able to secure the position as the new Moon Supreme.

572
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,300
What's so strange about that?

573
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,900
I never thought

574
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,200
the rumor that you killed your father is true.

575
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,110
Then why there was no trace of pain,

576
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,750
nor regret on your face

577
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,520
when mentioning it?

578
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,200
Regret?

579
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,600
Why should I regret it?

580
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,120
He's your father.

581
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,710
So what?

582
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,750
I've always dreamed of having a family.

583
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,470
A parent.

584
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,710
You had a father.

585
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,190
But you killed him with your own hands.

586
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,240
People say you're a cold-hearted jerk

587
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,790
who doesn’t recognize your own family.

588
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,990
I thought people got you wrong.

589
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:23,960
That's right.

590
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,250
I am a jerk.

591
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,140
Now,

592
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,750
if you don't want to die,

593
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,110
you must learn how to be a jerk.

594
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,310
What are you doing?

595
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,920
Come here, you.

596
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,350
Let go!

597
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,630
I'm a beautiful fairy with a good heart.

598
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,130
I don’t want to be a jerk.

599
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:04,790
Get out of here.

600
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,240
Watch her.

601
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,910
Without my order,

602
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,680
don't let her in.

603
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,320
Yes.

604
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,310
You!

605
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,530
Go.

606
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,920
