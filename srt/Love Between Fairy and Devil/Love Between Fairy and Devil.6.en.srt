[Episode 6]

4
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,140
What do I like?

5
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,140
That's right.

6
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,500
What do you like?

7
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,740
And what do you want?

8
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,300
I'll bring whatever you want to you.

9
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,460
He is...making me happy?

10
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,220
As long as it can make me happy,

11
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,539
no matter what I say,

12
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,540
you're always willing to

13
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,580
to fulfill my wishes?

14
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:13,900
Yes. Go ahead.

15
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,780
I'll cook you something delicious today.

16
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,540
And you'll go back to the Haotian Tower after the meal.

17
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,260
Okay?

18
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,020
Except this one.

19
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,700
Give me back the Destiny Book.

20
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,660
I'll fix it for you.

21
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,260
Then you'll go back to the Haotian Tower.

22
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:35,620
Okay?

23
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,260
We'll talk about this after you recover.

24
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,780
He has been so nice to me.

25
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,100
He didn't mean to let me fix the Destiny Book.

26
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,210
It's just an excuse for him to stay by my side.

27
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,140
No.

28
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,100
I can't let him fall deeper in love with me.

29
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,340
Except for you to go back to the Haotian Tower,

30
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,420
I just want to pass the immortal examination.

31
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,620
The immortal examination?

32
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,980
Shuiyuntian holds the immortal examination

33
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,380
once every 100 years.

34
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,980
As long as we pass the exam,

35
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,900
we can become first class members of the fairy realm and be promoted.

36
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,780
But

37
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,700
if we want to pass the exam,

38
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,050
we must fight and subdue demons.

39
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,620
My power is too weak.

40
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,660
I might not be able to pass.

41
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,820
You took the medicine last night

42
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,340
for the exam, right?

43
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,340
I thought I could cure my immortal root.

44
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,020
But I almost lost my life because of it.

45
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,300
In order to serve tea to the immortals,

46
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,250
you almost died.

47
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,340
You're so stupid.

48
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,579
You know nothing.

49
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,620
The fairy who can be the first place in the exam

50
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,620
can get a position at

51
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,780
Lord Changheng's Fountain Palace.

52
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,860
So what?

53
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,140
Forget it.

54
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,220
You don't even know the Battle with the Moon Tribe,

55
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,579
let alone the prestige of our Lord Changheng

56
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,900
in the three realms.

57
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,730
Lord Changheng

58
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,460
is the younger son of Lord Dong,

59
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,940
and Lord Yunzhong's younger brother.

60
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,220
After the Battle with the Moon Tribe,

61
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,980
Shuiyuntian was split apart.

62
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,820
He regained all the lost territories

63
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,740
within less than 6,000 years.

64
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,220
He's just the best of a bad bunch.

65
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,820
You can laugh at me every day,

66
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,019
but you can't belittle Lord Changheng like this.

67
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,620
In my opinion,

68
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,380
he was born too late.

69
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,060
He was only hundreds years old during the Battle with the Moon Tribe,

70
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,100
If he were born earlier,

71
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,780
Dongfang Qingcang would be a nobody.

72
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,220
He's no match for him.

73
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,780
If he dares to provoke Lord Changheng,

74
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,220
he will be beaten up

75
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,580
by our Lord Changheng.

76
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,300
A young boy

77
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,100
doesn't deserve to be compared with the Moon Supreme.

78
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,460
You don't have to be jealous.

79
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,260
Dongfang Qingcang is dead.

80
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,860
Of course there's no way to prove who will win.

81
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,540
Anyway, Lord Changheng

82
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,940
is not only the strongest in the three realms,

83
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,700
but also the dream lover

84
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,620
of all the fairies in the fairy realm.

85
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,740
He's also your dream lover?

86
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,300
So he's the one you like?

87
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,420
I actually know myself well.

88
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,820
I'm just a lowly spirit.

89
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,700
So I never dare to expect anything.

90
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,020
As long as I can be closer to him

91
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,540
and see him every day...

92
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,260
Stop.

93
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,740
I'm just asking for what you like

94
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,180
and what you want.

95
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,060
Why do you keep

96
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,500
talking nonsense?

97
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,580
How is this nonsense?

98
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,500
I mean...

99
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,740
Forget it.

100
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,380
I think you've been locked up for too long.

101
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,380
It made you silly.

102
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,580
Anyway,

103
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,100
Daqiang, you have to know

104
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,260
you can't waste your time on me.

105
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,659
I can't respond to your kindness.

106
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,260
I don't need your response.

107
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,460
You're short-sighted.

108
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,820
You don't know that there are lots of beauties in the three realms.

109
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,860
They are much prettier, cuter ,and tenderer

110
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,900
than me.

111
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,580
So what?

112
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,900
I mean

113
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,980
after seeing more beauties,

114
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,900
you won't think I'm special.

115
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,500
Then you wouldn't pester me like this.

116
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,780
For me,

117
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,010
no one in the three realms

118
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,300
is as unique as you are.

119
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,530
You...

120
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,580
You...

121
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,580
I just want to tell you

122
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,460
the person I like is Lord Changheng,

123
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,610
not you!

124
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,940
I also hope that it's Lord Changheng who is by my side,

125
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,420
not you.

126
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,850
Do you understand?

[Haishi City Soul Transformation Grounds]

128
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,530
My lord, I have found out

129
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,740
the one who stole the Destiny Book

130
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,820
was a nameless Fairy Orchid of the Arbiter Hall.

131
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,660
Arbiter Hall?

132
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,940
Could it be the orchid plant

133
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,050
that inherited the Arbiter's power?

134
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,300
No wonder she could steal the Destiny Book.

135
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,220
My lord,

136
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:24,930
should we kill her?

137
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,260
Kill her!

138
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,100
Yes, my lord.

139
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,620
Wait.

140
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,170
Now Changheng is in Yujing.

141
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,340
If there is a murder,

142
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,020
he will investigate it thoroughly.

143
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
It'll be bad if it involves Haishi City.

144
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,780
Then...

145
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,250
Isn't the immortal examination coming?

146
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,700
If something happens to her during the exam...

147
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,020
Lord... Lord Changheng.

148
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,460
Stand up.

149
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,380
Are you here to check the Destiny Book?

150
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,460
I'll get it for you now.

151
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,140
No need.

152
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,620
Why are you here...

153
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,620
I'm here to be with you.

154
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,299
Am I dreaming?

155
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,340
From now on,

156
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,970
I will stay by your side

157
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,100
in this figure.

158
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,010
It's you!

159
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,340
Turn back now!

160
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,580
Right now!

161
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,610
Why are you angry?

162
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,660
What do you think?

163
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,340
How could you make fun of me like this?

164
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,980
I'm not interested in teasing you.

165
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,290
Didn't you say that

166
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,780
you want Changheng to be with you,

167
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,860
instead of me?

168
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,530
What's wrong with you?

169
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,100
You don't know anything

170
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,690
about human nature and love.

171
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,140
The strong doesn't need to understand those.

172
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,060
You're hopeless.

173
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,540
Then tell me

174
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,180
how can you be happy?

175
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,700
The person I want to see is Lord Changheng.

176
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,700
The real Lord Changheng,

177
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,900
not the one disguised by you.

178
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,940
It's simple.

179
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,220
I'll tie him up to accompany you.

180
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,620
Don't disturb him.

181
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,900
How can you do that?

182
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,100
Besides,

183
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,420
if you go and find Lord Changheng,

184
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,540
he can kill you with just a little finger.

185
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,300
Forget it.

186
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,500
I have to prepare for the immortal examination.

187
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,580
I need to be well-prepared.

188
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,300
Don't take the exam.

189
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,420
Why?

190
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,180
Because you're too weak. You'll be in danger.

191
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:57,980
Anyway,

192
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,300
I have to give it a try.

193
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,780
Besides, don't you want me to be happy?

194
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,010
If I can't pass the exam,

195
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,540
I can't go to the Fountain Palace.

196
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,580
If I can't go there,

197
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,300
I won't be able to serve Lord Changheng and repay his kindness.

198
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,940
Then I won't be happy.

199
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,020
Forget it.

200
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,080

If I hadn't come,

You're my daughter.

Your status is noble.

Why do you insist in taking the immortal examination?

210
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,380
You want to serve others?

Father.

212

I knew what you thought.

213
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,500
You don't really want to stop me from taking the exam.

214
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,500
You just don't want me to

entain Lord Changheng's Fountain Palace.

216

Changheng has got a fiancee.

217
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,940
But we haven't heard from the Goddess of Xilan for more than 30,000 years.

218
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,940
I'm afraid she has already died.

219
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,100
Even if Lord Changheng can't forget her at present,

220
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,180
and is still looking for her everywhere,

221
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,060
I don't mind.

222

As long as I pass the immortal examination,

223
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,020
and can be his attendant,

224
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,140
he will fall in love with me

225

as the days pass by.

How clear do you want me to say?

227
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,370
What should I do to make you give up the love for him?

228
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,500
The engagement of Changheng and the Goddess

is arranged by Lord Yunzhong.

230

If Changheng falls in love with you,

231
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,660
it won't be a happy ending.

232
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
It's the misfortune instead.

My lord.

234
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,860
I can't believe she wants to take the exam.

235
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,340
With her talent and ability,

236
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,780
it's hard to cultivate her.

237

I've been a tyrant all my life.

238
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,020
I didn't expect that serving a plant

239
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,940
is even harder than conquering the three realms and the whole world.

true or not?

Yes, it's true.

00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,290
It's an efficient tool for cultivation.

344
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,180
If Lord Changheng gave it to Fairy Danyin,

345
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,130
it would be obvious that he wants Fairy Danyin to win.

346
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,180
We must have wasted our time.

347
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,380
Our efforts will be all in vain.

348
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,780
Then let's think how to please Danyin.

349
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,500
We may get a position at the Fountain Palace as substitutes

350
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,420
some day later.

351
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:07,850
Don't forget

352
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,220
how hard we cultivated.

353
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,820
There will be a chance for us.

354
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,680
[Lord Sansheng]

355
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,660
Silence!

356
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,820
It's Lord Changheng.

357
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,700
Lord Changheng.

358
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,140
It's Lord Changheng.

359
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,500
Where is Rong Hao?

360
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,620
I haven't seen him yet.

361
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,180
He said he wanted to watch.

362
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,900
I even arranged a seat for him.

363
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,740
But where is he now?

364
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,020
You're indeed our famous God of War.

365
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
There are so many fairies gathered here

366
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,020
just to see you.

367
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,380
But is the love of our God of War

368
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,500
among them?

369
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,700
It's so beautiful.

370
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,740
It would be great if I could pick one of them

371
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,620
as a lantern at night.

372
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,300
It's not difficult.

373
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,820
How is it not difficult?

374
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,700
Stars are far away from here.

375
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,500
It's extremely hard to get them.

376
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,220
There is a spirit stone in the Northernmost Ocean

377
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,340
called the Magical Firefly Stone.

378
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,500
There are fireflies in the stone.

379
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,100
They shine at night.

380
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,380
They'll shine .

381
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,340
like the stars in the sky

382
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,900
But...

383
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,060
the Northernmost Ocean is far from here,

384
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,220
and it's so cold there.

385
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,010
I can't go there to get them.

386
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,740
If you want,

387
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,260
I can give you the stars.

388
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,220
Really?

389
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,540
Really?

390
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,540
Lord Changheng.

391
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,540
Lord Changheng, your spirit jade...

392
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,420
30,000 years ago,

393
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,500
if the former God of War, Chidi woman didn't

394
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
sealed the soldiers of the Moon Tribe with her death,

395
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,220
the Fairies would have been destroyed by the Moon Tribe long ago.

396
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,860
After the Battle with the Moon Tribe,

397
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,420
the Fairies started to be alert to danger.

398
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,340
I was right, wasn't I?

399
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,540
The gods were humiliated.

400
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,780
In this exam,

401
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,300
we invited the God of War, Lord Changheng as the judge.

402
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,500
And Lord Yunzhong

403
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,340
as the supervisor of this immortal examination.

404
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,940
If you keep talking nonsense, I'll send you out.

405
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,180
All the fairies need to do your best

406
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,820
and wait for the evaluation.

407
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,780
The candidates

408
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,260
must use demon pills

409
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,140
to subdue the monsters in Shuyu Forest.

410
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,300
If you succeed before sunset,

411
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,020
you'll pass the exam.

412
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,780
Thank you, my lord.

413
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,420
Thank you, my lord.

414
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,220
Be careful.

415
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,860
There are 48 candidates this time.

416
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,820
But there are only nine monsters in Shuyu Forest.

417
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,540
No matter what it takes,

418
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,500
the ones who subdue the monsters will pass.

419
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,980
Which fairy would like to enter the Shuyu Forest first?

420
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,250
I...

421
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:33,740
Okay.

422
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,900
Fairy Orchid.

423
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,820
You are the first one.

424
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,580
I don't know who pushed me just now.

425
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,140
My lord, are you really going to help her?

426
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,540
What?

427
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,300
Nothing.

428
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,420
I just think

429
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,820
you are the master of the three realms.

430
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,540
How can you do these tricks

431
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,020
for a plain fairy,

432
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,260
and even cheat for her.

433
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,620
I really can't stand it.

434
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,140
Do I have other choices?

435
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,290
My lord, I don't understand

436
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,180
why you have to do

437
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,340
all of these for her.

438
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,770
My lords, you can observe them

439
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,380
through the Tianji Mirror.

440
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,900
This Orchid is a coward.

441
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,220
She's easily frightened.

442
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,660
But why isn't she afraid of you?

443
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,060
I'm sorry.

444
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,980
My lord, there are nine monsters in the forest.

445
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,180
I will catch all of them

446
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,340
and give them to her immediately.

447
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,740
No need.

448
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,900
This will make people suspicious.

449
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,660
Go and lure the weakest one here.

450
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,140
Yes.

451
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,100
I'll go and move it again.

452
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,060
Is this

453
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:10,970
Ying Zhao?

454
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,780
Don't run!

455
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,060
This Ying Zhao seems to feel you.

456
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,020
If we keep following the Orchid,

457
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,810
I'm afraid no monster dare to approach her.

458
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,020
Let's keep a distance.

459
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,020
Yes, my lord.

460
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,740
Ying Zhao.

461
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,380
You look fatter than in the book.

462
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,780
I brought you

463
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,860
your favorite Hound's Tongue.

464
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,090
Have more.

465
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,580
My power is weak. I can only use my wisdom.

466
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,020
While you are eating the Hound's Tongue

467
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,340
and lowering your vigilance,

468
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,660
Sorry, Ying Zhao.

469
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,980
This Orchid

470
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
is weak in power,

471
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,980
but she's quite smart.

472
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,780
Not only that.

473
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,500
The beasts can identify pure and kind people.

474
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,460
That's why Ying Zhao trusts her so much.

475
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,580
You...

476
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,180
What are you doing?

477
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,780
I want this one.

478
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,770
But I found it first.

479
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,380
You found it?

480
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,820
Did the judge say

481
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,260
the beast would belong to whoever finds it first?

482
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,420
No.

483
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,740
Step aside.

484
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,460
No. I won't.

485
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,500
What?

486
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,540
You won't?

487
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,690
It's not up to you.

488
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,860
There's a private fight.

489
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,820
During the exam,

490
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,340
as long as they can capture the monster,

491
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,460
there are no limited ways.

492
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,300
So private fights are not against the rules.

493
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,180
Fairy Danyin,

494
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,500
you're so powerful.

495
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,140
Why do you still want mine?

496
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,540
It's fine if I give up this one,

497
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,940
but you can't catch a single one.

498
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,860
Why?

499
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,220
I remember that

500
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,700
I didn't offend you before.

501
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,980
There's no reason.

502
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,180
You should quit.

503
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,180
And never take the exam again.

504
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,700
I won't quit.

505
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,940
Say it again.

506
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,900
I won't quit!

507
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,330
Don't forget

508
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,580
we are allowed to have private fights in the exam.

509
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,020
It's inevitable

510
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,940
if I accidentally ruin your 1000-year cultivation

511
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,780
and beat you back into

512
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,300
a stupid grass

513
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,540
that hasn't been enlightened.

514
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,420
Get lost!

515
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:21,930
Get out of here!

516
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:22,980
-Get out of the way, Orchid! -Get lost!

517
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,940
Get lost!

518
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,660
Give that beast to us!

519
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,620
Do you want to be beaten?

520
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,540
Get out of here!

521
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,660
Go!

522
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,450
I won't quit!

523
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:31,900
Normally,

524
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,330
you can bully me.

525
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,380
But today,

526
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,900
I will never run away.

527
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,740
Even if I have to risk my life,

528
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,260
I must pass the exam.

529
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,250
I must go to the Fountain Palace

530
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,540
to repay Lord Changheng's kindness.

531
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,700
How dare you mention him?

532
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,490
What are you waiting for?

533
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,700
Orchid Spirit.

534
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,980
Let's wait and see.

535
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,290
Let's go.

536
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,460
I can't believe I'm so strong.

537
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,260
Could it be that...

538
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,420
I am enlightened?

539
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,900
Ying Zhao.

540
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,420
Thank you for helping me.

541
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,540
Me?

542
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,100
Great.

543
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,940
If I subdue you,

544
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,699
I'll have the chance to go to the Fountain Palace

545
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,100
to serve Lord Changheng.

546
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,780
There's an evil spirit.

547
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,780
Keep an eye on her.

548
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,620
I'll be right back.

549
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,660
Yes.

550
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,700
Why is this happening?

551
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,300
Ying Zhao, what's wrong with you?

552
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,820
Ying Zhao, what's wrong with you?

553
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,620
Help!

554
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,820
Help!

555
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,980
Help!

556
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,410
Why is this happening?

557
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,220
Help!

558
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,020
Fairy Danyin!

559
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,900
Leave now!

560
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,460
Fairy Danyin.

561
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:24,820
Are you okay?

562
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:25,900
You...

563
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,380
What are you waiting for?

564
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,460
Come and help!

565
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,980
Fairy Yulin,

566
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,300
Fairy Danyin and the Orchid

567
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,780
were attacked by a beast.

568
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,940
Let's go and save them.

569
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,420
Stop!

570
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,660
Don't take the exam.

571
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,820
This is the perfect timing.

572
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,620
They are trapped by the beast.

573
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,940
We have to seize this chance

574
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,860
and win the exam.

575
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,420
The God is on my side.

576
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,380
There's a tree hole.

577
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,620
Everyone, go inside and hide.

578
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:51,660
Hurry!

579
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,260
Hurry!

580
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:07,780
You...

581
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,940
Listen to me.

582
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,980
Are your demon pills still here?

583
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:12,930
-Yes. -Yes.

584
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,220
Ying Zhao is too strong

585
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,900
now.

586
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,940
It can't be subdued

587
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,540
with only one pill.

588
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,900
If we gather all the

589
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,020
demon pills together,

590
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,900
maybe we can subdue it.

591
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,900
Shut up.

592
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,220
Don't mention the bad idea.

593
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,900
Listen to me.

594
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,500
We will die if we keep hiding here.

595
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,740
How about I go out and distract it?

596
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,290
You go and find Aunt Sansheng

597
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,420
and ask her to save us.

598
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,700
Here you are.

599
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,420
-Hurry. -Here, take mine.

600
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,220
Be careful.

601
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,820
Okay.

602
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,300
Hi. Ying Zhao.

603
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,860
Catch me if you dare!

604
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,460
Father!

605
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,100
Father!

606
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:08,940
Aunt Sansheng.

607
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,140
Hurry and save that little Orchid.

608
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:10,900
She's in danger!

609
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,500
Danyin!

610
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,380
Danyin!

611
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:24,860
Danyin!

612
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,580
Are you okay?

613
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,460
I'm fine.

614
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,940
Stay here. Don't go anywhere.

615
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:28,780
Father!

616
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,500
Orchid!

617
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:38,780
Orchid!

618
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,340
Let's split up.

619
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,140
Okay.

620
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,460
Orchid!

621
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,580
Orchid!

622
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,610
Help!

623
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:22,740
