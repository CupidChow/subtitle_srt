[Haotian Tower, Shuiyuntian]

5
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,620
You are the sinful immortal who is locked inside.

6
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,580
You want to trick me into releasing you.

7
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,620
I advise you not to compare me

8
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,780
with these nobodies.

9
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,740
My patience is limited.

10
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,660
Hurry and break this Haotian Matrix.

11
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,300
Otherwise,

12
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,660
I will kill you now.

13
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,300
You are just a sinful immortal.

14
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,820
You're not a big deal.

15
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,940
You keep talking about yourself.

16
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,740
You're just more powerful than me.

17
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,660
Anyone in Shuiyuntian

18
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,260
is more powerful than me.

19
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,890
Besides,

20
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,540
we've switched bodies.

21
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,460
If you kill me now,

22
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,140
you kill yourself.

23
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,579
We can just die together.

24
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,020
Come on.

25
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,980
You reminded me.

26
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,579
My hair!

27
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,220
Don't forget.

28
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,579
You're also in my hands now.

29
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,700
I won't let you off the hook.

30
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,980
I'll make you bald today!

31
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,250
Stop!

32
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,660
How dare you be so presumptuous.

33
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,940
Do you believe that I'll

34
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,540
break your arms off now?

35
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,900
Then I'll cut your neck off!

36
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,020
You dare talk nonsense.

37
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,780
You don't seem to want your tongue anymore.

38
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,820
If you dare touch my tongue,

39
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,340
I will...

40
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,780
I will use my power to destroy your immortal root.

41
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,820
You dare?

42
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,980
Why not?

43
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,659
My immortal root is damaged anyway.

44
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,820
I'll just destroy yours.

45
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,740
I'm not afraid.

all gone.

49

Don't cry.

It's all gone.

51
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,700
I can't braid my hair anymore.

52
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,580
I can't wear a hairpin anymore.

53
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,900
I even have to stay

54
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,620
in this sinful immortal body of yours.

55
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,460
I told you not to cry.

56
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,460
I can't pass the immortal examination too.

57
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,740
I can never go back to the Arbiter Hall.

58

I'm only 1,500 years old.

59
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,500
I'm still so young.

60
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,940
Why is my life so miserable?

61

Clean your face.

You're the first person in history

to threaten me.

70
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,660
You're also the first person in history to

71
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,340
make me cry like a man.

72
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,340
I don't want to stay in

73

74
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,260
It's just some Haotian Matrix.

75
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,380
Today, I'll break it

76
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,260
for you.

let's figure out a way

79
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,100
as soon as possible.

80
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,820
People from the Heavenly Realm always claim to be honorable.

81
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,500
But when things happen,

82
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,940
you only care about yourself.

I'm just an orchid plant.

85

If you want a plant to think about these things,

86
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,330
then why do we need the Heavenly Soldiers,

87
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,620
Heavenly Emperors, and Fairy Lords?

88

Besides,

my master said that

90
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,220
stealing one's job is like killing one's mother.

Enough. Don't disturb me.

95

I don't know how to use your body.

96

How could there be such a stupid person in this world?

97
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,780
Do you have any idea?

98
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,300
You only know how to order people around.

Everything has its cause.

102
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,810
We must have done something

103
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,300
that caused us to switch bodies.

104
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,220
Now,

105
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,820
if we repeat what we were doing before we switched,

106
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,460
maybe we can switch back.

back from the Northernmost Ocean.

not good at other things.

116

I failed to save her.

But my brother and the others

You know that.

141

Me too.

142
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,820
I'd rather be with this lonely lake and empty mountain.

143

I'd rather

144

have a drink with you.

145
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,580
Green flame wine from the Northernmost Ocean?

146
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,660
It lives up to its reputation.

147
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,860
Good wine.

148
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,700
Xishan is really a good place.

I think that goddess, Xi Yun,

What are you holding?

152
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,620
Something from your lover?

153
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,020
It's nothing.

154
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,740
It's just a handkerchief.

something on it.

158
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,500
You can fool others but not me.

159
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,530
Why do you

160
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,820
keep staring at a handkerchief?

161
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,780
There are no poetries or patterns on it.

162

What are you looking at?

163
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,900
I didn't expect

164
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,290
you to hide the pattern.

165
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,620
Actually,

166
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,020
you and the goddess only have a marriage engagement.

167
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,580
You've never met each other.

168

she has been gone for 30,000 years.

What if she doesn't come back?

171
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,100
It's my marriage engagement with her.

172

Even if she's been away for 30,000 years,
