Left.

6
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,920
Left?

7
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,420
No, no, no.

8
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,340
A little to the right.

9
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:51,340
Like this.

10
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,140
Yes.

11
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,620
Right here.

12
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,030
Okay.

13
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,580
Butler.

14
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,160
The beans and saddle are ready.

15
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,460
Put them inside.

16
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,039
Yes.

17
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,570
What are these for?

18
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,520
Those beans and saddle.

19
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,330
These are the customs of marriage in the mortal world.

20
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,259
To sprinkle beans and cross the saddle.

21
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,100
Beans are used to ward off the evil spirits.

22
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,160
Crossing the saddle means safety.

23
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,860
These are wishes to the couple

24
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,250
for a happy life after marriage.

25
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,260
But

26
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,860
we don't have much time,

27
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,960
we can only make it simple.

28
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:25,570
Otherwise, we'll have to send betrothal goose and pass bags,

29
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,260
and make match, choose an auspicious day and greet the bride.

30
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,680
There are many customs.

31
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,380
I see.

32
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,770
There are so many customs in the mortal world.

33
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,860
In that case,

34
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,760
there is also a custom for us dragons to get married.

35
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:39,030
A man will scrape the hardest dragon scale

36
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,190
and give it to his wife.

37
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,640
A dragon scale?

38
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,460
That is too cruel.

39
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,810
Without the protection of the dragon scale,

40
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,870
it's like exposing the most fragile part

41
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,040
to the person he loves.

42
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,480
It means

43
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,070
he will listen to her

44
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,850
and be bullied by her,

45
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,530
or be cheated by her.

46
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,520
I'm going to check

47
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,410
the wedding dress.

48
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,630
I'm very busy today.

49
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,690
I don't have time to listen to your weird custom of the Dragons.

[Orchid Residence]

51
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,100
We've searched the house,

52
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,320
but we couldn't find it.

53
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,010
We've searched everywhere outside,

54
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,060
but still couldn't find it.

55
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,620
That's a premium bead from the East Sea.

56
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,840
I'll deduct your annual salary if you can't find it.

57
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,560
Jieli.

58
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,079
This is a fake wedding.

59
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,250
Don't be so angry.

60
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,180
Although the wedding is fake,

61
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,780
the bead is real.

62
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,000
It's worth a lot of money.

63
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,180
I need to keep it for

64
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,330
landlord.

65
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,360
You guys

66
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,030
go to the east yard with me.

67
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,130
Yes.

68
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,899
It's almost time.

69
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,710
Why haven't you changed into the wedding dress?

70
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,680
Lady Wanqing.

71
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,070
Why are you here?

72
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,250
I heard you lost your jewelry.

73
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,270
I don't know if you can find it.

74
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,040
So I brought you all my jewelry

75
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,340
to you.

76
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,020
Take a look.

77
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,540
Is there anything you like?

78
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,640
The wedding is a huge occasion to all girls.

79
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,530
You need to dress up to look beautiful.

80
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:44,890
Sit.

81
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,300
This one looks nice.

82
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,150
It suits you well.

83
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,240
Let me put it on you.

84
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,330
You don't have to...

85
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,580
Thank you.

86
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,890
You're welcome.

87
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,340
After tonight,

88
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,320
you should call me sister-in-law.

89
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,710
Logically speaking,

90
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,590
I should have cared more

91
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,570
about your wedding.

92
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,540
Although Mr. Dongfang is your brother,

93
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,350
he is a man.

94
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,360
He is not that thoughtful.

95
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,640
If you have any worries or difficulties,

96
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,020
which you can't tell him in the future,

97
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,960
just let me know.

98
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,850
Let's go.

99
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,400
Brother-in-law, hurry up.

100
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,120
I told you I have no family or friends in Lucheng City.

101
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,130
No one will send me gifts.

102
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,300
Just go.

103
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,270
It's not necessarily like that.

104
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,400
Congratulations, Xiao Run.

105
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,580
Congratulations, brother-in-law.

106
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,120
Thank you.

107
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,380
Here are two purple jade bracelets.

108
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,980
One for each of you.

109
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,010
Thank you.

110
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,060
Please come in.

111
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,610
Please.

112
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,160
Congratulations, Xiao Run.

113
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,290
Congratulations, brother-in-law.

114
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,480
This is the Youyang scroll for you.

115
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,360
Thank you.

116
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,090
And two jars of Cuihu wine.

117
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,640
Thank you.

118
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,060
Please come in.

119
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,820
Have a nice day.

120
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,520
What's going on?

121
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,780
Didn't you say

122
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,300
you don't have friends in Lucheng City?

123
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,560
You're wrong.

124
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,310
First,

125
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,820
we are sworn brothers.

126
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,240
Second,

127
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,300
after this wedding,

128
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,230
you need to call me brother-in-law.

129
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,909
So?

130
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,970
So,

131
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,200
I made it clear on the wedding invitation.

132
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,460
If they send a gift to me,

133
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,680
they need to send you one.

134
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,470
From now on,

135
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,570
my friends

136
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,780
are your friends.

137
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,840
They have to call you brother-in-law

138
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,930
as I do.

139
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,810
Are you touched?

140
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,210
It's nothing.

141
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,170
Look.

142
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,690
Over there.

143
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,280
As long as I have it,

144
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,080
You...

145
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,260
my brother-in-law,

146
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,600
must have it too.

147
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,660
Congratulations, Xiao Run.

148
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,380
Thank you.

149
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:12,980
Come in, please.

150
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,150
-Congratulations. -Please come in.

151
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,570
Congratulations.

152
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,120
You wait here.

153
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll go in and greet them.

154
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,410
Let's go inside.

155
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,210
Congratulations, Xiao Run.

156
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:21,750
Please come in.

157
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,060
Please come in.

158
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,610
Let's go.

159
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,970
Why are you hiding here?

160
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,440
That's my question.

161
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,500
You should greet the guests now.

162
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,720
Why are you here?

163
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,060
I...

164
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,780
I'm going now.

165
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,480
Wait.

166
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,010
I'm in a bad mood.

167
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,900
Talk to me.

168
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,880
In the Arbiter Hall,

169
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,000
I had to organize a lot of mortals' Destiny Book every day.

170
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,100
But at that time,

171
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,650
their life, death,

172
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,780
happiness and sadness

173
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,630
in my eyes

174
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,980
is just like a red leaf

175
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,870
on the fate tree.

176
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,919
The leaf blooms, and it falls.

177
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,400
It falls and then blooms.

178
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,669
Everything is predestined.

179
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,520
But now,

180
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,690
after these few days,

181
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,250
in the mortal world,

182
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,560
in Lucheng City,

183
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,410
I found that

184
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,060
marriage, funeral,

185
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,410
happiness and sadness

186
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,470
are the most important things.

187
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,530
Just now Lady Wanqing came to me happily

188
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,250
and picked the hairpin for me.

189
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,390
I feel really sad.

190
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,750
Although I know she is destined to die tonight,

191
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,180
at the thought of that

192
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,530
we lied to her

193
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,130
and she's going to die tonight,

194
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,530
I feel so...

195
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,630
Forget it.

196
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,320
I've told you so much,

197
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,490
but you don't understand.

198
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,160
I do.

199
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,650
This is my first time feeling like this.

200
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,670
Xiao Run told me that

201
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,860
his friends

202
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,790
are my friends.

203
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,020
I feel guilty for a mortal...

204
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,860
No.

205
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,680
An enemy.

206
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,370
I feel guilty.

207
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,510
He is Xiao Run.

208
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,940
He's not Changheng.

209
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,590
He is not your enemy.

210
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,580
Tonight,

211
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,140
can we...

212
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,040
forget about the Fairies,

213
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,020
forget about the Moon Tribe.

214
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,160
Forget it all.

215
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,130
You are not the Moon Supreme,

216
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,690
nor am I a fairy.

217
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,480
Let's be mortals for a day,

218
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,790
Okay?

219
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,180
Okay.

220
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,220
Here.

221
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,070
Enjoy.

222
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,610
Excuse me.

223
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,580
Congratulations.

224
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,290
Congratulations.

225
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,340
Cricket.

226
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,620
You are back.

227
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,750
Where have you been?

228
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,140
It's my wedding day.

229
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,940
Why are you looking like this?

230
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,810
Whatever.

231
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,570
Let's go.

232
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,240
Get changed.

233
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,790
Cricket,

234
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,180
tell me honestly.

235
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,230
Where did you go today?

236
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:18,970
Say it.

237
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,440
Cricket.

238
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,100
Cricket.

239
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,740
What are you doing?

240
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,710
Cricket.

241
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,050
Cricket.

242
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,250
Why are you crying?

243
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,570
Did you get dumped

244
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,080
or are you in debt?

245
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,180
I know.

246
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,160
Do you think I'll leave you

247
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,330
after I get married?

248
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,820
Don't worry.

249
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,830
We've known each other since childhood.

250
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,790
We are like brothers.

251
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,970
How could I leave you?

252
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,690
Look.

253
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,330
Today is my wedding day.

254
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,560
After I get married,

255
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,240
I'll find you a beautiful girl from a good family.

256
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,820
What do you think?

257
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,630
Don't cry.

258
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,240
Get dressed.

259
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,840
Cricket.

260
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,240
Isn't this the bead on the phoenix crown?

261
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,200
Why is it here?

262
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,130
Send it to Lady Orchid.

263
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,850
She is putting on makeup

264
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,400
in the west yard with Lady Wanqing.

265
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,120
Hurry up.

266
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,870
Go.

267
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,540
You are

268
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,850
the servant of Xiao Run.

269
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,700
What are you doing here?

270
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,340
Lady Orchid, there's a bead on the phoenix crown

271
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,320
left in my young master's wedding dress.

272
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,340
I came to send it.

273
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,990
So it was left at his place.

274
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,330
Follow me.

275
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,830
Strange.

276
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,180
She was here just now.

277
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,700
Qu Shui.

278
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,720
Why are you here?

279
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,560
Run asked me to give this to you.

280
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:52,720
He has some words

281
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,290
for you.

282
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,190
They'll be husband and wife in a few hours.

283
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,660
He is so attached.

284
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,830
Forget it.

285
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,530
I can't hear

286
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,880
his words for you.

287
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,500
Orchid.

288
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,400
You look good in your wedding dress.

289
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,960
It took you so much effort

290
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,890
to finally marry him.

291
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,230
Are you happy now?

292
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,820
Qu Shui.

293
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,210
No.

294
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,610
Are you Danyin?

295
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,220
What?

296
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,730
Are you afraid I'll ruin your plan?

297
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,510
This expression.

298
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,730
This tone.

299
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,990
You were like this

300
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,080
when you bullied me.

301
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,800
Fairy Danyin.

302
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,690
It's really you.

303
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,800
What are you doing?

304
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,100
It's just that I haven't seen someone from Shuiyuntian

305
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,150
for a long time.

306
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,410
I'm a little excited.

307
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,020
By the way,

308
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,700
why did you and Lord Changheng come to the mortal world to experience hardships?

309
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,010
Can you explain it to me?

310
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,430
You should tell me

311
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,570
why you are hanging out

312
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,370
with Dongfang Qingcang.

313
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,520
And you two look close.

314
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,590
It's a long story.

315
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,220
Forget it.

316
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,610
We'll talk about it later.

317
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,670
The most important thing now

318
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,020
is to find a way to save Lord Changheng.

319
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,830
Lord Yunzhong has known about

320
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,090
the hardship experience.

321
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,320
In order to stop Dongfang Qingcang,

322
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,210
he asked me...

323
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,230
What did he ask you to do?

324
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,330
He asked me to kill the mortal body of the first God of War

325
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,050
to stop the hardship experience.

326
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,770
Kill Lady Wanqing?

327
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,990
Why?

328
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,680
Wasn’t the first God of War a hero of Shuiyuntian?

329
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,690
Besides, if we do this,

330
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,830
Lord Changheng will disappear too.

331
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,920
His Majesty said

332
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,690
we have to sacrifice Changheng

333
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,370
for Shuiyuntian.

334
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,560
But I don't want to.

335
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,110
Of course you don't.

336
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,870
Fairy Danyin.

337
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,140
We must find a way to protect them.

338
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,140
Of course!

339
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,820
Even if I die,

340
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,170
I will protect Changheng.

341
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,720
Orchid,

342
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,770
tell me

343
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,620
how to help them go through hardships?

344
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,150
According to the fate poem,

345
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,160
only on the wedding night,

346
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,180
Xiao Run kills Lady Wanqing,

347
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,200
then they can go through it successfully.

348
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,590
With Xiao Run's personality,

349
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,020
how could he kill people?

350
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't know.

351
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,840
You don't know?

352
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,820
Then what are you doing here?

353
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,870
To try your luck?

354
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,220
Calm down, Fairy Danyin.

355
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,820
I've read so many Destiny Books.

356
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,210
There are more weird fate poems.

357
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,650
But before it happens,

358
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,830
I can’t figure it out

359
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,050
Let's wait and see.

360
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,520
We can't just stand by.

361
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,390
He cares about you the most now.

362
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,240
If there is no way,

363
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,510
I will hold a knife on your neck

364
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,690
and force him.

365
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,420
Are you serious?

366
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,300
Of course.

367
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,190
If it doesn't work,

368
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,490
I'll cut you.

369
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,130
I don't believe he won't do it.

370
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,810
No time for talking.

371
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,160
Let's improvise tonight.

372
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,050
Fairy Danyin.

373
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,280
Lord Ronghao.

374
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,160
Lord Ronghao.

375
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,520
Why are you here?

376
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,780
Changheng is in danger.

377
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,990
I can't leave him alone.

378
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,110
Even if Changheng can go through this time,

379
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,660
if he wants to leave safely,

380
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,130
there is one person we must keep an eye on.

381
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,240
Do you mean

382
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,050
Dongfang Qingcang?

383
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,910
Dongfang Qingcang is powerful.

384
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,710
In the three realms,

385
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,020
the only one that can fight with him is Changheng.

386
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,860
Tonight,

387
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,750
it's a good chance to get rid of Changheng.

388
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,820
Dongfang Qingcang will definitely kill him.

389
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,080
We need to find a way to lure him away.

390
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,800
Fairy Orchid.

391
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,030
You are the only one who could do it.

392
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,540
Because he doesn't believe anyone,

393
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,840
except you.

394
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,440
Only you

395
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,250
can get close to him.

396
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,210
I...

397
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,350
But...

398
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,400
But what?

399
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,000
Orchid,

400
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,140
do you want to save Changheng or not?

401
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,530
Of course I do.

402
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,540
That's it.

403
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,650
There's something

404
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,580
that you don't know yet.

405
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:31,600
Fairy Orchid,

406
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,940
don't you want to know

407
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,930
why Changheng risked his life

408
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,530
to experience hardships in Shenshui Hall?

409
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,760
You don't understand.

410
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,610
It's because you've never

411
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,540
loved someone as I do.

412
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,420
Lord Changheng is experiencing hardships

413
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,100
because of me.

414
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,190
Because you have always been the one

415
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,080
he loves.

416
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,280
Changheng had an engagement with the Goddess.

417
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,540
That's why he can't tell you.

418
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,940
Over the years,

419
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,080
he had looked for the Goddess everywhere

420
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,140
and wanted to break off the engagement

421
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,780
so you can be together.

422
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,300
And that Firefly Stone.

423
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,070
He traveled around

424
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,070
and found it

425
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,640
for you.

426
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,410
I shouldn't

427
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,710
say these things.

428
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,980
But now, the situation is critical.

429
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,830
I have to say it.

430
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,220
Fairy Orchid,

431
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,570
Changheng loves you so much.

432
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,460
I don't know if

433
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,470
you will accept him.

434
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,160
But what happened to him today

435
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,250
was caused by you.

436
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,680
Orchid,

437
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,160
what are you hesitating about?

438
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,710
If Lord Changheng is gone,

439
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,100
who else can fight with him?

440
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,220
Dongfang Qingcang is not a bad person.

441
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,700
He is not what you think.

442
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,590
How dare you speak for him!

443
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,020
Are you crazy?

444
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,960
Fairy Orchid.

445
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,270
You know what?

446
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,530
If Dongfang Qingcang

447
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,210
took my master's primordial spirit,

448
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,980
not only can't I see my master,

449
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,620
the three realms will be in misery.

450
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,770
Many people will lose their families.

451
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,850
Lord Ronghao,

452
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,610
what are you talking about?

453
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,120
Don't you know that?

454
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,680
What does

455
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,320
Dongfang Qingcang want?

456
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,530
Please tell me.

457
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,170
Dongfang Qingcang

458
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,110
wants to take my master's primordial spirit

459
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,750
to break the seal of the Shuofeng Sword

460
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,180
and regain 100,000 soldiers.

461
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,070
Then he will fight against Shuiyuntian.

462
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,840
It's impossible.

463
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,280
It's impossible.

464
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,120
It's true.

465
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,970
In the war 30,000 years ago,

466
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,950
the first God of War

467
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,630
sealed 100,000 soldiers

468
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,100
with the Shuofeng Sword.

469
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,150
There is my master's spiritual mark

470
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,040
on the Shuofeng Sword.

471
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,930
The seal will be broken

472
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,950
only with my master's primordial spirit.

473
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,310
Are you here

474
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,870
just to relax?

475
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,050
Or is there something else?

476
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,810
Nothing.

477
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,700
Are you lying to me?

478
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,920
No.

479
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,850
I'm just here to relax.

480
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,500
Lord Ronghao,

481
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,690
what should I do?

482
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,270
This is a bottle

483
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,700
of poison.

484
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,300
It can weaken his power temporarily.

485
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,350
Stall him for a while.

486
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,490
Just for a while,

487
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,540
I can take my master's primordial spirit

488
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,850
and leave with Changheng safely.

489
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,120
I'm counting on you.

490
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,690
Lady Orchid.

491
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,860
It's almost the auspicious time.

492
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,770
Where are you?

493
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,960
-Orchid. -Lady Orchid.

494
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,300
Make sure he takes the poison.

495
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,700
and make sure nothing goes wrong.

496
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,580
Got it?

497
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:27,380
Yes.

498
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,690
I believe

499
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,630
you will not ignore Changheng's life

500
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,570
and watch the three realms

501
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,880
suffering from the war.

502
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,160
Okay.

503
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,730
Congratulations.

504
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,950
Congratulations.

505
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,710
It's so lively.

506
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,060
Congratulations.

507
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,700
Run, we are going to propose a toast to brother-in-law.

508
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:39,790
Let's go.

509
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,150
Mr. Dongfang.

510
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,960
Brother-in-law, congratulations.

511
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,920
May you have a baby soon.

512
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,430
Let me fill your cup.

513
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,780
How about I get a pot of wine?

514
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,280
Okay.

515
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,000
Here.

516
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,840
Xiao Run is a good drinker.

517
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,100
Mr. Dongfang, here is a toast to you.

518
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,280
A toast to you.

519
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,330
Here.

520
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,290
Congratulations.

521
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,130
Let me fill you another cup.

522
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,480
This way.

523
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,320
Be careful.

524
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,310

Don't you think

it feels a little familiar tonight?

553
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,780
At that time, you just arrived the Cangyan Sea.

Yes.

563
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,810
You were so silly

564
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,870
and thought I would kill you.

We've only known each other for three months,

I've seen you in the Fairies' clothes.

I've seen you in the Moon Tribe's clothes.

Then I've seen you in mortals' clothes.

But the most beautiful clothes on you

572

is the wedding dress tonight.

00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,150
Orchid!

695
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,080
No!

696
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,090
Don't come over!

697
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,940
You will get hurt.

698
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:57,100
I won't let you go.

699
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,280
You took him away.

700
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,760
You took him away.

701
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,080
No!

702
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,010
Don't come over. You will get hurt.

703
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,690
Go.

704
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,980
Lady Wanqing.

705
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,880
Lady Wanqing.

706
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,550
This is the evil spirit.

707
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,260
What's wrong?

708
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,250
I've seen it in the examination for immortals.

709
00:37:59,180 --> 00:37:59,980
What's wrong?

710
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,430
Wooden Head.

711
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,480
Don't come over.

712
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,620
You will get hurt.

713
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:43,780
Be careful.

714
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,500
Lady Wanqing.

715
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,230
You can't die.

716
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,380
You'll be gone if you die.

717
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:24,900
You won't die.

718
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,790
As long as you make it,

719
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,480
you'll ascend back to Lord Changheng.

720
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,320
Lord.

721
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,310
Hang in there.

722
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,200
Cricket,

723
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,220
why are you

724
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,710
still calling me Lord?

725
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:47,750
I am Xiao Run.

726
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,630
Xiao Run.

727
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,080
Xiao Run.

728
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,810
Xiao Run.

729
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,880
Wooden Head.

730
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,740
You...

731
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,460
Are you okay?

732
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,660
It's just the evil spirit. Don't worry.

733
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,060
The poison wine and the bead

734
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,080
were made by the same person, right?

735
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,230
Who is it?

736
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,470
Lord Ronghao.

737
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,870
Chidi woman's one and only disciple.

738
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,860
You're injured.

739
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,950
Where are you going?

740
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,800
To do what I should do.

741
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:04,730
Wooden Head.

742
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,440
Wooden Head.

743
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,750
My Lord.

744
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,350
My Lord.

745
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,580
You are injured.

746
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,130
What happened?

747
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:18,590
It doesn't matter.

748
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,030
Did Xiao Run and Xie Wanqing disappear?

749
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,280
Go find them.

750
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,350
The primordial spirit of Chidi woman is the key to unlocking the seal.

751
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:32,700
It decides whether 100,000 soldiers will come back or not.

752
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,670
No mistake is allowed.

753
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:34,890
Yes.

754
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,140
Xiao Run.

755
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,660
I’ll avenge you.

756
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,860
Wooden Head.

757
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,500
Wooden Head.

758
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,770
Wooden Head.

759
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,170
Where are you?

760
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,170
Lady Wanqing.

761
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,810
What are you doing?

762
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,780
Lady Wanqing.

763
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,050
Why did you choose her

764
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,360
over me?

765
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:20,260
You betrayed me for this woman!

766
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,980
Give my husband back!

767
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,370
You took him away.

768
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,880
You took him away.

769
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,900
What?

770
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,120
You took him away.

771
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,220
It's the evil spirit.

772
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,400
Lady Wanqing.

773
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,210
You're poisoned by the evil spirit.

774
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,130
Let go of me!

775
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,360
Lady Wanqing, wake up.

776
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:55,420
