How dare a dying person

ask for my name?

Who on earth are you?

10

Bad news. It’s the evil spirit.

Is this an earthquake?

You're injured here as expected.

15

Thank you for your concern.

16

But we're not supposed to be so close.

Are you going to kill me?

I do

19
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,020
want to kill you very, very much.

20
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,580
I want to cut off your hands

21

and feet,

22
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,260
and throw you into the Memory Loss River to feed the crocodiles.

00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,860
But I can't do that.

24

Why?

25
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,580
Not only will I not kill you,

26
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,940
I also won't allow

If anyone dares to touch you,

29
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,940
I'll cut their skin off

30
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,860
and make a human lantern out of it.

31
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,420
From now on,

32
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,700

Every drop of blood in your body

belongs to me.

This sinful immortal has been locked up in Haotian Tower.

43
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,810
He has barely seen the world.

44

What spell?

54

This is… the Wulan Holy Seal?

55

You know it.

56

I've only seen it in books.

57
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,860
It’s the totem of the Wulan clan.

But you've got the wrong person.

If I could unlock such an advanced spell,

00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,300
How can this man change his face at the drop of a hat?

174
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,060
You, you…

175
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,500
Stop there.

176
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,660
I... I’m not afraid of you.

177
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,550
I’m warning you.

178
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,980
This is Shuiyuntian.

179
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,650
If you dare to hurt me even a little bit,

180
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,780
those heavenly soldiers

181
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,970
will definitely not let you go.

182
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,300
There is nothing

183
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,740
I wouldn't dare to do it.

184
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,660
But as I said,

185
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,820
I won't hurt you.

186
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,870
He's really scared.

187
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,190
That's good.

188
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,820
I have important things to do.

189
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,740
You should also go back

190
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,579
and turn yourself in at the Haotian Tower.

191
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,750
Don’t follow me anymore.

192
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,450
Little flower spirit,

193
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,339
do you think

194
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,940
I can’t do anything about you?

195
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,780
He's bluffing and waffling on.

196
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,540
He’s not looking for an excuse

197
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,820
to see me, right?

198
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,620
Let go of me.

199
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,500
Let go of me!

200
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,060
Wait.

201
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,430
You can’t read Destiny Book as a sinful immortal.

202
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,420
Give it back!

203
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,680
Don’t read it!

204
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,230
Give it back to me.

205
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,290
Give it back!

206
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,460
Chidi woman.

207
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,740
It's the Chidi woman.

208
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,740
She still has a vestige of her primordial spirit

209
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,420
in the mortal world.

210
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,180
What exactly happened

211
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,340
30,000 years ago?

212
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,460
Who cares how she got to keep her primordial spirit?

213
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,300
With her,

214
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,820
I can unseal 100,000 soldiers.

215
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,940
How dare you still read it?

216
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,860
If you mess with the Destiny Books

217
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,770
and change karma,

218
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,020
you’ll be destroyed,

219
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,900
do you know that?

220
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,180
I'm doing this for your good.

221
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,540
Lord, have you lost

222
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,570
something important?

223
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:00,660
Nothing.

224
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,860
Recently,

225
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,030
you seem to have something on your mind.

226
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,730
I would like to share your worries.

227
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:07,810
Nothing.

228
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,660
You can leave now.

229
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:10,900
Yes.

230
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,440
[Five hundred years ago]

231
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,980
Are you all right?

232
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:14,770
My Lord,

233
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,180
after the escape of the sinful immortals from Haotian Tower last night,

234
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,860
we've searched

235
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,780
the entire Shuiyuntian

236
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,670
as you ordered.

237
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,300
We didn’t find

238
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,370
anything wrong,

239
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,550
nor did we suffer any losses.

240
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,100
Has the Arbiter Hall also been checked?

241
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,860
Not yet.

242
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,700
Why not?

243
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,220
The Arbiter Hall is in a remote location

244
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,220
and has been unoccupied for a long time.

245
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,460
It was my negligence.

246
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,450
Who said it was unoccupied?

247
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,460
It's my fault. I'll go and check it now.

248
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,420
No need.

249
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,380
I'll go myself.

250
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,620
I underestimated you little flower spirit.

251
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,420
Not only do you know the mysterious spell,

252
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,820
but you have Destiny Book

253
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,730
in your hands.

254
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,020
What are you talking about?

255
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,860
I don't understand a word.

256
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,100
Put me down now!

257
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,420
Still trying to play dumb?

258
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,140
Even I thought

259
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,300
she's gone to dust.

260
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,340
I didn’t realize she’s only in the mortal world for destined suffering.

261
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,660
Where did you learn

262
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,820
this trick?

263
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,740
I'm telling the truth.

264
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,380
I found the Destiny Book

265
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,260
yesterday at Haishi City.

266
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,340
I don't even know who it belongs to.

267
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,220
You really didn’t keep it yourself?

268
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,500
All the destiny books

269
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
should have been placed in the Arbiter Hall.

270
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,740
I saw it in Haishi City,

271
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,980
so I brought it back.

272
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,180
Let me ask you.

273
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,260
Where is Arbiter now?

274
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,060
Why are you asking for my master again?

275
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,370
Didn't I tell you?

276
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,620
She's been wandering in Yunmeng Lake

277
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,460
for over a thousand years.

278
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,220
You're her disciple?

279
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,250
I'm her only disciple.

280
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,130
Then you must be able to fix the Destiny Book too.

281
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,340
Of course.

282
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,580
Little flower spirit,

283
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,850
I want you to do something for me.

284
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,380
Otherwise,

285
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,100
I will set fire to your greenhouse.

286
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,550
[Arbiter Hall]

287
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,090
[Arbiter Hall]

288
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,460
Lord… Lord Changheng.

289
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,860
Last night, sinful immortals escaped from Haotian Tower.

290
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,850
Did they harass the Arbiter Hall?

291
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,460
The Arbiter Hall is… very safe.

292
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,660
No sinful immortal came to rob the Destiny Book,

293
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,940
nor did anyone come to burn the greenhouse.

294
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,860
Burn the greenhouse?

295
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,140
Where is the young disciple

296
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,260
Where is the young apprentice

297
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:16,940
who is always around the arbiter?

298
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,020
Why haven't I seen her today?

299
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,340
Orchid

300
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,700
is recently in seclusion and training

301
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,130
to prepare for the immortal examination.

302
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,180
Okay.

303
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,380
Lord Changheng.

304
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,940
Would you like to come in

305
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,140
and look around for her in the Arbiter Hall?

306
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,660
If you can give her some guidance,

307
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,060
she'll make great improvements.

308
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,100
Lord, please look for her.

309
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,610
That's not necessary.

310
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,180
I was going to ask her when Arbiter would return.

311
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,460
Since she's busy,

312
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,220
I won't bother her.

313
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:53,940
Wait...

314
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,970
[Arbiter Hall]

315
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,010
I didn't say anything wrong.

316

Please let Orchid go.

317
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,500
Don't cry.

318
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,740
It's all your fault. It's all your fault.

319
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,290
It's rare

320
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,020
for Lord Changheng

321
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,460
to ask about me.

322
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,420
Ever since I met you,

323
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,020
I've been unlucky.

324
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,140
I lost the Universe Pill

325
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,300
that I went through all the trouble to buy.

326
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,700
I've also lost the elixir.

327
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,660
Now I can't even cure my immortal root.

328
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,580
Do you know how sad I am?

329
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,820
I wish I didn't know.

330
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:06,740
Yes, I do.

331
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,980
How could you possibly know?

332
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,420
What you want is this, right?

333
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,780
Universe Pill?

334
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,180
Give it to me.

335
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,340
Fix the Destiny Book, then I’ll give it to you.

336
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,220
Master only taught me how to organize the destiny books.

337
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:50,940
She never taught me

338
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,340
how to fix

339
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,460
a broken destiny book like this.

340
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,540
Are you really a disciple of the Arbiter?

341
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,140
Of course.

342
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,620
I'm the only disciple of my master.

343
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,700
Since you're a disciple of the Arbiter,

344
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,940
why are you doing it so wrongly?

345
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,300
You… you…

346
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,500
Think about how hard I’ve worked today.

347
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,740
I almost lost my life

348
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,060
in Haishi City.

349
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,420
I was so scared.

350
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,380
And look,

351
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,820
I now have bruises

352
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,740
all over my body.

353
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,140
They hurt so much.

354
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,260
I’m also being threatened, scared,

355
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,140
and pinched by you.

356
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,460
I'm really tired.

357
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,100
But don't worry.

358
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,900
After I rest for one night,

359
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,970
I'll fix it tomorrow.

360
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,140
Okay.

361
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:55,740
In that case,

362
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,860
where will I sleep tonight?

363
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,470
How do I know where you'll be sleeping?

364
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,810
You're not going to stay here, are you?

365
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,420
No, no!

366
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,140
You can't stay here.

367
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,660
Go, go!

368
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:13,700
That's fine.

369
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,460
Where do you want to spend the night with me?

370
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,260
With you?

371
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,660
No,

372
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,660
I’ll stay here tonight.

373
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:21,780
No way.

374
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,340
I told you

375
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,380
you belong to me.

376
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:26,940
I can go,

377
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,580
only if you stay with me.

378
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,700
I mean,

379
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,820
I'm just an ordinary fairy

380
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,260
in Shuiyuntian.

381
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,620
Although my power and appearance

382
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,700
are not worth mentioning,

383
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,980
I'm still on the list.

384
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,500
You should consider my reputation,

385
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,010
okay?

386
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,060
Besides,

387
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,700
if I'm running around like this,

388
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,860
how can I get my strength back?

389
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,860
How can I fix the Destiny Book?

390
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,140
Anyway, I’m staying here tonight.

391
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,740
I’m not going anywhere.

392
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,580
That's a good point.

393
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,420
Then let's stay in the Arbiter Hall tonight.

394
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,500
So,

395
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,540
where will I sleep tonight?

396
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,220
This is my master's room.

397
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,660
Although it’s somehow small,

398
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,100
I can make do with it.

399
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,300
Small?

400
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,820
This is small?

401
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,140
Did you use to live in a palace?

402
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,980
My master is out on a trip.

403
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,980
She won’t be back for a while.

404
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,940
No one lives here.

405
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,300
If you stay here,

406
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,310
don't ever wander around.

407
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,810
If someone finds out

408
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,900
I'm hiding a sinful immortal,

409
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,060
we’ll be both screwed.

410
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,500
With me here,

411
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,850
no one will dare to hurt you.

412
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,740
It's enough to tell a lie once.

413
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,740
Why do you take it more and more seriously?

414
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,340
Where are you going?

415
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,660
Going to sleep.

416
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,020
It's been such a long day.

417
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,290
I'm exhausted.

418
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,130
Aren't you tired?

419
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,860
Right,

420
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,060
the blanket and pillow are over there.

421
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,750
Get it yourself.

422
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:49,740
Stop there.

423
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,660
I'll say it again.

424
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,700
From now on,

425
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,860
don't leave my sight.

426
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,780
Don't go anywhere else.

427
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,820
Sleep right here.

428
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,740
You sinful immortal.

429
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,620
Have you been

430
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,690
locked up for so long that you’ve lost your mind?

431
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,860
You don't even know the rituals of Shuiyuntian.

432
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,540
Male body, female body.

433
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,420
We have to sleep separately.

434
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,300
It’s already against the rules

435
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,500
to stay in the Arbiter Hall alone.

436
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,060
If we even sleep in the same bed,

437
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,460
well, you…

438
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,460
What will happen?

439
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:35,900
then...

440
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:38,660
Forget it.

441
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,100
I’m not going to waste my time with you.

442
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,660
I'm going to bed.

443
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,580
Right,

444
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,620
I have something else to tell you.

445
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:53,660
Go ahead.

446
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,170
I already have someone I like.

447
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,340
Whom you like is none of my business.

448
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,670
But you belong to me.

449
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:04,580
If...

450
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:22,980
You…

451
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,070
Why, why are you here?

452
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,140
I told you

453
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,660
you are not to leave my sight.

454
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,140
I also said

455
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,900
we'll sleep in our own rooms.

456
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,740
Go back now!

457
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,460
Are you threatening me?

458
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,020
It’s not like I’ve never done this before.

459
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,940
Okay.

460
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,140
Fine.

461
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,340
You like it here.

462
00:32:59,340 --> 00:32:59,940
Fine,

463
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,330
you sleep here and I’ll go.

464
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,740
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

465
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,900
Are you done?

466
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,930
You’re a few thousand years old.

467
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,220
Let me tell you.

468
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,650
Although I've only known you for one day,

469
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,900
I’ve never been more annoyed in the past one thousand years I lived.

470
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,860
I can only

471
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,100
keep you out of danger.

472
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,300
For me,

473
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,500
you’re the only danger

474
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,850
in the whole Yujing.

475
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,260
Ouch.

476
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,900
I hit my head.

477
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,740
Why are you moaning?

478
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,780
I'm ordering you

479
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,980
not to hurt yourself anymore.

480
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,940
This sinful immortal

481
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,540
is quite caring though.

482
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,540
Neither of us can sleep well

483
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,340
like this.

484
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,340
How about

485
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,900
you go back to your room?

486
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,980
Then I'll come back tomorrow morning.

487
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,500
What are you doing?

488
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:17,930
Come with me.

489
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,580
Little sinful immortal?

490
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:39,440
