00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,860

Please cooperate with me later.

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,630
I'll say "start".

Then you can count down from 5 to 1, and I'll take a screenshot, OK?

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,360
Well, everyone, I'll say "start", and you can count down.

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,430
Start.

[The host is announcing the winning list]

63

and we will contact you.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,630
At the same time,

72
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,060
you can again take a look at our Rua dolls.

73
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,990
Aren't they lovely?

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,560
Please give a cut-away shot to them.

75
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,160
OK. At the same time,

76
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,390
Today at 19:00,

77
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,360
we'll announce a lucky quota.

78
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
When you enter the live stream room,

79
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,600

80
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,360
the entrance to the lucky destiny book.

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,390
We all have our lucky numbers.

82
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:39,960
Later,

83
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,560
100 lucky fans will get the lucky box.

84
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,829
Besides the Rua dolls we just showed,

85
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,030
“Love Between Fairy and Devil" also has many derivative products.

86
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,160
There are gift boxes for treasuring up,

87
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,030
jointly-designed models,

88
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,460
Dongfang Qingcang's GPS Voice packet,

89
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,060
various cultural and creative merchandises,

90
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,290
and accessories that appeared in the drama,

91
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,430
like the Han Chinese Clothing, cooking Utensil,

92
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,360
and tea-based drink.

93
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,090
We hope you can always

94
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,500
feel in life

95
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,560
the continuous companionship of "Love Between Fairy and Devil".

96
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,700
Next,

97
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,960
I'd like to invite two special guests to the stage.

98
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,760
They two are

99
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,030
very important to the drama.

100
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,560
Because without them, your beloved "Love Between Fairy and Devil" wouldn't have come into being.

101
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,760
They are the two parents of the drama.

102
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,790
Let's applaud

103
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
and welcome the senior VP of iQIYI, Yang Bei,

104
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,300
and CEO of STELLAR,

105
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,190
Wang Yixu, please.

106
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,160
Welcome Lady Bei. Welcome. Come together.

107
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,000
Have a seat. Wow, you are happy now, right?

108
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,230
Would you like them to share with us

109
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,990
how this drama came into being?

110
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,360
OK. Please say hello to the netizens.

111
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,890
Lady Bei.

112
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:44,890


113
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,350
Hi, everyone. I'm Yang Bei

114
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,720
from iQIYI PCG content team.

115
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,290
Thank you for coming here tonight.

116
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,690
And the people onlone,

117
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,780
thank you for supporting us in this summer.

118
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,890
Thank you.

119
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,380
Hello, everyone. I'm Yi Xu from STELLAR,

120
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,850
thank you.

121
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,490
We have support for both of you.

122
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,320
Why don't you share with

123
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,920
the VIP users

124
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,080
the evolvement of "Love Between Fairy and Devil"?

125
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,180
You go first, Ms. Bei.

126
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,120
Actually, I'm quite excited today

127
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,850
to be able to share

128
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,120
with you the story of "Love Between Fairy and Devil".

129
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,380
At the end of 2018,

130
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,120
our team started preparing for this project.

131
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,380
The project we got at that time

132
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,380
was actually a science fiction story.

133
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,890
At that time, the fairy realm was defined as

134
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,650
a gathering place for aliens in charge of everything in the mortal world.

135
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:53,450
And the Moon Tribe was defined as a slum of steam punk style,

136
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,550
where

137
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,850
the alien Orchid falls in love with the punk Supreme Lord.

138
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,040
This project has been revised 19 times

139
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,590
during three years

140
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,190
and ends up what you see now.

141
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,250
In the first place,

142
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,920
Orchid has a

143
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,150
traditional persona

144
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,650
in the cheesy ancient immortal TV series.

145
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,050
She's a sweet but silly girl.

146
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:26,880
After many conversations with the director and scriptwriter,

147
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,390
we finally made this character

148
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,120
cowardly but brave,

149
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,090
which is the Orchid we see today.

150
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,880
The original Moon Supreme

151
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,680
is a very weak character.

152
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,050
During the process,

153
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:51,680
we gradually made him his father, brother, and subordinates

154
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:59,250
so that the character has family, friendship, and love to complete him.

155
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,320
"Love Between Fairy and Devil" is actually about

156
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,850
what is love

157
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,350
and how to love.

158
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,650
What is love?

159
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:14,160
Love is tolerance, understanding, sincerity, and courage.

160
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,690
Love is not a weakness.

161
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,050
Love is armor.

162
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,680
This is also one of the important reasons

163
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,250
why "Love Between Fairy and Devil" has made it to Sweet ON.

164
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,080
The success of this project

165
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,320
is the result of a team working together.

166
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,490

we can turn this love into power

193
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,690

194
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,250

On behalf of our company,

Thank you.

198
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,250
Next, Mr. Yi Xu, please talk to us.

199
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,650
Okay.

200
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,190
I mainly want to express my gratitude.

201
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,920

for STELLAR.

205
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,180
We've created

206
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,090

207
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,550
And on behalf of

208
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,050

210
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,520
I want to thank all of you

211
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,950
who have supported us this summer.

212
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,520
It's you who've made

213
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,320
this summer miracle.

214
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,320
Thank you for making this summer miracle happen.

215
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,320


216
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,110
Second,

217
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,770
what I want to express is that this is a work

218
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,640
that all of our main creative teams have poured our love into it.

219
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,370
and it has also been loved by everyone.

220
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,640
So we hope that in the future,

221
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,740
when you feel lonely,

222
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,040
depressed

223
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,580
or eager to be inspired,

224
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,380
you can watch "Love Between Fairy and Devil" again.

225
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,440
We shall never say goodbye.

226
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,140
Lastly, I would like to make a wish

227
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,080
I hope that every staff member

228
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,410
who participated in the production of “Love Between Fairy and Devil”

229
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,010
and every audience who enjoyed this series

230
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,840
will have a safe, happy,

231
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,040
and successful future. We can all be loved

232
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,080
and never feel lonely, thanks.

233
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,860
And thank Mr. Yi Xu for bringing us the sense of well-being and love.

234
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,540
Today,

235
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,210
though our director didn't come to the scene,

236
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,870
he also recorded a video for us.

237
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,580
Let's look at the screen.

238
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,480
Hello, everyone. I am the director of “Love Between Fairy and Devil”, Yi Zheng.

239
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,540
I'm so sorry that

240
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,410
I couldn't join you today

241
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,740
to celebrate the success of “Love Between Fairy and Devil”.

242
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,340
It's such a pity.

243
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,980
And

244
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,640
I'd like to

245
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,440
express my gratitude to everyone.

246
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,240
First of all, I want to thank the platform, iQiyi,

247
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,770
Thank Mr. Gong Yu and Mr. Xiao Hui.

248
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,140
Next, thank the producers of iQIYI.

249
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:09,060
Ms. Bei, Mr. Fei, Manman, and Tuoye.

250
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,740
I also thank my responsible editors,

251
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,170
Yi Fei, Yan Fei

252
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,480
and many other friends whose names I don't know.

253
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,210
I really appreciate everyone's hard work

254
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,980
from the very beginning of “Love Between Fairy and Devil”

255
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,340
to the final broadcast.

256
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,010
I am grateful and happy

257
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,940
that you could fight alongside us.

258
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,980
Then I would also like to thank STELLAR.

259
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:42,040
Thank Yi Xu and Jason for giving me such an opportunity

260
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,140
to make such a good TV series.

261
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,370
Then I want to thank the creators.

262
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,770
First of all, I would like to thank Xiaojiu

263
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,370
for writing such a good novel.

264
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,840
And

265
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,410
I thank all the creators who filmed on site,

266
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,010
and the crew

267
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,640
for their dedication to this series.

268
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,380
Lastly,

269
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,740
I want to thank

270
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,040
my lovely young actors.

271
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,570
As a representative

272
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,680
of the young actors

273
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,340
who starred in "Love Between Fairy and Devil",

274
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,140
I would like to thank the lead actor and the lead actress.

275
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,770
I would like to

276
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,610
start with Esther Yu, who starred Orchid.

277
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,970
She is a gifted actress

278
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,470
with a naturally good sense of rhythm.

279
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,610
And

280
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,080
she has a very sensual sense

281
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,610
of sensitivity.

282
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,280
She also has a great ability to imitate.

283
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,240
As an actress,

284
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,270
these abilities are a unique gift.

285
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,380
It is not common for her

286
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,080
to have such comprehensive talents

287
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,140
and conditions

288
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,210
among young actors.

289
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,240
It's really rare.

290
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,080
I hope she can

291
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,210
create more different and good characters

292
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,770
in the future.

293
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,010
As for Dylan,

294
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,410
you may wonder why I was so optimistic about him

295
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,140
at the beginning.

296
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,440
We had been shooting for two or three months at that time.

297
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,240
Only I knew what he would be like

298
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
when the whole plot was connected.

299
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,170
His performance was just too amazing.

300
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,140
He's like

301
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,040
the core member

302
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,370
on the basketball court.

303
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,780
When you are stuck

304
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,080
or in a deadlock,

305
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,780
he will step up

306
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,040
to help you

307
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,210
solve those problems.

308
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,340
So I actually didn't think much

309
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,540
about posting those things on Weibo at the time.

310
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,980
Because I firmly believe that

311
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,640
“Love Between Fairy and Devil” will definitely

312
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,570
make everyone recognize a different Dylan Wang,

313
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
and so would the rest of these actors.

314
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,840
I believe that the entire performance

315
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,010
and creation process of this TV series

316
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:55,010
will be a very unforgettable experience in their lives.

317
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,010
And it would also be a very important work

318
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,980
in their career as actors.

319
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,870
In fact, it's hard to express my feelings right now

320
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,340
in just a few words.

321
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,580
We spent four months together.

322
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,240
Thank you

323
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,140
for devoting all your emotions to this project,

324
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:20,080
offering such great performance,

325
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,970
and delivering such a moving story and emotions.

326
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,210
I hope your future path will be more and more successful

327
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,980
and you will create more and more good and impressive characters.

328
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:40,470
I also wish this celebration party of "Love Between Fairy and Devil"

329
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,040
will be a success.

330
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,010
Thank you.

331
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:44,010


332
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,380
Thank director for the blessings.

333
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,780
We also look forward to

334
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,210
more of the director's works in the future.

335
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,010
Next,

336
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,080
it's time for our guest's big news.

337
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,880
Let's welcome

338
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,280
Guo Xiao Ting, who starred God Chidi,

339
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,080
Charles Lin, who starred Shangque,

340
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,750
and Hong Xiao, who starred Jieli.

341
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,550
Let's have a talk. Please.

342
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,610
Welcome, Xiao Ting. This way, please.

343
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,380
Hello, Charles.

344
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,280
Hello, Xiaoxiao.

345
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,010
Please have a seat.

346
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,120
Hello. Hello.

347
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,380
Have a seat.

348
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,210
Sit down.

349
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,480
Sit here.

350
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,280
OK. Please say hello

351
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,310
to our VIP members on-site and online.

352
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,820
Xiao Ting, face that side first.

353
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,750
Hello, everyone. I'm Guo Xiao Ting.

354
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,310
I played the role of God Chidi.

355
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,880
Welcome Xiao Ting.

356
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,420
And Charles.

357
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,880
Hello, everyone. I'm Charles Lin.

358
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,610
I starred Shangque.

359
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,820
Welcome our Black Dragon.

360
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,580
Hello, everyone. I'm Hong Xiao.

361
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,810
I starred Jieli.

362
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,910
OK. Welcome Xiaoxiao.

363
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,480
Why don't the three of you

364
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,610
expose something to us, OK?

365
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,320
We've collected a lot of questions

366
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,150
from the netizens and VIP members.

367
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,010
For example, the first one.

368
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,780
It says

369
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,680
they think the crew of “Love Between Fairy and Devil” is a happy crew.

370
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,980
You seem to be having fun

371
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,310
in bonus scenes.

372
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,150
Can you tell us some interesting stories behind the scene?

373
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,510
How to enliven the atmosphere?

374
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,280
Anything is fine.

375
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,810
You go first. Okay, I'll go first.

376
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,580
I think the atmosphere of our crew,

377
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,680
except for when we started filming,

378
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,350
didn't need to be enlivened.

379
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,280
Because we got familiar with each other soon.

380
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,180
Who didn't have scenes then

381
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,350
would have dinner together.

382
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,210
So we were very happy every day.

383
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,480
There's no need to enliven it.

384
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,080
We boys played basketball.

385
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,120
Then we got familiar soon.

386
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,780
Every day, you were like hey bro,

387
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,280
Let's go play basketball.

388
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,120
OK. What about Xiao Ting?

389
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,020
Only in scenes at Yunmeng Lake

390
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,220
did I meet the others.

391
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,820
Yes. We had fun every day.

392
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,310
OK.

393
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,020
Many netizens said that you have a team spirit.

394
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,080
Let's make a hypothesis today.

395
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,310
If your leading actors

396
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,280
are in the same group,

397
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,080
which task will you bear?

398
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,109
For example, if one would be a good look bearer,

399
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,220
who will you three choose?

400
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,880
Orchid.

401
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,550
Me...

402
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,280
You?

403
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,510
Haha, you said you're the good look bearer.

404
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,079
Yes, does  The Moon Supreme know that?

405
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,109
My Lord and I...

406
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,819
Ah, haha.

407
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,920
Xiaoxiao, what do you think?

408
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,579
Dongfang Qingcang.

409
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,980
Maybe Black Dragon is more handsome in your heart.

410
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,550
No. He's a vocal.

411
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:24,819
Vocal bearer.

412
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,550
Yes.

413
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,510
I have a new role.

414
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,820
But I think Zhang Ling He is the vocal.

415
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,680
Zhang Ling He?

416
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,380
Yes, yes. He has direct shots with over a million plays.

417
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,210
Well, you two,

418
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,220
what kind of bearer do you think you can be?

419
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,520
I'm the makeup bearer.

420
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,580
Makeup bearer.

421
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,880
[Makeup bearer? Haha.]

422
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,480
- Xiaoxiao wants to battle. -We need to compete.

423
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,480
What kind of bearer is Xiaoxiao?

424
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,750
I think she's the film bearer.

425
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,150
IQ bearer.

426
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,380
OK. Shall we arrange for the other people?

427
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,010
Let's think of a role for Dylan.

428
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,310
-He's the... -Poser.

429
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,950
Vocal.

430
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
He's also a vocal?

431
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,710
You're a better vocal than he is.

432
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,350
He's the lead singer and dancer.

433
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,980
Lead singer and dancer.

434
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,080
I think Dongfang Qingcang should be the Bking.

435
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,910
It's true.

436
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,720
Yes.

437
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,620
Let's arrange a role for Xifang Shuaimai.

438
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,180
What kind of a bearer is the little brother?

439
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,950
He is the youngest.

440
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,950
The cutest one in every group, right?

441
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,580
Alright, Cutie. What about Lord Ronghao?

442
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,510
Rong Hao is the depression bearer.

443
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,750
Depression bearer. Yes.

444
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
OK. Everyone has their own responsibilities.

445
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,710
If you have your own ideas,

446
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,680
you can tell us in the comment area, okay?

447
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,510
Thank you.

448
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,480
Next question.

449
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,280
That is...

450
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,910
We heard that there is a private group chat of The Moon Tribe.

451
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,920
Charles, tell us about it.

452
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,550
Who are in this group?

453
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,350
What's your ID?

454
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,320
The Moon Tribe?

455
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,480
Yes, the Moon Tribe's group chat.

456
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,380
Name of the group chat?

457
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,310
You can tell me your group name and your ID.

458
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,580
Why are you in a private group?

459
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,220
They don't let us join them.

460
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,320
I don't think we're in this group.

461
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,720
We're not, right?

462
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,550
Oh no.

463
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,950
Why do they have a private group?

464
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,280
Black Dragon will kneel on the washboard back home.

465
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,350
Well,

466
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,960
The Four Giants of the Moon Tribe.

467
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,780
The Four Giants.

468
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,720
What's your ID?

469
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,910
We are all bros.

470
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,980
What's Dylan Wang's ID?

471
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,880
Is it the same? Yes. Giant One, Giant Two, Giant Three.

472
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,920
Yes, he's Giant One.

473
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,310
He's Giant One? OK.

474
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,950
We just complained that

475
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,310
you didn't let these two girls join you,

476
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,150
Right? Is there a group chat of The Immortals Tribe, Xiao Ting?

477
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,950
No group chat, right?

478
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,310
I'm only in the group chat of all.

479
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:38,850
The large group?

480
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:38,850


481
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,850
What is it called again?

482
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,110
Let me see.

483
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,310
He's only one who brings his phone to work.

484
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,670
It's called "Love Between Fairy and Devil happy something..."

485
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,280
Didn't you just send a message in that chat?

486
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,110
It's called family or something.

487
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,880
It's like a family group chat.

488
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,210
Like a family group chat.

489
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,840
Every one of them

490
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,540
is going through the chat history carefully.

491
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,550
Can you find it?

492
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,210
It's called "Love Between Fairy and Devil Squad."

493
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,740
What a boring name.

494
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,010
What was the last message you posted in that group chat?

495
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,340
Can you tell us?

496
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,680
I said, "Everyone has arrived. Hurry up!"

497
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,540
I'm here. OK.

498
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,550
Xiao, if you could change the name of the group,

499
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,750
what would it be?

500
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,040
Jieli's Fan Club.

501
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,280
Haha.

502
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,110
Haha.

503
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,240
I thought it would be a mutual-help group like Jieli can teach you to get rich or something.

504
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,910
Just follow the boss and making money will be as simple as breathing.

505
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,940
OK. Now let's move on to the next section.

506
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,810
Let's talk about the crew.

507
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,280
I heard the food for crew was really nice.

508
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,480
There are many behind-the-scenes of you guys eating.

509
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,680
Can you share it with us?

510
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,410
Did you crew members usually eat together

511
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,210
or eat separately?

512
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,840
I mean did you gather in a circle and eat together?

513
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,020
When I was filming,

514
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,940
I would have food with everyone on set,

515
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,650
and together we would share a lot of snacks,

516
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,450
including some yogurt.

517
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,250
Oh, the yogurt?

518
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:51,610
Yeah.

519
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,210
We also have the yogurt here today.

520
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:57,010
That's right, the Chunzhen yogurt was so tasty.

521
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,140
So this is the new version of health yogurt.

522
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,810
I heard this yogurt is...

523
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,010
Why does Charles look like he wants to try some yogurt?

524
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,640
Hahaha.

525
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,880
He loves this, too.

526
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,080
Yes. I love Chunzhen yogurt a lot.

527
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,410
It's not only popular

528
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,310
in Yunmeng Lake and Shuiyuntian,

529
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,640
They are also popular in Cangyan Sea.

530
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,880
It's healthy.

531
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,540
It's healthy and tasty.

532
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,210
OK. You can try this yogurt now.

533
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,610
Please pass it to Charles.

534
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,910
He's been memorizing the ad slogan behind the scene.

535
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,540
Here comes the handsome side face.

536
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,080
OK. It's the Chunzhen Yogurt!

537
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,750
It's healthy and tasty.

538
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:38,810
Ha.

539
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,010
Well, let's get down to the topic.

540
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,940
I mean, you guys must have shared a lot of snacks

541
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,350
other than the yogurt, right?

542
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,410
Which one of you was the foodie?

543
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,880
Uh.

544
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,650
Is that a sensitive question?

545
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,850
He can't stop drinking it.

546
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,880
Haha.

547
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,540
You mean, who was the foodie among us?

548
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,910
It seems like you guys are reluctant to answer this question.

549
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:58,940
It looks like it's gonna be something intimidating.

550
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,210
I don't think there was a foodie in this crew.

551
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,880
Everyone was on a diet.

552
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,450
It's Jieli, she can eat a lot.

553
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,410
Me? Really?

554
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,840
You always bought a lot of stuff in Hengdian,

555
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,680
like the specialties or something.

556
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,650
Huh?

557
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,750
So you guys were all on a diet,

558
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,050
and went to work out a lot, right?

559
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,210
It's called involution, right?

560
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,880
So which one of you likes to working out the most?

561
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,040
I mean the type of person who's like addicted to working out.

562
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,710
That's him, every time when came to the crew,

563
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,910
he would show everyone the muscles he just made through work-out the other day.

564
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,040
Haha.

565
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,410
Is that true, Charles?

566
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,880
Yeah, because in the beginning,

567
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,710
I didn't know much about Jieli, we're not acquaintances.

568
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,910
And we had to start with shooting some romantic scenes.

569
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,010
What does this have to do with your fitness?

570
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:42,710
Hahaha.

571
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,310
I didn't know how to get along with her.

572
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,840
Let me make it clear.

573
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,110
Because he had to shoot some romantic scenes with Jieli,

574
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,310
he went to the gym and bragged about it.

575
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,710
This behavior sounds quite like a kind of

576
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,080
cute and cool animal that I know.

577
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,940
Yeah, it's kinda childish. Boys think girls would be surprised to the muscles.

578
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,050
Right. It reminds me of peacock, actually.

579
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,280
Hahaha.

580
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,710
Yeah, after finishing the show, I know that girls don't like to see it.

581
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,480
OK. Xiao Ting, could you please tell us,

582
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,010
did anything funny happen during the filming with Hai Qiao,

583
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:10,610
or some happy moments?

584
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,340
Because every time you two show up, it feels like you two got some real problems.

585
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,540
Yes, we were like...

586
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,480
The only way to solve this problem was to play

587
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,640
a boring game.

588
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,710
How boring was it?

589
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,680
Like, we would pick up the leaves on the ground.

590
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,860
We would have a competition to see who picked the prettier leaves.

591
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,880
For him,

592
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,610
this is the Rong Hao's destiny book.

593
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,010
Right. Then we'll stab each other.

594
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,240
What does that mean?

595
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,080
I mean, I was saying the ending.

596
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,740
Right.

597
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,080
The last scene of you two made me feel so sad when I watched it at home.

598
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:37,850
Haha.

599
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,840
Very sad.

600
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,150
OK. Now, I'll ask you three a commen question.

601
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,350
If there was chance

602
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,410
for you to

603
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,640
take something from the crew,

604
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,110
what would that be?

605
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:50,910
For example,

606
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,340
I heard Dylan took

607
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,900
the ring

608
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,810
as a souvenir, right?

609
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,640
If you were allowed to take something from

610
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,910
Love Between Fairy and Devil crew,

611
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,480
what would it be?

612
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,680
I would like to take

613
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,280
Dongfang Qingcang's Hellfire Sword.

614
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,640
Wow, is that your option?

615
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,280
You're really ambitious, Black Dragon.

616
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,510
I've been guarding that sword for 30,000 years.

617
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,710
I have feelings for it.

618
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,740
Yes, it's been 30,000 years.

619
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,050
Look how many things Rong Hao has done during the 30,000 years.

620
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,080
What about you? You just waited for 30,000 years.

621
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,480
It's hard to guard that sword.

622
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,080
Everyone wants to get that sword.

623
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,610
I don't want it.

624
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,110
Neither do I.

625
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,510
Not really.

626
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,940
So, what will Xiaoxiao choose to take?

627
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,710
I really want the Dieyi's whip.

628
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,650
I think that whip is so cool.

629
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,110
-Because I was being abused every day, right? -Yeah.

630
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,640
Maybe you're the one who's been whipped the most.

631
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,450
Right.

632
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:40,450


633
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:41,710
What about Xiao Ting?

634
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,740
I want the black dragon with visual effects.

635
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,340
Wow, is that your option?

636
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,710
I really want that big black dragon.

637
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,210
With that big black dragon, we can travel the three realms

638
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,080
and travel around.

639
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,940
It looks cool.

640
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,210
Yes.

641
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,350
But Xiaoxiao seems to have something to show you around.

642
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,550
With TAILG,

643
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,510
Black Dragon can get off work.

644
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,510
We can travel the three realms by TAILG.

645
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,240
TAILG runs further.

646
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,280
This one will be given to you later, okay?

647
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,540
-Really? -You can ride home directly.

648
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,410
I'll take it seriously.

649
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,480
-Really? -You can ride your beloved TAILG

650
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,510
and go home.

651
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,080
Okay, I'll move it down later.

652
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,280
OK.

653
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,240
During our chat,

654
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,710
we could feel the atmosphere of our crew was very lively

655
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,940
and happy.

656
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,150
In the behind-the-scenes video,

657
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,680
you also played a game.

658
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,940
It's the folding hamburgers game,

659
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,610
a game to hit the counterpart's back of his hand.

660
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,740
Besides this game,

661
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,080
do you have anything interesting

662
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,410
to share with us?

663
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,310
Interesting sidelights

664
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,540
or some scenes make you burst into an undue laughter are OK.

665
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,610
Our crew...

666
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,240
Can you think of more interesting things

667
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,210
when you get together?

668
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,410
Because our scenes

669
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:57,210
were shot by two or three people.

670
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,510
We rarely get together.

671
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:03,880
So each couple has their own way of getting along.

672
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,140
Yeah.

673
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,950
OK. Let's look forward to everyone's gathering.

674
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,310
-Please take a break, OK? Thank you. -OK.

675
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,210
Our online friends must be excited

676
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,140
after waiting for a long time.

677
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,050
Now let's draw another round of awards

678
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,010
and send our presents to you.

679
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,250
We will also select 10 VIP members of iQIYI by ScreenShots.

680
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,690
They can get the membership of iQIYI for one month,

681
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,510

683
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,480

684
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,850
Everyone, can you call three, two and one for me?

685
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,880
Come on.

686
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,410
It is successful. Let's congratulate

687
00:26:47,410 --> 00:27:04,940

688
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,110
We'll save this one and pick another one.

689
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:12,910
There are two more. The first two get our presents. Three, two one. Okay.

690

we have to mention that

698
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,840
the auspicious time has come and the moon is full.

699
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,610
When we meet again with the full moon and beautiful flowers,

The flowers are full of Yumeng Lake.

00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,810
Beautiful scenery is always here.

703
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,740
The moon shadow floats across the ocean.

704
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,710
At this moment, we can achieve our deams.

That's right. We gather here today at blooming flowers and full moon night.

Alright.

734
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,680
I'm not... With such a sad music...

735
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,240
I'm not peony.

736
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,150
I'm not Chinese rose.

737
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,450
I am Orchid

739
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,510
Okay.

746
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,740
I'm not a Dongfang seller.

747
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,770
I'm not a Dongfang promoter. I'm Dongfang Qingcang.

748
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,870
Wow.

749
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,170

752
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,210
Hello, everyone. I'm Lord Changheng.

753
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,910
Haha. No one applauded for you.

754
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,810
Can I applaud myself?

755
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,370
Sure.

756
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,300
Lord Ronghao looks happy.

757
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,540
Then please say hello in this way.

758
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,570
Let me learn how Orchid calls me in the play.

759
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,740
I'm Lord Rong Hao.

760
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,970
- Hahaha, I failed. - No.

761
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:09,900
Welcome, Hai Qiao.

762
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,910
Aren't we supposed to introduce ourselves?

763
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,070
But we didn't recite that "I'm not...

764
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,900
I'm not..."

765
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,370
You can introduce yourselves in your own way.

766
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,210
I'm not.

767
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,340

00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,300
Hahaha.

770

OK. OK. Let’s welcome Charles.

771
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,900
Many people are like this now.

772
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,910
It feels good.

773
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,370
It feels good.

774
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,570
I am the vehicle of

775
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:36,510
Orchid and Dongfang Qingcang's.

776
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,740
I'm the first bodyguard of Cangyan Sea.

777
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,210
I'm Shangque. All hail my lord.

778
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,770
Welcome.

779
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,500
To be honest,

780
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,740
this is the first time I've heard this version.

781
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,370
He may feel a little uncomfortable.

782
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,940
Come on, Xiaoxiao.

783
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,540
I'm neither a rhinoceros nor lobster fairy.

784
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,500
I'm the love security of Cangyan Sea.

785
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,800
What fairy is that?

786
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:05,700
That's a little demon.

787
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:09,370
You're like a little psycho.

788
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,800
I agree.

789
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,810
Little demon.

790
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,870
Okay. Give it to Xiao Ting.

791
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,200
I'm not Landi. I'm not Lvdi.

792
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,910
I'm Chidi.

793
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,000
Let's welcome

794
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,470
Next,

795
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,540
I'm not Xifang Shuaimai.

796
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,070
Chen Xiao.

797
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:27,670
Hello.

798
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,940
I'm not Xifang Shuaimai or Xiaoqiang, I'm Xunfeng.

799
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,400
Welcome, Xunfeng.

800
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,610
Next, we're talking about

801
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,770
that Cheng Zi mentioned just now.

802
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,770
I'm not a moth.

803
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:45,540
I'm Secretary Butterfly who's causing trouble in the three realms.

804
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,910
Okay. Let's welcome our Secretary Butterfly.

805
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,070
Let's sit down after the greeting.

806
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,540
Let's have a talk, okay?

807
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,470
Let's sit down and talk.

808
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,140
Let's go.

809
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,070
Haha.

810
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,010
Wow.

811
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,110
I want to share my view with you.

812
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,770
I think I'm the happiest person in the Three Realms.

813
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,200
I saw them all sitting here.

814
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,870
I think my summer is happy.

815
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:11,470
OK. So,

816
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,000
let's talk about something in common.

817
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,370
Many netizens want to ask you

818
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,900
if there is a chance

819
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,610
a chance

820
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,210
to choose a character to perform.

821
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,910
You can't choose your roles.

822
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,740
Who will they choose?

823
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,870
Esther, who do you want to play?

824
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:30,970
I'll want to play the role of Shangque.

825
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,400
Why do you want to play a dragon?

826
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,140
Yeah, it's exciting.

827
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,900
It can fly around in the sky.

828
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,670
I've seen the special effects.

829
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,400
The black dragon is so cool.

830
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,310
Cool. Yeah.

831
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:42,740
And

832
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,340
sometimes his part is funny.

833
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,140
I think

834
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,570
OK.

835
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,900
Dylan, what do you want to play?

836
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,470
I just want to play myself.

837
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,470
Indeed, yours is impeccable.

838
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,200
If I can't choose myself, I won't choose.

839
00:32:58,970 --> 00:32:59,800
Isn't he handsome?

840
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,410
This is the persistence from Dongfang Qingcang.

841
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,310
[Laughing]

842
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,570
In this world, only Dongfang Qiangcang got hurt.

843
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,370
Hahaha.

844
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,270
Fine. Lord Changheng,

845
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,170
what will you play?

846
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,100
I'm here.

847
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,510
Yes, I'm looking at you.

848
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,570
Okay.

849
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,900
I want to play Lord Yunzhong.

850
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,870
Ah.

851
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,400
Without Lord Yunzhong,

852
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,270
Changheng wouldn't be like this.

853
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,270
That's why I want to play the role of Lord Yunzhong to give Changheng freedom.

854
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,110
Wow.

855
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,340
I'll become you

856
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,700
and free myself.

857
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,610
Interesting.

858
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,300
What about Lord Rong Hao?

859
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,300
Do you want to play Lord Yunzhong?

860
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,940
You can act as Lord Yunzhong.

861
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,870
I'll be the lead and I'll grant your wish.

862
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,740
That's right.

863
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,600
It's OK.

864
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,540
I think we can also play Chidi.

865
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,340
Because she was

866
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,710
sleeping for half of the eqisodes.

867
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,810
Acting as Chidi?

868
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:56,610
Yes.

869
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,140
Then why don't you play me?

870
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,140
Fine.

871
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,540
Hahaha.

872
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,970
[Laughing]

873
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,470
Because she was sleeping for half of the episodes.

874
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,800
So if you want to play, let's ask Chidi.

875
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,270
Ah, I want to be the Moon Supreme.

876
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:11,370
Because I want a big black dragon.

877
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,540
[Laughing]

878
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,800
Everyone seems to be very kind.

879
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:17,969
This one.

880
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,800
This is impeccable.

881
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,270
Why am I the only one who gets excited?

882
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,300
It's OK. It's really hard to pick up.

883
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,469
Your microphone is amplified.

884
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:28,900
Put it next to your mouth.

885
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:29,770
I'm sorry.

886
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,739
I think it's not OK without you.

887
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:37,540
Everyone wants to be you. What do you think, Black Dragon?

888
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,540
I'm quite happy.

889
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,340
Why are you so official?

890
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:45,010
Are you acting like this because you've gone popular?

891
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:45,010


892
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,800
Give me the microphone.

893
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,270
Our company told me to talk nicely.

894
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:51,699
I want to become Dongfang Qingcang,

895
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,710
because... He wants to usurp the throne.

896
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,310
Yes. What do you mean?

897
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,570
You want to usurp the throne?

898
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,470
Do you like me too?

899
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,510
You don't like Orchid, do you?

900
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,070
I also want to drive a black dragon.

901
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:05,240
Carry my beloved.

902
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,610
Who do you like?

903
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,770
Playing in the three realms.

904
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,090
Xunfeng.

905
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,570
That's hilarious.

906
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,600
OK. OK. Let's ask Xiaoxiao.

907
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,910
Who you want to be?

908
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,270
Dongfang Qingcang.

909
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:22,070
Because I want everyone to kneel down

910
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,010
when they see me.

911
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,640
Just because everyone can easily

912
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,240
control Jieli.

913
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,170
And bully her.

914
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,570
So you want everyone to treat you like that.

915
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,570
Yes, I want to be like him.

916
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,470
Then you can only

917
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,610
ask Black Dragon to do so.

918
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,570
Did I do that?

919
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,400
Yes.

920
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,470
He didn't act like this in front of me.

921
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,500
When Dongfang Qingcang doesn't want to see you, he'll...

922
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,440
Beat people.

923
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,470
OK. The three realms won't treat you like this,

924
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,400
neither will the Moon Tribe.

925
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,810
But you can let Black Dragon treat you like this at home.

926
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,370
Okay, let's ask Chen Xiao.

927
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,370
Xunfeng, who do you want to be?

928
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,000
I definitely want to become Brother.

929
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,610
Because he has Hellfire,

930
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,200
and he can ride the black dragon.

931
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,500
How tempting is it to ride the black dragon?

932
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,170
Mostly because I can ride the black dragon, right?

933
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,440
Yes.

934
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,100
I found the answer from the Moon Tribe

935
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,070
is very consistent.

936
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,870
Dongfang Qingcang only wants to be himself.

937
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,070
The others only want to be Dongfang Qingcang.

938
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,910
Right. Let me ask Dieyi who she wants to be.

939
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,040
Cheng Zi.

940
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,440
I want to be the evil spirit.

941
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,170
You can do it.

942
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,870
Becoming

943
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,570
the evil spirit

944
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,370
is more impressive.

945
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,810
I didn't think of the evil spirit, but it's pretty good.

946
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,010
And...

947
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:34,840
Tai Sui.

948
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,840
Tai Sui?

949
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,300
Oh, Tai Sui. But he can only be heard but not be seen.

950
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,840
Tai Sui is the Big Boss. -Right.

951
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,570
What do you want to be?

952
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:46,300
I want to be Arbiter,

953
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,870
because I think she really knows everything.

954
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,310
She will show up at the critical moment.

955
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,510
She destroyed the immortal root to protect you.

956
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,770
In the end, she told Daqiang how to save you.

957
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,640
Nothing will happen without Arbiter.

958
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,800
I want to be Arbiter.

959
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,900
You must have seen our play.

960
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,070
Yes, it's really good.

961
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,200
You guys feel the same, right?

962
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,000
OK. Let's continue.

963
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,070
There are many popular lines in the play.

964
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,840
I want to ask you

965
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,900
what the most impressive line is.

966
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,640
Let's start over here.

967
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,640
Okay?

968
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,670
Cheng Zi, which one impressed you the most?

969
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,910
I don't know.

970
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,110
Because it may be different from what I heard.

971
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,770
The crew,

972
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,170
if someone's voice is low,

973
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,170
please remind me.

974
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,440
This is your Chinese medicine.

975
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,670
Orchid, I want to take your Chinese medicine.

976
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,000
From now on,

977
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,470
you are mine.

978
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,370
Your life is mine.

979
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,900
Your breath is mine.

980
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,470
Your heartbeat is mine.

981
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,070
Every drop of your blood is mine.

982
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,310
Ah.

983
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,070
Why does it sound so familiar?

984
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,670
Dylan, do you want to deliver this sentence for us?

985
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,470
No need.

986
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,100
No need. Wait for mine.

987
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,670
Just wait for mine.

988
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,870
Okay.

989
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:00,240
Xiao Ting, which one impressed you the most?

990
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,270
My most impressive sentence is...

991
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,270
I once had a crush

992
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,370
for you.

993
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,400
Oh.

994
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,240
Lord Rong Hao,

995
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,100
is it related to the sentence that impressed you?

996
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,370
It doesn't matter.

997
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,500
Which one impressed you the most?

998
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,370
Anything.

999
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,770
Well...

1000
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,410
Ennn...

1001
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,370
What's your name?

1002
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,240
He said his name is Dongfang...

1003
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,800
She said it's Dongfang Qiang.

1004
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,570
-I... -Yes.

1005
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,440
Because when he said that,

1006
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,010
there was silence.

1007
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:39,970
Let me explain.

1008
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,570
The scenes here are so sad.

1009
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,500
So we only remember happy scenes.

1010
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:44,670
So it's that line.

1011
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,170
Okay, Ling He, which one impressed you the most?.

1012
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,470
The most impressive one is

1013
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,070
Lord Changheng praised me.

1014
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,970
Oh.

1015
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,470
Let's play the scene.

1016
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,440
I've played the scene.

1017
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,000
You didn't shake your head.

1018
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,670
Lord Changheng praised me.

1019
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,240
Pay attention to my image.

1020
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,100
Well, do you remember what it was like?

1021
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,570
Don't fall into her trap.

1022
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,800
She shook her head only once.

1023
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,200
Like this.

1024
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,440
Only you can deliver it.

1025
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,270
But that's not what impressed me the most.

1026
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,070
Which one?

1027
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,800
There are many sentences that impressed me.

1028
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,470
Say three or five sentences.

1029
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,570
That's disgusting.

1030
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,810
Why did you say mine?

1031
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,210
That's disgusting.

1032
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,810
One is this.

1033
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,440
And the other one is "Ouch".

1034
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,070
The other one is...

1035
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,900
If you save me,

1036
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,770
I will marry someone else.

1037
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,070
Do you want me to marry someone else?

1038
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,270
Isn't this a impressive sentence?

1039
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,670
Right? They're all impressive.

1040
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,300
The netizens also think these scenes

1041
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,490
are classic.

1042
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:44,490


1043
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,260
I remember those.

1044
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:46,890
Yes.

1045
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,110
I can tell that it's very true and sincere.

1046
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,000
How about Dylan? Which part do you consider the most memorable?

1047
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,890
I really can't forget about the line that said "I'm back."

1048
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,490
Your Emperor...

1049
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,790
Excuse me?

1050
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,960
That was my last line.

1051
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,900
That was Dongfang Qingcang's last line in the show.

1052
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,500
Dongfang Qingcang has addressed himself as "Your Emperor" for the entire show

1053
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,560
Only at the very end that he finally said to Orchid

1054
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,000
"I'm back".

1055
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,260
Then the most memorable line for me is "Tai Sui have regained his immortal body"

1056
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,600
Let's hurry

1057
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,890
to Spirit-Shattering Abyss.

1058
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,960
So your last line is...

1059
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,800
This last line belongs to everyone.

1060
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,430
I dubbed the ending.

1061
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,790
I was the narrator.

1062
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,260
You know the part I said about your happy lives.

1063
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,360
Yes.

1064
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,060
Okay, so addressing himself as I

1065
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,260
after addressing himself as "Your Emperor" for the entire show

1066
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,230
This is...

1067
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,490
a detail that I haven't noticed before.

1068
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,460
Okay, what about you, Charles?

1069
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,490
Bro.

1070
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,400
All hail my lord.

1071
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,630
Calm down my lord

1072
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,830
That's what I wanted to say.

1073
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:48,390
My favorite line is "All hail my lord".

1074
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,100
Such a serious line.

1075
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,200
Because the company asked him to manage his facial expressions.

1076
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,460
Yeah. I think Black Dragon is like

1077
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,790
is a little different after getting married.

1078
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,960
He's now a mature man with a family.

1079
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:05,500
Because I have to be very serious when saying "All hail my lord".

1080
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,700
That's why I'm a little different

1081
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,950
when I have to say that line so many times.

1082
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,900
OK. What about Jieli?

1083
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,460
How dare you mess with my men?

1084
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,860
It’s a classic line from Dongfang Qincang.

1085
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,060
Why are we dancing all of a sudden?

1086
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,400
What's your most memorable line, Xunfeng?

1087
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,190
I think the most memorable line for me

1088
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,790
is from a scene with Orchid.

1089
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,990
"Don't go!"

1090
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,600
"If you leave, Brother will never forgive me."

1091
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,300
Yes.

1092
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,060
That scene was very touching. It was very touching when we were acting it

1093
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,430
Although we didn't know each other well,

1094
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,030
but we both got really into it.

1095
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,180
When the shooting started,

1096
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,360
we were indulged in it.

1097
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,160
Right?

1098
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,660
OK. We have reviewed many memorable lines.

1099
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,360
According to our VIP members and viewers

1100
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,990
there are many popular scenes in the show

1101
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,600
that they have replayed many times.

1102
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,000
But some of them

1103
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,060
are really addicting to rewatch

1104
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,230
to a point where they can't stop rewatching.

1105
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,290
So I want to ask Esther.

1106
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,390
Do you personally have a favorite scene of that type that gets you all emotional?

1107
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,160
Which scene would it be?

1108
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,090
I already told you just now

1109
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,230
Other than that one scene,

1110
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,760
I need to think about it, the scene that is very,

1111
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,700
very memorable for me,

1112
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,390
because of the ambience at the time

1113
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,290
and the line that is being delivered

1114
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,900
together with the atmosphere

1115
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,460
And now that the audience has watched up until this point.

1116
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,260
Not only that.

1117
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,390
They have also seen all the scenes before that

1118
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,800
When all of the story comes together in your mind,

1119
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,490
it really is an awesome show.

1120
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:28,760
I agree.

1121
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,060
Do you feel the same way too?

1122
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,360
The scene where the Arbiter Hall collapsed.

1123
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,190
Right, right? It's not easy to not cry

1124
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,360
when I'm browsing my phone

1125
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,500
and I see that scene again from apps,

1126
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,660
I would cry.

1127
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,760
I have cried many times.

1128
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,990
Would you still cry to it now?

1129
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,800
Um..

1130
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,690
I'm not sure.

1131
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,430
Fine.

1132
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,430
What about you?

1133
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,630
For me it's the scene when Orchid died.

1134
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,160
It's that scene for sure.

1135
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,260
That scene is so memorable for me.

1136
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,390
I had a breakdown because of it.

1137
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,700
The two of you make all of us feel like

1138
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,460
you are recording each other's feelings

1139
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,400
from each other's scenes.

1140
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,400
It's not mutual. I'm the only one that is recording him. Thank you.

1141
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,090
Alright.

1142
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,700
Speaking of the Arbiter Hall, I want to give Orchid a test.

1143
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,600
Esther, please listen to the question.

1144
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,160
How many Arbiter Halls are there in total?

1145
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,490
That was unexpected isn't it?

1146
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,960
Two.

1147
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,060
Four.

1148
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,190
Four? Which four?

1149
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,860
There's a real one, a fake one from Dongfang Qingcang.

1150
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,460
One from the master.

1151
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,690
And one from the dream

1152
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:28,230
The one in the dream is actually all four of them

1153
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,360
There's also one from Lord Rong Hao.

1154
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,080
Isn't that the same?

1155
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:30,630
Yeah.

1156
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:31,120
They are the same.

1157
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,260
No they are not.

1158
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,130
Isn't that the same one?

1159
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:34,260
Four?

1160
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,030
There are five.

1161
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:36,590
There is one more.

1162
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,430
There's one more from the dream.

1163
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:39,600
Lord Rong Hao has another one.

1164
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,460
There's one in the Haishi City.

1165
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,660
There are six.

1166
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,090
There's another one in Haishi City.

1167
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,430
More and more people say that Dongfang Qingcang built several Arbiter Halls.

1168
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,460
May I ask how many flowers are there

1169
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,890
in the garden of the Arbiter Hall?

1170
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,030
8452. Is it right?

1171
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,290
That's correct.

1172
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,490
Is it? You still remember the number.

1173
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,090
So smart.

1174
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,890
I've memorized the lines many times.

1175
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,860
The Moon Supreme...

1176
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,390
This...

1177
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,460
Are you here for our college entrance exam?

1178
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,700
Let me ask Dylan about some brainstorming questions

1179
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,960
We all know that Dongfang Qingcang is not a simple character

1180
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,160
there's even a body swap scene with Orchid

1181
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,830
and a battle scene

1182
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,090
between two Daqiang.

1183
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,590
How did you understand these two different characters

1184
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,260
or played all three different characters, Dylan?

1185
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:21,430
Actually,

1186
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,430
it's just about finding the unique personalities of these characters

1187
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,790
and their reasons to act.

1188
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,800
Acutally, in "Love Between Fairy and Devil"

1189
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,060
Everyone is like...

1190
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,860
A lot of us are like

1191
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,990
acting multiple roles at the same time.

1192
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,230
You see, I played three different characters.

1193
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,830
Esther played two different characters.

1194
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,230
I've played 3 roles. I've also played God Chidi.

1195
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:37,960
You've played God Chidi. Then that's three.

1196
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,490
You also played the role of Lord Changheng.

1197
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,600
You played five roles?

1198
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,300
So yeah,

1199
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,000
a lot of us actually played multiple roles.

1200
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,230
We should ask the producer to pay us more.

1201
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:47,890
That's right.

1202
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,830
We should all speak up.

1203
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:50,760
We need a raise.

1204
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:50,760


1205
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,590
What's going on?

1206
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,350
Do you have a livestreaming camera?

1207
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,320
Luckily, you don't have a camera there.

1208
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:58,790
OK.

1209
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:01,020
Next question is for Dylan.

1210
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,390
Some netizens said if you want to make a girl heart-broken,

1211
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,320
you just need to tell her that

1212
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:07,650
there is no man like Dongfang Qingcang in this world.

1213
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:08,790
But there is a man like Lord Yunzhong.

1214
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,820
No, I'm just kidding.

1215
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,320
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1216
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:16,250
What I want to say is that

1217
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,020
I hope every girl can

1218
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,850
meet her Dongfang Qingcang.

1219
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,050
You need to find your Dongfang Qingcang.

1220
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:24,620
OK.

1221
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,650
I hope all girls can meet your Daqiang.

1222
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,720
Lord Ronghao, you were so happy just now.

1223
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,520
Since you laughed a lot,

1224
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,820
I'm going to ask you this.

1225
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,120
Here's the question.

1226
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,390
You played an antagonist in your last drama.

1227
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:37,190
And in this drama,

1228
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:39,050
Lord Ronghao is also a villain.

1229
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,320
Are you going to play a villain in the next drama?

1230
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,280
Is Lord Ronghao a villain?

1231
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,020
What about Changheng?

1232
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,680
He is not a villian.

1233
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,350
Is he?

1234
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,660
-I don't think he is. -No.

1235
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:47,950
No, no, no.

1236
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,940
Changheng said he's not a villain.

1237
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,220
I don't think he's a villain.

1238
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:51,990
So he is just a role

1239
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,590
with a little bit ruthlessness.

1240
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,420
But he's not a villain,

1241
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,420
because he did everything for God Chidi.

1242
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:58,740
That's right.

1243
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,850
So what roles you're going to choose next?

1244
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,060
I won't act anymore.

1245
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,650
I want to start...

1246
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,520
No, don't set a goal like this.

1247
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,360
Trust me.

1248
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,590
I just break my word as soon as I set the goal.

1249
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:10,420
It's okay

1250
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,450
if I can't make it.

1251
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,320
Anyway, I'm going to start a way to set a positive image.

1252
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,520
Okay. We'll be with you.

1253
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,360
Yes, everyone must remember

1254
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,220
Rong Hao was the only one among the three worlds who remembered the sacrifice of God Chidi.

1255
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,920
I think this is very important.

1256
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,920
Secret glances.

1257
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,920
-He went to sweep her tomb. -Right.

1258
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,150
Now, here's a question for Lord Changheng.

1259
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,720
Actually,

1260
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,790
we think everyone in Love Between Fairy and Devil is gifted and well-hidden.

1261
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,420
And you are the God of War,

1262
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,220
and you are also

1263
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,060
a good friend of Orchid.

1264
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,460
And Orchid really relies on you.

1265
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,620
What do you think is the key factor

1266
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,750
of being the God of War?

1267
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,520
How to become the God of War?

1268
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,920
The most important factor?

1269
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,020
Handsome.

1270
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,190
Good at crying.

1271
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,960
You must have a brother like Lord Yunzhong.

1272
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,640
-I found you really like to mention Lord Yunzhong. -Why?

1273
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,120
Why are you doing this?

1274
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:55,990
He's not here.

1275
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,220
Although

1276
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,020
he is not here, but he is in our heart.

1277
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,350
Because Lord Yunzhong traumatized me.

1278
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,320
I think the ways you are traumatized are different.

1279
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,520
You just keep mentioning him.

1280
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,050
And Ronghao is so...

1281
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,220
Hai Qiao seems like he's going to scold him any moment.

1282
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,590
-He's going to scold him right away. -He's like the well-behaved student of the class.

1283
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,350
And Lord Yunzhong is like the class teacher.

1284
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,260
-And you're like the bad student. -You're right.

1285
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,320
Like a bad senior. We said this before.

1286
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,350
If we have a chance,

1287
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,420
we can film

1288
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,020
a school drama.

1289
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,000
The cast will still be us.

1290
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,150
And Lord Yunzhong is the headteacher.

1291
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:31,950
More like a grade dean.

1292
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,460
Right, and you are the bad senior.

1293
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,620
And you are the good senior.

1294
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:39,650
And I'm the little girl in the class who studies very hard.

1295
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,450
You're a bad boy who doesn't like study.

1296
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,060
Of course you are his follower.

1297
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,020
And this is your girlfriend from your class.

1298
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,650
And he's your younger brother.

1299
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,620
He is your family...

1300
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,390
-He's your younger brother and he's junior high. -My sibling.

1301
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,620
It's... It's...

1302
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,000
like we used to be.

1303
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,520
Yeah, the relationship of these characters are all the same.

1304
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,390
Yes.

1305
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:01,420
But in modern times.

1306
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,550
Anyone wants to see it?

1307
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,190
-Mr. Yixu. -I can finally hear you.

1308
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,220
Wow, you made the script of your second collaboration.

1309
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,250
OK. I think those who know will understand immediately.

1310
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,020
It's gonna be fantastic. I'll take care of the script.

1311
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,590
Okay.

1312
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:17,660
Thank you.

1313
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:21,320
Wow, I'm very happy with this second collaboration.

1314
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:23,750
Okay, next,

1315
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,960
please share something with us.

1316
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,660
For this question,

1317
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,060
we want to ask Charles.

1318
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,620
As the assistant and driver of Dongfang Qingcang,

1319
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,620
you are the black dragon...

1320
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,850
It's not a driver. It's like a vehicle.

1321
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,520
OK. Vehicle.

1322
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:36,990
You are so strict.

1323
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,320
You should talk with your mic.

1324
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,520
Is there anything the audience can't hear?

1325
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,220
-Bro. -Put your mic on.

1326
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,450
Bro, you're a bit putting on airs today. Bro, what's wrong with you?

1327
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,020
He was like

1328
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:48,790
"Be nice."

1329
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,620
"It's not a vehicle. Call it driver."

1330
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,620
Help him to raise

1331
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:55,920
Put it on.

1332
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,320
OK.

1333
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,020
OK. So everyone say

1334
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,960
You're the assistant, vehicle, and driver for Dongfang Qingcang.

1335
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,860
and love guard of Dongfang Qingcang .

1336
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,020
Are you satisfied with this identity?

1337
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:05,720
Yes.

1338
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,790
Okay, let's continue.

1339
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:07,590
Satisfied.

1340
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,020
In the show, Big Dragon will make this gesture every time he sees His Lord.

1341
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:12,450
We want to recreate it.

1342
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,360
Because they want to know

1343
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,260
if this arm will be injured.

1344
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:16,970
This one?

1345
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:17,230
Yeah.

1346
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:20,120
I remember last summer vacation,

1347
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,520
it was cured when this drama ended.

1348
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,850
But, a while back ago, during the promotion, it got hurt...

1349
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,420
He has mentioned this many times.

1350
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,450
So, you beat your chest a lot and now there's a problem.

1351
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,320
Jieli, hurry up and unleash his nature.

1352
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,420
Who is from Shangque's company?

1353
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,950
I really don't understand what he said.

1354
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,190
Can you allow him to make some expressions?

1355
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,350
-How about this, Black Dragon. -What do you want to see?

1356
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:40,150
Just say it.

1357
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,420
Raise your hand, if you're from his company.

1358
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:42,640
What do you want to say?

1359
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,320
He's learning Mandarin lately.

1360
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,220
He may not know how to say properly right now.

1361
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,960
This is the change of a man after married.

1362
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,120
He can't look too much when he's out.

1363
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,320
Because he has to be careful with his wife beside him.

1364
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:53,320


1365
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,180
You are talking like I'm so young.

1366
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:57,690
Who is married?

1367
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,880
What's going on?

1368
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,580
You good sisters should communicate by yourselves.

1369
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:02,780
Why are you a married man all of a sudden?

1370
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:05,590
So crazy. Forget it. We're doing live stream.

1371
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,590
We're doing live stream.

1372
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:07,850
We'll talk about it later.

1373
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:08,880
OK. We're too excited.

1374
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:10,950
Do you want to recreate it? It's up to you.

1375
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,180
Do you want to recreate it?

1376
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:13,050
Again?

1377
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:15,550
I feel sorry for you.

1378
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:16,590
Come on.

1379
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,390
The rhythm

1380
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,950
is different.

1381
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:19,950
Are you looking for a camera?

1382
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:22,550
Black Dragon is looking for a camera?

1383
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:23,180
Just say it.

1384
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,590
Show me one of the cameras.

1385
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,490
This one?

1386
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,620
The one with the light on.

1387
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,680
What are you going to do?

1388
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:32,690
All hail my lord.

1389
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,650
Ouch!

1390
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:40,850
-So childish. -So handsome.

1391
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,680
Jieli, Xiaoxiao promised me,

1392
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:44,620
after we finish the live stream tonight,

1393
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,180
apply some medicine on Black Dragon, ok?

1394
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,550
It doesn't matter. Just hit him. He's strong!

1395
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:50,450
Oh my god.

1396
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,580
Next question.

1397
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,620
Let's turn to this side.

1398
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,450
Xiao Ting,

1399
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:57,880
You are Chidi woman, Fairy,

1400
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:59,690
and the role Xie Wanqing in the world.

1401
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,220
The netizens comment

1402
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,820
that your acting can change your face in a second.

1403
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,380
They say your acting is effetive.

1404
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:05,620
What do you want to say

1405
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,750
to netizens for their comments, Xiaoting?

1406
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:10,950
The script is good,

1407
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:12,180
the director is good.

1408
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:13,950
and the other actors are good.

1409
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:17,020
So it's easy to act.

1410
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,250
Because everyone acts well

1411
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,250
-So you act well -Yes.

1412
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:22,050
Our Chidi woman

1413
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:23,050
praised all of these people,

1414
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:25,420
even the ones sitting under the stage.

1415
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,450
Xiao Ting's style today

1416
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:29,650
refers to Dieyi's style in the drama.

1417
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,580
We said that Xiaoting today became

1418
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:32,420
Dieyi.

1419
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,890
I also think it's Dieyi's style after I made up and dressed today.

1420
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:37,050
She sent me a photo after she finished making up and changing clothes today.

1421
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,480
She said, "Who do I look like today?"

1422
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:40,250
I said, "why did you become Dieyi?"

1423
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:42,190
She really looks a little bit like Dieyi.

1424
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:43,620
Then let's ask Dieyi.

1425
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,580
As the supreme queen of Haishi City,

1426
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:46,850
Ronghao's right-hand assistant,

1427
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,650
you seem to be able to do 10,000 things alone.

1428
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:51,450
But in the end, Jieli killed you with a single stab.

1429
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:53,620
Even hellfire couldn't kill you before!

1430
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,150
You two can talk about this.

1431
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,050
Yes.

1432
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,450
Jieli is the big boss.

1433
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:00,450
He's even ore powerful than Dongfang Qingcang.

1434
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,150
Actually, I dubbed the evil spirit.

1435
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:03,980
How?

1436
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:05,220
You can dub it now.

1437
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,190
-Come on. -I am here.

1438
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:11,490
Why did you suddenly die?

1439
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:13,420
Maybe the time for my buff is over.

1440
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,880
-What? -I said that the time for my buff was over.

1441
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:16,890
Let me say something.

1442
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:19,350
Actually, we were all there in that scene.

1443
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:21,150
Jieli was there.

1444
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:22,020
and Dieyi was there too.

1445
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:24,580
We went to film when we woke up in the moring.

1446
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:25,190
Jieli got here.

1447
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:26,890
Dieyi got there and said,

1448
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:31,220
"I can finish it at 12:00 noon, I'm going out for lunch."

1449
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:32,390
I said that you were too young.

1450
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:33,990
This scene wouldn' t finish until night.

1451
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:35,250
Because it was complicated.

1452
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:36,380
And we have military plays.

1453
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,020
I think we ended up

1454
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,580
filming till the wee hours of night.

1455
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,550
Right? And she told me the next day

1456
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:45,550
that she did it wrong. I said what happened.

1457
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:47,950
She said, "I was too sleepy.

1458
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:50,880
I did it without thinking.

1459
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:54,780
Wait, what am I doing?

1460
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:56,190
So,

1461
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:58,850
I'll just die when it's time,

1462
00:52:58,850 --> 00:52:59,650
right?

1463
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:01,420
OK. Here's a question for Hong Xiao,

1464
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,150
We talked about a lot of questions just now.

1465
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:04,680
About Hong Xiao,

1466
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:08,490
I want to ask you, as a fairy who was left out

1467
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:10,050
and the love of Black Dragon.

1468
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:12,850
Do you know what is the name for your Coupling?

1469
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,790
Longli Dansi.

1470
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:15,820
Yes.

1471
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,780
What did you feel when you first heard this?

1472
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,850
I really like this name. I think it's cute.

1473
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:24,190
Because it is actually a song,

1474
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:26,020
a popular song recently.

1475
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,780
-It's a rap song. -How to sing it?

1476
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:30,050
Why don't you two sing the song?

1477
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,280
Sing the song.

1478
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:32,580
You two should sing the song.

1479
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:33,820
I'm sure Shangque can sing.

1480
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:37,020
Is it ok, Shangque's company? Please!

1481
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:37,480
Well...

1482
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:38,990
-You have to pay extra for this content. -He said it's okay.

1483
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:40,790
That's the extra work. That's the extra work.

1484
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:42,220
Sing a cappella, Shangque.

1485
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:45,490
Is that ok, Shangque?

1486
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:47,490
The comment said Shangque has a video with 1 million views.

1487
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:50,050
Jieli is actually a good singer.

1488
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,020
Don't tremble. Why does he have a video with a million views?

1489
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:57,820
I feel that the shadow beside me is shaking.

1490
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,080
You sing first.

1491
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,280
Don't worry. It'll be your turn soon.

1492
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,050
I've...

1493
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:06,890
I've sealed my microphone.

1494
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:09,090
But you can dance.

1495
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:10,420
I can't dance neither.

1496
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:12,220
Hahaha.

1497
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,950
Don't dodge it. You sing first. Be quick!

1498
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,080
Can't you sing?

1499
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:16,990
I...

1500
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,050
You can sing something else.

1501
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,580
Just sing something.

1502
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:22,580
Please start the song for me.

1503
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:23,650
♫Wu Wu Wu♫

1504
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:26,690
Are you sure?

1505
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:31,590
-Right, I guarantee you that's the way it is. -Let's sing it together, 1, 2, 3.

1506
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:34,350
♫Wu Wu Wu Wu Wu♫

1507
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:36,590
♫Longli Dansi♫

1508
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:37,990
That's right.

1509
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:40,150
That's how the song is sung.

1510
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:41,850
The second line is yours.

1511
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:41,850


1512
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,930
What did he say?

1513
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:47,570
What did he say?

1514
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:50,090
What's the second sentence?

1515
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,100
The second sentence is...

1516
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:54,590
-Stop teasing me. -Stop teasing me.

1517
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,500
Hahaha.

1518
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,360
Can I ask Dylan a question?

1519
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,930
Dylan says we can ask the next question, right?

1520
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,390
Go ahead.

1521
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,400
Because my principle today is

1522
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,860
even if you fight on the stage,

1523
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,690
as long as you are happy,

1524
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,330
I won't push the process.

1525
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:09,690
I like to see you guys making a scene together.

1526
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:11,860
Do you think we can proceed to the next part?

1527
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,490
-Let's move on. -OK. OK.

1528
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,460
OK, let's ask

1529
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,080
Chen Xiao,

1530
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,090
who acts Xunfeng in this drama.

1531
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:21,290
Chen Xiao, what do you think your most "beloved" brother...

1532
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,130
Of course, there is a quotation mark.

1533
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,700
When Brother was tortured by thunder for you,

1534
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,560
the bullet screen was full of "Finally, my brother loves me again."

1535
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,930
What did you think

1536
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:31,690
when you see this comment?

1537
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,000
It's indeed beyond the expectation of Xunfeng.

1538
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,330
He didn't expect

1539
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:39,130
his brother

1540
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:41,490
would make such a decision at such a time.

1541
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,330
And

1542
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:44,360
in my opinion, Xunfeng may think

1543
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,900
that I can finally wash my feet.

1544
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,990
[Laughing]

1545
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,900
[Laughing]

1546
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,520
Lord Changheng doesn't understand this joke.

1547
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,900
You can explain.

1548
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,860
What foot-washing?

1549
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,660
-His dirty feet. -Right.

1550
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:02,520
You were tortured by the thunder.

1551
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,130
Sing.

1552
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,700
[Laughing]

1553
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,100
Let's keep it for a while.

1554
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,330
Each of you have some time

1555
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:11,360
to choose a few lines that you can sing.

1556
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,590
Leave you some time.

1557
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,600
And then each of you may sing a few lines.

1558
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,330
OK?

1559
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,490
What do you mean?

1560
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,420
Who agreed to this?

1561
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,260
-I agree. -How about you?

1562
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:20,080
Yes.

1563
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:20,960
[Laughing]

1564
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,460
OK.

1565
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,060
This part is designed for you.

1566
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,660
Do you like it?

1567
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,090
I see.

1568
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,960
Esther, I appoint you as the assistant host today.

1569
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,160
OK. We are partners today.

1570
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,860
Sure.

1571
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,660
You really helped me a lot.

1572
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,260
No. Esther is the official host today.

1573
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,130
You're the assistant.

1574
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:33,960
Yes, I am.

1575
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,730
OK, Esther is the official host today.

1576
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:36,790
I'm the assistant host.

1577
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,330
Let me, the assistant host announce it.

1578
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:40,890
Let's move on to the next part: replaying.

1579
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,930
Because we just chatted and

1580
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,260
found that everyone in the drama

1581
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:45,090
has their own

1582
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,400
famous scenes and gestures.

1583
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,960
In the next part,

1584
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,490
replaying,

1585
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,300
I hope you can add

1586
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,700
your famous scene or gesture into it.

1587
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,530
It'll be like a freestyle drama.

1588
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:59,090
Please stand up.

1589
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,990
Let's split up on both sides.

1590
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,300
I'll read the narration later.

1591
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,800
The one that is called needs to stand in the middle to perform.

1592
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,900
OK?

1593
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:08,930
Let's take a step forward.

1594
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:10,060
The one that is called needs to start his acting.

1595
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,530
Okay, go back first

1596
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,600
to leave enough space.

1597
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,760
Everyone wants to act.

1598
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,330
OK. Next,

1599
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,490
let's get started

1600
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:20,320
to perform.

1601
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:24,990
Two thousand years later,

1602
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:26,930
in the Arbiter Hall,

1603
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:31,300
Orchid is fixing the Destiny Book.

1604
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,930
She walks two steps forward

1605
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:39,190
and takes another Destiny Book to repair.

1606
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,960
At this time, Lord Changheng suddenly jumps,

1607
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,590
appearing in front of her,

1608
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,860
and tries to take her away by force.

1609
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,260
Come with me.

1610
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,260
At this time, the Moon Supreme appears

1611
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,560
and stops him in time.

1612
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:59,360
The Moon Supreme tilts his head towards the camera,

1613
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,000
smiles

1614
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,700
[Laughing] and snaps his finger.

1615
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:08,460
The Moon Supreme smiles at the camera.

1616
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:10,860
Then he makes a finger snap

1617
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,260
and squeezes out the Hellfire.

1618
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,330
He is surrounded with light,

1619
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:16,930
so dazzling that no one can open his eyes.

1620
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:18,260
No one can open their eyes.

1621
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:19,690
[Laughing]

1622
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,900
At this time, Lord Changheng also makes a fighting gesture,

1623
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,560
ready to fight with him for 300 rounds.

1624
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,590
Suddenly, Shangque and Xunfeng barged in.

1625
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,530
They greet the Moon Supreme

1626
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:32,990
with the highest courtesy.

1627
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,900
[Laughing]

1628
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:40,460
At this moment, Chidi woman plays the shakuhachi.

1629
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,210
What about me?

1630
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,370
You're in the middle.

1631
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,330
You're here.

1632
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:48,060
Chidi woman wants to use a local song

1633
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,730
to join the battle.

1634
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,160
But Lord Ronghao comes too.

1635
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,600
He wears a mask,

1636
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,660
looking at Chidi woman with glad eye.

1637
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,090
He hopes she may remember who he is,

1638
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,730
and gets ready to help his master.

1639
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,260
At this moment,

1640
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,590
the third battle of the Moon Tribe and the Fairies is triggered.

1641
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,700
Dieyi shows up very quickly.

1642
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:13,260
Then Lord Ronghao gives Dieyi a look.

1643
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,290
Dieyi understands it in a second.

1644
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,360
She quickly casts a spell in hope of carrying Orchid away.

1645
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,760
But how could Jieli ignore her best friend?

1646
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,390
So, she quickly joins the battle.

1647
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,130
Her fighting with Dieyi is fierce.

1648
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:26,090
It's hard to separate them apart.

1649
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,490
Fight!

1650
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,330
They're fighting.

1651
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:29,660
Fight!

1652
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:31,660
Ah.

1653
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:33,690
Orchid rushes up

1654
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:35,490
and holds Dongfang Qingcang tightly.

1655
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,560
She resolves everything with love.

1656
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:39,560


1657
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:41,090
Let's step back a little.

1658
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:41,890
Well..

1659
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,220
OK.

1660
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:50,690
This is a comedy version.

1661
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:53,450
So it's for the last line,

1662
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,220
-host. -Well, I...

1663
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,890
No wonder I couldn't get the script.

1664
00:59:57,820 --> 00:59:58,290
What?

1665
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:59,920
It's really embarrassing.

1666
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,820
The early section is also cute.

1667
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,150
We did a comedy version.

1668
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,660
Have you seen this enough?

1669
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:04,700
No.

1670
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,560
Yes. I knew you wouldn't be satisfied so easily.

1671
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,460
Next,

1672
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:10,460
let us take a look at the scenes with the ones who are addicted to this serial

1673
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:12,660
to see the famous scene together.

1674
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:13,660
Please look at the screen.

1675
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,490
Sit.

1676
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:19,520
Oops, why did I look so fat?

1677
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,090
This is the scene when I took the pill.

1678
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,620
What is she doing?

1679
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,700
You little flower spirit.

1680
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:04,950
You are so short-sighted.

1681
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,220
You are only about a thousand years old.

1682
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:10,380
How could you see the strongest in the Three Realms,

1683
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:12,750
Dongfang Qingcang, who is the outstanding Moon Supreme?

1684
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,290
I've never seen him,

1685
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:18,920
but it's written in the book.

1686
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:21,180
That Dongfang Qingcang

1687
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,850
has green face and fangs

1688
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,420
and super long hair,

1689
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:26,520
which is full of lice.

1690
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,100
I heard that he hasn't brushed teeth and take showers

1691
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,290
for thousands of years.

1692
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:30,520
His breath smells so bad.

1693
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,020
It's very disgusting.

1694
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,490
Since Orchid pleaded for you,

1695
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,350
and it's for some reason,

1696
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:48,820
I agree.

1697
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:54,420
The Guqin notation.

1698
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:09,720
I warn you guys that

1699
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,490
you'd better run for your lives

1700
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:12,750
since I don't want to kill you now.

1701
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:13,820
Shut up!

1702
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:15,650
You are still pretending.

1703
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,020
I guess the Moon Supreme now

1704
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,690
is just a useless fairy.

1705
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:23,450
What should we do? What should we do?

1706
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,420
I think they saw through us.

1707
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:52,090
If you save my life,

1708
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:59,950
I will marry someone else.

1709
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,290
Would you rather see me marry someone else?

1710
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,290
No.

1711
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:21,460
Don't leave.

1712
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:25,220
So sad.

1713
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:32,720
So this scene is amazing because

1714
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:35,720
many people cried

1715
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,120
for this scene.

1716
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,950
Right? But to be honest,

1717
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:39,820
look at the screen.

1718
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:42,320
It was retouched by Wang Yixu so that our tears disappeared.

1719
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:45,620
But audiences can still be sincerely moved by it,

1720
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:48,550
which means this scene is really touching.

1721
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:49,690
Okay, I think they're weird too.

1722
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:51,050
When you watched this scene at home,

1723
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,760
you were like this.

1724
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,450
But you were so excited when we showed you on spot.

1725
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,560
It is because they are really there

1726
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:59,490
so you think they are really happy right now.

1727
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:01,650
Then you don't feel sad when you see the sad scenes,

1728
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:02,460
do you?

1729
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:05,450
I don't buy it. Well, next.

1730
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,220
This question comes to Esther.

1731
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,290
Please look at me for a second.

1732
01:04:09,290 --> 01:04:11,050
We just watched many famous scenes.

1733
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:11,720
This scene

1734
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:16,620
is the Top 5 famous scene chosen by our netizens.

1735
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,890
These scenes are all very memorable.

1736
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,140
I want to ask Esther.

1737
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:23,120
What impressed you the most or

1738
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,290
which scene do you want to re-enact the best?

1739
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,360
I...

1740
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:34,650
If we do those simple scenes, it would be very easy.

1741
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,020
But if we do the hard ones...

1742
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,860
I don't know. I'll listen to you.

1743
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:38,860


1744
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,250
[Laughing]

1745
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,860
A live performance?

1746
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:47,990
Yes. Choose one of the five scenes and perform on the spot.

1747
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:49,390
Just pick one.

1748
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,150
Any of them.

1749
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,990
Or all the five scenes?

1750
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,420
[Laughing]

1751
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,150
They're discussing over the microphone.

1752
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,020
OK. I don't have a line in that scene.

1753
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:11,560
OK. Let's perform the scene of asking for the music score.

1754
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,620
Alright.

1755
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:15,120
I'd like to know about the design.

1756
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,060
- There was also Lord Changheng in that scene. - Asking for the music score?

1757
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:18,160
From the first scene just now, right?

1758
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:18,820
Ah.

1759
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:20,790
I heard that

1760
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:22,150
there were some changes made when shooting,

1761
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,860
and made it what it is like now, right?

1762
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:26,390
Yes, the last scene of the music score

1763
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:27,790
was improvisation.

1764
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,190
Yes.

1765
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:30,920
Improvisation.

1766
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,520
Yes, during the audition,

1767
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,420
he didn't have the music score.

1768
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:37,720
In the end, he said,

1769
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:40,420
"director, where's the music score?" Something like that.

1770
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:41,120
Right.

1771
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,520
The director thought it was funny

1772
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,850
and he added it into that scene.

1773
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,120
OK. Let's do it now.

1774
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:47,360
OK. Please stand up.

1775
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:49,020
What's my line?

1776
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,020
How about I create a live performance plan?

1777
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,050
Since we know that

1778
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,620
when actors are acting,

1779
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,590
you need to act in front of the camera when shooting close-ups,

1780
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:57,950
and you don't always have a partner.

1781
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,990
Most of the actors would love to have a partner, though.

1782
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:01,050
Well, here today,

1783
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,660
let's face the camera directly.

1784
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:05,060
Ling He, you just assume they are standing here.

1785
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,720
You two just assume Ling He is standing here.

1786
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,020
So everyone can see your faces, OK?

1787
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:09,350
Well.../This...

1788
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,660
Otherwise, if you stand against each other,

1789
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:11,520
they only see one side of your faces.

1790
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,550
But this...

1791
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,820
How to act like that?

1792
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,990
How about this? Let's stand sideways.

1793
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:17,320
They have to look a little sideways, too.

1794
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,190
You stand slightly sideways

1795
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,760
so that the audience and the cameras can have your faces.

1796
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:22,750
How about the cameras covering now? Give me some feedbacks, please.

1797
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:23,790
What are the lines?

1798
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:25,320
I'll go first.

1799
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,350
I'll say, "Dongfang Qingcang, I'm here to take Orchid home.

1800
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:28,450
And you'll say no.

1801
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:31,220
I say no. That's not it.

1802
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,150
I remember the lines.

1803
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:35,120
I remember. It's "We should

1804
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,650
work together

1805
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:37,860
to play the song

1806
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:41,990
which can

1807
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,420
comfort the souls of those dead people."

1808
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:46,350
And then, "Now since Orchid asked,

1809
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:46,860
I promise you."

1810
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:48,520
So, we'll work together.

1811
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:49,650
OK.

1812
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,620
"Now that Orchid asked, I promise you."

1813
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:52,850
Then he will say the music score.

1814
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:53,620
OK.

1815
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:54,550
- Alright. - OK.

1816
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,460
How about this?

1817
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,350
If you sing a song now, we won't have to act.

1818
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:01,160
Haha./[Laughing]

1819
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,150
[Laughing]

1820
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,460
Ling He, you stand at here.

1821
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:04,720
You two can step forward a little.

1822
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,320
Yes. All of you stand in one way.

1823
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,450
OK.

1824
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,590
OK. It's okay to look at them.

1825
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:12,120
Where's the camera? Or we will look at the camera.

1826
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,150
Why are we standing here?

1827
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,260
We don't look good this way.

1828
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:14,960
Where?

1829
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:15,860
Let's change.

1830
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,390
- OK. - Right?

1831
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:20,150
This way. How about we exchange the positions?

1832
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,020
- What's the operation about? - Let's change.

1833
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:24,190
[Laughing]

1834
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:25,550
OK.

1835
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,760
Where is the camera?

1836
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:27,920
Just look at

1837
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,020
-each other. -You don't understand me.

1838
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:30,860
Let them make the shot.

1839
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,450
I'll go first, right?

1840
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:35,520
Dongfang Qingcang.

1841
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:38,720
Only when we work together,

1842
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:41,950
can we save the world.

1843
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:49,990
Since there is a reason,

1844
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:51,950
for the sake of Orchid,

1845
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,350
I promises you. The music score.

1846
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,460
I said the music score, not the ring.

1847
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:03,620
That's ridiculous.

1848
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:05,450
Give me back my ring.

1849
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:08,420
-OK. -Thank you!

1850
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,790
It's so wonderful.

1851
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,990
OK. Ling He, please have a seat.

1852
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:15,020
Esther and Dylan, one more minute, please.

1853
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:15,950
Me?

1854
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:16,819
Yes. Esther, please.

1855
01:08:16,819 --> 01:08:18,450
I have a question for you.

1856
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:19,220
Just now,

1857
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,350
I suddenly thought of a happy scene.

1858
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:21,990
In the drama,

1859
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:23,790
the happiest scenes I saw happen mostly were

1860
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:25,189
in Yunmeng Lake,

1861
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:26,550
when you went to the mortal world.

1862
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:27,620
Back then,

1863
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,390
everyone seemed to be

1864
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,990
leading a happy life.

1865
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:32,950
So, I want to know that

1866
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,760
in the next life, if Orchid,

1867
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:37,350
no matter by reincarnation

1868
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:39,189
or hardship experience, goes to Yunmeng Lake again,

1869
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:41,590
what kind of flower do you think you will turn into?

1870
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:46,460
I think I'll become a smiling flower.

1871
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:49,990
Because you're funny and cute, right?

1872
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:53,319
So, here comes the smiling flower for Esther. Hold it please, Esther.

1873
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,520
Do you have anything to say to her?

1874
01:08:57,859 --> 01:09:00,520
Anything?

1875
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:01,250
I'll just say anything.

1876
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,560
You can tell her to smile.

1877
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,460
Oh, right.

1878
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:06,990
Smiling flower, I wish you

1879
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,250
are always happy in Yunmeng Lake.

1880
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:11,620
Smile.

1881
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,319
[Laughing]

1882
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:16,720
Don't do this to anyone but me.

1883
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:17,520
Ah.

1884
01:09:18,189 --> 01:09:18,950
Ah.

1885
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,920
Fine, I agree.

1886
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,420
OK. As you can see,

1887
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:25,590
the flower represents another variety show of iQIYI,

1888
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:28,220
called the Super Sketch Show.

1889
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:29,990
It's a great crossover today.

1890
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:30,790
The show is coming soon.

1891
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:32,550
Please support the second season of Super Sketch Show.

1892
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,990
Thank you.

1893
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:35,560
Please take a seat.

1894
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,819
OK. Thank you.

1895
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:40,200
Thank you, Esther. Thank you, Dylan.

1896
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:40,200


1897
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:41,510
Next,

1898
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,080
we have another gift

1899
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,810
for the VIP members.

1900
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:47,250
It's unique for VIP members today.

1901
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:50,149
It's a limited edition

1902
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:54,240
of the drama's behind-the-scenes video

1903
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:55,710
exclusively for tonight's meet-and-greet VIP members.

1904
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:56,910
It's never been revealed before.

1905
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:57,640
A big surprise, right?

1906
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:58,650
-Watch the big screen. -What behind-the-scenes video?

1907
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,740
Are you from the side?

1908
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:08,250
Are you from the side?

1909
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:14,170
I'm telling you that I saw your sweet smile clearly just now.

1910
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:16,170
No, Dongfang Qingcang.

1911
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:19,570
That's it.

1912
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:20,910
You are really

1913
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,480
the green grass in the fairy realm,

1914
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,890
being easily swayed.

1915
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:26,530
You can have her.

1916
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:27,550
Who wants her?

1917
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:29,450
I don't want her. You can have her.

1918
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:30,280
Let's go.

1919
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,140
I'm leaving too.

1920
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,210
Then I'll quit too.

1921
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:35,110
What?

1922
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:39,410
-Because I'm too ugly. -So you should take a step back.

1923
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:42,350
Come on.

1924
01:11:05,950 --> 01:11:08,080
I also shed tears!

1925
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:10,540
The tear should be like a pearl, being really big.

1926
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:13,110
I can only cry after you turn around.

1927
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:15,910
My tears are coming, only if I want. I thought you wouldn't film me.

1928
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:18,080
You see, they suddenly filmed me, and my tear just dropped down.

1929
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:35,480
Why did you kiss me so passionately?

1930
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,440
You're like being half dead.

1931
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:39,710
You're also like being on the verge of death.

1932
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:43,740
If I go to the very depth of your heart,

1933
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,440
then I can gain the Glazed Fire.

1934
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:47,350
It can control you.

1935
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:27,480
Next, let's welcome Jing Long and Jing Di'er to sing "The Other Side" for us.

1936

01:14:57,610 --> 01:15:03,890
♫ Cut a red flower and shake it off in the water moon ♫

1964
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:13,490
♫ I turned around and you're gone ♫

1965
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:13,490


1966
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:26,980
OK. Let's thank Jing Long and Jing Di for the wonderful song, "Far Shore".

1967
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:29,790
It’s the melody lingering in many people’s mind in this summer.

1968
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:30,850
Next,

1969
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:33,480
let's continue the game.

1970
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,850
Let's welcome the leading actors to the stage again.

1971
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:37,580
Please come on.

1972
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:38,520
Friends.

1973
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:47,850
I've given it up.

1974
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:50,150
Everyone,

1975
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:51,350
we have prearranged positions here.

1976
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:52,680
I haven't been on the stage for a long time.

1977
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:54,390
So many prearranged positions.

1978
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,150
Everyone,

1979
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:57,650
Today, Fairies,

1980
01:15:57,650 --> 01:16:00,450
the Moon Tribe and even the Xilan Tribe are all here.

1981
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:03,320
But we don't want you to be divided by tribe,

1982
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,080
because the theme of

1983
01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:05,950
Love Between Fairy and Devil is love.

1984
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:07,120
We're the same.

1985
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,780
So let's team up

1986
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:10,920
by boys and girls, OK?

1987
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:13,750
The leader of the girls' team will be Esther.

1988
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:15,780
And the leader of the boys' team will be Dylan.

1989
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:18,350
If you have a fight later,

1990
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:19,050
I won't lend a hand.

1991
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:22,050
Let's fight hard for victory, okay?

1992
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:27,920
The first game is called "You're the only one in my life."

1993
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:29,590
Excuse me, give us the props.

1994
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:30,550
Let's talk about the rules.

1995
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:32,290
Really?

1996
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:35,180
I've never lost in games, girls.

1997
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:38,750
-Come to me. -Stand where you belong.

1998
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:40,640
I want this position.

1999
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:43,190
They have four. We have one more.

2000
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:45,450
Esther, can you think of a team name for the girls?

2001
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:46,380
They have the host.

2002
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:47,090
What's our name?

2003
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:47,990
Think of a team name.

2004
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:48,980
What's our name?

2005
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,120
That's it.

2006
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,680
Boys, think of a team name too.

2007
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:52,280
I like this.

2008
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:53,720
It's up to you.

2009
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:54,850
OK. Good.

2010
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:55,920
Come on.

2011
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:57,250
Mine?

2012
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:59,750
Move forward a little bit, you five are out of light area.

2013
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:00,710
Very good.

2014
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:03,490
I've come up with a cheesy one.

2015
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:04,290
We're done.

2016
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:04,980
You're done?

2017
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:05,810
You go first.

2018
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:06,850
Ladies first.

2019
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:08,450
Your team name is "Ladies first"?

2020
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:10,180
No, ladies first.

2021
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,950
What's your name? Let's exchange it.

2022
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,050
We've got it.

2023
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:14,520
Yes.

2024
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,720
What's your name?

2025
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:17,050
You haven't decided yet?

2026
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:17,380
Yeah.

2027
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:18,980
We want you to say first.

2028
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:21,750
Then let's stop it here.

2029
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,080
We'll say it.

2030
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:26,050
Let me cue it.

2031
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:30,490
Hello, everyone. We're the male model team from "Love Between Fairy and Devil".

2032
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:35,780
Male model team.

2033
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:37,690
Male model team.

2034
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:41,720
I wanted to name you "Big Five of Love Between Fairy and Devil".

2035
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,650
Don't you think it's classic?

2036
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:44,590
It's more fashionable.

2037
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:46,050
Theirs sounds more tasteful.

2038
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,320
More tasteful.

2039
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:49,120
What's our name?

2040
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:51,750
Let's call it the Fairy Team from Love Between Fairy and Devil".

2041
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,180
-OK? -Good.

2042
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:55,950
Here are the Fairy Team and the Male Model Team of Love Between Fairy and Devil.

2043
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:58,120
Are we taking an advantage?

2044
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,250
Male model team.

2045
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:01,350
You can change it. Will you change it?

2046
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:02,450
Who gave you the name?

2047
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:08,740
Moon Supreme. Moon Supreme.

2048
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:10,080
Do you still want to change it on your last chance?

2049
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:10,790
Are we changing it?

2050
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:12,920
-No need to change. -No.

2051
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,780
They don't look very smart.

2052
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,450
Lord Ronghao such a long face.

2053
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:19,080
He's going to release the evil spirit.

2054
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:19,920
Ronghao wants to come here.

2055
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,780
Shangque said something seriously beside me.

2056
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,650
"Five Tigers from Love Between Fairy and Devil".

2057
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:29,720
It's worse than Male Model.

2058
01:18:30,490 --> 01:18:31,350
I need to control my facial expressions.

2059
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:32,880
Say some harsh words.

2060
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:34,150
Come on, leader.

2061
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:35,350
Esther, Dylan.

2062
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:36,850
Freestyle.

2063
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:43,920
Our Fairy Team will win against you guys.

2064
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:46,380
Let them win.

2065
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:48,120
They don't look classy.

2066
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,320
No.

2067
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:52,280
Send Chidi woman, you look more aggressive.

2068
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:53,890
Our strongest member.

2069
01:18:54,190 --> 01:18:55,280
Hurry.

2070
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:58,320
Chidi woman, use her tone.

2071
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:01,850
I think you should say it as Dongfang Qingcang.

2072
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:04,650
You as the Chidi woman. Let's see who's stronger.

2073
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:05,590
The role.

2074
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:07,920
We'll play the role of my parents.

2075
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,600
Come on. Pass your power.

2076
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:17,480
Let's do it together.

2077
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:18,950
Really?

2078
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:22,650
My lord is mighty.

2079
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:24,680
My lord, you have to look mighty.

2080
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:26,550
Pass power. Don't push me.

2081
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:28,300
What?

2082
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,850
Losing is a taboo for a soldier.

2083
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:36,090
That's all?

2084
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:36,810
Yes.

2085
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:38,850
So powerful.

2086
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:41,050
Ruthless people say less.

2087
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:44,690
Although you're my respectable opponent,

2088
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:48,120
a dying man doesn't deserve to know my name.

2089
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:48,120


2090
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,050
Wait.

2091
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:55,650
This is the girl who belongs to men.

2092
01:19:55,650 --> 01:19:58,780
None of us thought they were great, but they kept cheering for themselves.

2093
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,720
Why would you do that?

2094
01:20:03,450 --> 01:20:04,250
What is it?

2095
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:05,320
It's "disgusting".

2096
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,180
Okay.

2097
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:09,650
Let's end the harsh words session here, and the next step is the game session.

2098
01:20:09,650 --> 01:20:10,720
I'll introduce you the rules.

2099
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,720
The two team leaders are required to participate in the game.

2100
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,150
You can also each choose a friend to join you.

2101
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,120
Besides,

2102
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:18,950
we are the running team members. And we're standing team members.

2103
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:19,950
Here are our rules.

2104
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:22,580
The four of you will stand together on this Destiny Book,

2105
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,550
and then I will stand around the Destiny Book first.

2106
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:25,880
Next I will give you a password,

2107
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:27,450
for example, "Please stand upside down on it".

2108
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:27,940
And I'll say "Three, two, one, go".

2109
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:29,580
You need to do the action I said.

2110
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:31,150
But you don't need to actually stand upside down, I'm just giving an example.

2111
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:32,550
-Okay. -Stand upside down.

2112
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:33,720
Then we have to go up.

2113
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:36,520
After finishing the action... If the girls' team finishes first,

2114
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:37,850
I will say the girls' team is done.

2115
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:40,250
The other two can run over and hit the gong.

2116
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:42,180
Whoever hits the gong first will get the right to answer questions.

2117
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:44,350
Then I will ask you a question and you will get a point for answering one correctly.

2118
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:45,750
I am wearing high heels.

2119
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:47,350
Then I'll be the one who runs.

2120
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:47,980
It's easy.

2121
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:49,350
-We'll run. You two go there. -Who are you going with?

2122
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:52,060
-I'll with Jieli. -To hit the gong?

2123
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,120
Okay, then you and Jieli are the standing team members.

2124
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,050
You're like my kid.

2125
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:56,250
Who are standing team members?

2126
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:58,850
Wait a minute, sweatheart. I'll call you later, okay?

2127
01:20:58,850 --> 01:20:59,980
OK. You and your brother.

2128
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:01,250
I don't know.

2129
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,720
We are so stupid.

2130
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:04,950
Choose one.

2131
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:06,610
What does the standing team mainly do? Answer questions?

2132
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:08,120
Doing actions.

2133
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:08,700
Doing actions.

2134
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:09,050
Right?

2135
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,430
OK.

2136
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:10,550
How about you and Black Dragon?

2137
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,180
Or Xunfeng? Choose one.

2138
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:12,990
Who will do it?

2139
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:13,590
You.

2140
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:14,390
OK.

2141
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:15,090
OK. Come on.

2142
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:16,590
You four stand around this Destiny Book.

2143
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:17,320
Don't stand on it.

2144
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,920
Stand around first. Come on, Esther.

2145
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:20,590
-When will... -What should we do?

2146
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:21,230
We need to stand properly.

2147
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:22,650
Then you guys come to my side.

2148
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:23,650
Our mission is to bang the gong.

2149
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:24,750
You need to bang the gong.

2150
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:25,750
We need to bang the gong?

2151
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:26,340
Yes.

2152
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,180
Then we'll...

2153
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,720
Do we need to answer questions?

2154
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:30,470
Let's try.

2155
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:31,980
We play games very seriously.

2156
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:33,990
We might actually get into a fight up there.

2157
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:35,120
Safety is most important.

2158
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,450
-It's okay. If you guys get into a fight, I... -Are your bodyguards ready?

2159
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:38,690
Okay.

2160
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:39,720
Please listen to me.

2161
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:42,120
Listen to what you need to do in the first round.

2162
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,150
I will say 321 first, and then...

2163
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:44,920
Wait a minute, we have to step on it and do it right?

2164
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:45,520
Yeah, step on it.

2165
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,080
But you guys have to wait until I say three, two, one.

2166
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:48,350
We can only run if we answer the question right, is that so?

2167
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:49,020
Stand closer.

2168
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:50,380
No, you have to run over for the right to answer the question.

2169
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:52,490
No. It's if you do these actions right...

2170
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:53,590
You can run over and bang the gong.

2171
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:54,850
Yes.

2172
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:57,290
-Are you four ready? -We need to bang the gong after she says 321.

2173
01:21:57,290 --> 01:21:58,990
-She says 3,2,1. And I'll bang the gong. -Yes. -You don't need to.

2174
01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:01,990
-Step back. -He's need to bang the gong.

2175
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:05,750
What should I say?

2176
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:08,650
Which team does the action before starting...

2177
01:22:08,650 --> 01:22:09,480
Yes.

2178
01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:12,650
Get ready. I'm going to tell you about the first action.

2179
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:14,950
The first round's action is...

2180
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:18,250
to make eye contact with your teammate and touch your face affectionately.

2181
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:19,280
Three, two, one, go.

2182
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:21,490
-Okay, girls finished. -Bang the gong

2183
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:22,850
Alright.

2184
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:25,280
To be honest.

2185
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:25,950
We won!

2186
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:26,780
Girls haven't finished.

2187
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:27,770
We win.

2188
01:22:27,770 --> 01:22:29,350
Do you have to be so serious?

2189
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:30,250
Alright.

2190
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:31,320
Do you have to be so serious?

2191
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,050
Let's do it again.

2192
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:32,670
One more time.

2193
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:33,150
What did they do?

2194
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:34,780
-When I say... -Touch another person's face.

2195
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:35,720
Yes, touch another person's face.

2196
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,480
When I say "girls' done", then you can eun.

2197
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:39,850
I see.

2198
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:41,750
One more time.

2199
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:46,650
Three, two, one. Please step on the Destiny Book and touch your teammate's face.

2200
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:48,390
Okay, girls' done. Go.

2201
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:50,750
OK. They sounded the gong.

2202
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:52,350
-OK, go now. -How about we?

2203
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:53,590
No no no. We can only...

2204
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:54,090
No.

2205
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:55,120
You can also snatch.

2206
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:57,930
We won first.

2207
01:22:57,930 --> 01:22:58,770
You two hurry up.

2208
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:01,750
But they had no need to run.

2209
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:02,450
They can also run.

2210
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:03,880
Because if they get the answer wrong, it's your turn.

2211
01:23:03,890 --> 01:23:05,150
But if you guys aren't there,

2212
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:06,120
their teammates can answer.

2213
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,720
If they have done first, we...

2214
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:08,650
As soon as they run,

2215
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:11,050
you can push each other.

2216
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:15,120
Whoever pushes the other guy out of the Destiny Book wins.

2217
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,880
Do you know why we play this?

2218
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,850
Because we want you to be more childish.

2219
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:22,390
Girls, here's the question, Xiaoting please listen,

2220
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:23,650
Because you just hit the gong.

2221
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:25,990
If you're wrong, the chance will be given to boys.

2222
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:28,120
I ask, and you answer.

2223
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:29,350
Here's the question.

2224
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,050
Orchid kissed Dongfang Qingcang for the first time,

2225
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:33,520
what color was Dongfang Qingcang's hair?

2226
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:35,920
What color?

2227
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:38,480
Silver white.

2228
01:23:38,490 --> 01:23:40,190
Correct.

2229
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:42,850
I am the most just person.

2230
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:44,590
Beacuse girls won,

2231
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:46,890
your team leader is only allowed to be here.

2232
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:48,300
Dylan, the team leader must be here.

2233
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:49,720
-Charles, you're out. -You guys come back.

2234
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:50,650
And become a runner.

2235
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:51,280
We weo do actions, you two snatch.

2236
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,050
We'll do actions.

2237
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:53,210
Yes, you two do actions... We...

2238
01:23:53,210 --> 01:23:53,210


2239
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:54,700
We answer.

2240
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:56,910
One of you has been eliminated.

2241
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:57,840
One of you has been eliminated.

2242
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,070
Now only Dylan can be here.

2243
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:00,100
Charles was eliminated.

2244
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:01,470
Because the girls' team got it right.

2245
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:03,900
This is your model Five Tigers.

2246
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:05,870
OMG. How can you do it alone?

2247
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:07,310
One person has his own movement.

2248
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:09,840
What about we call you “Five Tiger Trash”?

2249
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:12,370
OK. No problem. You four come.

2250
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:13,710
Please listen to the movements.

2251
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:16,410
When they finish hugging

2252
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:17,470
or touching,

2253
01:24:17,570 --> 01:24:19,570
you can run, okay?

2254
01:24:19,570 --> 01:24:23,400
But your Destiny Book will be smaller.

2255
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,040
It's not worth it.

2256
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,670
So I said one of you will be eliminated.

2257
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:28,040
But if you four are willing to squeeze,

2258
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:29,100
I'd like to see it too.

2259
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:29,910
OK.

2260
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:32,640
Three, two, one, please listen to the question.

2261
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,910
The movement of this question is two people make a heart.

2262
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:37,470
And stand on one foot. Do it with your teammates.

2263
01:24:37,770 --> 01:24:40,700
OK. Let’s start. Boys, hands, make a heart.

2264
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:43,510
Girls didn't make a heart. Stop.

2265
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,040
The boys’ team finished it first and let the boys’ team beat the gong.

2266
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:47,800
Are we really not ourselves?

2267
01:24:47,810 --> 01:24:47,970
Finished.

2268
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:49,040
Of course it's us.

2269
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:52,600
Did you two make hearts? I didn't see it.

2270
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:55,470
Two people make a heart. We have two people.

2271
01:24:55,610 --> 01:24:58,840
She never said that.

2272
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,370
How about this? Let the boys answer once.

2273
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:02,000
They may not get it right, okay?

2274
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:03,810
Who will be the represent of the boys' team?

2275
01:25:03,810 --> 01:25:04,640
Xiao Qiang.

2276
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:06,040
Okay, I'll do it.

2277
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:08,900
Over here please Chen Xiao, I will ask you my question now.

2278
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:12,400
May I ask how Orchid's immortal root got destroyed?

2279
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:16,240
It was destroyed by her master with his feet, with wine.

2280
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:19,100
It got stepped by her master with his feet

2281
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:20,310
With his feet.

2282
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,440
With his wine! not his feet

2283
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,100
Being destroyed with wine.

2284
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:25,010
What wine?

2285
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:28,570
Soju?

2286
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:29,470
Foot Wash.

2287
01:25:29,470 --> 01:25:30,700
What wine?

2288
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:33,170
You can use any wine, even wedding wine.

2289
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:34,040
It doesn't matter.

2290
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,500
Anyway, you got it right.

2291
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:37,770
OK. Congratulations to boys’ team for getting one point.

2292
01:25:37,810 --> 01:25:39,570
A destiny book will be withdrawn.

2293
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:40,700
The two captains

2294
01:25:40,710 --> 01:25:42,570
will do their last move.

2295
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:43,600
Good luck! Okay.

2296
01:25:44,910 --> 01:25:45,710
Go for it!

2297
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:47,210
I'm wearing high heels.

2298
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:49,270
This game is a match point.

2299
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:52,100
Wait. Will it involve any intense movements?

2300
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:54,240
No, no, no. Okay.

2301
01:25:54,610 --> 01:25:56,910
I might rather lose the game.

2302
01:25:56,970 --> 01:26:00,300
So your next action would involve

2303
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:02,570
Both of you, please

2304
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:06,600
stand on the book and cover each other's eyes. Go!

2305
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:09,670
Okay, Orchid did it first. Girls' team go.

2306
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:14,670
OK. OK. I don’t know why I ran.

2307
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:16,900
Well, nobody is doing anything

2308
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:17,810
Why did I run?

2309
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:18,840
We can run too.

2310
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,470
I thought by covering eyes, someone

2311
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:23,110
would give us a big gift, a surprise.

2312
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:25,410
Right? Orchid was waiting

2313
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:26,640
for a...

2314
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:27,900
Big surprise.

2315
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:31,170
Thought we would look back and see, something extra or special but...

2316
01:26:31,410 --> 01:26:33,610
No, we just want you to cover each other's eyes.

2317
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:36,170
Who will answer this question?

2318
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:37,300
Stay away from Jieli.

2319
01:26:37,710 --> 01:26:39,440
Let's do quick answering

2320
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,270
Then all of you will answer together, Okay?

2321
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:42,040
OK.

2322
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,970
Everyone, answer it together.

2323
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:47,300
In this drama,

2324
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:51,040
what does Lord Rong Hao like to drink the most?

2325
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:52,870
Lord Rong Hao himself is not allowed to answer this question

2326
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:55,610
Does Changheng know? But we can't answer it.

2327
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:56,400
Hurry up.

2328
01:26:56,410 --> 01:26:57,440
Can we answer it?

2329
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,400
Yes, you can try.

2330
01:26:59,240 --> 01:26:59,870
Do you want to answer?

2331
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:00,800
Sure.

2332
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:02,100
Sorghum wine

2333
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:03,240
What?

2334
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:03,770
Rice wine.

2335
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:04,970
Green Flame Wine.

2336
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:10,090
Nice one!

2337
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:12,840
OK. Boys’ team won this round.

2338
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:14,600
So you have to punish the four girls.

2339
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:15,370
Grils. This way, please.

2340
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:16,370
This is so unfair.

2341
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:18,570
Why do you ask a question about Lord Rong Hao?

2342
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:21,300
Because everyone has a relevant question. Then you can ask one about Jieli.

2343
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:21,800
They have.

2344
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:24,240
May I ask Jieli sister's name?

2345
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:25,070
Danyin.

2346
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:27,810
I announce I lost this round, okay?

2347
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:31,110
The punishment is also interesting.

2348
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:32,710
We'll do a truth or dare

2349
01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:33,710
Please come over here

2350
01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:35,700
Or you can choose to take a special drink.

2351
01:27:37,870 --> 01:27:40,300
Our punishment is to take a Truth or Dare challenge

2352
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:43,910
Or drink our special magic elixir.

2353
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:44,810
Everyone can choose

2354
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:46,240
which punishment you will accept.

2355
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:48,570
Boys should want to be punished with girls, right?

2356
01:27:48,570 --> 01:27:50,570
No, no, no.

2357
01:27:50,570 --> 01:27:51,470
No.

2358
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,770
Really now？

2359
01:27:53,870 --> 01:27:55,970
If they don't want take the punishment with you I'll take it with you

2360
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:57,100
What kind of punishment do you want?

2361
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:59,240
Truth or dare. Well why would you take the punishment with them?

2362
01:27:59,240 --> 01:27:59,900
Okay

2363
01:27:59,910 --> 01:28:01,910
Sure. Truth or Dare.

2364
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:03,100
Truth or Dare.

2365
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:05,170
Or to drink the special magic elixir.

2366
01:28:05,210 --> 01:28:06,170
Truth or Dare.

2367
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:08,270
OK. So do you want Truth or Dare?

2368
01:28:09,670 --> 01:28:13,000
Dare.

2369
01:28:13,010 --> 01:28:14,770
Let me think of one.

2370
01:28:14,770 --> 01:28:16,810
The five of you will think of a Dare for them.

2371
01:28:16,810 --> 01:28:16,810


2372
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:18,730
Let's get started.

2373
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:22,010
Let's hear Zhang Ling He sing the Buffalo version of "Quit Smoking."

2374
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:24,310
This is a "dare" for me.

2375
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:26,500
My ears won't be able to handle this

2376
01:28:26,670 --> 01:28:27,870
We won!

2377
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:28,470
Yeah.

2378
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:32,540
But this is a "dare" for us.

2379
01:28:32,910 --> 01:28:34,210
Great logic!

2380
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:35,970
You just said that. Just say it now.

2381
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:37,300
Come on.

2382
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:40,140
Dear child.

2383
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:42,600
No, no, no.

2384
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:45,770
Can you show us the game of folding burgers?

2385
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:47,300
Then I'll take it as you finished the "dare."

2386
01:28:47,310 --> 01:28:48,110
I have a suggestion.

2387
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:51,270
How about you girls take five cute continuous photo shoots?

2388
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:54,540
OK. That will also be the gift for the fans.

2389
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:56,370
But you have to make a demostration first.

2390
01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:58,810
One of you should lead the game.

2391
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:01,010
And we'll follow that person.

2392
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:03,470
How about this? You five make five photos.

2393
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:06,070
I mean, you four can make five continuous shots first and they follow. Is that okay?

2394
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:06,690
-Sure. -OK.

2395
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:07,570
Deal.

2396
01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:08,900
Aren't we supposed to be the winners?

2397
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:09,770
Yes.

2398
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:12,340
It's a reward for you winners.

2399
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:14,340
We're having a fan meeting right now.

2400
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:15,800
Why are you so serious?

2401
01:29:15,970 --> 01:29:19,570
-Hahaha. -Sounds horrifying.

2402
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:20,570
It's scary.

2403
01:29:20,770 --> 01:29:23,500
It doesn't matter. This is called the pupil's obsession with the game.

2404
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:24,000
Okay.

2405
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:26,370
All right, let's take five continuous cute shots, okay?

2406
01:29:26,370 --> 01:29:28,600
Please play some music, and I'll call the tempo.

2407
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:29,410
You have to do it.

2408
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:30,170
OK.

2409
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:30,970
You guys have to do it too

2410
01:29:31,910 --> 01:29:32,870
Let's stand in a line.

2411
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:34,540
Stand here and do it together.

2412
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:36,140
Come here. Stand together.

2413
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:36,940
Okay.

2414
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:39,510
-Okay. -How to make the five continuous cute shots?

2415
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:41,310
You mean each person needs to make one pose?

2416
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:43,360
Right so I'll say "five continuous cute shots."

2417
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,340
And when I say "Five," and you should pause for a while.

2418
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:45,200
When I say "four," it's time for you to stop the move.

2419
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:46,540
So, each person needs to make five poses?

2420
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:48,740
Yeah, all of you should make five poses together. But you can make it different.

2421
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:50,100
-And you boys should imitate them. -OK.

2422
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:51,590
Now we have

2423
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:55,870
The girl team's five continous cute shots! First shot!

2424
01:29:57,970 --> 01:29:58,940
The second one.

2425
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:01,370
The third one.

2426
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:04,210
The fourth one.

2427
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:06,870
The fifth one.

2428
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:09,340
Why are there the fifth?

2429
01:30:10,170 --> 01:30:11,570
Haha.

2430
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:13,410
Is it okay?

2431
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:14,870
Do you know what I saw just now?

2432
01:30:14,870 --> 01:30:15,670
I finished!

2433
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:17,010
You know it, right?

2434
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:17,710
We finished.

2435
01:30:17,710 --> 01:30:19,070
I want to know what it was.

2436
01:30:19,070 --> 01:30:20,740
Many of you had a tacit understanding just now.

2437
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:22,870
Because you did the same pose without seeing each other.

2438
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:25,220
-We finished, right? -Yeah, it's done.

2439
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:26,770
Yes.

2440
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:29,610
Wait a moment!

2441
01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:31,000
Ling He didn't pose just now!

2442
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:32,270
I suggest we should give him...

2443
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:34,000
He wants to sing, right? He wants to sing a song.

2444
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:34,970
Wow.

2445
01:30:35,410 --> 01:30:36,870
I see.

2446
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:38,300
I'm looking forward to it!

2447
01:30:38,410 --> 01:30:38,510
You...

2448
01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:39,170
Let's move on to the next game.

2449
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:41,730
No, everyone posed but you didn't.

2450
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:42,610
You have to do something.

2451
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:44,010
How about this? He doesn't have to sing.

2452
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:45,170
Because once he sings,

2453
01:30:45,170 --> 01:30:47,570
we can't help dancing.

2454
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:48,970
So it looks terrible.

2455
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:49,910
He also can dance.

2456
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:53,770
You guys were good friends in the drama.

2457
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:55,540
You still want to save him outside the sets?

2458
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:56,600
Do you want to sing?

2459
01:30:56,670 --> 01:30:57,800
Just do it if you want.

2460
01:30:58,540 --> 01:30:59,200
No, I don't think so.

2461
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:01,010
Let's make it a happy day.

2462
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:02,340
Let's save it for later.

2463
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:03,540
Later, each of you can sing a line or two.

2464
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:06,400
I'm so disappointed, Lord Changheng.

2465
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:07,770
Every has to sing a line or two later, okay?

2466
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:10,940
Here's another game.

2467
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:12,400
Please come over there.

2468
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:13,610
Let's keep away from the gong.

2469
01:31:13,610 --> 01:31:15,270
We're going to walk off the stage.

2470
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:16,610
We still have Boys' team and girls' team.

2471
01:31:16,610 --> 01:31:18,070
Two captains can stand in the middle.

2472
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:19,200
OK, captains, please come here.

2473
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:20,870
OK. Listen to me.

2474
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:23,870
Here is the rule.

2475
01:31:24,010 --> 01:31:28,370
We're going to read some of the words

2476
01:31:28,570 --> 01:31:29,570
that are used to describe our characters of the drama.

2477
01:31:29,570 --> 01:31:31,370
For example, with a green face and ferocious fangs,

2478
01:31:31,370 --> 01:31:33,200
and lice on the hair.

2479
01:31:33,470 --> 01:31:35,170
If you know who the words are associated with,

2480
01:31:35,170 --> 01:31:36,140
you can ring the gong and say your answer.

2481
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:38,070
Well, the words just now won't be the options anymore, okay?

2482
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:38,870
Because we already used them as the examples.

2483
01:31:39,110 --> 01:31:41,470
The person who answer it wrong will lose the right to answer the next question.

2484
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:43,000
Then, you have to let others answer this question.

2485
01:31:43,010 --> 01:31:45,510
-OK. -Here is the first question.

2486
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:46,570
Should we vie to answer?

2487
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:47,670
He is...

2488
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:48,870
So everyone can vie to answer?

2489
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:50,900
Yes. But points are accumulated according to the team.

2490
01:31:50,910 --> 01:31:51,740
OK?

2491
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:54,970
He is a cold and heartless person.

2492
01:31:57,340 --> 01:31:58,600
You two are team mates!

2493
01:31:58,610 --> 01:31:59,540
But you were still so competitive.

2494
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:01,500
Ronghao, do you think who it is?

2495
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:03,110
Many people fit that description.

2496
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:04,940
Yeah. It's kinda impulsive

2497
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:05,570
to be the first one to try it.

2498
01:32:05,570 --> 01:32:06,370
Lord Yunzhong.

2499
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:07,870
Is the person here?

2500
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:08,970
Um..

2501
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:09,890
Definitely.

2502
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:11,540
- Is it a man? -She doesn't know it, too.

2503
01:32:11,570 --> 01:32:13,100
I'm the one who's asking the question.

2504
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:13,810
You...

2505
01:32:13,810 --> 01:32:15,610
played it like it's a different game.

2506
01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:16,940
Hahaha.

2507
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:18,470
He turned it into a situation puzzles.

2508
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:20,110
Is it Dongfang Qingcang?

2509
01:32:20,110 --> 01:32:20,570
No.

2510
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:21,510
Ok, you lost the right to answer it.

2511
01:32:21,510 --> 01:32:21,980
Lord Yunzhong!

2512
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:24,340
Here, Hai Qiao, please come here.

2513
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:25,300
Who?

2514
01:32:25,410 --> 01:32:26,610
Look, this is the answer.

2515
01:32:26,610 --> 01:32:27,430
He said it's Dongfang Qingcang.

2516
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:28,330
This answer is so funny.

2517
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:29,170
She didn't announce the right answer.

2518
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:30,540
What?

2519
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:32,140
Okay. Don't tell them yet.

2520
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:33,800
The first description is cold and heartless.

2521
01:32:33,870 --> 01:32:35,470
His answer was Dongfang Qingcang, but that was wrong.

2522
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:38,340
The second description is deep obsession.

2523
01:32:42,210 --> 01:32:43,010
Rong Hao!

2524
01:32:43,070 --> 01:32:43,970
Correct.

2525
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:45,810
But Daqiang, we have a drumstick there.

2526
01:32:46,910 --> 01:32:48,170
I like using fists.

2527
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:49,470
OK, you're great.

2528
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:51,710
Boys' team got one point.

2529
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:53,310
The second question,

2530
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:54,570
Even Ronghao didn't answer it right.

2531
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:55,410
But I'm wearing high heels, I can't run.

2532
01:32:55,410 --> 01:32:56,870
Here is the second question.

2533
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:59,200
It's...

2534
01:32:59,810 --> 01:33:01,710
a person in black robe.

2535
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:03,740
We don't even dare to answer it.

2536
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:05,570
-There were so many people in black robes. -We're not sure about this.

2537
01:33:05,810 --> 01:33:07,470
That's why you gotta make a guess.

2538
01:33:07,470 --> 01:33:08,740
A black robe?

2539
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:10,100
Yeah, black robe.

2540
01:33:10,510 --> 01:33:11,580
Xiao Ting, who do you think it is?

2541
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:12,810
Is it Dongfang Qingcang?

2542
01:33:12,810 --> 01:33:15,170
Wrong. Please come here.

2543
01:33:15,470 --> 01:33:16,470
Black robe.

2544
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:17,270
Dieyi...

2545
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:20,570
Master and disciple both lost in the first round.

2546
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:21,410
Chenxiao, do you think who it is?

2547
01:33:21,410 --> 01:33:22,170
I think it's me.

2548
01:33:22,170 --> 01:33:23,700
Are you sure?

2549
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:23,700


2550
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:25,830
That is correct.

2551
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:29,290
Take a look at the answer.

2552
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:31,900
Yes. OK.

2553
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:33,030
One more question.

2554
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:34,630
Why are you going to win again?

2555
01:33:35,230 --> 01:33:36,690
Because we are strong.

2556
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,560
Is this okay?

2557
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:40,190
Let the girls answer, okay?

2558
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:41,270
Listen, girls.

2559
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,480
If they get it wrong, they'll be sifted out and we will win.

2560
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:44,390
She is

2561
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:46,690
a heroine.

2562
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:48,460
What?

2563
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:50,960
You two are out.

2564
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:54,120
Why are you two who are out so active?

2565
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:55,830
Are we out?

2566
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:56,160
Yes.

2567
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:59,360
Give Jieli a chance, okay?

2568
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,690
Give her a chance.

2569
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:02,430
Black Dragon said it. We must give her a chance.

2570
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:04,190
-God Chidi. -Correct.

2571
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:09,160
Good. I did it on purpose. It is not obvious, right?

2572
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:11,440
-Next question. -It's so hard.

2573
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:14,390
He has a black robe with golden trim.

2574
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,630
A black robe with golden trim?

2575
01:34:16,660 --> 01:34:17,590
He?

2576
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:19,860
No.

2577
01:34:20,230 --> 01:34:21,190
It's my brother.

2578
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:23,630
But do you know what your brother was doing?

2579
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:25,660
Ask your brother. He was...

2580
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:27,120
Golden trim...

2581
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:27,800
Right? No?

2582
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:29,060
-Your brother asked you to come back. -Do you have it?

2583
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:29,690
A black robe with golden trim.

2584
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:30,760
Lord Yunzhong.

2585
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:32,100
You have it. Is it that?

2586
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,700
Lord Yunzhong doesn't have a black robe with golden trim.

2587
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:36,100
-He doesn't have the black robe. -Golden trim?

2588
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:37,890
Golden trim.

2589
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:39,300
Who said it?

2590
01:34:40,460 --> 01:34:42,560
-Do you have a black robe with golden trim? -No.

2591
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,660
Friends, I think

2592
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:44,630
that one minute just now

2593
01:34:44,630 --> 01:34:47,190
was the most dramatic in my life.

2594
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,660
I said it's Lord Yunzhong.

2595
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,630
-He doesn't have a black robe. -No.

2596
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,830
Well, the funniest thing is that Xunfeng got the question quickly.

2597
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:54,460
Who did you just say?

2598
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:55,290
DaQiang is anxious.

2599
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,660
He gave Orchid the chance. Orchid said Lord Yunzhong

2600
01:34:58,460 --> 01:34:59,460
Is it Dongfang Qingcang?

2601
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,760
Yes it's Dongfang Qingcang.

2602
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,960
The last question. Here is the match point.

2603
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:04,860
Match point.

2604
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:05,230
Match point.

2605
01:35:05,230 --> 01:35:07,090
Let's answer it together, okay?

2606
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,290
-OK. -Let me think.

2607
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:10,060
We won't sandbag.

2608
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,260
She has no regrets for love.

2609
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:14,960
What is it?

2610
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:15,660
She's gone.

2611
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:17,890
Okay, please answer, Dieyi.

2612
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:19,760
She has no regrets. Is that her?

2613
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,460
-Me. -Correct.

2614
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,190
We all think...

2615
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:25,490
She has no regrets.

2616
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:28,460
You also have no regrets, but she's right.

2617
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:31,360
All right. Ronghao's key sentence is that your obsession is deep.

2618
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,430
She has no regrets.

2619
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:33,690
I am obsessed.

2620
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,560
She has no regrets.

2621
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:36,660
You.

2622
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:39,090
This is about Haishi City, you solve on your own.

2623
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:40,360
Alright.

2624
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:43,230
Why are my words so scary while her words are so good?

2625
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:45,490
You also have good ones: to wear a plain hair clasp,

2626
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:47,100
to wear white clothes, which are like snow.

2627
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:48,600
I didn't read that.

2628
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:49,260
Next,

2629
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:51,690
the girls' team has answered three questions correctly.

2630
01:35:52,030 --> 01:35:53,430
Two questions for boys, right?

2631
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:54,090
It doesn't matter.

2632
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:56,200
Because I want to punish you all, OK?

2633
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:58,560
-Ok. -No matter it is welfare or punishment,

2634
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,260
We want you to recreate the game

2635
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:01,890
that we saw in the behind-the-scenes video.

2636
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:03,430
The game of folding hamburgers

2637
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:04,860
that you had fun on the set.

2638
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:06,890
Folding hamburgers? Folding Luohan.

2639
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:07,090
What?

2640
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,360
So many people play it together.

2641
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,490
Let's play in groups. Can you arrange yourselves?

2642
01:36:11,030 --> 01:36:12,990
To be honest, I didn't understand how to play that game.

2643
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,700
But I think everyone likes it and enjouys it.

2644
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:15,560
Many people

2645
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:17,030
say they want to see you play that game in the comments.

2646
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:19,060
Who can do it? Step forward, please.

2647
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:21,890
-Show us how to play it, OK? -I can. Who else can do it?

2648
01:36:22,830 --> 01:36:24,390
Just you two.

2649
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:25,560
OK.

2650
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:26,360
Just you two?

2651
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:28,560
Let's do PK together.

2652
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:29,790
OK. PK.

2653
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:30,000
PK.

2654
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,800
-And the others play the game to push the counterpart. -OK.

2655
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:34,660
I've arranged everything.

2656
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,030
One more time.

2657
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,860
-Sorry! Sorry! -Put it here!

2658
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:50,660
Put it here.

2659
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:55,760
-This is to hit hands, right? -Put it here.

2660
01:36:58,360 --> 01:36:59,430
How to play it?

2661
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:00,360
I don't understand.

2662
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:04,660
I don't understand it. Hit after putting hands down.

2663
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:06,230
Everyone knows it.

2664
01:37:06,230 --> 01:37:08,000
OK. The rest of you play the push game.

2665
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:11,460
The rest of you. Let Jieli and the Black Dragon play the push game.

2666
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:14,960
-Come on. -Jieli and Black Dragon

2667
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:15,390
Let's...

2668
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:16,630
Let's play the game that stand there

2669
01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:18,790
and push away the counterpart.

2670
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,960
I remember you said the closer you stand, the harder it is.

2671
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,460
Do you want to play it on the scope of Destiny Book?

2672
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:24,390
Yeah.

2673
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:25,430
Yeah. The Destiny Book is still here.

2674
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:27,590
-This is a small Destiny Book. Is there a bigger one? -Yes.

2675
01:37:28,030 --> 01:37:29,390
It's too small.

2676
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:31,000
I'll get a medium-size one.

2677
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:32,790
A little bigger.

2678
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:35,790
OK. Thank you for your arrangement, Director Esther. It's perfect.

2679
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:38,230
A hit can push me out of the stage.

2680
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:42,030
-OK. He won't be so rude. -You won't be so rude, will you?

2681
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:43,400
He will.

2682
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:44,760
I think you'd better keep it up.

2683
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,230
Do you want to win?

2684
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,590
Don't sandbag.

2685
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:50,900
Come on. Don't do it.

2686
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:56,430
Three, two, one, go.

2687
01:37:58,830 --> 01:37:59,890
He doesn't dare to use his strength.

2688
01:38:00,630 --> 01:38:02,360
What are you doing?

2689
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:05,630
-It's OK to move. -You must push the other out of the scope of the Destiny Book..

2690
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:16,830
You're sandbagging today.

2691
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:20,280
-Your acting is so poor. -Jieli is so "powerful".

2692
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:20,280


2693
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,260
Then let's play another game.

2694
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:24,760
Let's play together, okay?

2695
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:26,660
I just came up with a game.

2696
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:29,390
- OK. - Let's play the game what Love Between Fairy and Devil has.

2697
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,260
- OK. - Each of you say one thing. - OK.

2698
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:33,060
- Let's play the rhythm. - Too many.

2699
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:34,460
Let's stand in a row.

2700
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:37,390
- Let's line up. - He said there was something?

2701
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:39,560
A whole line.

2702
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:41,560
I say what Love Between Fairy and Devil has.

2703
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:45,130
It's correct even if you say Wang Yi Xu.

2704
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:45,890
Come on.

2705
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:46,860
Follow my order.

2706
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:48,960
- Let's start with Xiao Ting, OK? OK.

2707
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:51,260

OK. Next round. Let's continue.

2713
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:05,530
Is it still this game?

2714
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:07,190
Still this game. Let's talk until anyone can't say it.

2715
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:08,560
Don't repeat it.

2716
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,360
Don't repeat, OK? What is in the Love Between Fairy and Devil?

2717
01:39:13,330 --> 01:39:14,560
VIP members.

2718
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,900
- You don't have answers? - Hahaha.

2719
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:19,990
Orchid.

2720
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:24,060
OK, Xiao Ting was eliminated. Come here.

2721
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,000

01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:42,660
Give me a beat. In the Love Between Fairy and Devil.

01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,500
- Hahahahha. - Out.Out.

01:39:58,360 --> 01:39:59,790
There were melon seeds indeed.

2734
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,660
OK, Dieyi, come here.

2735

Yes, the winnder gets a prize.

What prize?

2740

I'll tell you later.

2741

2745
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:22,090
I didn't.

2746
01:40:22,330 --> 01:40:24,760
- I'm talking about the Arbiter Hall. - I said Arbiter Destiny Book

2747
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,660
- You are questioning. You're out. - You come down. Hahaha. - You are out.

It's a bit fast.

[Laughing]

2751
01:40:39,730 --> 01:40:40,530
The four of us.

2752
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,160
You're the only four left. Let's speed up!

2753
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,200
What's in the Love Between Fairy and Devil?

Dragon scales, wire, Bone Orchid, Jieli, transformation, green screen. Director.

2755
01:40:50,860 --> 01:40:51,690
Someone said director.

2756
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:53,100
Someone said director.

2757
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,060
Someone said director.

2758
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:58,160
Who said that? Did someone say director?

2759
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,100
No, no, no.

2760
01:41:01,330 --> 01:41:02,490
I was talking about the prelude.

2761
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:04,360
I lost.

2762

Hahaha come to us.

2766
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:16,000
Charles

2767
01:41:16,130 --> 01:41:17,730
and Xiao

2768
01:41:17,730 --> 01:41:18,290
won.

2769
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:21,360
The staff will present our Just Yogurt as the prize.

2770
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:23,660
Hahaha. Wow.

2771
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:27,200
You just give him one bottle. There are still a lot of games.

2772
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,900
You promised. It's OK to give it to me.

2773
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:31,660
Just one bottle. There are still a lot in the following competitions.

2774
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:32,890
A lot.

2775
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:35,200
Please come to the center, please.

2776
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,860
Let's welcome Esther and Dylan stand in the middle.

2777
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:38,960
Hahaha.

2778
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:40,860
You should know

2779
01:41:40,860 --> 01:41:42,730
that we have worked with the brand

2780
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:45,130
to prove the brand's recognition of the Canglan Art, right?

2781
01:41:45,130 --> 01:41:46,860
Thank you for supporting the Mantra of Cang Lan.

2782
01:41:47,530 --> 01:41:48,590
Next,

2783
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,160
we just announced

2784
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:52,530
we had a lucky book at first.

2785
01:41:52,530 --> 01:41:54,160
The lucky number has been announced.

2786
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:55,990
You can check the event page

2787
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,700
if you're the winner.

2788
01:41:57,860 --> 01:42:00,690
Remember to fill in the address in two days.

2789
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:03,200
and get one lucky gift box.

2790
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:06,490
And we've played it, right?

2791
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:07,400
We talked, played

2792
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:09,730
and I also admired your romantic relations in the drama.

2793
01:42:09,730 --> 01:42:11,460
But we have another session today.

2794
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:12,960
That is what I look forward to the most.

2795
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,390
Because many people think it's hard to give up on Cang Lan.

2796
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:17,460
because the roles don't have a complete ceremony

2797
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:18,760
in the drama,

2798
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:19,560
Right?

2799
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:21,460
Today,

2800
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:23,090
when the VIP

2801
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:25,100
of our special fan meeting is about to end,

2802
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:26,560
we're going to

2803
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,390
have our actors gather here

2804
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:29,400
with no regrets,

2805
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,330
and complete a ceremony together.

2806
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:33,800
The moon is full and the night is set.

2807
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:37,000
Staff, please give me a flower ring and a phoenix crown.

2808
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,490
Wow, what is this?

2809
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:46,760
Everyone, move to the right.

2810
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:48,760
OK? It's a bit off-stage.

2811
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:49,730
Take one each.

2812
01:42:49,730 --> 01:42:50,730
This is...

2813
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:54,330
Do you know what this is?

2814
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:55,390
You're familiar with that, right?

2815
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:58,260
It appeared in the last episode, right?

2816
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,500
One for each of you.

2817
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:06,760
One line in the drama says, you need to love the people as a whole,

2818
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:07,530
and also love one person for good.

2819
01:43:07,530 --> 01:43:09,730
I hope you can find the one you love.

2820
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:10,890
Later,

2821
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:12,590
Esther, wear it with a sense of ceremony.

2822
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:13,600
Is that OK?

2823
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,000
OK.

2824
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,560
You can help each other.

2825
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:19,090
Black Dragon wants to put it on Jieli, right?

2826
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:21,780
OK, next.

2827
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:21,780


2828
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:26,330
Let's finish the farewell ceremony

2829
01:43:26,330 --> 01:43:28,660
of Love Between Fairy and Devil.

2830
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:31,960
Love the world and love one person.

2831
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:34,760
Please wear the token of love.

2832
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,360
Phoenix crown with flowers.

2833
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:41,400
Let's draw a perfect end for Love Between Fairy and Devil.

2834
01:43:41,730 --> 01:43:43,260
Like a bird.

2835
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:46,330
How time flies.

2836
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:48,460
It's back to the segment we were waiting for.

2837
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:51,160
Let's sing songs a cappella, OK?

2838
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:54,700
Let's start with Esther and Dylan.

2839
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:55,960
Everyone sings a line.

2840
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:56,760
OK?

2841
01:43:57,460 --> 01:43:59,130
Which one do you want to sing?

2842
01:43:59,130 --> 01:44:00,560
We can sing together later.

2843
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,060
You can sing a line first.

2844
01:44:02,130 --> 01:44:03,290
You can sing anything.

2845
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:04,100
Memory Loss.

2846
01:44:04,330 --> 01:44:05,190
Can you sing?

2847
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,130
Okay, you sing first.

2848
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:08,330
Let's sing together. Okay.

2849
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:14,090
Your pitch is so high.

2850
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:15,200
You sing higher, and I lower.

2851
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,560
123

2852
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:22,180
♫ I stuck together with you in life and death ♫

2853
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:25,900
♫ I rivaled against the world to guard you ♫

2854
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:29,260
♫ If we would finally part ♫

2855
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:33,660
♫ I'd rather clear my memory ♫

2856
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:37,140
♫ And meet you again in the next life ♫

2857
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:40,980
♫ With a new identity ♫

2858
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:46,140
♫ To rewrite the ending that is to be continued ♫

2859
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,330
What are you singing with me?

2860
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:53,390
Take out my part.

2861
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:55,360
I'll sing another song with Lord Changheng.

2862
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,090
You can also sing a song with him.

2863
01:44:57,100 --> 01:44:58,730
After all, you mentioned Changheng first.

2864
01:44:58,730 --> 01:45:00,930
You have to sing a song. Linghe, you can't escape today.

2865
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:01,690
Okay.

2866
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:02,600
What do you want to sing?

2867
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,960
Why are you so excited?

2868
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:06,790
What can you sing?

2869
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,300
Farewell Love or Search for You?

2870
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:11,190
Farewell Love.

2871
01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:12,290
Farewell Love. OK.

2872
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:13,600
Come on, sing several lines a cappella.

2873
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:16,090
Do you remember the lyrics?

2874
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:16,900
Give me a key.

2875
01:45:18,130 --> 01:45:19,060
♫ Waiting for the moment when the sky collapses and the ground cracks ♫

2876
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:20,260
Oh no, I can't remember the lyrics.

2877
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:21,060
♫ Farewell Love ♫

2878
01:45:21,130 --> 01:45:23,660
Well...

2879
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:25,460
Can you do it?

2880
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:26,460
The key of Farewell Love is so high.

2881
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:27,330
I can't sing it well.

2882
01:45:27,930 --> 01:45:28,790
Just sing a Wiggles song.

2883
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,560
Linghe, I've relaxed the requirement for you.

2884
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,200
Do you have lyrics for him?

2885
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:35,560
We have the lyrics but no teleprompters.

2886
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,960
How about giving you the phone?

2887
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,760
Then sing a song you're good at.

2888
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:41,260
Just sing like two lines you're good at. There will be no copyright problems then.

2889
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:43,790
-How about the song Smoking Cessation? -Smoking Cessation!

2890
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:46,000
Some of us even don't know how to sing the ost.

2891
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:49,000
Any lyrics? Why don't we take some lyrics?

2892
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:50,760
Lord Changheng.

2893
01:45:52,730 --> 01:45:55,300
We'll meet Lord Changheng's requirements.

2894
01:45:55,340 --> 01:45:57,360
Search the lyrics of Farewell Love with your phone.

2895
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:58,890
Bring it in 30 seconds.

2896
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,530
Search the lyrics of Farewell Love.

2897
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,660
I'd like to say something in 30 seconds.

2898
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:04,890
And say something to our creators, OK?

2899
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:07,300
They are having fun again.

2900
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:08,760
Hurry up.

2901
01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:09,930
Search it.

2902
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,060
I just want to tell you

2903
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:13,330
what the fans asked me to deliver.

2904
01:46:13,330 --> 01:46:14,260
In this summertime,

2905
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:16,460
they saw the story of your summer.

2906
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,100
They were moved by it and really loved it.

2907
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:20,800
-And they will keep...-So he is not going to sing? -They go catch the phone.

2908
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,960
I was making up for it.

2909
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:22,560
Sorry.

2910
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,660
He will sing it. They really like you guys.

2911
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:25,690
And they hope

2912
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:27,130
every character in the parallel universe

2913
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:28,990
could live a happy life.

2914
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,860
And they will always support you in the future.

2915
01:46:30,860 --> 01:46:32,160
Of course, as Esther said today,

2916
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:34,390
if they have a chance

2917
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:35,160
to cooperate again,

2918
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:37,960
we'll look forward to it the most, right?

2919
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:38,760
-Yes. -But at the same time,

2920
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:41,290
they will be with you

2921
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:42,530
in your future works

2922
01:46:42,530 --> 01:46:44,160
and spend the next summer together.

2923
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:46,590
Okay, let's applaud for our leading actors.

2924
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:47,600
Have you searched it?

2925
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:50,460
Let's begin.

2926
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:52,290
I still have to sing?

2927
01:46:52,330 --> 01:46:54,390
Of course.

2928
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,300
You can't escape

2929
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:01,530
Will we sing together or just two of us?

2930
01:47:01,530 --> 01:47:03,760
Let's sing together.

2931
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:04,730
I'll join in the chorus.

2932
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:06,020
♫ Waiting for the moment when the sky collapses and the ground cracks ♫

2933
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:09,740
♫ When it collapses and shatters, open your eyes ♫

2934
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:15,380
♫ There is nowhere to put the soul but only to land ♫

2935
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:19,980
♫ If our souls get to know each other in the world ♫

2936
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:23,500
♫ Watching the vows come and go ♫

2937
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:27,420
♫ I can't bear the world without you ♫

2938
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:29,360
OK, I think we can stop here.

2939
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:33,660
We can feel it.

2940
01:47:33,660 --> 01:47:35,260
Because there's another song for Linghe.

2941
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:36,760
Not bad.

2942
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:39,360
I really left you a song.

2943
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:39,930
Ok?

2944
01:47:39,930 --> 01:47:41,060
Wait, sis.

2945
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:43,590
But I didn't hear him sing the chorus.

2946
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:44,500
Just sing two words.

2947
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,130
It's OK.

2948
01:47:46,130 --> 01:47:48,390
You didn't sing the most important part.

2949
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:50,190
Just sing farewell...

2950
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:51,560
Farewell love.

2951
01:47:52,930 --> 01:47:54,090
Nice.

2952
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:56,060
It's so good.

2953
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:00,790
It's good.

2954
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:01,660
Yes.

2955
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:03,260
OK, next,

2956
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:05,690
we're going to say goodbye

2957
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:07,060
at the end of this summer.

2958
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:07,760
But everyone,

2959
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:09,490
they asked me to ask you

2960
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:11,600
when did you think you were going to say goodbye to your character.

2961
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:12,760
I don't want to ask this question.

2962
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:15,160
Let's take today as a small farewell point.

2963
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:17,260
Everyone

2964
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:18,330
say something to your own character

2965
01:48:18,330 --> 01:48:20,290
or my partner,

2966
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:22,130
and say something to our audience, OK?

2967
01:48:22,130 --> 01:48:23,890
Esther, you go first.

2968
01:48:23,890 --> 01:48:23,890


2969
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:26,650
-It's... -This part...

2970
01:48:27,050 --> 01:48:27,350
Come back.

2971
01:48:27,350 --> 01:48:29,980
I wasn't ready just now. I'm so happy tonight.

2972
01:48:32,890 --> 01:48:34,550
Do I have to say goodbye?

2973
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:35,450
It's up to you.

2974
01:48:35,450 --> 01:48:36,980
You can express your feelings to Orchid,

2975
01:48:36,990 --> 01:48:39,390
Dongfang Qingcang or yourself.

2976
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:41,950
Or what you want to say to Love Between Fairy and Devil.

2977
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:43,480
I've always wanted to say

2978
01:48:43,490 --> 01:48:48,020
I'd never say goodbye to any of you guys or this serial.

2979
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:51,890
OK, Dylan.

2980
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:54,450
Although this serial is finished,

2981
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:57,450
it's not a goodbye.

2982
01:48:57,620 --> 01:49:00,980
I hope in your future life,

2983
01:49:00,990 --> 01:49:03,550
if you are in a bad mood or if you need company,

2984
01:49:03,550 --> 01:49:07,550
you could click IQIYI to see Love Between Fairy and Devil.

2985
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:10,950
and let Love Between Fairy and Devil be with you forever, thank you.

2986
01:49:11,050 --> 01:49:12,620
Okay, Ling He.

2987
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:16,380
Neither Dylan nor Esther said goodbye.

2988
01:49:16,390 --> 01:49:17,750
Let me say something.

2989
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:19,650
Although Love Between Fairy and Devil is over,

2990
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:21,880
we'll meet again.

2991
01:49:23,590 --> 01:49:25,190
Hai Qiao.

2992
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:26,780
I think...

2993
01:49:27,890 --> 01:49:31,150
I thought of a farewell speech,

2994
01:49:31,150 --> 01:49:32,620
but what they said are pretty good.

2995
01:49:32,620 --> 01:49:34,480
I think I should follow what they said.

2996
01:49:34,820 --> 01:49:35,850
If

2997
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:39,350
any one of us is needed,

2998
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:40,880
we'll always be online.

2999
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:42,680
OK, Charles.

3000
01:49:45,050 --> 01:49:45,750
I think...

3001
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:47,280
you have to cry.

3002
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:50,220
I'll give you the emotional part.

3003
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:51,260
You need to cry.

3004
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:52,880
You can flick that leaf a little.

3005
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:55,390
You need to cry.

3006
01:49:55,950 --> 01:49:59,680
OK, I think in Love Between Fairy and Devil.

3007
01:49:59,990 --> 01:50:01,620
I'm glad that...

3008
01:50:01,990 --> 01:50:03,020
I'm glad to meet you all.

3009
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:04,480
I hope

3010
01:50:04,490 --> 01:50:07,020
Love Between Fairy and Devil can live

3011
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:08,020
in your memory.

3012
01:50:08,350 --> 01:50:11,250
When you are in a bad mood,

3013
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:13,150
you can watch

3014
01:50:13,650 --> 01:50:16,380
some funny clips in Love Between Fairy and Devil.

3015
01:50:16,750 --> 01:50:18,420
I heard many netizens say

3016
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:21,930
they will watch Love Between Fairy and Devil again during the winter vacation.

3017
01:50:21,930 --> 01:50:25,020
That means a lot of people will watch Love Between Fairy and Devil during winter vacation.

3018
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:28,480
I hope this will come true. Thank you.

3019
01:50:28,620 --> 01:50:29,680
Okay, Xiaoxiao.

3020
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:35,240
During the filming of Love Between Fairy and Devil,

3021
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:37,350
and after that,

3022
01:50:37,350 --> 01:50:38,150
I think

3023
01:50:38,150 --> 01:50:40,420
there are a lot of memories.

3024
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:43,750
When I turn on my phone,

3025
01:50:43,750 --> 01:50:46,150
all the details come to my mind.

3026
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:49,350
I'll use a line in the play.

3027
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:50,200
What?

3028
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:52,420
Black Dragon, forget me.

3029
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:57,590
Okay, Cheng Zi.

3030
01:50:59,990 --> 01:51:03,290
I'm very happy to meet you as Dieyi.

3031
01:51:03,290 --> 01:51:04,450
I won't say goodbye, either.

3032
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:06,580
I hope Dieyi can become...

3033
01:51:07,150 --> 01:51:09,020
A what?

3034
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:11,950
...a symbol of love and stay with you.

3035
01:51:12,090 --> 01:51:13,090
Okay, Xiao Ting.

3036
01:51:13,820 --> 01:51:15,680
I feel very happy

3037
01:51:15,690 --> 01:51:17,820
Love Between Fairy and Devil can meet

3038
01:51:17,890 --> 01:51:21,420
all the fans.

3039
01:51:21,450 --> 01:51:24,020
I also hope

3040
01:51:24,050 --> 01:51:25,820
in every sad moment,

3041
01:51:25,890 --> 01:51:27,150
when you need us,

3042
01:51:27,150 --> 01:51:29,480
you'll be accompanied by Love Between Fairy and Devil.

3043
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:31,350
Okay, Chen Xiao.

3044
01:51:31,890 --> 01:51:33,620
I want to thank

3045
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:36,250
this drama for letting me meet everyone on

3046
01:51:36,250 --> 01:51:37,980
and off stage.

3047
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:40,780
It's glad to have this chance to gather together.

3048
01:51:40,790 --> 01:51:42,290
And thank

3049
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:43,750

3050
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:45,050
for bringing us such wonderful memories.

3051
01:51:45,050 --> 01:51:49,050
I hope we can have

3052
01:51:49,590 --> 01:51:53,420
another chance to work together.

3053
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:57,420
I also want to tell Xunfeng that in Cangyan Sea,

3054
01:51:57,950 --> 01:51:59,980
you will be the one as you wish.

3055
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:03,650
OK. I'll say something on behalf of

3056
01:52:03,650 --> 01:52:04,650
the fans.

3057
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:07,580
Fans like you and Love Between Fairy and Devil.

They love every memory in Love Between Fairy and Devil.

3063
01:52:16,890 --> 01:52:19,050
Next is our last part of today.

3064
01:52:19,050 --> 01:52:22,450
Let's sing "Find You" together.

3065
01:52:23,390 --> 01:52:26,350
Give me my phone. I'll take a photo.

3066
01:52:26,350 --> 01:52:27,380
Sure.

3067
01:52:29,010 --> 01:52:30,450
Thank all the actors,

3068
01:52:30,450 --> 01:52:31,220

for bring us such a good work in this summer.

3070
01:52:33,410 --> 01:52:36,490
An exclusive fan meeting for the VIP of Love Between Fairy and Devil

3071
01:52:36,590 --> 01:52:37,990
is coming to an end.

3072
01:52:37,990 --> 01:52:39,990
I hope iQIYI can present more

3073
01:52:39,990 --> 01:52:42,750
and better works in the future.

3074
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:45,150
The leading actors will also meet you

in different works on iQIYI.

3076
01:52:54,420 --> 01:52:56,420
Can you pull it to the front?

3077
01:52:56,650 --> 01:52:57,650
I'll take a photo for you.

3078
01:52:57,690 --> 01:52:58,820
Who has the hands long enough?

3079
01:52:58,820 --> 01:52:59,620
Who has the hands long enough?

3080
01:52:59,690 --> 01:53:00,950
I'll help...

3081
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:02,450
Use a stand, okay?

3082
01:53:03,820 --> 01:53:05,080
OK. Take a photo for us.

3083
01:53:05,090 --> 01:53:05,650
Thank you, OK.

3084
01:53:05,650 --> 01:53:07,620
You're using the rear camera?

3085
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:07,620


3086
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:08,920
OK.

3087
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:10,710
Do you have lyrics?

3088
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:11,780
Look at me.

3089
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:14,280
This is a video. We can shoot the MV together.
