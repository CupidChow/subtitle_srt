After the Flower of Osmanthu , the European color makeup brand represented by Fu Boya,

192
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,180
entered the domestic market,

193
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,240
it's very popular.

194
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,350
According to the media,

195
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,470
it will impact our sales.

196
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,320
[Congratulation]

197
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,510
Boss,

198
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,680
did you have other people's soul?

199
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,350
What are you talking about?

200
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,140
But I haven't seen you having a strange smile like this

201
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,020
for years.

202
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,020
It's so strange that my heart aches.

203
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,700
Do you want to deduct your salary for the second half of the year?

204
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,430
and let your heart suffer more?

205
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,230
Boss,

206
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,740
If you deduct my salary for the second half of the year,

207
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,600
I can only live in your house and you need to support me.

208
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,630
My house? No.

209
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,890
You're overreacting.

210
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,610
You indeed hid a beauty in your house. You look so happy.

211
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,120
If you have so much free time,

212
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,830
why don't you clean the meeting room?

213
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,170
I want to continue my research on the product line.

214
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,300
Don't waste my time.

215
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,370
Boss,

216
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,470
do you want me to clean the bedroom for you at the House of Gu?

217
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,180
Here's the chicken soup.

218
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,020
It's ready?

219
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:48,940
How is it?

220
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,600
It smells good.

221
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,120
I trust

222
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,750
your cooking skills.

223
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:57,730
But...

224
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
What about that?

225
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,370
Here.

226
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,060
I specially asked the people from my hometown.

227
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,390
It's ginseng and deer antler tonic wine.

228
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,740
Our people said

229
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,040
as long as drinking a small bottle,

230
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,100
the young people

231
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,790
will become passionate.

232
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,650
Just now,

233
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,950
I found a pillow and a quilt

234
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,140
on the sofa in their room.

235
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,800
Xicheng

236
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,830
has been tough since childhood.

237
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,940
I'm sure he won't take the initiative.

238
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,660
Yes.

239
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,220
With this magic weapon,

240
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,940
I just wait to have my great grandson.

241
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,050
Hurry.

242
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,160
Hurry up.

243
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,040
More.

244
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,060
More.

245
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,490
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is busy.

246
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,020
Please try again later.

247
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,020
He Jinxi.

248
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,900
Where did you take mom?

249
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:16,660
Xixi.

250
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,090
Grandma.

251
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,420
Xicheng went to work.

252
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,680
I'm here to see

253
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,270
if you are used to living there.

254
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,280
Grandma, I'm used to it.

255
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,950
I lived well.

256
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,340
I'm relieved if you live well.

257
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,190
Here.

258
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,540
Mei and I

259
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,380
specially made ginseng and black chicken soup

260
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,300
for you two.

261
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,400
When Xicheng comes back,

262
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,090
you two have a drink.

263
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,670
No need.

264
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,190
No.

265
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,250
Xicheng has been working hard recently.

266
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,090
He also worries about your marriage.

267
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,130
I consider you.

268
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,370
All right.

269
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,780
I'll drink with him when he comes back.

270
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,380
Good girl.

271
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,390
Let's go.

272
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,900
The compression design of the flower box is simple,

273
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,210
magnificent and plain without wrinkles.

274
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,420
The lines are neat.

275
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,660
The package of the flower box combines with

276
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,310
[When will you come back?]

277
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,000
the popular Macaron color.

278
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,740
If you don't come back in ten minutes,

279
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,330
[If you don't come back in ten minutes, I'll eat all of you dinner, leaving nothing for you.]

280
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,380
I'll eat all of your dinner,

281
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,140
leaving nothing for you.

282
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,370
It is deeply loved by young female users.

283
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,530
Let's call it a day.

284
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,580
Everything tastes good when you're hungry.

285
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,630
It's so hot.

286
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,270
Grandma.

287
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,410
You're back, Xicheng.

288
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,830
How's the company today?

289
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,830
Not bad, Grandma.

290
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,770
I'll report to you about the company another day.

291
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,170
I'm going back to my room.

292
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,420
What happened?

293
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,740
Gu Xicheng.

294
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,410
Have you eaten?

295
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,560
I was too busy today.

296
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,240
I even didn't have time to attend the meeting.

297
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,210
Mr. Gu,

298
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,520
I find you are very handsome

299
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,620
today.

300
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,220
You...

301
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,220
What are you doing?

302
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,360
Nothing.

303
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,060
I just...

304
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,100
I found

305
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,490
it's so hot.

306
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,500
It's hot.

307
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,290
It's so cool.

308
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,910
Did you eat something wrong?

309
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,260
I ate Grandma's soup.

310
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,320
It's so hot.

311
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,620
It's still hot. I want to take it off.

312
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,650
Take off my clothes.

313
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,050
Gu Xicheng.

314
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,980
Aren't you hot? Let me help you.

315
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,660
No, no.

316
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,610
Don't.

317
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,580
Let me do it.

318
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,060
Let go!

319
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,110
Xicheng, have you finished your dinner?

320
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,060
I'll come in and collect the bowls for you.

321
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,630
It's okay. We'll deliver them later.

322
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,540
Okay.

323
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,130
Boss,

324
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,280
you look different today.

325
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:00,780
Go away.

326
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,260
Okay.

327
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:01,900
Come back.

328
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,220
Do we have flash mob

329
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,380
near the company today?

330
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,500
Yes, there are two.

331
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,370
Are you going to invite

332
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,780
your fiancee, my sister-in-law,

333
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,020
the landlady?

334
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,420
Situ Shuo,

335
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,440
I think your annual salary will be deducted.

336
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,490
Whatever. When it's all deducted,

337
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,370
I'll ask help for the landlady.

338
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,800
Why do you look like

339
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,790
as if you were beaten?

340
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,420
Thank goodness.

341
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,000
It's so scared.

342
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,250
It seems that I can't drink chicken soup casually.

343
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,260
The chicken soup is "poisonous".

344
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,900
Gu Xicheng.

345
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,530
Hello, what's up?

346
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,600
There's a brand flash mob near the company today.

347
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Do you want to come over and observe?

348
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,820
I can go, too?

349
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,820
Don't embarrass the brand.

350
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:10,580
Yes, sir.

00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,850
[Classic]

354
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,670
Hello, I'm an online broadcaster.

355
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,220
I have my own idea

356
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,550
about this model's makeup.

357
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,090
I want to communicate with you.

358
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,220
What do you think?

359
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,550
Why are you here?

360
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,040
Mickey.

361
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,490
I'm here to learn.

362
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,810
I was about to tell the dresser.

363
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,500
Because I don't think

364
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,350
this makeup highlights

365
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,810
the characteristics of Huayan's new product.

366
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,750
Although you've signed a contract with Huayan,

367
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,760
we hired

368
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,580
the most professional dresser.

369
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,510
I don't think you can do better.

370
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,330
I'm not questioning the professional quality of the dresser.

371
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,330
It's just that...

372
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,890
if I'm not straightforward enough,

373
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,180
I can change the makeup for the model

374
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,700
so that we can see it more clearly.

375
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,580
No need. Don't waste our time.

376
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,610
Let her change.

377
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,180
Mr. Gu.

378
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,020
Why are you here?

379
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,910
I have a meeting here.

380
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,010
So I stopped by.

381
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,190
I'm curious about what you think.

382
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,720
Mr. Gu, media are here.

383
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,280
If she can't change it well,

384
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,940
it will affect the publicity.

385
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,710
Are you confident?

386
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:58,770
Yes.

387
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,090
This is beautiful. So beautiful.

388
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,180
Huayan has been dedicated to conveying oriental aesthetics.

389
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,990
Its texture and color

390
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,280
are more suitable for Asian women than European and American brands.

391
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,190
The new series is called Shangsi.

392
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,940
So I changed the makeup into more classic style.

393
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,250
At the same time, it suits modern people's aesthetics.

394
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,890
Really.

395
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:54,370
Yes.

396
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:55,990
Mr. Gu.

397
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,830
Editor Chen is here.

398
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,740
I've heard that

399
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,580
your new product is unique.

400
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,850
I didn't expect the actual effect

401
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,650
is more shocking than I thought.

402
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,340
I've decided.

403
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,500
The content of the headline in fashion this period

404
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,830
will be your new series.

405
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,320
It's our honor.

406
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,020
I have another request.

407
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,710
Can we upload her internet ID

408
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,210
on the content?

409
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,290
Of course. That's what we should do.

410
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,040
Besides, how can I miss

411
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,520
such an excellent design.

412
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,270
Hello. Nice to meet you.

413
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:26,770
Hello.

414
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,130
By the way, we invited

415
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,340
master Huangshanyue to attend the interview.

416
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,880
Mr. Gu, do you want to consider

417
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,810
our invitation?

418
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,260
If we can invite you,

419
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,460
this episode will be more exciting.

420
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,010
Master Huangshanyue?

421
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,699
What's wrong?

422
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,770
Huangshnayue is my idol.

423
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,300
So when I heard him,

424
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,980
I was a little excited.

425
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,670
By the way, editor Chen,

426
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:59,050
you know the exclusive interview is always handled by the specific person.

427
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,510
Mr. Gu doesn't accept the exclusive interview.

428
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,110
Of course.

429
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,220
If Mr. Gu

430
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,420
needs an exclusive interview,

431
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,880
please consider me first.

432
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,450
Thank you.

433
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,520
You're welcome.

434
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,110
Jinxi.

435
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,530
Mr. Fu, why are you here?

436
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,230
Have you forgotten that I'm also a beauty makeup worker?

437
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,460
Huayan has an offline activity.

438
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,790
Of course I have to come.

439
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,580
By the way, I have something to tell you.

440
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:49,120
It's about the Flower of Osmanthus.

441
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,630
Have you made up your mind?

442
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,520
Here's the thing.

443
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,520
I've signed a contract with Huayan.

444
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,400
According to the company rules,

445
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,660
I can't accept other brands' promotion.

446
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:02,680
Sorry.

447
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,300
I understand.

448
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,140
You don't have to apologize.

449
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,100
I couldn't help much.

450
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,580
I'm sorry.

451
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,760
If you really think so,

452
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,620
how about this?

453
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,540
How about we sign the contract

454
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,540
after your contract with Huayan ends?

455
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,270
Don't worry.

456
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,200
The price I offer will definitely be higher than that of Gu Xicheng.

457
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,250
What's wrong?

458
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:33,900
He Jinxi.
