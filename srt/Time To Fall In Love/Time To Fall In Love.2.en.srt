But I didn't.

163
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,900
It's not written in the contract that I need to live with you.

164
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,400
But the contract clearly states that

165
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,250
due to inevitable circumstances,

166
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,720
if Party A raises any unexpected conditions,

167
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,650
Party B is obligated to cooperate unconditionally.

168
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,100

170
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,200
Don't worry. After you move in,

171
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,100
I will keep my distance with you.

172
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,780
You can treat me as your working partner.

173

We can cooperate with each other.

174
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,640
When Grandma gets better,

175
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,180
you can get what you want

176
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,660
and leave safely.

177
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,420
What?

178
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,060
So you signed a contract with Gu Xicheng?

179
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,620
You're his fiancée now.

180
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,460
And you have to move to his house now.

181
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,820
Keep your voice down. The walls have ears.

182
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,340
But if you move in,

183
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,340
I'm afraid it's inappropriate

184
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,250
for you two being in a room alone.

185
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,380
No.

186
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,100
Although we don't harm people,

187
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,760
we must be cautious of others.

188
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,060
I have to prepare something good for you.

189
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,970
Wait.

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,820
Stun gun.

191
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,380
Pepper spray.

192
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,300
Glare flashlight.

193
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,180
Self-defense alarm.

194
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,420
With these things,

195
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,720
even if Gu Xicheng wants to do something to you,

196
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
these can at least buy you some time.

197
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,000
Where did you get these?

198
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,210
As a fairy designated driver,

199
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,410
I have to protect myself all the time.

200
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,420
I have to work now.

201
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,900
You must take these things.

202
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,200
I'm leaving.

203
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,330
Bye.

204
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,210
This...

205
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,850
An'an is exaggerating.

206
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,220
I don't think I'll need them.

207
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,500
No matter what happens, and no matter where I go,

208
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,930
I'm glad you're always here with me.

209
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:40,890
Hello.

210
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,940
Mom and I are going abroad.

211
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,680
Going abroad?

212
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,420
You didn't even discuss it with me.

213
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,460
No, I disagree.

214
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,550
The medical conditions abroad are better.

215
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,630
Don't worry. I'll take good care of her.

216
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,760
You just need to follow the contract. A few months later,

217
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,410
you'll be reunited with Mom.

218
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,940
You can't take Mom abroad.

219
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,089
Hello? Hello?

220
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,839
To the airport.

221
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,000
Sir, can you drive faster please?

222
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,860
Miss, wake up.

223
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,330
Miss, are you alright?

224
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,180
Don't be afraid. I'll take you to the hospital.

225
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,300
We'll conduct a detailed analysis

226
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,940
on the terms you proposed,

227
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,260
and the price our company offered

228
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,980
can't be changed at all.

229
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:57,980
Boss.

230
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,980
We will consider it carefully.

231
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,290
Looking forward to meeting you, Mr. Gu.

232
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,340
I'm looking forward to meeting you.

233
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,420
This means

234
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,940
he won't be insisting on wanting the price change?

235
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,940
Do you think they can afford to do so?

236
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,540
Yeah! This is great! With this German order,

237
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,940
the sales of Huayan will be increased by double this year.

238
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,740
Boss, you're amazing.

239
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,610
Come on.

240
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,300
It's not the time to celebrate yet.

241
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,470
Let's drink and enjoy ourselves.

242
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,790
[An unknown caller]

243
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,580
Hello.

244
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,300
Municipal Hospital.

245
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,580
Mr. Fu Boya,

246
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,740
we have checked

247
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,880
this lady carefully.

248
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,720
It's just a minor collision which

249
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,120
caused an overreaction.

250
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,100
No other parts were hurt.

251
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,180
Fu Boya.

252
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,500
What a coincidence.

253
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,700
She is ready to be discharged.

254
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,980
Will he recognize me?

255
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,180
Thank you, doctor.

256
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,220
You're welcome.

257
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,180
You're awake, Miss He.

258
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,150
Are you alright?

259
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,590
Are you feeling unwell?

260
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,440
Miss He?

261
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,190
My name is Fu Boya.

262
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,000
The hospital said they need to contact your family.

263
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,050
So in a hurry,

264
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,500
I took your ID card from your bag.

265
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,740
I'm sorry for going through your stuff without your permission.

266
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,710
It's okay. I should thank you.

267
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,460
You’re welcome.

268
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,980
Miss He,

269
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,280
don't worry.

270
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,120
It's my full responsibility for this accident.

271
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,650
I'll be responsible to you.

272
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,500
Su Yanxi, what's wrong with you?

273
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,860
He Jinxi!

274
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,620
You scared me to death when I called you.

275
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,580
The hospital answered your phone.

276
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,700
Are you feeling unwell?

277
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,780
I'm fine.

278
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,700
This is Mr. Fu Boya.

279
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,370
Hello.

280
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,820
The doctor said I'm fine.

281
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,780
Please take me home at once.

282
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,210
Let's go now. I'll get your stuff.

283
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,470
Let me help you, Miss He.

284
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,100
It's okay. You're so nice.

285
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,760
Let me see you off then.

286
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,290
[Reception desk]

287
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,660
Boss, is that your...

288
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,180
Shut up!

289
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,780
Be careful.

290
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,520
Thank you.

291
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,590
What happened?

292
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,310
Why are you here?

293
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,700
Mr. Gu.

294
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,640
What a coincidence.

295
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,340
You know each other?

296
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,310
Fu Boya, why are you here?

297
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,940
I caused Miss He’s car accident.

298
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,460
So it's my duty

299
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,000
to look after her here.

300
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,670
Don't worry about

301
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,190
my girlfriend.

302
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,260
As for the follow-on work of the accident,

303
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:17,700
Situ,

304
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,220
prepare the lawyer's letter tomorrow morning.

305
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,550
It will be delivered on time, guaranteed.

306
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,340
She's your girlfriend?

307
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:26,830
Let's go.

308
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,650
I haven't finished talking yet.

309
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,420
An'an.

310
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,540
Fu...

311
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,460
Miss He, if you don't want to go with him,

312
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,850
I won’t let anyone take you away.

313
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,860
Fu Boya.

314
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,790
She is my girlfriend.

315
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,050
This is my personal affair.

316
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,220
Calm down, you two.

317
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,530
I'll go back with you.

318
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,070
Mr. Fu, thank you.

319
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,880
Xixi.

320
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,220
Xixi.

321
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,580
Where are you going?

322
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,830
Xixi.

323
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,340
Of course they're going home.

324
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,300
Why are you meddling in their relationship?

325
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,060
Who are you?

326
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,180
Who am I?

327
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,390
I'm Xixi's best friend.

328
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,940
You look so green. Who do you think you are? A green onion?

329
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,800
Green onion? I'm a green onion?

330
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,130
You...

331
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,180
You are crazy.

332
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,110
How dare you call me crazy?

333
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,060
I think you have some sort of serious illness.

334
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,370
Why are you stopping me?

335
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,940
You're so annoying.

336
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,860
Go away!

337
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,450
Xixi.

338
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,420
Crazy woman.

339
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,300
Can you drive slower?

340
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,630
I just had an accident. I have a headache.

341
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,950
What are you doing?

342
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,130
See if you've lost your mind.

343
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,490
You're the fool.

344
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,380
I was just hit a bit.

345
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,840
I didn't get a concussion.

346
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,480
I'm have a clear mind now.

347
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,220
You look so energetic. Good.

348
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,620
Let's go to your apartment and get your luggage.

349
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,740
Why are you going to my apartment? Why are we getting my luggage?

350
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,500
Did you forget about the promise because of the accident?

351
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,030
You promised my grandma that you'll move into my house tonight.

352
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,260
That's too fast.

353
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,500
Give me some time to prepare.

354
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,550
You don't need to prepare anything.

355
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,240
Just come to me.

356
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,300
I mean,

357
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,660
you move into my house and live close to me.

358
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,630
Don't go out alone at night again.

359
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,150
You also can't meet someone you don't know.

360
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,450
Why?

361
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,100
Because you are my girlfriend.

362
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,770
It's just a contract, okay?

363
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,820
That's all for now.

364
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,000
I'll fetch your luggage with you now.

365
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,390
Got it, Mr. Gu.

366
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,730
My dear car.

367
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,520
It's all my fault. I drank two glasses of champagne.

368
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,120
If it's not because I feel bad to leave you here alone,

369
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,780
I'll take a taxi home already.

370
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,630
Look at you.

371
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,130
Sorry, sir, I'm late.

372
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,670
Hello, I am the designated driver, Miss Ma. I'm glad to serve you.

373
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,740
-It's you! -It's you!

374
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,550
I didn't expect you to be a designated driver.

375
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,040
Cancel the order immediately.

376
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,340
You want me to cancel it? Why? I won't.

377
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,540
You won't?

378
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,470
Give me your phone.

379
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,540
Give it to me.

380
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:31,980
Stop grabbing!

381
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,340
Give it to me. Give me the phone, you hear me?

382
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:33,860
Stop grabbing!

383
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,590
Give me the phone. Give it to me.

384
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,020
Don't think I can't reach you.

385
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,060
Give it to me.

386
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,480
Oh no, my hands are dirty.

387
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,190
Bastard, if I don't kill you today,

388
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,940
how am I going to continue to walk the streets?

389
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,980
I'll kill you, you bastard!

390
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,940
I'll kill you, you bastard!

391
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,740
I'll kill you!

392
00:26:58,810 --> 00:26:59,180
I'll kill you!

393
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,840
Be careful.

394
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,920
[Miss Ma, designated driver]

395
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,410
My head.

396
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,220
Ouch!

397
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,410
It hurts.

398
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,900
A wig?

399
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,420
Yours?

400
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,780
How dare you touch my hair?

401
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,220
I...

402
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,300
I saved you just now.

403
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,740
Besides,

404
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,870
I have nothing to do with your bald head.

405
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,220
Who is bald?

406
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,060
Don't hit me!

407
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,180
You are bald! Your whole family is bald!

408
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,090
I'm bald? You're bald!

409
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,740
You're the bald one.

410
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,740
Baldy!

411
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,060
Your order is confirmed.

412
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,130
Fine, let's wait and see.

413
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,720
If you dare to slack off,

414
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,490
I'll make a complaint.

415
00:28:59,380 --> 00:28:59,940
I...

416
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,530
I'm a girl, so I have a lot of stuff.

417
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,320
I...

418
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,940
You were so arrogant just now.

419
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,400
But you have to serve me now.

420
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,880
You did it on purpose, right?

421
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,450
I didn't mean it.

422
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,000
That's because you didn't wear your seat belt.

423
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,020
There are thousands of rules while taking transportation. Safety is the first rule.

424
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,180
You did it on purpose. I will make a complaint.

425
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,150
How dare you!

426
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,610
See if I dare.

427
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,740
What are you doing?

428
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,260
What are you doing?

429
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,320
Give me your phone.

430
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,060
You snatched my phone! Are you crazy?

431
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,620
I'll kill you if you give me a negative comment.

432
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,260
Give me your phone.

433
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,420
I'll give you a negative comment.

434
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,410
Give me your phone.

435
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,180
No.

436
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,700
Oh my god.

437
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,220
Young people nowadays are so open.

438
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,150
I'll give you a negative comment today.

439
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,150
Your evaluation has been effective.

440
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,060
This service is rated as poor.

441
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,760
Bastard!

442
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,910
You want to leave after kicking me?

443
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,880
I've drunk alcohol. How can I go back?

444
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,650
You can go home in any way you like.

445
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,280
I've been putting up with you all night.

446
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,010
Due to you...

447
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,700
your negative comment, all my efforts are in vain.

448
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,100
I can't stand it anymore.

449
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,990
You can't leave.

450
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,220
The negative comment is because you tried to grab my phone.

451
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,620
Besides, you have to be responsible for me.

452
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,390
Me? For you?

453
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,460
Shameless! Go away!

454
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,660
You don't want to be responsible? Fine.

455
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,070
Let's have a competition.

456
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,160
If you lose the game, call me dad ten times.

457
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,220
If I lose, I'll call you dad ten times.

458
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,980
Boring. I don't have time to play with you.

459
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,050
No. Fine. Pay me back.

460
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,370
You want me to compensate you?

461
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,920
Are you kidding me?

462
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:53,990
Fine, tell me.

463
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,970
What's the competition?

464
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,400
Whatever. You'll lose anyway.

465
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,720
Okay.

466
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,260
Just wait to call me dad.

467
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,740
Good boy.

468
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,660
Just one room?

469
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,360
Do you sleep in two bedrooms

470
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,620
in your own apartment?

471
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,870
I don't have two bedrooms.

472
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:40,460
But

473
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,800
shouldn't you arrange two beds?

474
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,630
Two beds?

475
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,960
Don't come near me.

476
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,160
We agreed not to interfere with each other.

477
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,920
You sleep on the sofa and I sleep on the bed.

478
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,670
Why?

479
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,830
Because I'm the Party A.

480
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,510
You're not a gentleman at all.

481
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,120
Shouldn't lady be the priority?

482
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,850
No.

483
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:11,940
Why?

484
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,640
You want to sleep on the bed? Okay.

485
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,770
Return the deposit,

486
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,030
and we'll sign the contract in reverse.

487
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,020
You know it's impossible.

488
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,000
This is bullying.

489
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,570
The sofa is too small for me to sleep.

490
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,480
So you have to sleep on it for a few days.

491
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,810
I'll find a way to get you a mattress later.

492
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,710
[Pepper Spray]

493
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,680
Pepper spray.

494
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,000
What is this?

495
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,310
Why is this here?

496
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,420
All right, unpack your luggage first.

497
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,070
I'll take a shower.

498
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:26,699
By the way,

499
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,949
don't touch anything.

500
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:30,389
Especially the cabinet.

501
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,130
Got it.

502
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,510
He Jinxi.

503
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,010
Why did you turn off the light?

504
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,470
Sorry.

505
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,760
I didn't mean it. Let me turn it on for you.

506
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:37,900
I'm...

507
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,980
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

508
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,890
I didn't see anything.

509
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,160
Light.

510
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,880
Yes, the light.

511
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:48,480
Light.

512
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,630
Have you seen enough?

513
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,310
Yes.

514
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,540
No.
