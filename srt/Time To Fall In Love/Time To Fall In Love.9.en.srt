00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,490
I just used it.

5
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:46,940
Xicheng.

6
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,440
Why are you still here?

7
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,100
I just joined Huayan.

8
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,420
I want to use the least amount of time

9
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,220
to learn more about the company.

10
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,780
It's also to prepare myself

11
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,960
for the future R&D of the company.

12
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,360
She is the organizer of the charity banquet, right?

13
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,940
Why is she here?

14
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,020
So Xicheng hasn't introduced me to you.

15
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,180
Xicheng and I are very good

16
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,660
old friends.

17
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,010
It's her first day here at Huayan. I have yet to...

18
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,450
Mr. Gu,

19
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,490
I have a very important R&D question

20
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,260
to ask you.

21
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,460
Can I come back after you're done eating?

22
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,180
Here.

23
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,020
Mr. Gu,

24
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,820
I...

25
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,670
I can't eat anymore.

26
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,010
You can enjoy them.

27
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,620
Xixi!

28
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,380
He didn't call

29
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,579
and explain.

30
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,780
He just ignored my feelings.

31
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,520
What good old friends who haven't met for years?

32
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,500
There must be something between them.

33
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,060
An'an still said

34
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,540
he likes me.

35
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,620
Hello, your meal here.

36
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,860
Thank you.

37
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,440
Be careful.

38
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,620
Xixi?

39
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,100
Fu Boya?

40
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,880
You're eating these at night?

41
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,050
Initially, I had something better,

42
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,540
but...

43
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,460
I don't feel like eating it anymore.

44
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,350
That can't work.

45
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,740
We should eat something delicious.

46
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,280
My treat.

47
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,130
Steak

48
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,060
or pasta?

49
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,940
No thanks.

50
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,170
I'm good with the bread.

51
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,090
Xixi,

52
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,150
how have you been

53
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,400
living with the Gu family?

54
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,800
Are you talking about me pretending to be my sister?

55
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,900
Grandma and Aunt Mei are nice to me.

56
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,860
As for Gu Xicheng,

57
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,700
I just make do with it.

58
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,140
Don't worry about me.

59
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,900
I'm just staying with them for a while.

60
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,600
When Grandma gets better,

61
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,660
I will end the cooperation with Gu Xicheng.

62
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,660
Really?

63
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,260
As long as his grandma is healthy,

64
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,190
you can leave the Gu family safely?

65
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,540
Xixi.

66
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,810
I don't know

67
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,580
what's going on between you and Gu Xicheng.

68
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,870
But I'll say the same thing.

69
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,380
I hope you know

70
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,390
I've always been caring about you.

71
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,980
You can come to me if you need any help.

72
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,300
For example, at the auction last time,

73
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,580
if you want to get the necklace back,

74
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,840
you can also come to me.

75
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,140
In this world,

76
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,180
not only Gu Xicheng can help you,

77
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,460
I can too.

78
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,820
Thank you.

79
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,020
All right.

80
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,300
I've said what I should.

81
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,740
I think you

82
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,880
need more time to be alone now.

83
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,260
Think about it. I'm leaving.

84
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,500
Remember.

85
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,980
Call me

86
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,940
if anything happens.

87
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,659
I hope you'll get better.

88
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:38,520
And I hope you can leave Gu family as soon as possible

89
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,320
and be yourself again.

90
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,140
Eat well.

91
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,980
Bye.

92
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,130
It's not that easy

93
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,300
to be Su Yanxi again.

94
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,780
I wonder if mom's surgery

95
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,740
went well.

96
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,340
He secretly recruited an old friend into the company.

97
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,410
She even provoked me.

98
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,070

He suddenly recruited a girl into the company

118

without consulting you

119
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,140
and let the media make things up?

120
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,900
Grandma, these are just gossip news.

121
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,230

00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,340
you are the woman by Xicheng's side.

128
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,730
You can't allow them

129
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,340
to flirt with each other in the company.

130
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,980
As the saying goes, the closer you are, the more advantages you'll get.

131

You can't just stay at home now.

132

134
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,020
Yes, you.

135
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,860
I'll ask someone to make some arrangements

136
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,260
to put you next to Xicheng.

137
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,140
You'll have to keep an eye on Xicheng.

138
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,620
Don't let others step

139
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,570

140
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,260
It's settled.

141
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,420
I'll go to work at Huayan too.

142
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,700
Grandma is right.

143
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,340
If something really happened between Gu Xicheng and Nangong Liuli,

144
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,780
I can't fulfill the contract for He Jinxi.

145
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,470
That would be troublesome.

146
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,220
I’ll stay by Gu Xicheng's side and keep an eye out

147
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,740
to see what his old friend

148
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,500
can do.

149
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,180

150
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,260

151
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,980
What are you doing?

00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:11,940
On behalf of the moon,

153
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,940
I'll destroy the bad guys.

155
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,440
Grandma told me everything herself.

156
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,690
Don't worry.

157
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,940
As long as it can help you and Boss,

158
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
I'll do anything.

159
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,180
I am now on your side.

160
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,820
There's no need to exaggerate.

161
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,860
Anyway, we have to take the absolute advantage on the position.

162
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,460
The position I arranged for you is

163
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,580
the president's special assistant.

164
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,620
What do I need to do?

165
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,860
This job is specially made for you.

166
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,380
It's to follow Boss 24 hours a day,

167
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,240
take care of him 24 hours a day,

168
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,860
and keep an eye out on him for 24 hours a day.

169
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,420
Got it.

170
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,220
When can I start?

171
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:15,890
Now.

172
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,500
The proposal you wrote can be executed.

173
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Just follow this.

174
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,450
But you have to pay attention to one thing.

175
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,910
You can reconsider the packaging material.

176
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,220
What's wrong?

177
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,540
Nothing. It just occurred to me that

178
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,580
I'm not very sensitive towards the area of materials.

179
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,510
I've been like this since college.

180
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,940
I remember when I had a design homework,

181
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,300
I couldn't find a suitable combination material.

182
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,700
I was so anxious that I cried.

183
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,350
But you stayed up late for many nights

184
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,410
to find the suitable material for me.

185
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,690
Don't ever mention this in the company again.

186
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,880
Boss,

187
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,980
your special assistant has joined us.

189

00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,290
ask me out for a drink?

376
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,740
Didn't we used to drink together

377
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,220
when we were abroad?

378
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,180
Why?

379
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,830
You're not used to it once you're back?

380
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:15,730
By the way,

381
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,760
the relationship between Xicheng and Miss He Jinxi

382
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,620
is not ordinary.

383
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,300
Xicheng never had

384
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,110
any special assistant or secretary.

385
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,510
What is his relationship

386
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,340
with her?

387
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,760
He Jinxi

388
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,370
is Gu Xicheng’s fiancée.

389
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,540
But the news hasn't been released yet.

390
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,820
So no one knows.

391
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,040
When I was abroad,

392
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,810
his grandma kept urging Xicheng to find a girlfriend.

393
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,370
I didn't expect

394
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,810
she's the one who entered the Gu family.

395
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,200
Nangong.

396
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,860
Fiancée.

397
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,620
But they're not married yet.

398
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,390
So I still have a chance.

399
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,820
As expected, you have

400
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,900
yet to give up on Gu Xicheng.

401
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,190
How could I give up?

402
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:40,990
Boya,

403
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,460
I see that you and Miss He

404
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,950
know each other quite well.

405
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,120
You are...

406
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,110
friends?

407
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,670
Yes.

408
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,140
We are friends.

409
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,730
You haven't known each other for long though.

410
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,260
You became friends so fast.

411
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,570
You two really get along well.

412
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,070
Mr. Gu,

413
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,540
this is the new recipe I've learned online.

414
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,450
Try it.

415
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,160
How is it?

416
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,530
It tastes good.

417
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,390
Mr. Gu.

418
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,280
Miss He is also here.

419
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,640
Mr. Gu,

420
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,080
I have something to discuss with you.

421
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,950
I heard that Miss He works as an online makeup live streamer

422
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,350
during her spare time.

423
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,090
She's also working with Huayan,

424
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,370
and she is doing well.

425
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,740
You flatter me.

426
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,860
It's a waste of your talent to be Mr. Gu's assistant.

427
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,990
My R&D department is short of hands.

428
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,230
Would you like to come over and help me?

429
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,500
The R&D department?

430
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,300
Isn't that the core department of Huayan?

431
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,510
She has no experience in this area.

432
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,040
I think we should forget it.

433
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,360
She suddenly wants to transfer me away.

434
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,000
What is she up to?

435
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,440
But if I go to her side,

436
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,850
I can know her purpose better

437
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,530
and fight back better.

438
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,450
I want to go.

439
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,730
Nangong's department is very important.

440
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,350
You don't have any work experiences.

441
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,080
It's not as simple as you think.

442
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,150
Although I'm inexperienced,

443
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:18,060
I can learn from Director Nangong.

444
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,640
I think I'll be able to learn a lot.

445
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,440
As for the administration...

446
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,370
I'll write a transfer letter to the administrators.

447
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:31,780
Xicheng,

448
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,320
do you have work to hand over to Miss He?

449
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,220
No work.

450
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,640
But I won't have much fun anymore.

451
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,830
I can go over anytime.

452
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,480
That's great.

453
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,130
I'll take you to fill up the paperwork now.

454
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:52,950
Okay.

455
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,230
You just left like that?

456
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,830
From today onwards,

457
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,470
we have a new colleague in the R&D department.

458
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,470
Let's welcome Miss He Jinxi.

459
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,470
Hello, everyone.

460
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,240
Miss He has never done any related job before.

461
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,100
Please help her to get used to it as soon as possible.

462
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,440
She directly joined the R&D department without any working experience?

463
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,370
What kind of backdoor did she take?

464
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:51,510
Jinxi.

465
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,580
This is your desk.

466
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,810
Go and summarize

467
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,440
the market requirements for the new products.

468
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,380
I've never done

469
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,260
the market requirements before.

470
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,430
Can someone teach me?

471
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,170
Jinxi.

472
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,280
Everyone has their own job.

473
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,080
I'm afraid it's inappropriate to find someone specially for you.

474
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,490
If you have any questions,

475
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,690
you can ask everyone else

476
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,370
or me.

477
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,360
Send it to the production department before 4pm.

478
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,000
Okay.

479
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,330
By the way,

480
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,640
please design a set of

481
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,550
eyeshadow packaging plan by today.

482
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,900
I’ll report it to the president on tomorrow's meeting.

483
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,820
Within today?

484
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,730
Yes.

485
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,740
Work hard and pull an all nighter.

486
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,510
The meeting will not be delayed for anyone.

487
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,880
Jinxi, you are very talented.

488
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,550
I don't want you to miss this opportunity,

489
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,280
understand?

490
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,260
Thank you, Director Nangong.

491
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,450
I wonder if she

492
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,730
embarrassed me there.

493
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,640
Mr. Gu.

494
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,570
Boss.

495
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,970
This is rare. What brings you here?

496
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,190
I'm just taking a walk.

497
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,840
I'll pay you back two of them next time.

498
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:21,710
Mr. Gu.

499
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,500
That's it.

500
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,740
Just change this one.

501
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:37,730
Mr. Gu.

502
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,770
Why do you suddenly have time

503
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,770
to drop by the R&D department today?

504
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,750
I just had my meal. I was just doing some exercise.

505
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,750
How did you know I'm hungry?

506
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,350
This...

507
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,090
I didn't expect you to remember

508
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,970
I like turkey breast sandwich.

509
00:33:59,270 --> 00:33:59,960
Thanks.

510
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,110
Mr. Gu,

511
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:10,810
I have something urgent

512
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:11,739
to report to you.

513
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,040
It's related to the tomorrow's meeting .

514
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,170
Are you free now?

515
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:17,870
Let's talk in the office.

516
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:22,900
Did you know?

517
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,840
Mr. Gu specially bought lunch

518
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,040
for Director Nangong today.

519
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,739
He still remembers her preference.

520
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:28,889
Would this drama happen

521
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:30,489
in our company?

522
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,760
Gosh, that's so sweet.

523
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,250
Gu Xicheng.

524
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,409
How dare you have drama in the company?

525
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,429
I really underestimated you.

526
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,900
Wait until I finish my work.

527
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,100
Wait and see.

528
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,450
Is He Jinxi still working?

529
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,820
Boss, this is the information for tomorrow's meeting.

530
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,460
Fu Boya, as the advisor of Lipman,

531
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,300
he has full authority to participate in the meeting on behalf of the Germans

532
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,140
and to give suggestions and support in technical aspects.

533
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,500
Okay.

534
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,460
Go home.

535
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,200
Then why aren't you leaving?

536
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,940
Are you waiting for someone to get off work?

537
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,540
Grandma made great efforts to arrange He Jinxi to join the company.

538
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,940
How can I explain to her if I went back alone?

539
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,970
Understood.

540
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,510
Get lost.

541
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,110
Okay.

542
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,870
[Huayan]

543
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,180
Come in.

544
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,250
Director Nangong, my design draft is ready.

545
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,410
Could you please

546
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,850
provide me with some advice.

547
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,450
So soon?

548
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,210
Have you submitted the market requirements to the production department?

549
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,740
I submitted it before 4pm as per your request.

550
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,080
Okay, let me see it.

551
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,600
[Six Stars]

552
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,600
[Galaxy's Planet. Smart Cat's Eye.]

553
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,660
Very good.

554
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,870
I like it.

555
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,590
This is my first design.

556
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,090
There are many things I don't understand.

557
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,240
It's fine. It's good enough.

558
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,160
It just needs some slight adjustments.

559
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,510
How about this?

560
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,760
You stay back, and I'll modify it with you.

561
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,960
