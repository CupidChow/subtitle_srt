is living in your house brazenly.

00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,340
Xixi,

7
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,950
you can't allow her to bully you like this.

8
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,320
But for the moment, I don't have any news about my mom.

9
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,120
Since she has my Achilles‘ heel,

10
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,600
I have no choice.

11
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,140

to help you get the news of aunt.

15
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,350
I'll try my best

16

These days,

you must be careful.

19
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,970
Don't let her manipulate you

20
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:01,900
and affect your relationship with Gu Xicheng

21
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,910
by resorting to aunt.

22
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,320
Judging from her personalities,

23
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,780
she'll definitely cause trouble if she lives in the Gus' home.

24
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,670
By then,

31
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,490
An apartment?

32
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,600
Jinxi's cousin

33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,950
lives in my house for some reasons.

We're relatives,

35
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,050

36
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,090
So I want to rent her an apartment.

38
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,700
He Jinxi's cousin!

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, what's with that look?

40
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,690
I mean...

41
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,079

44
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:58,780

It's the agreement between me and Gu Xicheng.

You're fully eligible to fulfill the deal.

He Jinxi,

75
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,000
I suggest that

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,800
next time when you fix your face,

77
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,200

I'm listening to your love story.

81
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,900
I heard from Jinxi that

82
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,040
the reason why you're together is quite special.

83
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,659
It's because of a contract.

84

85
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,900

88

Sure.

89
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,700
Then you two spend time together.

92

100
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,840

No, Jinxi.

102
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,790

There is no need.

105
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,440

Xicheng,

111
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,480
you don't need to worry about Jinxi.

112
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,520
I know my cousin very well.

113
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,590
She's been cautious since she was a child.

114
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,540
If she has things she doesn't want to tell,

115
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,250
then no one can figure it out.

116
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,860
She is my fiancee.

117
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,370
If she has any difficulties,

118
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,700
I should care about her.

119
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,940

Nothing.

You won't visit mom.

124
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,050
By saying so, you just want to remind me

125
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,650
not to go out with Gu Xicheng.

126
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,350
You're smart and obedient.

Watching you show your mutual affection in front of me

129
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,430
makes me even more angry.

131
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,420

134
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,930
Forget it.

135
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,020
Then I'll tell him in person that

136

Go.

144

00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,410
I noticed you've always been in a bad mood.

189
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,070
Is it because Su Yanxi is here?

190
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,390
Xixi,

191
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,320
whose necklace on earth

192
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,360
is it?

193
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,720
It's Su Yanxi's.

194
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,100
If it's not that important to you,

195
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,430
why were you so anxious

196
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,810
at the auction?

197
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,870
After all,

198
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,260
it's very important.

199
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,520
Xixi, why are you

200
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,030
hiding things from me too?

201
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,400
I'm not hiding anything.

202
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,980
This belongs to Su Yanxi's mother.

203
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,570
I want to be alone for a while.

204
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:56,850
Okay.

205
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:08,610
By the way,

206
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,500
I asked Situ to find an apartment for your cousin.

207
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,540
I'll pay the rent.

208
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,020
I just hope that if she leaves,

209
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,060
you'll be happier.

210
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,460
Xicheng,

211
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,760
thank you.

212
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,900
Where is Angel's Tears?

213
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,100
If you really want to take it away,

214
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,440
I hope you can more or less cherish it.

215
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,070
Just a necklace.

216
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,540
What's there to cherish?

217
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,540
It makes me feel terrible.

218
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,880
How could you have all these good stuff?

219
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,860
He Jinxi,

220
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,640
don't go too far.

221
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,270
Is this too much?

222
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,890
Su Yanxi, let me tell you.

223
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,550
I'm going to get

224
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:54,710
little by little

225
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,120
all the stuff you have from you.

226
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,770
Alright, you can go now.

227
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:34,650
Jinxi.

228
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,110
Jinxi.

229
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,300
Are you hiding anything from me?

230
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,960
[China Construction Bank]

231

232
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,670
When we left the nursing home,

233
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,260
Jinxi insisted on

234
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,660
buying something for me.

235
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,020
She said she pitied me

236
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,180
and wanted to treat me well.

237
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,650
Mr. Gu,

238
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,490
can I call you Xicheng?

239
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,430
If you have something to say, talk inside.

240
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,390
There's no need. It'll do here.

241
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,140
You went shopping with Xixi today?

242
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,670
Yes.

243
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,090
I told you when we came back.

244
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,230
I know you're short of money.

245
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,920
Xixi doesn't like to ask me for it.

246
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,480
She only takes it on her own.

247
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,190
If you have any requests in the future,

248
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,200
just tell me.

249
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,700
You're her cousin,

250
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,160

251

As long as your requests are reasonable,

00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,990
I'll satisfy you for the sake of Xixi.

253
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,060
That's all I want to say.

254
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,839
Why?

Why does everyone

00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,280
only care about and love Su Yanxi?

00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,670
Why?

258
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,460
He Jinxi,

259
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,310
you must believe in yourself.

260
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,060
You've been working harder

261
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,900
and smarter than her since you were a child.

262
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,580
What Su Yanxi can do,

263
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,870

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,910
Xicheng,

267
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,550
didn't you say that

268
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,520
I can come to you any time when I need help?

269
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,030
Yes, go ahead. What is it?

Good night.

It turns out that Xicheng had to work overtime at a late hour.

276

He worked really hard,

How do you know he worked overtime last night?

280
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,290
Last night,

281
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,180
I saw the lights in his study were still on,

282
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,440
so I went to have a look.

283
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,010
We talked for a long time.

284
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,850
What's there to talk about between you?

285
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,100
After all, I grew up

286
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,750
along side He Zhendong.

Although the He family is not as rich as the Gu's,

288
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,690
there are many common topics

289
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,420
between Xicheng and me.

290
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,590
At least more than yours.

291
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,230
Who are you to call him Xicheng?

292
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,750
Why? Does it hurt you?

293
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,770
He asked me yesterday

294
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,800
if I was short of money recently

295
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,390
and if I was

296
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,220
I could ask it from him directly.

297
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,850
Impossible.

298
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:00,990
Why not?

299
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,320
If you don't believe me, you can ask him yourself.

300
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,320
You see, if this continues,

301
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,140
I don't need you to ask for the three million.

302
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,070
He will take the initiative and give it to me.

Situ,

306
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,220
I'm looking for you.

307
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,350
How's the investigation going?

308
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,860
I've checked all the nursing homes in our city

309
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,790
including private institutions.

310
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,170
We didn't find any information about aunt.

311
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,930
Could it be that He Jinxi

312
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,170
used a fake name?

313
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,520
I used aunt's detailed information

314
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,110
and made use of my personal relationship.

315
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,700
Even if He Jinxi did something,

316
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,370
It's useless.

317
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,260
We can't find any information,

318
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,120
which means she's not in the city.

319
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,780
What should I do?

320
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,740
Is mom really in a foreign country?

321
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,710
Don't worry.

322
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,280
We haven't checked the surrounding cities.

323
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,540
But if we keep investigating in this way,

324
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,640
it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

325
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,800
Haven't you thought about

326
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,120
telling these to Boss?

327
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,770
What's the point of telling him now?

328
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,540
You're right.

329
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,030
As long as He Jinxi isn't willing to tell us,

330
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,430
no one can force her to do it by questioning.

331
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,900
Even if it's like looking for a needle in a haystack,

332
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,100
it's still possible.

333
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,810
I'll ask more friends tomorrow

334
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,460
to search all the nursing homes

335
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,990
in the surrounding cities.

336
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,250
As for you, while He Jinxi is staying at Gu's home,

337
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,220
you should keep an eye on her.

338
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,220
It's impossible that she doesn't contact aunt at all.

339
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,400
You're right.

340
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,550
He Jinxi won't leave mom alone all together.

341
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,110
As long as she's at Gu's home

342
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,200
and under my nose,

343
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,230
she'll definitely betray herself.

344
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,730
It's great that you think in this way.

345
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,190
You'll by no means give up.

346
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,760
If you're really sad, go to An'an.

347
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,140
Don't worry, I won't.

348
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,640
I'll go to Xicheng then.

349
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:00,940
Why are you here?

350
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,040
I received a message from the bank.

351
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,720
You paid off the debt for me.

352
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,320
Xixi, don't feel burdened.

353
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,660
I just...

354
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,050
I don't want to trouble you because of my cousin.

355
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,640
Why are you laughing?

356
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,740
Nothing.

357
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,150
I just didn't expect

358
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,550
that one day

359
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,930
I would solve these kind of problems

360
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,210
for my fiancee.

361
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,450
I know that

362
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,730
there are a lot of things that you don't want me to know

363
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,780
between you and your come-from-nowhere cousin.

364
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,110
Xicheng, I didn't mean...

365
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:52,750
It's okay.

366
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,790
I won't ask if you don't tell me.

367
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,470
But let me handle these

368
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:57,690
small problems.

369
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,630

370
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,570
Mr. Gu,

371
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,170
the video conference has been canceled by the foreign side.

372
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,830
They want to make another appointment with you.

373
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,300
Okay, I got it.

374
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,550
What's up? Anything goes wrong?

375
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,830
It's indeed a bit tricky.

376
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,670
Well, you...

377
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,160
I'm thinking about something very serious.

378
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,560
Today,

379
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,450
I suddenly have a free afternoon.

380
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,600
I was thinking

381
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,350
should I take you to a movie

382
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,210
or go for a walk with you?

383
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:12,610
Mr. Gu,

384
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:13,690
now you

385
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,560
have become bad.

386
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,860
It's not often when no one comes to bother us.

387
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,860
I can't let you go.

388
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:19,620
Let's go.

389
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,010
How is my mom these days?

390
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,140
All indicators are improving.

391
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:24,840
You can be rest-assured.

392
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,680
Aunt can check out soon.

393
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,850
Let her stay longer.

394
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,890
After all, she just had a big surgery.

395
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,890
There's no hurry.

396
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,730
The most important thing is her health.

397
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,850
Miss He, you are such a filial daughter.

398
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,180
Don't worry. We'll take good care of aunt.

399
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,790
By the way, I need to tell you something.

400
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,220
Aunt Su keeps asking

401
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,900
if we can help her

402
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,710
contact her other daughter Su Yanxi.

403
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,750
I see. Thank you.

404
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,620
I do have a sister named Su Yanxi.

405
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,710
But she died

406
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,050
many years ago.

407
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,350
My mom just had the surgery.

408
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,780
She's weak

409
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,990
and in a bad mood,

410
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,990
which make her prone to talk nonsense.

411
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,570
You just need to coax her a little bit.

412
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,860
Don't worry, we will.

413
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,110
I spared no effort

414
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,170
to find a good hospital for mom abroad

415
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,520
and spent so much money for her surgery

416
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,630
and her care,

417
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,110
but she only cares about Su Yanxi.

418
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,770
Why?

419
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,240
Come in.

420
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,130
I'm working.

421
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,340
If you have nothing important,

422
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,530
please don't disturb me.

423
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,810
Didn't you say that

424
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,260
I can come to you any time?

425
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:11,740
Yes.

426
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,990
But it's not whenever you want.

427
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,050
It's too late now. I'm not available.

428
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,790
What if I don't want to leave?

429
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,150
You started it.

430
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,110
Don't blame me for exercising my right.

431
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,870
What I ask you to do now

432
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,740
is to drink with me.

433
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:47,890
Su Yanxi,

434
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,760
there are only two reasons why I put up with you.

435
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,320
First,

436
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,470
because you're Jinxi's cousin.

437
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,440
Second,

438
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,850
It's Grandma who asked you to stay.

439
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,560
But don't blame me for not reminding you.

440
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,490
You're running out of my patience.

441
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,780
Xicheng,

442
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,720
is there anything about me that makes you uncomfortable?

443
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,520
I'm uncomfortable about everything you've done.

444
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,920
Maybe in your mind,

445
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,470
men are all the same.

446
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,820
You underestimated me

447
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,440
and overestimated yourself.

448
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,210
Gu Xicheng,

449
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,280
you humiliated me like this.

450
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,610
I won't let you

451
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,140
end well with Su Yanxi.

452
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:01,010
[How's it going?]

453
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,210
How's it going?

454
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,020
[Don't worry too much. I've entrusted someone with the task of asking.]

455
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,780
Don't worry too much.

456
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,440
I've entrusted someone with the task of asking.

457
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,080
Xixi.

458
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,540
Xicheng.

459
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,500
Su Yanxi.

460
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,010
Su Yanxi.

461
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,860
Xicheng, you want to see me?

462
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,070
I want to talk with you about something.

463
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:44,880
[Lease Contract]

464
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,510
I rented an apartment for you

465
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,250
and paid the rent for a year.

466
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,800
Everything is ready.

467
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:51,880
You can pack up now

468
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,540
and move into that apartment.

469
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,020
I know I'm not welcomed.

470
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,800
In this case, I'll leave.

471
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,830
Your staying here

472
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,160
does affect my life with Xixi.

473
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,520
Do you want me to leave too, my cousin?

474
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,720
I know you don't want to leave me.

475
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,730
Didn't you say that

476
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,740
you'd visit my mom with me?

477
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:42,920
Xixi,

478
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,850
what's going on between you and her?

479
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,990
Nothing.

480
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,200
Don't lie to me.

481
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,130
I...

482
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,590
I just

483
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,460
don't want her to leave.

484
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,480
Don't want her to leave?

485
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,920
Since Su Yanxi's coming,

486
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,000
I don't think there are deep feelings

487
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,230
between you two.

488
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:17,850
Besides,

489
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,580
she brought us so much trouble.

490
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,280
I know.

491
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,740
But...

492
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,680
We can't kick her out.

493
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,610
It's not kicking her out.

494
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,440
I can pay for her livelihood,

495
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,900
as long as she doesn't come to disturb our life.

496
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,620
She shouldn't have been here.

497
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,540
She can't move out.

498
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,500
Unless

499
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,590
you kick me out with her.

500
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,550
Sorry, Xicheng.

501
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,850
I'll definitely tell you the truth

502
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,260
when I find my mom.

503
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:07,510
Xixi,

504
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,320
you are never such

505
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,040
an unreasonable person.

506
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,570
Do you know Su Yanxi

507
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,660
came to me in private at night?

508
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,720
She wanted to ruin our relationship!

509
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,410
Anyway,

510
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,920
she can't leave.

511
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,120
Gu Xicheng.

512
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,930
Sorry.

513
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,330
Xicheng.

514
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:38,830
Mr. Gu,

515
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,170
if it's because of me

516
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,600
that you two don't get well along with each other,

517
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,640
then I apologize.

518
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,910
I don't want it to be like this.

519
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,110
I'm sad to see you fight with each other.

520
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,160
Xixi staunchly stands up for you

521
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,420
and trusts you.

522
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,610
Although I really don't know why,

523
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,680
I hope you'll live up to her love.
