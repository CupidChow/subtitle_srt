392
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,140

00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,100
You said

395
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,170
you would always trust me.

396
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,810

I lied to you with my sister.

400
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,270
I should have told you earlier.

401
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,160

00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,100
No.

403
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,720
The reason why we were together

404
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,250
has never been your sister.

405
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,800

408
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,110

♫Why do I feel an unexplainable joy?♫

559
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,600
♫Chased away gloominess♫

560
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,520
♫I learn to get used to♫

561
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,580
Xicheng.

562
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,460
Late again?

563
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,450
♫Hiding my love for you♫

564
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,800
You have no choice now.

565
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,740
Because you can't get the job to promote the Xiyan series,

566
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,160
♫But you suddenly turned around♫

567
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,380
you can only go home with me now

568
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,180
and be my wife,

569
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,870
♫It made waves♫

570
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,300
Mrs. Gu.

571
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,630
♫This happiness♫

572
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,470
♫Comes with the sea breeze over and over again♫

573
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,480
♫Layer by layer like wave splashes♫

574
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,240
♫I almost wanted♫

575
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,960
♫To confess to you♫

576
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,550
♫What should I do♫

577
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:32,600
♫With a pounding heartbeat♫

578
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,460
♫I wandered past your windowsill♫

579
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,640
[the End]
