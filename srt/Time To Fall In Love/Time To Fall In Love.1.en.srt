00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,380
we received feedback on the collaboration with the Germans.

Tell Lipman that

12
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,580
the price we gave them is more than the average

13
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,130

14
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,900
It's impossible for us to give in anymore.

15
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,940
If they sincerely want this collaboration,

16
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,200
then we'll do our best.

17
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,680
If they are still hesitant about the price,

132
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,100
50,000.

133
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,330
20,000 per month is fine too.

134
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,660
Every month? Are you sure?

135
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,160
Although I don't usually work long hours,

136
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,860
my monthly amount

137
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,100
is at least 100,000.

138
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,900
So 20,000 per month

139
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,350
is not an issue for me.

140
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,860

I don't think you should use this word.

161
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,340

place a price on myself.

170

Grandma and I have the same thought.

195
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,130
You need someone

to care and protect you.

Con?

561
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,180

to pretend as his girlfriend and to put on

563
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,220

564
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,770
Yanxi, think about our mom.

565
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,600

Just wait and see.

569
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,450
Maybe you'll just have to see Mom die.

Don’t let him find out.
