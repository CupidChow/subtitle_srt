00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,130
All these years,

192
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:37,530
No.

193
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,890
you only care about her.

194
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,230
Alright.

195
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,900
Have a good rest now.

196
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,640
I'll arrange for you to be discharged tomorrow.

197
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,369
[Message from the Bank: Your loan is overdue. To avoid affecting your credit record,]

198
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,369
[we hereby remind you to repay your loan as soon as possible, thanks for your support.]

199
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:33,440
[Gu Xicheng, the president of Hua Yan Group, is a super fan of his wife]

200
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,450
Su Yanxi.

201
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:50,980
I didn't expect that

202
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,180
you're quite capable.

203
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,590
Nangong?

204
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,330
I have something

205
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,900
to tell you.

206
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,840
We're leaving.

207
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,860
We?

208
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,720
I want to bring Boya's final will

209
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,160
to the place

210
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,300
where we first met.

211
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,050
Nangong...

212
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,820
I'll probably be there for a long time.

213
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,810
I may not come back.

214
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,280
I don't want to say goodbye to Xicheng alone.

215
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,580
So,

216
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,610
please say goodbye to him

217
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,200
on behalf me.

218
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,420
I did make an unwise choice and let him down.

219
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,280
Back then, I thought if

220
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,620
I studied abroad, got a diploma

221
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,980
and an excellent job,

222
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,910
then I would be qualified to stand by his side,

223
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,180
and I would become the one

224
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,110
who runs Huayan together with him.

225
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,100
But I was wrong.

226
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,700
I forgot that

227
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,780
everything in this world

228
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,740
can be calculated,

229
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,170
except for

230
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,830
people's thoughts and love.

231
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,850
I've missed Boya's love.

232
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,900
I don't want to

233
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,120
be entangled in the love I can't get for the rest of my life.

234
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,540
Otherwise,

235
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,010
Boya's sacrifice would be in vain.

236
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,780
I'll tell Xicheng.

237
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,460
Nangong,

238
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,740
if you've decided to leave,

239
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,830
I hope

240
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,780
you can find yourself again one day.

241
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,380
Please take good care of yourself.

242
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,340
I believe Boya will also hope that

243
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,930
you can live a happy life.

244
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,490
Thank you.

245
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,640
I also hope you and Xicheng

246
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,180
can overcome all obstacles

247
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,550
and cherish each other.

248
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,880
So you've already know

249
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,020
who I am,

250
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,810
right?

251
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,060
Who you are

252
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,760
means nothing

253
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,690
to me now.

254
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:54,810
Besides,

255
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,440
I also want to apologize

256
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,280
for what I did

257
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,850
impulsively and stupidly to you.

258
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,980
I'm sorry.

259
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,750
I need to go.

260
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,030
I wish you happiness too.

261
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:22,780
Bye.

262
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,530
What's wrong?

263
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,880
I'm fine.

264
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,620
Remember to tell me if you have something on your mind.

265
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,340
Xicheng.

266
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,340
I'm afraid that if I tell the truth,

267
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,940
you will leave me.

268
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,210
Nothing.

269
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:19,900
Mr. Gu,

270
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,220
eat.

271
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,670
Xixi.

272
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,860
Bring me the tea bags please.

273
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,570
[Taikoo]

274
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,300
Xixi.

275
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,900
I want the tea bags,

276
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,300
not sugar bags.

277
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,000
[Taikoo]

278
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,890
Sorry, I took the wrong one. I'll change it.

279
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:36,850
What happened?

280
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,690
Nothing.

281
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,600
I can see

282
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,710
you've been absent-minded these days.

283
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,910
You've been worrying about something.

284
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,760
Are you still thinking about Fu Boya?

285
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,250
It's a pity that he left us,

286
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,520
but many things in life

287
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,750
are uncontrollable.

288
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,620
The things we can do

289
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,500
are to stick to our hearts,

290
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,540
protect the people around us,

291
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,150
and cherish every day of our lives.

292
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,620
Although Boya and Nangong

293
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,650
did many wrong things,

294
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,440
they are not bad people.

295
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,260
I'll always remember him as my friend.

296
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,150
But Xicheng,

297
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,780
if one day,

298
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,390
I did something wrong,

299
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,750
will you forgive me?

300
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,090
That won't happen.

301
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,060
No matter what you did or what you did wrong,

302
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,510
everything will be the same.

303
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,280
I will always love you,

304
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,010
spoil you,

305
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,480
and take care of you.

306
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,780
Love is not just one word.

307
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,400
It's my heart

308
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,120
and everything about you.

309
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,640
Xicheng.

310
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,930
You're really nice.

311
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,520
By the way,

312
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,930
I happen to have something that

313
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,990
may need your help.

314
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:25,980
Look.

315
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,590
This is the sales data

316
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,080
of Huayan's new products.

317
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,840
I thought with the designed R&D direction,

318
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,580
as well as your packaging design,

319
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,420
the expected sales should be good.

320
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,750
But the data we received

321
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,210
is far from

322
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,070
how Situ and I expected.

323
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,030
Something seems wrong here.

324
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,780
Do you have any ideas?

325
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:53,860
I do.

326
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,310
It's just ahead.

327
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,380
I used to go to the cosmetics store

328
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,260
before I do my online research.

329
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,990
Are you sure you can do that?

330
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,310
Trust me.

331
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:20,940
Let's go.

332
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,000
Are you sure

333
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,080
we can get the data we need here?

334
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,530
Of course.

335
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,420
I used to do surveys on this street.

336
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,150
Normally, I look at

337
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,350
the latest fashion products

338
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,470
and their offline sales

339
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,870
at this cosmetics store.

340
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,640
We are doing online promotion,

341
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,950
so we can't fall behind in the type of product we're selling

342
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,860
or the current trend.

343
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,890
When others are selling

344
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,890
the small molecule fruit acid mask,

345
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:51,750
we can't still be selling the hydrating hyaluronic acid ones, right?

346
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,680
Come here.

347
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:01,960
It's here.

348
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,620
Take notes.

349
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,320
The offline research is very important.

350
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,180
The cheaper the product is,

351
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,990
its value ratio

352
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,520
is more recognized by the public.

353
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,190
So,

354
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,340
we need to produce and sell this kind of product,

355
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,250
in order to increase the sales

356
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,660
and occupy the market.

357
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:30,790
I didn't expect

358
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,500
you to be so knowledgeable about products.

359
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,360
So,

360
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,560
do you think

361
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,730
you found a treasure?

362
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,060
Yeah.

363
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,400
Isn't it too slow to take notes?

364
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,460
Let me take a photo.

365
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,500
You can't take photos. They'll hear the camera.

366
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,890
What are you doing here?

367
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,530
Let's go!

368
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,130
Hurry up.

369
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,770
You can't take photos here.

370
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,910
Manager, stop them!

371
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,890
Stop!

372
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,000
♫ If the weather is good tomorrow ♫

373
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,690
♫ If the shoelaces are always tight ♫

374
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,460
♫ Maybe I'll ask you out tomorrow ♫

375
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,530
♫ Let's go for a walk ♫

376
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:35,110
♫ Three pedestrians wearing floral dresses on the street ♫

377
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,900
♫ Colorful colors like your eyes ♫

378
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,720
♫ Seeing three contrails ♫

379
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,340

451
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,490

00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,780
