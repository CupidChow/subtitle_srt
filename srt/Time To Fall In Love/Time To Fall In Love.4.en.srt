00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,740
When I first went to the interview,

191
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,380
I found everything on your desk

192
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,040
is in pairs.

193
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,390
Gu Xicheng, this is called

194
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,740
even number obsession.

195
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,500
Yes, even number.

196
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,250
Why do you have such a strange hobby?

197
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,150
It's not strange, is it?

198
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,350
I just like things being in pairs.

199
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,850
The feeling of not being left alone.

200
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,960
I hate

201
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,180
everything that's single in the world.

202
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,730
But in this world

203
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,420
everything is different.

204
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,980
But I can make them

205
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,800
look alike as much as I can.

206
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,260
But

207
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,610
this is human-made.

208
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,260
Gu Xicheng, do you have OCD?

209
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,280
It has nothing to do

210
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,310
with you.

211
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,330
Don't get me wrong.

212
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,190
I-I just want to help you.

213
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:40,980
Miss He.

214
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,650
I hope you can understand our relationship

215
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,820
and observe the contract I signed with you.

216
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,880
I don't need you to commend on my life.

217
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,430
And I don't need you to analyze my life.

218
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,380
Mr. Gu. I didn't...

219
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,490
Gu...

220
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:10,970
Come on.

221
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,260
Drink.

222
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,100
Drink!

223
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,380
Hello, Xixi. Help me.

224
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,520
Where are you An'an?

225
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,040
Why is it so noisy?

226
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,660
I-I'm in a bar.

227
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,070
I'll send you the location now.

228
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,690
Come to pick me up. Hurry up.

229
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,970
You are not allowed to make a call.

230
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,360
Drink. Hurry up.

231
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,480
I didn't say I wouldn't drink with you.

232
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,790
You can't drink it, right?

233
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,820
I didn't say I wouldn't drink with you. I'll drink with you now.

234
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,340
Cheers.

235
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,330
This An'an...

236
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,590
Forget it. I'd better not to irritate him today.

237
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,050
I'll go and save her first.

238
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:55,900
Where is she?

239
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,560
Is she out again at this late hour?

240
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,180
An'an.

241
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,380
Where are you?

242
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,090
You loser. You're not as good as me.

243
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,660
Drink.

244
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,620
An'an.

245
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,850
Let me drink.

246
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,190
I, Situ Shuo, drink.

247
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,540
Hello, Situ, where are you?

248
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,490
Help me check...

249
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
How drunk you are! Come home with me.

250
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,020
Xixi, you are here.

251
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,620
Let's go. Go.

252
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,250
Go.

253
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,370
Right?

254
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,220
You can't leave.

255
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,160
You haven't called me daddy.

256
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,240
Who's leaving?

257
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,340
I want to continue drinking with you.

258
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
An'an.

259
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,780
He Jinxi.

260
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,560
I didn't expect to meet you here.

261
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,530
Sorry, you mistook me for the someone else.

262
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,180
How could I?

263
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,720
Look.

264
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,100
I gave you these high heels.

265
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,090
I...

266
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,420
I gave you so many gifts,

267
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,270
but you never drank with me.

268
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,970
We happen to meet today. Let's have a drink.

269
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,540
Let's go.

270
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,860
Let go of me! Otherwise I'll call the police!

271
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,800
Are you trying to scare me?

272
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,960
Don't be shameless. Go.

273
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,380
Gu Xicheng.

274
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,600
I...

275
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,820
Did I hurt you? Are you okay?

276
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,620
Gu Xicheng.

277
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,750
Playing the hero who saves the beauty!

278
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,460
Come on.

279
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,460
Stay here.

280
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,060
Ouch!

281
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,370
How dare you touch my woman!

282
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,520
Watch out, Gu Xicheng!

[Bass Clef Bar]

284
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,470
An'an.

285
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,090
You have been defeated. You have to call me daddy.

286
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,770

[Bass Clef Bar]

288
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,700
Look at yourself now.

289
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,100
You're sitting in a wheelchair. You should call me daddy.

290
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,410
Bah!

291
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,410
You don't buy it, right? Look at me.

292
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,060
You look at me.

293
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,380
Don't touch me.

294
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,380
I can take you to a picnic. I'll take you to fly.

295
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,540
Fly, fly.

296
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,540
I'll throw up.

297
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,470
I take you to fly.

298
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,620
Do you think I won't throw up?

299
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,330
An'an.

300
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,980
An'an you're drunk. I'll take you home.

301
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,110
I'm fine Xixi. I want to drink with him.

302

Situ. Situ.

303
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,410

My boss is here.

305
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,610
My boss is here. I'm not afraid of you.

306
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,270
I'm not afraid of you either because Xixi is here.

307
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,800
I've called a taxi for them.

308
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,380
Okay.

309
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,020
Bye.

310
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,570
Bye.

311
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,580
Do you know the guy at the bar?

312
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,730
No.

313
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,160
He mistook me for another person.

314
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,760
I have nothing to do with him.

315
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,640
I'm telling the truth.

316
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,740
Don't be angry.

317
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,060
I didn't come out so late on purpose.

318
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,460
But I told you

319
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,420
what you should do

320
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,940
and what you shouldn't during the contract duration.

321
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,140
Forget it. Let's go home.

322
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,470

No.

You're acting tough.

00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,740
What?

363
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,980
I said you should be quiet.

364
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,530
Bear with it and you'll be fine soon.

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,560

From now on you sleep on the bed and I on the sofa.

389

If you're not afraid of losing your hair,

390
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,270
then we'll compete over staying up.

391
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,850
Bald. You mean I'm bald?

392
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,100

How is it possible?

419

It's okay, Situ Shuo.

420
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,350
Nothing must have happened.

The pair is my new design this year.

458
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,370
With their special material, they won't rub feet.

459
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,780
It's pretty,

460
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,580
but it's useless giving it to me.

461
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,340

00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,280
You can give them to the girl you like.

464
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,420

00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,940
It's not necessary indeed.

559
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,060
The bus is coming.

560
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,960
You are being too courteous.

561
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,420
You see,

562
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,340
taking a bus with such weighty stuff,

563
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,470
what if you break it?

564
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,680
Come, give it to me.

565
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,130
Thank you.

566
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,880
You're welcome. Let's go.

567
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,370
Take care.

568
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,530
No wonder you returned the shoes I gave you.

569
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,420
So you're wearing flat shoes now.

570
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,390
I made a mistake.

571
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,540
I didn't expect

572
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,340
you would give me high heels.

573
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,110
But I don't really need them now.

574
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,730
Anyway,

575
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:12,920
thank you.

576
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,560
Are you available later?

577
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:23,130
Why don't we find a place and go for a walk?

578
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,530
The weather is so nice today.

579
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,330
By the way,

580
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,110
there's something I need to talk with you too.

581
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,630
Me? What is it?

582
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:33,770
You'll know soon.

583
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,370
When I was learning to draw at a young age,

584
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,170
this was my favorite place to go.

585
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,150
I met many interesting friends

586
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,890
because of drawing.

587
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,490
Unfortunately, I went abroad

588
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,730
and we gradually lost contact.

589
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,100
I see.

590
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,420
If it weren't for my special situation,

591
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,580
we could have a good chat

592
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,740
as old friends.

593
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,180
After returning, I've been the agent of

594
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,300
the organic cosmetics brand of Europe.

595
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,030
Yes.

596
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,020
After you told me about yourself last time,

597
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,480
I went back and had a check.

598
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,720
I found the Chinese brand name

599
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,160
is designed by you.

600
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,280
You're amazing.

601
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,720
You really know

602
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,140
about our brand.

603
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,110
How wonderful it is if I could work with you.

604
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,010
I always missed the opportunities.

605
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,810
If Mr. Fu appreciates my ability,

606
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,160
you can come to me later.

607
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:38,750
What I mean

608
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,810
is not just a contract.

609
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,640
It's okay. There will be many opportunities in the future.

610
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,900
We have plenty of time.

611
00:42:53,670 --> 00:43:01,020
[Big Lawn]

612
00:42:53,670 --> 00:43:01,020
[Rest Room]

613
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,030
Be careful.

614
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:05,920
What's up?

615
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,150
Nothing.

616
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,400
Maybe I was wrong.

617
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:13,930
Let's go.

618
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,630
Be careful.

619
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,790
Take a look at your drawing.

620
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,660
Yanxi.

621
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,130
You were drenched just now. Take care not to catch a cold.

622
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:36,060
It's okay.

623
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,510
Let's take a look at the drawing right now.

624
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:49,860
What a pity.

625
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:53,330
It's okay. Anyway,

626
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,100
it's just for practice.

627
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,280
I'm sure I'll draw a better one in the future.

628
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:59,970
You were in such a hurry

629
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,460
and blocked the water for me.

630
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:01,920
Thanks.

631
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:04,820
We're friends. You're welcome.

632
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,500
Yanxi, it's really you.

633
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,620
Why it was you who hurt Nangong?

634
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,830
What should I do

635
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,200
to avoid hurting people?
