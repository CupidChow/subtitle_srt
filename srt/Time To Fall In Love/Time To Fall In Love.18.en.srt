My queen, are you sober yet?

00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,580
It's so chaotic outside.

00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,230
What happened?

8
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,140
Some unscrupulous media

9
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,010
suddenly published photos of

00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,180
you and Fu Boya.

11
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,660
They even came up with a scandalous title for it.

00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,990
Now the whole Huayan...

I didn't see Fu Boya yesterday.

Alright, stop talking.

I'll send you the address.

I'm afraid you can't handle it alone,

00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,500
so I'll take you home first.

But I did go out for a while.

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,900
I fell in love with her.

193
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,220
Although I know

194
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,350
deep down in her heart,

195
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,490
she loves someone else.

196
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,060
But it doesn't matter.

197
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,070
As long as I can stay by her side,

198
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,610
that's enough

199
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,090
for me.

200
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,830
I get it now.

201
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,440
I want her to be happy.

202
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,980
I hope she can be happy.

203
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Even if in the end,

204
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,950
I'm not the one by her side,

205
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,010
it doesn't matter.

206
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,030
My life belongs to her.

207
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,560
No matter what I need to do to repay her,

208
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,320
it would never be too much.

209
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,180
When she knew Gu Xicheng had a girlfriend,

210
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,380
she was in great pain.

211
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,060
Seeing her in pain,

212
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,610
my heart feels like its being pierced by needles,

213
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,550
being cut by a knife.

214
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,190
I... I felt worse than her.

215
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:10,820
So,

216
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,430
I decided

217
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,500
to destroy the relationship

218
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,820
between Gu Xicheng and his girlfriend.

219
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,220
Are you still the Fu Boya

220
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,940
I know when I was young?

221
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,960
I'm sorry.

222
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,180
I let you down.

223
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,610
So,

224
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,420
I tried everything

225
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,350
to get close to Gu Xicheng's girlfriend.

226
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,270
I even drove around your house

227
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,040
to find a way

228
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,220
to establish a relationship with Gu Xicheng's girlfriend.

229
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,660
Miss? Miss! Miss, are you alright?

230
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,150
That day,

231
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,650
you crashed into the taxi I took.

232
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,690
You even planned an accident.

233
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,530
I calculated everything.

234
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,940
But I didn't expect

235
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,890
Gu Xicheng's girlfriend to be you.

236
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,390
This is ridiculous.

237
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,250
So you joined the collaboration

238
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,900
between Huayan and the German company

239
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,940
on purpose?

240
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,200
I heard that Gu Xicheng

241
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,450
intended to collaborate with Lipman.

242
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,700
I knew they were lacking a third party general consultant.

243
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,060
So I went to Lipman

244
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,450
and offered him

245
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,380
a price he can't refuse.

246
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,970
You really put all your effort into it.

247
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,100
But I never

248
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,850
expect you to

249
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,930
fall in love with Gu Xicheng.

250
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,460
No matter how I treated you,

251
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,650
you don't feel anything.

252
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,530
I had no choice.

253
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,260
So I had to find someone

254
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,610
to take photos of us at the bar.

255
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,490
Stop talking!

256
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,320
I really don't understand.

257
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,080
You hurt others

258
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,290
to make the person you love happy.

259
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,890
Is this your so-called love?

260
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,840
Are you crazy?

261
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,260
Do you know

262
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,630
you've hurt others?

263
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,260
You'll cause a mess in Huayan.

264
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,850
Why do you have to do this?

265
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,890
I don't care about others.

266
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,290
I only did it for Nangong.

267
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,000
Xixi,

268
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,180
if you are willing to give up Gu Xicheng

269
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,640
and return him to Nangong,

270
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,820
I will announce to the public that

271
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,900
it was all my plan.

272
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,370
I'll take full responsibility.

273
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,210
Fu Boya!

274
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,100
Xixi, you and Gu Xicheng are not suitable for each other.

275
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,360
As long as you give up your love for him...

276
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,740
Fu Boya, I treated you as my friend.

277
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,500
I didn't expect you to be such a person.

278
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,620
From now on,

279
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,620
I don't want to have any contact with you anymore.

280
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,840
Just pretend that we

281
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,690
never knew each other.

282
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,550
Xixi. Xixi!

283
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,880
[Camp Coffee]

284
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,820
Xixi! Xixi!

285
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:05,980
Xixi,

286
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,940
let's talk about it.

287
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,620
Let go!

288
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,430
I have nothing to say to you.

289
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,500
Let go!

290
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,530
Xixi, don't forget

291
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,870
you have another big secret.

292
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,250
Let go!

293
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,690
Fu Boya!

294
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,860
Gu Xicheng, no! Gu Xicheng!

295
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,270
Fu Boya, I don't care who you are.

296
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,300
I don’t care what you did.

297
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,510
If you keep pestering Xixi,

298
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,170
I'll beat you up every time I see you.

299
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,820
Gu Xicheng, please don't!

300
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,870
We're not done.

301
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,070
I'll settle it with you slowly.

302
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,410
[Camp Coffee]

303
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,270
Don't be angry.

304
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,240
I'm not angry.

305
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,250
It's just too messy today.

306
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,540
I'm confused too.

307
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,980
I'm sorry.

308
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,330
It's all my fault.

309
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,010
I shouldn't have trusted others so easily.

310
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,210
I shouldn't have gotten drunk outside.

311
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,530
Because of me,

312
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,900
this mess happened.

313
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,790
I'm not afraid of the mess outside.

314
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,450
I'm just...

315
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,270
I'm just afraid that they'll hurt you.

316
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:26,740
Xixi,

317
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,170
I won't let them hurt you.

318
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,170
No matter what happens,

319
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,370
no matter what it takes,

320
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,020
I will always protect you behind me.

321
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,300
Xicheng,

322
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,680
I want to

323
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,790
tell you something.

324
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,300
Go ahead.

325
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,660
Wait for me in the car.

326
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,740
I'll be right back.

327
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,460
Go.

328
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,290
Hello, Boss.

329
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,480
What happened?

330
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,410
This is serious.

331
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,700
A reporter told me that

332
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,420
Fu Boya just called the reporters saying that

333
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,260
he wants to make a statement about the situation.

334
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:49,940
Fu Boya?

335
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,420
What is he up to?

336
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,160
He's making a scene.

337
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,700
He seems to have more than one trump card.

338
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,860
I don't understand it either.

339
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,260
But we have evidence that shows

340
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,500
Fu Boya and Nangong Liuli

341
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,960
studied abroad together.

342
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,530
Nangong Liuli?

343
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,180
I was also surprised when I found out.

344
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,620
And we have evidence that shows

345
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,980
they are friends.

346
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,530
But I don't know if they have

347
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,210
any other relationship.

348
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,910
Situ, go and check

349
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,700
the whereabouts of Nangong after she joined Huayan.

350
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,900
Gather all the evidence that we can get.

351
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,660
And send more manpower

352
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,900
to the conference tonight.

353
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,700
Don't let them get close to Xixi.

354
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,420
Okay, got it.

355
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,910
Is everything okay?

356
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,800
I'm here, everything will be fine.

357
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,420
Relax.

358
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,180
There will be a news conference in Huayan's hall tonight.

359
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,010
I'll clarify everything.

360
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,690
News conference?

361
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,570
Let's go.

362
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,910
Miss Nangong,

363
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,970
your boyfriend asked us to give you a letter.

364
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,140
[Liuli,]

365
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,140
[It hurts me to see you lying on a hospital bed.]

366
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,140
[I can risk everything. This time, I will succeed.]

367
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,970
[But you saved me that winter night.]

368
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,970
[Liuli, I really like you.]

369
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,970
[You work hard in your academics and designs.]

370
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,570
[I stayed by your side to protect you. I felt very happy.]

371
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,570
[You're always so sure of what you want, and you would go after it.]

372
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,570
[Boya.]

373
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:46,720
Boya.

374
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,300
Mr. Gu is here! Mr.Gu!

375
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,300
Mr. Gu is here! Mr. Gu is here!

376
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,420
Mr. Gu! Mr. Gu!

377
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:04,940
Mr. Gu!

00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,620
It's fine now.

566
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:26,580
Boya!

567
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,510
I'll turn myself in, I'll turn myself in.

568
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,510
Boya, wait for me!

569
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,120
Nangong!

570
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,970
Boya. Boya.

571
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,190
Boya. Boya. Boya.

572
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,330
Are you okay, Boya?

573
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,880
Boya. Boya.

574
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,000
Boya!

575
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,370
Don't... don't cry,

576
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,110
If you cry,

577
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,340
I'll be sad.

578
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,870
Why did you do this?

579
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,660
Why did you do this?

580
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,390
Because...

581
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,530
Because...

582
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,070
I... I love you.

583
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,660
Since that day when

584
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,090
I lay in your

585
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,740
arms like this.

586
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,100
Don't be afraid.

587
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,830
I'll call an ambulance for you.

588
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,380
From that moment on,

589
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,080
I love you.

590
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,350
I'm on the 5th Street.

591
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,710
Get them over.

592
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,130
My heart

593
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,780
has never changed.

594
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,450
Boya, hang in there.

595
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,250
The ambulance will be here soon.

596
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,500
I'm...

597
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:17,580
I'm...

598
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:18,260
I'm...

599
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:19,780
I'm...

600
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,500
I'm...

601
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,900
I'm sorry.

602
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,660
Promise me.

603
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,740
In the next life,

604
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,020
let's...

605
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,440
meet...

606
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:34,800
each...

607
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:37,440
other...

608
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,090
first...

609
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,500
♫ You know it ♫

610
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:55,160
♫ I don't know much loving words ♫

611
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,660
No, Boya.

612
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,170
♫ Plant a flower ♫

613
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,020
No.

614
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,900
♫ Wait for it to sprout slowly ♫

615
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,650
♫ Wanted to leave ♫

616
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,970
♫ But still can't let go ♫

617
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,660
Boya!

618
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,030
♫ Betray myself ♫

619
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,380
Boya!

620
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,380
♫ Is the price for falling in love ♫

621
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,300
Boya!

622
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,150
♫ You are my dream ♫

623
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,220
Boya!

624
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,960
♫ You also know my heart ♫

625
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,220
Liuli, I'm sorry.

626
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,930
♫ Walking through the crowd ♫

627
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,240
♫ Only your voice was there ♫

628
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,380
I hope in my next life,

629
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,250
I'll meet you before Gu Xicheng.
