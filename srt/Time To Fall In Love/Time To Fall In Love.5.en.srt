00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,980
three times in one live stream.

377
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,420
Yes.

378
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,150
It was weird to have audiences.

379
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:06,980
Xixi,

380
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,170
I didn't expect you could have this benefit

381
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,680
as a contract girlfriend.

382
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,860
He rented this place yesterday.

383
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,940
He said the equipment here is better.

384
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,860
But I think

385
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,700
he's afraid I'd be seen have live stream at home

386
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,100
and then affect Grandma.

387
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,140
Please.

388
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,660
Can you just think about it?

389
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,890
He must have bought this place.

390
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,900
With Gu Xicheng's ability,

391
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,060
he can provide 100 rooms for you

392
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,100
to do live stream at Gu House.

393
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,450
But why did he buy this place?

394
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,220
Is it because this place has a good equipment

395
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,190
and professional service?

396
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,100
Does Gu Xicheng...

397
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,540
Don't talk nonsense.

398
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,800
He bought it by the way, not just for me...

399
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,860
He asked me to come here

400
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,990
for the good effect of the live stream.

401
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,560
Are you playing dumb or are you really confused?

402
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,750
Did he only sign you as a live streamer?

403
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,140
Gu Xicheng is so generous to you.

404
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,380
It means

405
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,130
he cares about you.

406
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,300
So stupid.

407
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,440
I'll check over there.

408
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,660
Gu Xicheng cares about me?

409
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,460
Impossible.

410
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,820
Fu Boya.

411
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,420
Hello, Mr. Fu.

412
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,710
Where are you? I'll pick you up for dinner.

413
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,220
Why do you want to have dinner with me?

414
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,460
It's my birthday today.

415
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,090
Jinxi, have you forgotten?

416
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,460
No.

417
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,100
Send me the location of the restaurant.

418
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,740
I'll be right there.

419
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,540
Okay.

420
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,700
Do you see that?

421
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,360
The room over there is bigger.

422
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,300
I'm leaving.

423
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,660
Where are you going in such a hurry?

424
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,540
Fu Boya asked me out for dinner.

425
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,100
We had an appointment.

426
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,910
When did you become so close to him?

427
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,820
You get good luck in adventures with men recently.

428
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,020
Don't talk nonsense.

429
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,020
I just have dinner with a friend.

430
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,960
I'm leaving. I haven't bought a gift.

431
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:05,210
Sit.

432
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,100
Okay.

433
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,380
You ordered so many dishes.

434
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,260
I won't be a gentleman today.

435
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,410
I'll exercise my right as a birthday boy.

436
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,540
I ordered some signature dishes here.

437
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,700
Try it. They must be delicious.

438
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,340
I'm so lucky tonight.

439
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,170
By the way, this is a gift for you.

440
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,020
Look.

441
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,790
You really brought a gift.

442
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,140
Thank you.

443
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,340
Can I open it?

444
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,100
Of course. It's a small gift.

445
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,300
I hope you like it.

00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,700

[Jay Chou Common Jasmine Orange]

450
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:31,060
I guessed. I didn't except I was right.

451
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,540
Thank you. I like it.

452
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,310
I need to take this call.

453
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,460
Okay.

454
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,380
Hello.

455
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,310
Why aren't you back yet?

456
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,620
I forgot to tell you

457
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,020
I'll be back late for my friend's birthday.

458
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,580
Friend?

459
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,210
Lu An'an?

460
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,300
No.

461
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,500
It's Mr. Fu.

462
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,940
You celebrate birthday for Fu Boya.

463
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,900
Where are you?

464
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,540
I'll pick you up.

465
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,300
Now?

466
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,460
I...

467
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,830
Send me the address.

468
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,500
No need. I'll be right back.

469
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,100
Sorry, Mr. Fu.

470
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,580
I have to go back now.

471
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,820
You're leaving now?

472
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,900
It's okay. Go ahead if you have something to do.

473
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,350
I've received the gift.

474
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,340
I like it.

475
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,660
Today is a happy day.

476
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,100
Happy birthday to you again.

Thank you.

00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,660
See you.

00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:30,930
Take care.

00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,940
Bye.

481
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,700
I'm back.

482
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,800
You're so thoughtful.

483
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,500
You even celebrate birthday with him.

484
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,260
Mr. Gu, without affecting the contract,

485
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,580
I can have my own social contact.

486
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,740
You shouldn't interfere in this.

487
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,180
So you still remember the contract.

488
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,540
If grandma finds you out with a man,

489
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,570
how do you explain that to her?

490
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,500
I just had a meal with a friend.

491
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,370
There's nothing to explain.

492
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,180
You're just friends.

493
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,260
Yes.

494
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,380
What do you think

495
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,040
my relationship with Fu Boya?

496
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,220
Even if you are just friends,

497
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,880
you should be careful.

498
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,340
Besides, you haven’t seen Fu Boya many times.

499
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,740
You need to be careful when making friends.

500
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,300
You called me back

501
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,620
just to tell me this?

502
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,830
I have a task for you.

503
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,740
What is it?

504
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,420
Did you study in Germany?

505
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:34,930
Yes.

506
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,780
Tomorrow, I will have a very important

507
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,100
dinner with a German client.

508
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,540
The client will bring his wife.

509
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,260
So I want you to go with me

510
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,780
and translate for me.

511
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,820
Translate?

512
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,300
Any problem?

513
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,140
The person who went to Germany is He Jinxi,

514
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,340
not me.

515
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,050
Something is wrong.

516
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,380
I mean the client is taking his wife.

517
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,930
But I'm not your real wife.

518
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,100
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

519
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,260
It doesn't matter. You just need to translate well.

520
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,060
Don't worry about other things.

521
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,180
But...

522
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,380
Anything else?

523
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,380
No.

524
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:21,980
Go out.

525
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,860
Sorry, Mr. Gu, I just remembered

526
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,660
I have something to do tomorrow noon.

527
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,340
Put it off.

528
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,220
Okay.

529
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,020
I can't put if off.

530
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,659
An'an and I are going to do a live stream tomorrow.

531
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,900
After all, Mr. Gu spent so much money on us.

532
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,699
We have to do our best, right?

533
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,500
Just one time.

534
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,100
OK.

535
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,260
Okay.

536
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,940
Mr. Gu, An'an will invite a reinforcement tomorrow.

537
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,900
She's a celebrity with millions of fans.

538
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,699
We've already made an appointment.

539
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,739
We should keep our promise.

540
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:34,860
Nothing can

541
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,659
compare to tomorrow's mission.

542
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,100
Okay.

543
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,060
How about this?

544
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,860
I'll hire the best interpreter for you.

545
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,659
What are you doing?

546
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,380
Why do you keep saying no?

547
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,860
Give me a reason.

548
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,060
No.

549
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,620
I'll be there tomorrow.

550
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,540
Mr. Gu.

551
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:10,940
Good night.

552
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,020
Hello. Nice to meet you.

553
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,950
[Xixi]

554
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,020
Not bad, not bad.

555
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,130
But I think it's useless for me

556
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,340
to learn some daily language.

557
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,040
I'm going to be an interpreter tomorrow.

558
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,180
Right.

559
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
What should we do?

560
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:50,940
Got it.

561
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,060
What's your idea?

562
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,700
I have a great idea.

563
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,420
I can be saved now.

564
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,460
What's wrong?

565
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,700
Nothing.

566
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,340
The Lipman couple will be here soon, right?

567
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,540
Mr. Gu.

568
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,140
Mr. Lipman.

569
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,220
Hello, welcome to China.

570
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,220
Mr. Gu's German is really standard.

571
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:46,420
He said your German is really standard.

572
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,590
Just a little. Let's sit down and talk.

573
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:55,930
Let's sit down and talk.

574
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,660
I've always focused on German biotechnology.

575
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,380
I'm very happy

576
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,350
to work with you.

577
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:22,500
I've always focused on German biotechnology.

578
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,170
I'm very happy

579
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:29,820
to work with you.

580
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,500
I also want to work with you.

581
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,650
Mr. Gu, you're just as uncompromising as

582
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,740
rumor has it.

583
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,860
Mr. Lipman is praising you.

584
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,020
You don't give in to business.

585
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,220
You flatter me. This is my principle.

586
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,540
I don't know if the food here suits your taste.

587
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,980
Let's talk while eating.

588
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,260
I don't know if the food here suits your taste.

589
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,450
I don't know if the food here suits your taste.

590
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,780
Let's talk while eating.

591
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,580
I'm afraid you know too much about the Chinese market,

592
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,530
so I hired a friend to be the consultant.

593
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:11,060
He is also good at brand promotion.

594
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,780
He'll be here soon.

595
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,780
Mr. Lipman said

596
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,900
he doesn't know the Chinese market.

597
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,620
So,

598
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,940
He invited a friend

599
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,580
as a consultant.

600
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,900
Mr. Lipman's friend

601
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,980
must be an elite in the industry.

602
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:28,860
Here.

603
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,500
If you're hungry,

604
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,010
you can eat less.

605
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,540
But don't forget your job.

606
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:59,420
Mr. Gu, this is your favorite spicy sauce.

607
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,130
Here.

608
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:00,700
I...

609
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,580
Mr. Gu likes spicy food?

610
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,380
Yes.

611
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,270
You dropped something.

612
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,420
What?

613
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,820
You're wrong.

614
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,860
What happened?

615
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,830
Nothing.

616
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,790
Mrs. He, are you okay?

617
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,660
Sorry, everyone.

618
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,510
I'm late.

619
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,980
Here you are.

620
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,020
Long time no see, Lipman. Welcome to China.

621
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,140
I'll translate for you.

622
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,100
So the consultant

623
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,690
is you.

624
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,450
Mr. Gu, Jinxi.

625
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,300
We meet again.

626
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,980
It seems that Mr. Gu is dissatisfied

627
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,750
with me, the consultation.

628
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,940
You're a consultant hired by Mr. Lipman.

629
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,300
As long as it's for the project,

630
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,700
I have no complaints.

631
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:04,460
But I hope your purpose is simple.

632
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,790
Don't focus on the person or things

633
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,200
outside this project.

634
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,420
Mr. Gu,

635
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,100
you think too much.

636
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,260
Let's talk about work first.

637
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,700
Do you know each other?

638
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:24,660
Yes.

639
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,860
Mr. Gu, your card.

640
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,140
Mr. Gu, are you feeling unwell?

641
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,500
I’m fine.

642
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,710
Where is the dressing room?

643
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,740
Turn right ahead.

644
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,180
Thank you.

645
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,340
Su Yanxi, what's wrong with you?

646
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,460
He Jinxi.

647
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,580
Be careful.

648
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,400
Be careful.

649
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:28,660
Are you cold?

650
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,900
It's okay. I don't need it.

651
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,430
You don't have to be so polite.

652
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,100
Since we're ordinary friends,

653
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,530
you don't need to do that.

654
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,830
I just picked up something.

655
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,340
This should be yours.

656
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,380
This...

657
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,630
This is for listening to music.

658
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,860
Lipman told me you studied in Germany.

659
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,620
But you don't know German at all.

660
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,500
I don't know why you think that.

661
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,850
I was the translator before you came.

662
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,860
Is it because Lipman isn't satisfied?

663
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,540
Do you think I don't understand your German?

664
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,290
Sorry, Mr. Fu. I have something to do.

665
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:38,060
See you.

666
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:39,540
If I were a little late,

667
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,690
the fact that you know little about German

668
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,460
will be exposed to everyone.

669
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:45,580
Su Yanxi.
