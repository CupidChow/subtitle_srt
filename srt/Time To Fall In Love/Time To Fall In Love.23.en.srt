4
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:38,940
Xixi.

5
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,050
Xixi, are you asleep?

6
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,979
Why are you sleeping so early?

7
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,039
Jinxi.

8
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,910
You're back.

9
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,530
Su Yanxi, what are you doing?

10
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,980
Who allowed you to see mom?

11
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,150
How dare you take her away?

12
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,500
He Jinxi.

13
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,470
What are you doing?

14
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,240
How dare you stop me?

15
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,470
Who do you think you are?

16
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,780
You keep bullying Xixi.

17
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,180
And...

18
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,380
You want to hit me now?

19
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,230
Listen,

20
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,030
if then I break your arms and legs,

21
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,400
don't say I didn't warn you.

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,190
How dare you.

23
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,620
You...

24
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,600
Miss He, don't you have a mouth?

25
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,050
Can't you talk properly?

26
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,079
Are you all bullying me?

27
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,570
Su Yanxi, you're so good.

28
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,970
You even found a group of assistants.

29
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,460
The dinner with Gu Xicheng this afternoon

30
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,620
was a trap, right?

31
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,200
You've been looking for clues since then,

32
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,510
so you came here,right?

33
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,020
Yes.

34
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,690
I lied to you on purpose.

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,510
I took your phone and found out where my mom was.

36
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,310
What's wrong?

37
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,810
You took mom away for half a year.

38
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,470
You didn't even give me a call.

39
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,080
Now that I found my mom,

40
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,100
I'll take her away.

41
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,900
Don't forget

42
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,950
I paid for her medical expenses.

43
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,670
I'm the one who accompanied her to operate abroad.

44
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,310
But you

45
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,870
just watch her die.

46
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,200
All your money was got through fraud.

47
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,130
So what?

48
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,220
I took money from Gu Xicheng,

49
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,680
you're not happy, are you?

50
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,020
Don't forget,

51
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,850
it's you who lied to him.

52
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,720
Xixi.

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,550
Xixi.

54
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,110
Boss.

55
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,060
Xixi.

56
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,120
Xicheng.

57
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,829
Your Xixi,

58
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,410
she bullied me.

59
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,670
She lied to me,

60
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,030
hit me

61
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,000
and took my mom away from me.

62
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,250
Xicheng.

63
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,250
I...

64
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,940
Who are you?

65
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,830
Who are you?

66
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,670
Xicheng.

67
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,310
I am...

68
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,320
She is Su Yanxi.

69
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,750
I am He Jinxi.

70
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,730
What?

71
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,360
Her name is Su Yanxi.

72
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,920
My name is He Jinxi.

73
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,900
We are twins.

74
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,740
Six months ago,

75
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:37,940
my face

76
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,540
looked exactly like hers.

77
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:42,500
But because of an accident,

78
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,020
I fixed my face.

79
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,750
But I'm the one who signed the contract with you, not her.

80
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,880
But I never thought

81
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,830
she would use my name

82
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,420
to be your girlfriend.

83
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:53,890
No.

84
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,170
No, mom.

85
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,390
She seduced you

86
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,490
and made you fall in love with her.

87
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,620
Now,

88
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,300
she not only cheated your trust,

89
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,340
but also coveted your property.

90
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,570
And she even wants to take my mom away.

91
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,190
No.

92
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,980
She's not only a liar,

93
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,960
but also a very bad woman.

94
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,980
Don't talk nonsense.

95
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:16,890
Shut up!

96
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,980
Xicheng, it's not like that.

97
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,910
Xicheng.

98
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,660
It's not like that.

99
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,360
Xicheng.

100
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,920
Xicheng, listen to me.

101
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,610
An'an, take care of mom for me.

102
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,590
He Jinxi, don't touch Mrs. He.

103
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,300
Get lost!

104
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,320
You'd better get lost!

105
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,990
Shut up!

106
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,000
No one can touch Mrs. He

107
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,070
until Su Yanxi and Boss come back.

108
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:45,990
He Jinxi.

109
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,730
If you touch Mrs. He again,

110
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,380
I'll call the police.

111
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:50,900
You...

112
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:52,890
You...

113
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,380
-Mom. -Auntie.

114
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:56,990
Mom!

115
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,350
Mrs. He, are you okay?

116
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,300
Xicheng.

117
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,830
Xicheng, wait for me!

118
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:09,820
Xicheng.

119
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,660
Xicheng.

120
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,210
Wait for me!

121
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,720
Gu Xicheng!

122
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,180
Gu Xicheng, wait for me!

123
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,640
Gu Xicheng!

124
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,230
Gu Xicheng!

125
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,410
Gu Xicheng!

126
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,260
Please listen to me.

127
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,050
OK.

128
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,250
Go ahead.

129
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:33,890
I'm listening.

130
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,590
Just now...

131
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,120
Just now.

132
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,710
I...

133
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,200
You don't know what to say.

134
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,290
Let me ask you.

135
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,350
Is what she said true?

136
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,300
Your real name is Su Yanxi

137
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,930
instead of He Jinxi.

138
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,260
She's really your twin sister.

139
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,960
She looked exactly like you.

140
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,710
The person who signed the contract with me

141
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,620
wasn't you.

142
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,470
So you really lied to me.

143
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,860
You came to me using her name

144
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:35,659
to take

145
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,020
that large contract money

146
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,420
to treat your mom, right?

147
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:38,909
No.

148
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,120
Xicheng, it's not like what you think.

149
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,960
Then why?

150
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,290
Fine.

151
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,310
Let me ask you again.

152
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,970
Why didn't you tell me

153
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,560
when you were in trouble?

154
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:03,850
If

155
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,350
you using her name came to Gu family

156
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,420
and came to me

157
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,710
for a reason,

158
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,120
then when your sister

159
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,150
came to the Gu family,

160
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,080
threatened you,

161
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,280
and made demands on you,

162
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,540
why didn't you tell me?

163
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,640
In your heart,

164
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,970
I'm someone you can't rely on,

165
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,800
you can't trust,

166
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,380
and you can't confess to, right?

167
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,620
No, Xicheng, listen to me.

168
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,060
I have no choice.

169
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,870
Or

170
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,050
in your heart,

171
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,710
even your feelings for me are fake?

172
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,400
How is that possible?

173
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:37,770
Then tell me

174
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,880
you've never lied to me,

175
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,120
and you love me.

176
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,660
Xicheng, Gu Xicheng.

177
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,240
I'm so disappointed in you.

178
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,460
Gu Xicheng.

179
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,060
Don't follow me.

180
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,550

194
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,030
♫ Wait for it to sprout slowly ♫

195
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,060
Then tell me

196
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,540
you've never lied to me,

197
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,470
♫ Wanted to leave ♫

198
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,000
and you love me.

199
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,690
♫ But still can't let go ♫

200
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,890
♫ Betray myself ♫

201
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,680
♫ Is the price for falling in love ♫

♫ You are my dream ♫

205
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,970

♫ Left with the final sentence saying you're also willing ♫

209
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,980
We promised

210

in the future,

211
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,270
no matter what happens,

212
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,060
we will always be together.

213
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,920

Xicheng.

no matter what happens in the future,

219
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,450
♫ Wait for it to sprout slowly ♫

220
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,740
we'll give each other time to talk

221
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,940
and give each other a chance to explain.

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,400
♫ Wanted to leave ♫

223
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,660
Don't fight.

♫ But still can't let go ♫

225
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,300

♫ Is the price for falling in love ♫

228

This necklace is very important to you.

229
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,860
But to me,

230
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,890
♫ You are my dream ♫

231
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,510
you're important to me.

♫ Left with the final sentence saying you're also willing ♫

238
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,540
I told you

239
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,690
I'll come.

240
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,520
I'll come.

241
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,100
No matter what happens,

242
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,200
the first person you think of

♫ You are my dream ♫

244
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:38,750
must be me.

♫ You also know my heart ♫

246
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,020
Xixi.

247
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,190
♫ Walking through the crowd ♫

248
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,340
I love you.

249
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,630
♫ Only your voice was there ♫

250
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,470
♫ You are my dream ♫

251
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,010
If one day

252
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,900
♫ Walked here ♫

253
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,820
I did something wrong,

254
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:05,240
♫ Left with the final sentence saying you're also willing ♫

255
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,900
will you forgive me?

256
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,040
No matter what you did,

257
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,480
or however you err,

258
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,540
I will always be the same,

259
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,490
loving you,

260
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,170
spoiling you,

261
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,520
and taking care of you.

262
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,330
Xixi.

263
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,930
Are you okay?

264
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,470
Why

265
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,430
your eyes are swollen like this?

266
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,500
Where is Gu Xicheng?

267
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,310
I deserve it.

268
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,740
I shouldn't have lied to him.

269
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,090
I shouldn't

270
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,950
appear in front of him again

271
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,380
and hurt him.

272
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,590
It's not your fault.

273
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,380
It's He Jinxi's.

274
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,160
She wants everything you have.

275
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,820
She always wants to set you up.

276
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,190
Don't blame yourself

277
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,670
for everything, okay?

278
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,390
I can't face him anymore.

279
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,460
I just want to protect my mom.

280
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,760
When she gets better,

281
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,010
I'll take her out of here.

282
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,530
What?

283
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,520
Calm down.

284
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,410
I'll talk to boss these days.

285
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,670
But now is not the time.

286
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,260
I've sent someone to watch the door.

287
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,460
He Jinxi can't get in.

288
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,180
The most important thing is

289
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,180
solving problems

290
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,540
not running away.

291
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,850
Yes.

292
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,700
You can't just run away.

293
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,830
Alright, Xixi.

294
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,650
You stay here with auntie

295
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,360
and have a rest.

296
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,390
Situ Shuo and I will go back to deal with something.

297
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,620
We'll pick you up

298
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,360
when Mrs. He gets better.

299
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,320
None of them came back.

300
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,500
What is she doing?

301
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,710
Stop pretending to be pitiful.

302
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,350
Don't think I will let you go

303
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,310
when Gu Xicheng knows everything.

304
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,350
I must get

305
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,930
what I want.

306
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,950
Do it now.

307
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:38,910
Okay.

308
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,170
Go.

309
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,530
Yes.

310
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,140
[Huayan]

311
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,040
Boss.

312
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,500
Boss!

313
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:02,670
Boss.

314
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,770
I apologize.

315
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,599
I'm sorry.

316
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,890
I accept the punishment.

317
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,670
You can fine me with annual bonus and salary.

318
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,540
Anything is fine.

319
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,400
Do you think this is about salary?

320
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,420
I know

321
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,200
it has nothing to do with salary or company.

322
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,470
After I knew this thing,

323
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,579
An'an and Su Yanxi asked me to keep it a secret.

324
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,119
I'm afraid you can't accept it.

325
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,050
I really don't know how to tell you.

326
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,930
Then choose the person you trust.

327
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,100
You can't take these pills.

328
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,770
Situ Shuo,

329
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,590
don’t think you can control me

330
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,840
after knowing me well.

331
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,640
You shouldn't have sent her to me

332
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,670
and let her lie to me.

333
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,950
Gu Xicheng, wake up!

334
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,660
She was forced to do everything.

335
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,930
She didn't mean to lie to you.

336
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,260
But she knew I love her.

337
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,790
So why did she hide everything from me?

338
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,050
If she really loves me,

339
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,690
she should confess to me.

340
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,550
But she didn't.

341
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,180
Yes.

342
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,950
She didn't tell you about her mistake.

343
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,620
But have you thought about why?

344
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,880
She's afraid that you can't accept it.

345
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,680
She's also afraid of losing you.

346
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,260
Everything she did was forced.

347
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,010
Su Yanxi is not someone

348
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,530
who loves you because of money.

349
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,210
Xicheng.

350
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,900
Are you willing to give up?

351
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,390
Mom, you're awake.

352
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,660
Are you feeling better?

353
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,340
I'll call the doctor for you.

354
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,710
Xixi.

355
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,600
I'm fine.

356
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,320
How are you?

357
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,380
Did your sister

358
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,250
give you a hard time again?

359
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,590
Mom.

360
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,090
I found you.

361
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,010
I have friends to help me.

362
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,810
She won't do anything to me.

363
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,530
Don't worry.

364
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,900
When you feel better,

365
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,550
I'll take you out of here

366
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,890
and never come back.

367
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,510
Xixi.

368
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,850
You took me away.

369
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,820
What about

370
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,320
the boy who likes you?

371
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,050
I don't know

372
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,640
what happened to you,

373
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,150
but I can see

374
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,660
the boy who came that day

375
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,770
likes you,

376
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:20,860
right?

377
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,750
What's wrong?

378
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,870
Don't tell me...

379
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,190
you broke up?

380
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,790
I'm sorry.

381
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,340
It's all my fault.

382
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,330
I didn't teach Jinxi well.

Why are you calling me?

393
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,400
I thought

394
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,300
you would never call me again.

395
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,630

You haven't contacted me for so long.

I don't know you.

428

I'm your father. You don't know me?

457

You don't have money to compensate,
