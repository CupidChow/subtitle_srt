373
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,660
Why didn't you answer my calls?

374
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,730
I was busy, so I didn't hear it.

375
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,540
Tell the truth.

376
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,950
I don't know what you mean.

377
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,320
I'm telling the truth.

378
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,630
Do you need me to explain it for you?

379
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,010
He Jinxi.

380
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,410
Where are you? I'll pick you up.

381
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,040
I have my private matters.

382
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,910
Sorry, Mr. Gu. It's none of your business.

383
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,620
Hello? Hello?

384
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,000
What happened to Miss He?

385
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,060
Is she okay?

386
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,410
Where is the restaurant you mentioned?

387
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,690
It's a little far from the company.

388
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,800
I'll go to my office and get my bag.

389
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,570
See you later.

390
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,340
Are you okay?

391
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:13,890
Don't care about him.

392
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,810
Foolish leader!

393
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,120
Why are you laughing?

394
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:24,950
Nothing.

395
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,570
Don't be angry.

396
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,120
Let's go. I'll treat you to dinner.

397
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,240
I promised I'll treat you.

398
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:30,780
Let's go.

399
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:48,880
Nangong.

400
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,800
Are you with Miss He?

401
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,840
Is she okay?

402
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,050
I heard she was in a bad mood.

403
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,300
You went out with her?

404
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,290
She's fine. Don't worry.

405
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,650
I hope so.

406
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:01,820
Boya,

407
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:05,050
when a girl is in a bad mood,

408
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,480
she'll be okay after eating a tasty meal.

409
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,500
Would you like to take Miss He to eat something good?

410
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:12,930
That's what I intend to do.

411
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,510
We are going to have dinner.

412
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,980
Do you have any good suggestions?

413
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,110
You asked the right person.

414
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,720
I know a restaurant

415
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,480
where its atmosphere and food are first-class.

416
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:25,610
I'll send you the address.

417
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,600
What should we eat?

418
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,810
Choosing a good restaurant is so difficult.

419
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,190
Well,

420
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,960
my friend recommended a restaurant that seems nice.

421
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
Do you want to try it?

422
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,020
Sure.

Director, you wanted to see me?

428
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,180
I've listed the plans for tomorrow

429
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
on the calendar.

430
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,570
You can go once you copied them.

431
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,640
Okay, Director.

Today, I'll

437
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,940
spend all my salary from Huayan

438
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,220
to vent my anger.

439
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,570
Excuse me.

440
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,220
Hello.

00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:19,690
Thank you.

442
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,410
The amount of dishes has to be in odd number too.

443
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,120
Three steaks, please.

444
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,820
Okay.

Here.

446
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,430
Do you want some puffs?

Okay.

451
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,130
Thank you.

452
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,660
Can you unfold the napkin for me?

453
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,340
Okay, that's all for now.

454
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:23,690
