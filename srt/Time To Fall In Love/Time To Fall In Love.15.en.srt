4
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,820
What do you think of

5
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,530
your little Shuoshuo's

6
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,759
heroic act of saving people just now?

7
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,820
My little Shuoshuo?

8
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,700
You can also call me

9
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,560
sweetheart.

10
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,740
Sweetheart?

11
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,100
Are you kidding?

12
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,220
Didn't expect that, did you?

13
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,650
I've improved.

14
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,780
Didn't expect that, did you?

15
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,979
I've improved too.

16
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,860
Don't follow me.

17
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,790
I'd better sleep on the sofa.

18
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,450
Don't move.

19
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,420
You're badly injured.

20
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,700
How can I let you sleep on the sofa?

21
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,829
That's not what a gentleman should do.

22
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,260
Bring me the medical kit please.

23
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,450
What's wrong? Does your foot still hurt?

24
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,460
I'll ask the doctor to come over.

25
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,320
It's not for me.

26
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,530
It's for you.

27
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,710
I saw everything when the box collapsed.

28
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,620
Is your shoulder okay?

29
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:19,850
I'm fine.

30
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,780
I'm really fine.

31
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,400
Okay.

32
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,440
I'll get the medical kit.

33
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,440

♫ Is this my wish? ♫

41
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,670

♫ Maybe insomnia ♫

43
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,779
No.

44
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,460
How is that possible?

45
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,100
♫ Is the price for falling in love ♫

46
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,140
A large area of your skin is swollen.

47
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,710
It must be painful.

48
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,060

I took care of myself.

♫ Walking through the crowd ♫

79
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,940

♫ Only your voice was there ♫

81

♫ Left with the final sentence saying you're also willing ♫

87

hurt you when you are by my side.

89
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,130
No one is allowed to hurt you

90
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:28,930
under my nose.

91
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:31,620
Xixi,

92
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,780
no matter what happens in the future,

93
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,380
the first person you think of

94
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,320
should always be me.

95
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,780
Got it?

96
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,230
♫ You are my dream ♫

Gu Xicheng, are you still awake?

104
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,180
Yes.

105
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,640
What's wrong?

106
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,580
I can't sleep.

107
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,220
Are you still thinking about what happened today?

108
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,110
When I think about what happened today,

109
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,140
I'm a little scared.

110
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,070
It's okay. I'll accompany you.

111
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,710
Try to sleep.

112
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,620
Sleep tight. Good night.

113
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,480
Morning.

114
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,660
Morning.

115
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,590
Did you sleep well?

116
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,320
Very well.

117
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,700
So I...

118
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,140
I slept on your arm all night.

119
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,000
Does your arm hurt?

120
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,940
I'm a man,

121
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,210
it's not easy for me to feel painful.

122
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,720
You can stay in bed longer.

123
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,520
I'll prepare breakfast for you.

124
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,700
It will be perfect

125
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,460
if all the days are sunny like today.

126
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,780
Hello?

127
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,300
Jinxi.

128
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,530
I'm your father.

129
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,750
Who?

130
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,500
Who are you?

131
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,030
I'm your father, He Zhendong.

132
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,180
Jinxi,

133
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,940
it's been ages since you came back to visit me.

134
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,500
I miss you so much.

135
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,250
And I almost get sick from missing you.

136
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,510
You should come back with Gu Xicheng of Huayan Group

137
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,650
to see me tomorrow.

138
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,300
If you don't bring him,

139
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,550
I'll go straight to you at Huayan.

140
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,890
No.

141
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,540
It's almost time.

142
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,590
They're coming.

143
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,060
Jinxi.

144
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,500
You're finally back.

145
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,060
Jinxi.

146
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,400
You're finally back.

147
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,110
Your Aunt Yazhen and I

148
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,540
miss you very much.

149
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,990
Dad.

150
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:51,670
Auntie.

151
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,380
Good girl.

152
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,740
Let's go inside first.

153
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,090
Let’s wait for Xicheng.

154
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,760
Mr. Gu.

155
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,260
Mr. Gu

156
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,020
is so handsome and talented.

157
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,340
This way, please.

158
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,380
Let's go.

159
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,440
Please.

160
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,150
Remember to take a photo with Gu Xicheng later.

161
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,260
Otherwise, when you talk about financing,

162
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,360
you won't be able to prove that he's our son-in-law.

163
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,480
I know what to do.

164
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,610
Come.

165
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,780
Xicheng, please have a seat with Jinxi.

166
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,710
I'll get you coffee in the kitchen.

167
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,400
We just received the coffee from South America.

168
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
It’s just boiled.

169
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,460
Mr. Gu, have a seat please.

170
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,530
Mr. Gu.

171
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,530
Mr. Gu.

172
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,010
Since we have a family reunion today,

173
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,690
how about

174
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,160
we take a family photo together?

175
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,800
Wang.

176
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,800
Take a photo for us.

177
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,510
Okay.

178
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:26,930
Yazhen.

179
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:27,940
Coming!

180
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,030
Yazhen, come here.

181
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,630
I don't want to take a photo.

182
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,890
Jinxi, take a photo please.

183
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,770
It's rare for us to be together today.

184
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,270
But I don't want to.

185
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,450
Why are you still

186
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,000
as sassy as a princess?

187
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,620
Come on, take a photo.

188
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,220
Don't embarrass your dad.

189

190
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,140
she didn't want to.

191
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,610
Fine, fine, fine. We won't take it.

192
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,010
We won't take photos if she doesn't want to.

193
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,080
Let’s have coffee.

194
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,040
Mr. Gu, please have a seat.

195
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,260
Have some coffee.

196
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,840
Here, have some coffee.

197
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,380
Jinxi,

198
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,340
you haven't come back to see me

199
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,380
for so many years.

200
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,620
I miss you so much.

201
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,470
When you're available,

202
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,690
you can live at home.

203
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,560
Jinxi is very used to living in my house.

204
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,420
She also gets along well with me.

205
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,990
So there's no need to move back.

206
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,190
Yes. Yes.

207
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,260
Jinxi,

208
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,300
I have a gift for you.

209
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,950
Come with me and have a look.

210
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,960
I'll be right back.

211
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,330
Okay.

212
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,120
Let's go.

213
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:11,180
Come.

214
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,790
Look.

215
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,010
Although you haven't lived at home for years,

216
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,690
I've always kept

217
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,640
your room tidy and clean.

218
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,800
Don't you think

219
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,550
I care about you a lot?

220
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,970
Thank you.

221
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,570
Thanks?

222
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,230
So,

223
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,620
shouldn't you repay me

224
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,140
for raising you all these years?

225
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,410
[The Investment Agreement]

226
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,880
[The Investment Agreement]

227
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,580
Your little gift

228
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,840
really surprised me.

229
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,830
I don't have that much money.

230
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,130
I'm sure you don't.

231
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,910
Ask him for it.

232
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,150
Let him take the money out.

233
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,820
This amount of money

234
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,250
can't be earned by ordinary people

235
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,720
during their whole life time.

236
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,600
But to him,

237
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,370
it can be earned within one day.

238
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,310
You want me to ask Xicheng for money?

239
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,590
What do you mean?

240
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,370
Why are you being so harsh?

241
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
Isn't it normal

242
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,760
to help each other out between couples?

243
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,950
I was blind recently

244
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,930
and failed in my investment.

245
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,030
This time,

246
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,740
you have to help me

247
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,070
earn all the money back with interest.

248
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,910
Let him

249
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,670
sign his name

250
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,410
Gu Xicheng on this,

251
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,530
and he will be able to save our He family.

252
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,460
He family has nothing to do with me.

253
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,220
Say it again.

254
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,580
There is a secret that

255
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,460
I didn't want to reveal.

256
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,860
But what you did today

257
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,170
seems to force me

258
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,850
to reveal it.

259
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,470
What are you going to do?

260
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,500
You haven't lived with me

261
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,660
for over ten years.

262
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,660
Don't you even remember

263
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,980
whose daughter you are?

264
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,300
Yanxi!

265
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,690
What nonsense are you talking about?

266
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,890
I'm talking nonsense?

267
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,020
Do you think I can't even recognize

268
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,950
my own daughter?

269
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,020
You're pretending to be others

270
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,550
in front of your own father.

271
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,880
There's something

272
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,460
I am sure you don't know.

273
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,620
After you and your mother left me,

274
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,150
your sister has never called me dad

275
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,300
for all these years.

276
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,920
What did you call me just now?

277
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,860
As soon as you called me dad outside,

278
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,900
I suspected you were not Jinxi.

279
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,980
Let me ask you.

280
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,140
Gu Xicheng of Huayan Group

281
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,690
still doesn't know

282
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,180
you are dating with him on behalf of your elder sister, right?

283
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,070
What do you want from me?

284
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,620
Don't be nervous.

285
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,340
I don't care

286
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,380
what you and your sister are doing.

287
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,810
You are all my children.

288
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,020
As long as you can help me,

289
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,700
you're good girls.

290
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,260
Do you understand, Yanxi?

291
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,400
Tell Xicheng the truth if you dare.

292
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,200
I promise you won't get a single penny.

293
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,600
Do you have to be so cruel?

294
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,740
Fine.

295
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,120
We're all dead anyway.

296
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,010
I'll drag you along.

297
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,580
Jinxi.

298
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,380
Take it.

299
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,880
What took you so long?

300
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,470
I'm worried about you. Let's go.

301
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,650
Aren't we going home?

302
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,470
I'll take you somewhere first.

303
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,500
What's wrong?

304
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,530
You look unhappy,

305
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,980
so I brought you here for some fresh air.

306
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,200
You can see that I'm in a bad mood?

307
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,560
It's all written on your face.

308
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,390
Here says "I'm unhappy."

309
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,340
And here says "I have something on my mind."

310
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,030
Do you want me to prepare some balloons

311
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,250
so that you can write your worries on them and let them fly away?

312
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,060
No need.

313
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,380
I just...

314
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,540
I wish I could live a life like this forever.

315
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:19,970
In the future?

316
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,580
I can still see such sky,

317
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,400
sea,

318
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,220
and the person by my side.

319
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,040
Xicheng,

320
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,080
no matter what happens in the future,

321
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,330
we have to give each other time to talk

322
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,740
and a chance to explain.

323
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,310
Let's not argue.

324
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,200
Let's not turn our backs and leave.

325
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,770
Is Nangong still your concern?

326
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,590
I've explained everything to her.

327
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,620
She's really not my ex-girlfriend.

328
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,370
No.

329
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,320
It's not about Nangong Liuli.

330
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,530
It's...

331
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,640
Xicheng.

332
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,430
I trust you.

333
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,340
I know.

334
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,920
I know how you feel.

335
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,750
Is your department on strike?

336
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,880
The director is not here. He Jinxi is not here either.

337
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,540
Our director is on sick leave.

338
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,430
As for Miss He,

339
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,120
she skipped work because no one can control her.

340
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,060
Her attendance report says she's out for work.

341
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,140
Don't always target others during working hours.

342
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,870
Don't you think this department is messy enough?

343
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,040
Hand these department files over this afternoon.

344
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,930
Miss Miqi, but I don't know how.

345
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,090
Miss,

346
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,780
can't you just say what you want quickly?

347
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,130
I have to go home early after work.

348
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,520
If he doesn't like me, he can just tell me.

349
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,210
What is this now?

350
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,940
He takes orders with me every day,

351
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,180
but he never mentioned that he likes me.

352
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,190
Isn't my behavior obvious enough?

353
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,640
I've forgiven him.

354
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,800
I think

355
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,590
maybe you're already obvious enough.

356
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,500
But

357
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,230
he just don't get it.

358
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,970
After all, your attitude towards him before...

359
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,250
Maybe he is afraid that you will hate him.

360
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,760
Xixi.

361
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,510
Why don't you ask him out now,

362
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,850
and ask him what he thinks.

363
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,740
Now?

364
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,750
Yes, right now!

365
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,940
Situ,

366
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,940
are you available now?

367
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,670
I want to talk to you about An'an.

368
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,100
So you mean

369
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,780
you won't pursue her?

370
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,500
I'm not afraid of being laughed by you.

371
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,600
I think I'm getting more and more timid.

372
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,970
After she forgives me,

373
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,030
I thought a lot about us.

374
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,440
I think she just doesn't hate me,

375
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,530

That's why she hated me.

Now I've decided that

387
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,180
I'll stay by her side silently

You know nothing about the past of Xicheng.

563
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,100
You have no idea what he is thinking.

564
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,750
You will never know the secret

565
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,400
he is hiding in his heart.

566
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,890
Since you can't walk deep into his heart,

567
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:57,390
it will make no difference even if you have him.

568
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,030
Xicheng won't be with you.

569
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,550
Never!

570
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,500
Don't overthink it.

571
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,210
Nangong is talking nonsense.

572
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,020
Calm down.

573
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,130
Today is Xicheng's birthday.

574
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,880
Don't overthink it.

575
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:47,640
How could someone have such a strange even number obsession?

576
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,630
Everything must be in even number.

577
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,840
He feels comfortable when seeing these.

578
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,400
But I

579
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,620
still feel a bit weird.

580
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,280
Lighter...

581
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,650
Where's the lighter?

582
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,010
The typhoon will land at 12:30am.

583
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,380
All units and citizens should

584
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,070
prepare for the coming storm.

585
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,840
[Situ Shuo]

586
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,840
[Cancelled the call][Answer the call]

587
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,670
[Situ Shuo]

588
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,670
[Cancelled the call]

589
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,010
Hello?

590
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,740
Boss.

591
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,700
Congratulations, you're turning 18.

592
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,740
I'm here to celebrate your birthday.

593
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,330
Sure. Which bar is it?

594
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,480
Send me the address.

595
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,490
Are you serious?

596
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,720
Are you really coming to me in such a bad weather?

597
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,110
Of course.

598
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,700
How can I refuse your hospitality?

599
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,810
Send me your location. I'll come to you.

600
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:53,610
I...

601
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,550
I'm...actually ... not here.

602
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,570
All right, just stay with your girlfriend.

603
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,030
You're not sincere at all.

604
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,010
You are really my best friend!

605
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,330
I won't go and

606
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,280
celebrate your birthday tonight.

607
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,680
But for the upcoming three days,

608
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,510
I'll celebrate your birthday with you

609
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,710
to express my regret.

610
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,600
Tonight, I'll give you and my landlady some private space to...

611
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,270
Shut up!

612
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,420
Xixi, where...
