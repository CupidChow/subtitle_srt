[Episode 6]

4
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,460
If I were a little late,

5
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,060
the fact that you know little about German

6
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,660
will be exposed to everyone.

7
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,900
Su Yanxi.

8
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,810
I don't know what you're talking about.

9
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,740
You do.

10
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,460
Don't avoid me, Yanxi.

11
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:54,620
I...

12
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,620
I don't know why you are here

13
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,740
or why you are

14
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,100
with Gu Xicheng.

15
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,980
But at that night in the hospital,

16
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,310
I heard that your friend

17
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,930
called you by your real name.

18
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,660
Later at the beach,

19
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,900
your reaction made me realize

20
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,110
that you were clearly Su Yanxi.

21
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,810
You had early recognized me?

22
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,340
Yes.

23
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,800
The reason why I kept it

24
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,200
is that I want to

25
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,940
find a chance to ask you alone

26
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,380
why you had become He Jinxi

27
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,700
and now date Gu Xicheng.

28
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,780
What's the relationship of you two?

29
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,860
It's a long story.

30
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,500
Are you really his girlfriend?

31
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,829
Or you have already...?

32
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,370
Actually...

33
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:53,940
Go. Let's go home.

34
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,060
Gu Xicheng.

35
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,180
I didn't finish my conversation with Mr. Fu yet.

36
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,700
Do I need to repeat that?

37
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,460
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu. With your attitude,

38
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,300
I'm afraid you can't take her away.

39
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,500
Say it again.

40
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,990
She is my friend.

41
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,940
I won't allow anyone

42
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:18,780
to force her anywhere

43
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,620
or even put her in danger.

44
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,340
Are you her friend?

45
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,700
Of course.

46
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,060
She's not my girlfriend.

47
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,540
Instead, she is my fiancée.

48
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,700
So, I'm taking my girl home.

49
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,500
It's none of your business.

50
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,580
How could it be?

51
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,300
Will she leave her phone aside all day long?

52
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,459
[An'an, are you there? Please accept me.]

53
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,940
An'an, are you there? Please accept me.

54
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,930
I now inform you that I've blacklisted you.

55
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:28,750
[I now inform you that I've blacklisted you.]

56
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,900
Blacklist me?

57
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,540
I asked to have your WeChat

58
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,870
but you blacklisted me.

59
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,670
Is it that you misunderstand Fu Boya and me again?

60
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,930
We two are just...

61
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,700
Can't you tell me that before you stop the car?

62
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,900
I almost hit my head.

63
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,900
Now I give you time. Explain.

64
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,300
Explain for what? I have nothing to explain.

65
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,580
Do you think I am unaware of

66
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,420
your little tricks?

67
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,260
Lipman is important to our company.

68
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,220
As you know little about German,

69
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,820
why didn't you tell me?

70
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,140
And why did you get a simultaneous interpreter?

71
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,140
Why did you always take risks?

72
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,380
You've known that?

73
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,020
So,

74
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,300
you would rather tell Fu Boya

75
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,760
than me about your difficulties.

76
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,860
I didn't.

77
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,020
I didn't tell him myself.

78
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,750
It's he himself who found that.

79
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,260
Besides, Fu Boya and I

80
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,820
don't have any relationship.

81
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,260
We're just friends.

82
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,860
Friends again.

83
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,260
Why would a friend send shoes to your home?

84
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,540
Why would a friend

85
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,780
force you to celebrate his birthday with him?

86
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,220
And why would a friend

87
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,740
offer his suit for you to wear?

88
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,980
I didn't wear.

89
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,700
And it was he who asked me

90
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,260
to celebrate his birthday.

91
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,860
It was he that made a present of

92
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,380
what he received from his client.

93
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,640
I have refused. And what else should I do?

94
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,740
Gu Xicheng,

95
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,820
why do you keep focusing on

96
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,900
Fu Boya and me?

97
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,980
I've said that

98
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,820
we had no relationship.

99
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,100
Why do you still get mad?

100
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,340
Don't you think

101
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,740
you've gone too far?

102
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,140
I did agree to sign the contract

103
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,610
and be your girlfriend during the contract period.

104
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,380
But you shouldn't interfere

105
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,380
in my social life.

106
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
I didn't.

107
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,620
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

108
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,820
I'll take a taxi home.

109
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,170
He Jinxi. He Jinxi. He Jinxi.

110
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,180
He is annoying, isn't he?

111
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,700
He kept reminding me of the contract

112
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,980
and had a big fight with Fu Boya.

113
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,420
Although I signed a contract with him,

114
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,180
I didn't sell myself.

115
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,940
Gu Xicheng was so hostile to Fu Boya.

116
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,360
It's beyond what the contract contains.

117
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,620
Could it be that he has a crush on you?

118
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,260
How could that be?

119
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,260
Come on, sis.

120
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,990
Save you fertile imagination.

121
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,620
If he does,

122
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,100
I'll reverse my name and take his surname.

123
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,940
Gu Xiyansu?

124
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,980
Lu An'an, are you serious?

125
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,180
OK. I was wrong.

126
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,780
Well, wait.

127
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,090
You said Fu Boya had recognized you.

128
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,700
Will he betray you?

129
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,150
When I was talking to Fu Boya,

130
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,800
Gu Xicheng suddenly appeared.

131
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,950
So our conversation was interrupted.

132
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,650
But I guess

133
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,810
Fu Boya won't tell others.

134
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,620
An'an, let's stop here.

135
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,480
Gu Xicheng.

136
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,820
Gu Xicheng, what's wrong?

137
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,790
I'll go for Aunt Mei.

138
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,630
Don't move.

139
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,180
I'm okay.

140
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,880
I just have a stomachache.

141
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,580
A stomachache?

142
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,690
Come on.

143
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,700
Lie on the bed first.

144
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,440
Why would you have a stomachache?

145
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,380
Is it because of the dinner?

146
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,120
I can't eat spicy food.

147
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,500
Why didn't you tell me then?

148
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,159
I even put the chilli sauce...

149
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,539
I'll ask Aunt Mei for medicine.

150
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,799
Don't bother Aunt Mei.

151
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,630
Grandma will be disturbed.

152
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,420
But...

153
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,210
Well.

154
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,740
You should lie down.

155
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:53,620
Here.

156
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,660
Be careful.

157
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,400
You lie down for a while

158
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,790
and I will quietly go

159
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,700
to see if I can find any medicine.

160
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,300
Why are there so many medicines?

161
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,710
[Sedative and Heart-invigorating Pill]

162
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,150
To soothe the nerves...

163
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,630
No.

164
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,690
A psychiatric prescription medicine.

165
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,420
Not this.

166
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:36,820
Painkiller.

167
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,550
Painkiller.

168
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,180
His health matters.

169
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,340
Here.

170
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,040
Take the medicine, okay?

171
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,780
I won't die.

172
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,140
Are you still mad at me?

173
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,920
Take the medicine first.

174
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,020
If you don't, I'll resort to compulsion

175
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,350
and put the medicine in.

176
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,960
Here.

177
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,570

What do you mean by that?

372
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,010
Even if all men were dead,

373
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,890
I won't have any feelings for him.

374
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,940
Even if the seas ran dry and the rocks crumbled,

375
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,250
I'll insist on approaching Lu An'an and dating her.

376
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,340
Wish you success.

377
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,140
With my previous performance,

378
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,600
she must have had a crush on me.

379
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Now I only need to follow up a victory with hot pursuit.

380
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,900
But boss,

381
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,230
you're not bad, either.

382
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,480
I've never seen you scolding a guy so harshly.

383
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,270
Same to you.

384
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,310
You're back.

385
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,780
This one.

386
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,110
What a beautiful necklace.

387
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,020
What is this for?

388
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,190
I received an invitation to a charity auction.

389
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,450
I want you to go with me.

390
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,080
This is our donation item.

391
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,180
Shall I go?

392
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:00,810
Yes.

393
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,900
Don't you want to go?

394
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,050
Because you said that

395
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,450
our relationship wouldn't be made public.

396
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:14,650
Then,

397
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,370
what status am I as I go with you?

398
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,600
For grandma,

399
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,000
she'll think you as my fiancee.

400
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,420
But for others,

401
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,690
you are now a secretary of Huayan.

402
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,620
Keep this necklace.

403
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,280
The organizer will send someone to pick it up.

404
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,940
You'd better get ready early.

407
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,720
this is what your grandma left behind.

408
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,210
I thought

409
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,300
I wound take it

410
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,330
as a last resort.

411
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,190
Now we are in a plight.

412
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,480
Take it.

00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:25,690
This...

414
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,230
This is Angel's Tear.

415
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,400
Mom, I won't sell it.

416
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,980
Don't worry about money.

417
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,300
I will find a way.

418
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,140
Just listen to me and take it.

419
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,780
What if you couldn't?

423
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,260
So,

424
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,400
you're going to that charity party?

425
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,940
I've never been to a place like that.

426
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,630
Forget it. I'll play to the score.

427
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,480
Then have you get a full dress?

428
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,630
A full dress?

429
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,900
Really? Didn't Gu Xicheng prepare that for you?

430
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,650
He...

431
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,580
Maybe he forgot it.

432
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,640
Or he didn't realize that.

433
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,960
Ask him then.

434
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,390
He asked you to go,

435
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,330
so it makes sense for him to prepare.

436
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,250
I'm too embarrassed to say that.

437
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,320
Forget it. I'll figure it out myself.

438
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,800
I'll ask him if I really can't.

00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,340

00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,780
I don't know when you

559
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,060
saw through my secret.

560
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,130
But I didn't mean to lie to you.

561
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,790
He Jinxi and I

562
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,810
are twins.

563
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:33,830
Twins?

564
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,260
We were forced to separate and grow up alone

565
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,840
because of our parents.

566
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:44,780
No wonder.

567
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,500
So...

568
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,520
So I really didn't mean to lie to you.

569
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,110
I have my own reasons

570
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,680
to stay with Gu Xicheng.

571
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,030
So Gu Xicheng

572
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,510
doesn't know your real identity.

573
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,320
That was why he said you were his girlfriend.

574
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,760
Yes. He doesn't.

575
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,150
Although I don’t

576
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,460
know much about Gu Xicheng,

577
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,300
but as far as I know him in business circle,

578
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,900
he won't forgive you

579
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,490
if he knows that you're lying to him.

580
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,180
You might get yourself in danger.

581
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:31,620
Xixi,

582
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,830
it's too risky for you to do this.

583
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,910
You'd better stay away from him.

584
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,860
That's why I'm here to ask you to

585
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,370
keep this secret for me.

586
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,500
Before I leave safely,

587
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,260
don't let Gu Xicheng know that.

588
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,450
And anyone either.

589
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,660
Please.

590
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,730
Don't worry.

591
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,900
I will keep the secret for you.

592
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,050
Xixi.

593
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,420
although I don't know

594
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,440
what it is that

595
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,320
makes you take such a big risk,

596
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,810
I want to tell you that

597
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,050
it is lucky of us to meet

598
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,540
as we've been out of touch for years.

599
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,460
I will always be with you

600
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,420
and by your side.

601
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,250
Whatever difficulty you encounter,

602
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,540
you should tell me.

603
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,870
I will surely help you. Is that okay?

604
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,000
Thank you.

605
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,790
Well.

606
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,650
Now you've rejected that dress.

607
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,890
So what are you going to do now?

608
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,810
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

609
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,590
Fu Boya agreed to keep it a secret for me.

610
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,990
It's already a big favor.

611
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,100
How could I

612
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,640
accept the dress?

613
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,010
Besides,

614
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,190
if Gu Xicheng knows that，

615
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,910
there must be another misunderstanding.

616
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,560
See what a situation you are in.

617
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,690
Contract girlfriend as you are,

618
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:13,460
you're acting like Gu Xicheng's real lover.

619
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,060
What?

620
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,290
Are you afraid he'll be jealous?

621
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,449
What are you saying?

622
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,139
I have nothing to do with him.

623
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,420
Why are you talking nonsense?

624
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:24,530
Really?

625
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,480
Then why do you blush?

626
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,909
Alright, I'll stop teasing you.

627
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,670
Luckily, I've early expected that.

628
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,179
I've ordered

629
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,690
a handmade dress online.

630
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:42,570
It looks similar to

631
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,389
the latest one of a designer brand.

632
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:46,179
But it costs little.

633
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,870
It's definitely top-quality. No one will see it.

634
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,100
An'an, when did you...?

635
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,590
The moment when I knew

636
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,350
you went for Fu Boya.

637
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,409
I knew you would refuse

638
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,760
with your personality.

639
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,400
So I prepared it as there's still time.

640
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,860
An'an, you're the best.

641
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,670
Disgusting.

642
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,710
[Kangaroo Express]

643
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
A dress?

644
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,940
Why did He Jinxi buy

645
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,160
such a bad imitation?

646
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,510
Doesn't she

647
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,740
have a proper one for the charity party?

648
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,820
Prepare something for me.

649
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,420
With your anger, I can feel

650
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,340
your fear of intimacy

651
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,040
is collapsing bit by bit.

652
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:01,830
Do you mean that

653
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,950
my contact with her works?

654
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,300
What's next?

655
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,770
Continue to approach Lu An'an.

656
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:11,970
You can refer to

657
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,030
a common date.

658
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:16,540
Date?

659
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,610
Remember to exert your strength.

660
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,340
My strength?

661
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,060
Thick-skinned and persistent.

662
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,110
Who is there?

663
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:37,920
Pretty lady,

664
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,000
will you go on a date with me?

665
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,240
No.

666
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,630
An'an, let's date.

667
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,070
You rascal.

668
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,700
An'an. An'an

669
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,640
Go on a date with me.

670
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,530
No way.

671
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,930
You rascal!

672
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,880
Isn't that enough?

673
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,490
How can I take orders if you keep doing this?

674
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,710
If you agree to go on a date with me,

675
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,240
I won't bother you anymore.

676
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,670
You're such a rascal.

677
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,440
Fine. Let's just date.

678
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,390
Wait and see.

679
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:45,850
Really?

680
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:46,970
Yes.

681
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,220
But from now on,

682
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,380
stop following me.

683
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,770
Hello, a package for He Jinxi.

684
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,750
Thank you.

685
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,710
You're welcome.

686
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,640
Whose package is it?

687
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,030
Shall I open it or not?

688
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,870
It seems mine. Let me see.

689
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,180
It's mine.

690
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,030
What did you buy? It's a big one.

691
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,170
Just some personal stuff.

692
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,890
Mr. Gu, leave it to me as you are engaged.

693
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,260
I'm going back to my room.
