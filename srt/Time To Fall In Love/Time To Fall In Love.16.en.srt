00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,700
leave me?

380
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,290
There are too many obstacles between us.

381
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,510
We...

382
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,850
Xixi.

383
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,260
I don't care how many obstacles are between us.

384
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,320
Nangong Liuli, Fu Boya,

385
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,380
our past,

386
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:13,880
or my even number obsession.

387
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,410
These are not our problems.

388
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:17,810
Xixi.

389
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,480
I like you...

390
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,840
more than you can imagine.

391
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,920
I like you more than I expected.

392
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,780
I just want you to stay by my side.

393
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,250
Xixi!

394
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,460
Gu Xicheng!

395
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,460
♫ Admit it ♫

396
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,240
♫ I just can't help missing you ♫

397
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,210
♫ Don't tell him ♫

398
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,410
♫ But eyes don't lie ♫

399
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,800
♫ Time can tell ♫

400
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,010
♫ Is this my wish? ♫

401
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,170
♫ Maybe insomnia ♫

402
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:34,030
♫ Is the price for falling in love ♫

403
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,840
♫ You know it ♫

404
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,490
♫ I don't know much loving words ♫

405
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,300
Oh my god.

406
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,510
♫ Plant a flower ♫

407
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,940
Luckily I stopped you just now.

408
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,580
Otherwise, the boss would scold me to death.

409
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:47,770
♫ Wait for it to sprout slowly ♫

410
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,220
I didn't expect the president to

411
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,820
kiss in the rain

412
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,090
♫ Wanted to leave ♫

413
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,610
so passionately.

414
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,400
♫ But still can't let go ♫

415
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,440
♫ Betray myself ♫

416
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,620
An'an.

417
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,020
What do you think I want to do now?

418
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:01,460
♫ Is the price for falling in love ♫

419
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,880
♫ You are my dream ♫

420
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,520
♫ You also know my heart ♫

421
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,580
♫ Walking through the crowd ♫

422
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,600
♫ Only your voice was there ♫

423
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,670
♫ You are my dream ♫

424
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,190
♫ Walked here ♫

425
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:29,610
♫ Left with the final sentence saying you're also willing ♫
