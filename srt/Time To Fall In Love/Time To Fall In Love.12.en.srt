the Super Moon,

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,620

Since 1948,

So our R&D department

275

The theme of the moon

283
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,030
was inspired by

284
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,560
my personal experience five years ago when I was in college.

285
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,840

I'm sorry.

396
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,260
Recently,

397
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,030
I neglected your feelings.

398
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,940
Because of the arrival of Nangong,

399
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,540
I thought of you as someone who has rich experience

400
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,870
like her.

401
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,090
I forgot

402
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,910
you've been a live streamer.

403
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,460

405
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:06,970
I shouldn't have blamed you.

406
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,380
You need time to study.

407

408
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,460
I should be the on who should give you the most time.

409
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,220
I also ignored

410
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,970
the time we spent together.

411
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,710

417
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,390
forgive me?

418
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,690
