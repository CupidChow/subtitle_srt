193
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,060
Why are you so nice to me?

♫ To confess to you ♫

195
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,340

♫ Maybe it's an accident ♫

197
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,330
♫ Maybe it's the weather ♫

198
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,260
When did you prepare this?

199
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,020
I don't know about it at all.

It's like

232
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,910

Miss He Jinxi,

248
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,090
due to your serious personal credit problems,

249
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,260
the bank has froze all your credit cards.

250
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,260
Please bring your personal ID

Who are you to freeze my cards?

254
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,620
Why would you say I have a personal credit problem?

255
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,380
Hello? Hello?

256
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,440
Sorry, it's still not going through.

Fine, I won't stay here.

261
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,350
Let me tell you.

262
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,420
I have plenty of places to stay.

263
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:43,950
Hello?

264
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,460
Hello?

265
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,460
Darling,

266
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,500
I just came back from abroad today.

267
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,300
Can I stay at your place tonight?

268
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,540
Hello?

269
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,820
Hello?

270
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,330
Hello.

271
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,860
The subscriber you have dialed is busy now.

272
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,500
Please try again later.

273
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,700
You used to call me Miss Jinxi.

274
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,760
It sounded so nice.

275
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,900
But now, you're all gone.

276
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,330
Why can Su Yanxi

277
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,480
live in the House of Gu so comfortably?

278
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,980
Everything was supposed to belong to me.

279
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,980
What's wrong?

280
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,140
Xicheng,

281
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,700
I have something to tell you.

282
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:50,950
Go ahead.

283
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,260
Actually, I...

284
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,080
Xicheng, Jinxi.

285
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,060
Aunt Mei?

286
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,180
Why are you back? Where's Grandma?

287
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,609
Madam is back too.

288
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,310
Madam is in good health recently.

289
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,619
She's also in a good mood.

290
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:12,060
She was discussing with me to travel abroad.

291
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,890
So we came to see you before we depart.

292
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:17,829
By the way,

293
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,290
what did you want to tell me just now?

294
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,579
Nothing.

295
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,880
By the way, Miss Jinxi,

296
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,650
a relative of yours is here.

297
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,220
She's chatting with Madam.

298
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,570
Relative?

299
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:30,790
Let's go.

300
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,070
Let's go.

301
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,620
Madam, you are so cute.

302
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,060
Madam, they're back.

303
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,990
Jinxi, this is...

304
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,500
Jinxi, it's been a long time. I miss you so much.

305
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,380
Jinxi, Xicheng, come and have a seat with Grandma.

306
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,500
Go.

307
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,410
Come. Come.

308
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:08,050
It's boring to stay in a nursing home.

309
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,860
It's not fun at all.

310
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,470
I miss you, Jinxi.

311
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,610
Grandma.

312
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,950
Jinxi, seeing you being surrounded by love,

313
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,520
I'm happy for you.

314
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,060
This must be Jinxi's fiance.

315
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,920
Let me introduce myself.

316
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm Jinxi's cousin, Su Yanxi.

317
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,900
Jinxi.

318
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,850
You won't blame me

319
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,480
for coming over so suddenly, right?

320
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,000
No, I won't.

321
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,690
It's such a coincidence.

322
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,940
Mei and I just entered the porch.

323
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,700
Then, we saw Yanxi sitting at the door with her luggage.

324
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,700
Not bad. Not bad.

325
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,410
It's good to take a walk.

326
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,230
You're right.

327
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,740
I need to rest once I go back.

328
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,100
Who is this?

329
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,340
I don't know.

330
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,930
Eat more.

331
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,280
Madam, thank you so much.

332
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,620
I just wanted to meet Jinxi quietly,

333
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,500
but I didn't expect to disturb you.

334
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,780
Not at all.

335
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,060
You are Jinxi's cousin.

336
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,860
We'll be relatives from now on.

337
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,650
You can tell me if you need help.

338
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,030
In order to treat my mom,

339
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,540
I mortgaged my house.

340
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,390
And now the house has been taken away.

341
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,340
I had no choice but to find Jinxi.

342
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,360
Such a poor girl.

343
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,820
What are you going to do now?

344
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,730
I want to borrow some money from Jinxi.

345
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:18,970
But don't worry.

346
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,850
I won't

347
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,740
leech on to her.

348
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,480
I just want to have a place to live.

349
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,450
Then, I'll find a job.

350
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,420
I will pay her back.

351
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,490
I don't have to live well.

352
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,610
I just need a bed.

353
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:38,650
You're...

354
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,970
You're a girl.

355
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,390
You can't live like that.

356
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,230
How about this?

357
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,880
This is a big house anyway.

358
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,720
You can stay here first.

359
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,010
I can't disturb you too much.

360
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,740
And I heard that

361
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,870
Jinxi's fiance is here too.

362
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,750
I'm afraid it's not so convenient.

363
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,100
It's okay.

364
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,390
When they come back,

365
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,200
we'll talk about it.

366
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,090
Okay.

367
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,300
Here, eat.

368
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,580
Here.

369
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,180
Thank you.

370
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,440
Eat.

371
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,680
Yanxi told me

372
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,230
you two grew up together.

373
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,460
You were close.

374
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,400
So I took it upon myself and

375
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:44,010
let Yanxi stay in the guest room first.

376
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,380
Xixi, do you blame me for being nosy?

377
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,670
I don't. Grandma,

378
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,290
I know you meant well.

379
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,280
How about this?

380
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,100
When Jinxi's cousin finds a job,

381
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,180
I'll rent her an apartment

382
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,180
near the company.

383
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,610
It'll be more convenient for her too.

384
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,010
Jinxi, what do you think?

385
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,740
Mr. Gu,

386
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,780
thank you so much.

387
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,420
Grandma, I have something

388
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,860
to talk to my cousin alone.

389
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,260
Sure. You two haven't

390
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,180
met for so long.

391
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,620
You must have a lot to talk about.

392
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,130
Grandma, let me take you back to your room.

393
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,340
By the way, I have a flight tomorrow.

394
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,930
You two talk.

395
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,770
Where is my room?

396
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,950
Cousin.

397
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:42,610
Come with me.

398
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,670
What are you doing?

399
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,860
I told the truth to Madam.

400
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,540
In order to treat mom,

401
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,810
I don't even have a place to stay.

402
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,400
What's wrong with taking me in for a few days?

403
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,930
How long will you stay here?

404
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,580
Until...

405
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,260
you get the three million yuan.

406
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,140
He Jinxi, don't go too far.

407
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,880
I covered up the truth for you.

408
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,710
How dare you say I went too far?

409
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,190
You're so ungrateful.

410
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,860
I'll get my money, and you'll get to see mom.

411
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,910
Isn't that good?

412
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,020
Su Yanxi,

413
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,980
you have a huge advantage now.

414
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,050
I advise you to be content.

415
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,280
Don't force me.

416
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,540
I'll tell everything to Xicheng.

417
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,300
We'll just die together.

418
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,360
You don't want to see mom anymore?

419
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,240
As long as I don't tell you,

420
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,840
you will never see her again.

421
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,130
If Gu Xicheng is capable,

422
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,620
let him search all the nursing homes

423
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,620
around the world.

424
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,250
But you know foreign hospitals.

425
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,050
Mom will be kicked out

426
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,060
once I stop paying the hospital.

427
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,650
She just had surgery, and

428
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,080
she can't speak foreign languages.

429
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:19,970
I'm afraid...

430
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,640
Shut up!

431
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,410
Su Yanxi has been stupid since she was young.

432
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,980
Even she can handle Gu Xicheng.

433
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,330
Why can't I?

434
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,250
If I can get him,

435
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,460
then everything will be mine.

436
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,070
How should I tell Xicheng the truth?

437
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:20,740
Xixi?

438
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,990
I'm thirsty. I need a cup of water.

439
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,820
I'll go back to the bedroom soon.

440
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,980
What's wrong?

441
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,410
Nothing.

442
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,100
If anything happened,

443
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,420
you must tell me, okay?

444
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,440
Jinxi, you're here.

445
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,610
I'm here to see if there are

446
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,200
any ingredients in the fridge.

447
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,840
Madam Gu took me in kindly.

448
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,190
I want to cook something nice tomorrow

449
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,590
to express my gratitude.

450
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,030
I won't bother you if you're here.

451
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,220
Jinxi, what's wrong?

452
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,780
I know you're worried about my mom.

453
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,940
Don't worry. She's recovering well.

454
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,980
Once I arranged everything

455
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,480
after some time,

456
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,060
I'll arrange for you to meet her, okay?

457
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,860
If so,

458
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,390
that is the best.

459
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,560
Xixi, if you're worried about your elder,

460
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,150
I can arrange it for you.

461
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,020
No, Mr. Gu.

462
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,500
I'm very grateful

463
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,240
to be able to stay at your place.

464
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,840
I won't trouble you anymore.

465
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,970
It's late. Miss Su, go and rest early.

466
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,620
Let's go back.

467
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,500
What's wrong?

468
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,840
You can't sleep?

469
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,000
If you have something on your mind,

470
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,060
you must tell me, okay?

471
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,760
Good night.

472
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,580
These were supposed to belong to me.

473
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,050
You're smiling brightly.

474
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,480
But you won't be happy for long.

475
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,470
Gu Xicheng and Su Yanxi sleep in different beds?

476
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,500
If they really love each other,

477
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,520
why do they sleep in different beds?

478
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,500
Or

479
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,160
there are some problems between them?

480
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,480
If there are many problems between them,

481
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,710
then I'll have a higher chance

482
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,200
to get Gu Xicheng.

483
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,330
[Huangshanyue]
