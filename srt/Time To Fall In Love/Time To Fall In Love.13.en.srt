264
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,350
But you're not my medicine.

What now?

375
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,150
Did something happen at work again?

376
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,270
Or...

377
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,820
It's all because of Miss He.

378
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,380
I didn't expect it.

379
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,630
She looks gentle and weak,

380
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,300
but she's really tough.

381
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,920
She's still holding on in front of me.

382
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,290
Fine, I'll show her

383
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,790
who is tougher.

384
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,440
Nangong, stop it.

385
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,100
If this goes on, both of you will be hurt,

386
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,420
or only you'll get hurt.

387
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,260
You're on my side, right?

388
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,330
Nangong.

389
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,830
If you're on my side,

390
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,340
don't stop me.

391
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,700
If I lose this war,

392
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,120
I'll lose everything.

393
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:40,810
Drive.

394
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,540
Take me to a place.

395
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,480
I want my belongings back.

396
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,420
This is my last chance. I can't lose.

397
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,460
And I won't lose.

398
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,450
Why isn't she here yet?

399
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,530
Why are you so late?

400
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,100
There's no rush to design the product.

401
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,750
There's still a long time before the launch.

402
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,180
Come.

403
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,800
What's wrong?

404
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,340
What happened?

405
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,750
Did the R&D team bully you?

406
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,940
Or did Nangong tell you something?

407
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,410
I'll ask Situ to bring her here.

408
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,330
I trust you.

409
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,530
What?

410
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,310
Gu Xicheng, I trust you.

411
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,290
If Nangong Liuli is your ex-girlfriend,

412
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,310
please end your relationship with her nicely

413
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,340
before coming to me.
