[Episode 22]

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,460
Come out and drink with me.

5
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,720
Did you quarrel with Miss He again?

6
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,870
Because of that cousin?

7
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,870
There must be something wrong with her cousin.

8
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,110
What's wrong?

9
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,130
She actually came to me behind Xixi's back.

10
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:32,660
This is not

11
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,410
what a normal cousin should do.

12
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,829
In private...

13
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,870
Did she do anything to you?

14
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,410
That's over.

15
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,340
I told Xixi that

16
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,700
I could rent an apartment for her cousin

17
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,140
so that she can leave our house as soon as possible.

18
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,340
But she didn't agree.

19
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,960
I don't know what she's holding on to.

20
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,200
But I always feel there's something strange

21
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,730
between her and her cousin.

22
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,090
By the way,

23
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,200
please check

24
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,700
her cousin's background and experiences.

25
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,470
Be quick.

26
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,470
You want me to check it?

27
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,450
Or who should?

28
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,740
Okay, I'll check it.

29
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,910
But you have to give me some time.

30
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,860
I have to investigate it slowly

31
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,940
and carefully.

32
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,650
He Jinxi.

33
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,380
You went to Xicheng behind my back?

34
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,200
Do I have to report to you

35
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,190
of our talkings in private?

36
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,450
Don't go too far.

37
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,380
Su Yanxi.

38
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,990
It's you who occupied my place.

39
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,510
I just want to take back what belongs to me.

40
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,350
My feelings for Xicheng

41
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,850
have nothing to do with the contract.

42
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,160
Really?

43
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,380
Why don't you dare

44
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,250
tell him your true identity?

45
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,820
If you have the courage to confess to him,

46
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,180
I won't have any chance.

47
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,580
All crows are black.

48
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,520
Don't only judge me, reflect on yourself too.

49
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,700
How can I make you stop?

50
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,320
Please give my mom back to me.

51
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,040
It's quite simple.

52
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:41,930
First,

53
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,159
get three million from Gu Xicheng.

54
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,500
You still want more?

55
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,590
Second,

56
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,530
Gu Xicheng

57
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,170
has a deep prejudice against me.

58
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,320
I don't want to leave him this kind of impression.

59
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,720
I want to have dinner with him alone.

60
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,250
Make an arrangement for us.

61
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,360
You're daydreaming!

62
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,560
I won't arrange this for you.

63
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,830
So heartless.

64
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,920
Then you'll never

65
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,430
see Mom again.

66
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,460
Don't threaten me with Mom anymore.

67
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,750
I will never do the amoral thing

68
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,190
and hurt others

69
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,340
for you.

70
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:15,970
Okay.

71
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,580
But let me make this clear.

72
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,810
There's a limit to my patience.

73
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,940
Three days.

74
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,600
I only give you three days to prepare.

75
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,000
If I can't get three million,

76
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,690
and if...

77
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,190
I can't have dinner

78
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,460
with Gu Xicheng alone,

79
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,940
then I'll expose you

80
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,350
in front of everyone.

81
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,600
And I'll take Mom away

82
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,150
so that you'll never see her again.

83
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,190
He Jinxi.

84
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,260
Don't go too far.

85
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,090
How I do depends on

86
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,409
your performance.

87
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,410
Three days.

88
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,980
You only have three days left.

89
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,330
Xicheng.

90
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,630
What should I do to meet my mother

91
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,820
without hurting you?

92
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,370
You're back.

93
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,500
Why are you sleeping on the sofa?

94
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,900
Let me take you to the bed.

95
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,420
You drank, didn't you?

96
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,560
Are you mad at me?

97
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,470
No.

98
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,920
I just had a chat with Situ.

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,570
Really?

100
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,260
I wasn't mad at you.

101
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,290
What I said this afternoon

102
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,150
was all out of anger.

103
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,830
Your cousin came to visit you,

104
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,159
so you should keep her stay with you.

105
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,190
Since you don't want her to leave,

106
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,350
I'll let you decide.

107
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,590
Xicheng, why have you always been so nice?

108
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,250
You're the one I love.

109
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,440
I should be nice to you.

110
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,760
You are so nice to me.

111
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,450
I...

112
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,830
Alright.

113
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,740
Don't think too much.

114
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,280
No.

115
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,890
I can't go on like this.

116
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,140
I can't be dragged away by Jinxi.

117
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,660
I must find my mom as soon as possible.

118
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,159
Why isn't she here yet?

119
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,550
Here she comes.

120
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,620
Xixi, you're finally here.

121
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,210
Come in.

122
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:52,920
Come in.

123
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,240
Come in.

124
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,240
Have a seat.

125
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,280
I have to wait until Xicheng left.

126
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,620
And I asked for a leave from the supervisor,

127
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,080
so I am late for seeing you.

128
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,540
What did the boss tell you?

129
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,060
What's wrong?

130
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,910
I had a drink with the boss before.

131
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,040
He has suspected He Jinxi's identity,

132
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,230
and asked me to investigate it.

133
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,070
He's so sensitive.

134
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,510
Of course, he's the president of Huayan.

135
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,000
If he doesn't have that vigilance,

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,330
how can Huayan survive?

137
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,300
How did you reply to him?

138
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,150
I did say yes,

139
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,940
but I haven't informed you yet,

140
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,950
so I dare not tell him the truth.

141
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,520
But I can only hide it for a while.

142
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,060
As time goes by, the boss will find out the truth sooner or later.

143
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,660
I see.

144
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,960
We just need to buy some time.

145
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,290
Xixi, why are you in such a hurry to find us?

146
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,750
Do you have any solutions?

147
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,950
I need to find my mom first.

148
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,750
As long as I find her,

149
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,790
I won't be threatened by He Jinxi anymore.

150
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,390
I can confess to the Xicheng,

151
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,660
and let him know the truth.

152
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,370
But are you sure you want to do this?

153
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,550
What if you can't find your mom?

154
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,770
What if

155
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,830
the boss gets angry with you?

156
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
Although you two are very close now,

157
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
but listen to me,

158
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,360
the boss takes love seriously.

159
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,180
He's also a person who cares much about the truth.

160
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,180
If he finds out

161
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,880
you and He Jinxi switched identities

162
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,740
and lied to him.

163
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,170
I can't guarantee

164
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,240
what will happen according to his personality.

165
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,510
Aren't you afraid of

166
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,880
losing him?

167
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,320
Alright.

168
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,960
If you don't know how to comfort others,

169
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,690
just shut up.

170
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,170
At this point,

171
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,730
we have to focus on the problem solving.

172
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,120
What's the point of telling her the consequences?

173
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,320
I think Xixi is right.

174
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,840
Let's find her mom first.

175
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,970
When she comes back,

176
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,540
everything will be solved.

177
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,180
Hello.

178
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,530
Su Yanxi.

179
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,350
Where have you been?

180
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
Where's my money?

181
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,180
Where's Gu Xicheng?

182
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,950
Why are you in such a hurry?

183
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,180
Didn't you say to give me three days?

184
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,190
You sound confident.

185
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,480
What?

186
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,120
You don't want to see Mom anymore?

187
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,530
Don't do anything stupid.

188
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,540
Listen.

189
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,710
Today or tomorrow,

190

564
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,200
Xixi!

565
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,090
Did your sister bring you here?

566
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,430
Mom, how are you feeling?

567
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,560
Are you feeling better?

568
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,180
The operation was very successful,

569
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,510
and I am recovering now.

570
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,490
Look, I can walk now.

571
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,370
Don't walk.

572
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,960
But the doctor

573
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,150
asked me to have more rest.

574
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,230
This time,

575
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,660
we should thank Jinxi.

576
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,200
Mom,

577
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,650
An'an is helping you get discharged.

578
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,650
We'll leave soon.

579
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,530
Yanxi.

580
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,970
What happened between you and Jinxi?

581
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,880
I asked her many times,

582
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,460
but she refused to tell me

583
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,670
what happened between you two.

584
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,340
Mom, I'll tell you

585
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,570
later.

586
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:34,940
Auntie!

587
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,250
Auntie!

588
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,220
Auntie, stop talking. Get on the wheelchair first.

589
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:39,790
Yes.

590
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:40,760
Auntie. Xixi.

591
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,060
This is not a good place to talk.

592
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,650
Let's go.

593
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,210
Auntie, be careful.

594
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,250
Let me help you.

595
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:45,950
Be careful.

596
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,490
Be careful. Sit here please.

597
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:48,020
Okay.

598
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,920
Take your time.

599
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,850
Su Yanxi.
