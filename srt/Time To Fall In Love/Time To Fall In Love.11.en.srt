Yes.

Excuse me.

Hello.

8
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,410
I'd like to order one salad, three steaks,

Okay.

Don't be so willful, okay?

40

You finally

41

spoke your mind, right?

42
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,400
In your heart, I'm just immature and willful.

43
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,700
Don't get me wrong.

44
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,100
I didn't!

45

I saw you!

50
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,340
I have explained it to you many times.

51
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,270

It doesn't matter.

You can think whatever you want.

68
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,810
Why do I feel that you've changed a lot

69
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,930

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,790

I don’t think your dedication

73
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,640
to Gu Xicheng, as well as your hostility to Jinxi

74
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,880
is worthy.

79

Give me two minutes.

191
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:36,750
Okay.

192
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,250
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

193
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,900
Boss, just say it.

194
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,430
The movie is about to start.

195
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
Here's the thing.

196
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,510
A friend of mine asked me

197
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,310
what he should do

198
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,800
after quarreling with a woman?

199
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,200
Who? Which woman?

200
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:56,820
Miss He?

201
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,450
You don't know the person. Take it serious.

202
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,340
This is the easiest question.

203
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,450
Let "your friend" think about

204
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,590
what he did wrong,

205
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,530
and how he made the other angry.

206
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,070
Let him apologize to her and beg for forgiveness.

207
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,400
Just do the three things one by one as a set.

208
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,550
Why should I apologize and beg for forgiveness?

209
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,430
It's not my...

210
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,760
my friend's fault.

211
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,020
Then your friend is even wronger.

212
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,820
Do you know why?

213
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,770
It's always the man's fault

214
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,840
when there is a quarrel between a man and a woman.

215
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,700
If you have any other questions,

216
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,050
please refer to the previous guideline.

217
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:25,770
Okay, boss.

218
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,500
My movie is about to start.

219
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,260
Bye.

220
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,160
Hello?

221
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,250
Apologize?

222
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,220
Admit mistakes?

223
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,080
Beg for forgiveness?

224
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,210
[Are you still awake?]

225
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,830
Are you still awake?

226
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,640
[Are you still awake?]

227
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,640
[Yes. I'm in a bad mood today.]

228
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,970
Yes.

229
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,320
I'm in a bad mood today.

230
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:16,550
[Are you still awake?]

231
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:16,550
[Yes. I'm in a bad mood today.]

232
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:16,550
[What happened? If you want to get something off your chest, you can talk to me.]

233
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,470
What happened?

234
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,870
If you want to get something off your chest, you can talk to me.

235
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,850
Have you ever met

236
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,820
a self-righteous, bossy

237
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,700
and unreasonable...

238
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,360
That's too much, He Jinxi.

239
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,070
Do you hate him that much?

240
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,830
What's the relationship between you two?

241
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,470
He's my enemy, opponent, and creditor.

242
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,300
So you are in a bad mood today

243
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,380
because of this person?

244
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:48,730
[Do you hate him that much? What's the relationship between you two?]

245
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:48,730
[He's my enemy,]

246
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:48,730
[opponent,]

00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,150

[So you are in a bad mood today because of this person?]

250
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,710

[instead of me? I'm so mad.]

259
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,980
instead of me?

260
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,290
I'm so mad.

261
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:09,099
[He's a little bit over. But I don't think he did it on purpose.]

262
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:09,099
[Maybe he doesn't know you so well.]

263
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,760
He's a little bit over.

264
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,260
But I don't think he did it on purpose.

265
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,540
Maybe he doesn't know you so well.

266
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,140
No way.

[No way. You know, I was finally]

[comforted by my friend this afternoon, but he ruined everything again at night.]

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,640
but he ruined everything again at night.

273
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,020

274
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:26,950
[Friend? What kind of friend? Is he]

275
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:26,950
[someone special to you?]

276
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,410
What kind of friend?

277
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,380
Is he

278
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,550
someone special to you?

279
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,780
The perspective you pay attention to is really special.

280
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,540
[The perspective you pay attention to is really special. He's not that special.]

281

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,260
I saw this

301
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,620
on Director Nangong's schedule yesterday.

302
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,880

I only asked you to back up my work schedule,

but this is my private schedule.

Don't do this again.

00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,410
I'm sorry, Director Nangong. I won't do it again.

00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,440

Judging from the result of this proposal,

325

and as far as I know,

326
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,160
the core idea comes from He Jinxi.

I have to admit her contribution if she did do it.

338
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:03,440
I have no reason

339
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,240
to make her unhappy at this time.

340
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,810
Is it only for the company?

341
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,230
You just want to revenge for Miss He, right?

342
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:10,950
What?

343
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,700
Are you going to admit your mistake?

How is that possible?

345
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,760
You're overreacting. You must be guilty.

346
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,860
It's time for "Your friend" to apologize, right?

I think I should resign now.

[Letter of Resignation]

374
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,460
I should resign.

375
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,570
Is that true?

376
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:26,050
Director Nangong really printed her resignation letter?

377
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,010
Why?

378
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,910
Is it really because of He Jinxi?

379
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,290
It's because of her.

380
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,140
On the meeting,

381
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,910
Mr. Gu said

382
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,590
the design was made by He Jinxi.

383
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,700
How humiliated it is for our director?

384
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,230
Besides,

385
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,870
with our director's level,

386
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,190
she must feel so wronged

387
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,850
when being treated like that.

388
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,260
Is that design

389
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,310
really made by He Jinxi?

390
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,660
Is there any difference?

391
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,370
She is also a member of our R&D team.

392
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,430
Is it wrong if the design is under our director?

393
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,740
That person just wanted to

394
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,420
drive Director Nangong away

395
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,680
because she's close to President Gu.

396
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,530
Do you think

397
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,310
she really has special relationship

398
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,020
with Mr. Gu?

399
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,690
Gossip is endless.

400
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,370
Who is close to him?

401
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,590
Who bullied others with the help of him?

402
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,310
It was Nangong who appropriated my designs,

403
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,150
but now I'm blamed instead.

404
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,610
I didn't deny your capability.

405
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,210
I just want to show you the right way of working.

406
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,020
As a leader,

407
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,990
you shouldn't have erased the hard work of your team members.

408
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,420
To achieve the success of a team,

409
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,430
leadership's ability and cognition

410
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,560
are very important.

411
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,330
You're right, Mr. Gu.

412
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,170
So I feel very guilty.

413
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,780
Please allow me to resign.

Something happened to Boss. Please come and subdue the demon at once.

417
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,600
Okay.

418
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,800
I accept your resignation.

420
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,610
Are you so eager

421
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,590
to let me leave?

422
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,590
You proposed the resignation.

423
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,190
I didn't force you to do that.

424
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,420

425
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,070
Do you know

426
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,360
what is the wrongest thing you did today?

427
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,150
As an employee,

428
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,450
you can be dissatisfied with your boss,

429
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,950
but you shouldn't have forced your boss

430
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,950
in any way.

431
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,620
In this world,

432
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,130
no one is irreplaceable.

433
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,130
Neither is you.

434
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,520
Are you implying that

435
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,060
I've been replaced?

436
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,520
By He Jinxi?

437
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,610
I've told you...

438
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,930
I know I was wrong.

439
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,690
I shouldn't have left.

440
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,770
I shouldn't have left without saying goodbye.

441
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,570
I shouldn't have given up on you.

442
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,350
Otherwise, I would still be the one

443
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,100
with you.

444
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,550
There will be no place for He Jinxi.

445
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,010
Enough.

00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,290
This is my office.

447
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,000
I don't want to talk about this with you.

If you don't leave,

449
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,340
then I'll leave.

Nothing.

Don't worry about me.
