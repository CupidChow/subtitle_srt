00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,850
Everyone here has voted.

188
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,140
Situ,

189
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,120
you will host the next part of the meeting.

190
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,300
After announcing the result

191
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,150
fairly and openly,

192
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,090
just tell me.

193
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,000
Okay, Mr. Gu.

194
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,360
Mr. Gu.

195
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,350
Vice President, please announce it.

196
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:32,900
Okay.

197
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,530
Now I announce...

198
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,460
Beautiful East.

199
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,960
6 votes.

200
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,340
White Moonlight.

201
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,450
4 votes.

202
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,180
He Jinxi will be in charge of

203
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,020
the new product packaging design of Huayan.

204
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:17,310
[Beautiful East][White Moonlight]

205
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:17,310
[Huayan]

206
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,740
When the documents are sorted out,

207
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,670
remember to give it to me tomorrow.

208
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,450
Xicheng.

209
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,450
Go.

210
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,320
Xicheng.

211
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,980
Why did you leave the meeting room?

212
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,060
You don't even want to see my defeat.

213
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,340
Right?

214
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,210
Nangong.

215
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,820
I've told you many times.

216
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,120
This is the company.

217
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,150
I don't want to talk about personal matters with you in the company.

218
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,460
And I hope you can

219
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,700
control your emotions as a leader.

220
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,630
I don't want to control it anymore.

221
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,970
I even lost to He Jinxi on designing.

222
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,410
How can I stay in Huayan?

223
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,560
When you had a conflict,

224
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,300
I asked her to do the same.

225
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,390
But this time,

226
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,750
it's your problem.

227
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,910
I left the meeting room

228
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,390
to make the vote fair.

229
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,710
But as you can see,

230
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,070
you couldn't control your emotion which

231
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,440
[Huayan]

232
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,500
led you to lose to

233
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,620
your subordinate.

234
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,680
This is not the Nangong Liuli I know.

235
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,540
I admit

236
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,420
I came here

237
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,540
not for real work.

238
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,820
I'm here for you.

239
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,840
I'm willing to do anything for you

240
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,400
to make Huayan better.

241
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,890
But why did you push me away,

242
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,420
Xicheng?

243
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,500
It's impossible for us.

244
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,080
Why?

245
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,370
Back then,

246
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,900
you've made your choice.

247
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,240
I know

248
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,350
you asked grandma for some money.

249
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,540
You knew?

250
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,570
I've known it since the day you left.

251
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,150
Nangong.

252
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,600
I used to take care of

253
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,810
the only girl in the club, like others did.

254
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,380
But I didn't expect

255
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,400
you would do such a thing.

256
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,030
Xicheng, back then, I...

257
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,900
If I was a friend to you

258
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,810
in the Astronomical Society in university,

259
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,380
then since the moment you asked Grandma for money,

260
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,240
we can't even be friends anymore.

261
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,810
Don't get me wrong.

262
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,120
I'm not greedy for grandma's money

263
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,050
Back then, I...

264
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,650
There's nothing to explain.

265
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,290
Use the resources around you

266
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,540
to live a better life.

267
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,200
Many people would choose to do so.

268
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,150
It's not wrong.

269
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,650
But since you've made your choice,

270
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,589
you have to bear the consequences.

271
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,859
Who you are today

272
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,319
and the company's decision today

273
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,589
are your consequences.

274
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,020
Nangong!

275
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,420
Nangong!

276
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,540
Nangong, how are you feeling?

277
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,030
Are you feeling better?

278
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,260
I'll call the doctor.

279
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,980
I have nothing left.

280
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,670
Everything is gone.

281
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,810
Nothing left.

282
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:09,740
It's okay.

283
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,570
It's okay.

284
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,020
Everything will be fine.

285
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,860
I'm here.

286
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,340
It's okay.

287
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,220
I'll go back now.

288
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,420
Be good and finish your work.

289
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,950
If you take a taxi home,

290
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,680
remember to send me the car plate number.

291
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,300
Okay, don't worry.

292
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,020
Go.

293
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,880
I don't want you to leave suddenly.

294
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,360
Even if I'm working,

295
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,960
I want you to be with me.

296
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,190
Don't act cute.

297
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,220
You're the president of Huayan.

298
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,210
You have so many work to do.

299
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,810
You have to finish them earlier.

300
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,730
Work hard.

301
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,080
You'll see me at home.

302
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,530
Someone will see us.

303
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:08,630
Okay.

304
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,610
I'm leaving.

305
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,770
Okay.

306
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,150
Can I still have this happiness

307
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,630
when He Jinxi comes back?

308
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,490
An'an, it's me.

309
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,920
Cheers.

310
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,290
What's wrong with you today?

311
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,420
You don't look well.

312
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,730
I just feel uncomfortable.

313
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,970
I just feel uneasy.

314
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,000
You're struggling after the sweet period, aren't you?

315
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,040
I knew it.

316
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,800
What will you do when He Jinxi comes back?

317
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,580
Are you going to tell Gu Xicheng

318
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,110
or negotiate with He Jinxi?

319
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,410
Your sister is not easy to deal with.

320
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,910
You don't want to see auntie anymore?

321
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,180
An'an, stop talking.

322
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,010
Don't I know that?

323
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,590
But I can't control myself.

324
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,300
I don't know why

325
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,980
I really fell in love with him.

326
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,130
Waiter, another glass of wine.

327
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,220
There are two ladies over there.

328
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,170
I want to treat them

329
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,450
to some high wine.

330
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,300
I'll pay

331
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,100
their expenses.

332
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,540
Okay, go ahead.

333
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,230
I think

334
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,290
your troublesome sister

335
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,150
never thought

336
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,040
you two would really be together.

337
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,100
But love is

338
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,990
something you can't control.

339
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,420
Right?

340
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,710
I really can't control myself.

341
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,900
I really like him.

342
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,780
Thank you.

343
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,520
Xixi, drink slowly.

344
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,830
Xixi.

345
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,710
When you're drunk, take a nap

346
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,210
and forget all the unhappy things tomorrow.

347
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,660
Gu Xicheng.

348
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,770
Stop messing with me.

349
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,810
Hello, Miss.

350
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,260
Your friend is waiting for you outside.

351
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:41,820
My friend?

352
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,260
Yes.

353
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,370
Who is it?

354
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,120
Xixi, be good.

355
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,150
I'll be back soon.

356
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,570
I'll pick you up and send you home right away.

357
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,260
Bye.

358
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,140
Stop drinking.

359
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,530
Xixi.

360
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,060
Are you okay?

361
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:16,290
Who are you? I don't know you.

362
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,660
Xixi, you're drunk.

363
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:24,850
Let me help you up.

364
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,620
Come on.

365
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,130
Don't touch me! No!

366
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,660
Don't touch me!

367
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,310
Xixi, I'm sorry.

368
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,300
Let me go!

369
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,380
Who made me run  so far?

370
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Nobody was there.

371
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,270
Xixi, are you okay?

372
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,400
Huayan's herbal lipstick

373
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,700
has achieved good results in the Southeast Asia market.

374
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,940
The sales are very good.

375
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,540
Because Southeast Asia only has western makeup,

376
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,800
and no eastern makeup.

377
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,180
Hello, you miss me?

378
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,490
Xixi is drunk.

379
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,940
Here.

380
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:21,580
Xixi.

381
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,520
Gu Xicheng.

382
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,300
Why are you here?

383
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,890
Why did she drink so much?

384
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:34,570
I...

385
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:40,970
Come.

386
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,340
Why did you drink so much with An'an?

387
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,170
You can't hold your liquor. The wine is strong.

388
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:38,990
What are you doing?

389
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,640
Do you like me?

390
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,710
What?

391
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,600
Tell me.

392
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,860
I want you to tell me

393
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,820
you like me.

394
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,170
Didn't I tell you before?

395
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:01,160
I want you to say it again.

396
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,200
What about you?

397
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
Do you like me?

398
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,760
Xicheng.

399
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,380
I have a secret.

400
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,460
Xicheng, you're back.

401
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,060
Aunt Mei is here.

402
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,050
Let's go in.

403
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
Let's talk later.

404
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,760
Let's go.

405
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,120
Come here.

406
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,960
Why are you dressed like that? Where are your shoes?

407
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,080
I don't know.

408
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,160
I don't know where my pajamas are.

409
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,380
So I borrowed your shirt.

410
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,300
People say one of the must do things when dating

411
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,860
is to wear boyfriend's shirt.

412
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,950
You need wear it according to the season.

413
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,750
Besides, you just took a shower.

414
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,160
What if you catch a cold?

415
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,730
With you around,

416
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,350
I'm not afraid of getting sick.

417
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,730
I spoiled you too much.

418
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,340
Will you regret it?

419
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,610
Regret?

420
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,200
Will you regret knowing me?

421
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,220
Will you regret doting on me so much?

422
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,040
Didn't you ask me at the door just now?

423
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,500
Listen carefully.

424
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,100
Xixi,

425
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,740
I like you.

426
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,490
I'll like you

427
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,570
