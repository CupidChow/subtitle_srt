Long time no see.

6
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,850
You rejected me

7
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,070
in front of everyone.

8
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,530
Don't tell me

9
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,210
you won't even shake hands with me here?

10
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,770
I remember you're not that rude.

11
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,660
You've been away for quite a long time.

12
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,790
Don't you remember?

13
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,000
Sorry, I am a rude person.

14
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:23,860
It's okay.

15
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,650
I know you're still angry with me.

16
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,160
Others don't understand you.

17
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,760
But I do.

18
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,980
Don't be so arrogant in front of me.

19
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,810
From the day you left without saying goodbye,

20
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,340
we don't have any relationship left to build.

21
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,710
Really?

22
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,020
Then why are you still so angry?

23
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,890
Because I hate seeing people

24
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,590
being full of themselves.

25
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,510

to stand by your side,

32
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,500
I will definitely come back.

33
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,420
Xicheng, I knew you...

35
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:52,850
What?

36
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,230
Are you disappointed in seeing me?

37
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,170
I'm not disappointed.

38
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,860
I shouldn't have expect anything.

39
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,260
Welcome back,

40
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,840
my dear classmate.

41
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't move.

42
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,700
Don't worry about anything.

43
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,610
Just focus on me.

An'an.

45
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,840
What happened?

46
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,200
Situ just told me

47
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,600
you did something big at the dinner party.

48
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,340
What do you mean?

49
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,280
But you and Situ

50
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,790
are quite close now.

51
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,360
He reports everything to you.

52
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,220
We're talking about you.

53
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,480
Don't get me involved.

54
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,810
Tell me what happened.

55
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,580
It's just...

56
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,030
I made a little mistake.

57
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,310
I almost lost the necklace

58
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,350
my mom gave me.

59
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,270
He...

60
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,900
spent 2.8 million to bid it back.

61
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,080
What? Two million and eight hundred thousand?

62
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,680
Can you keep your voice down?

63
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,240
Come on. This is 2.8 million yuan,

64
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,380
not 280 yuan.

65
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,600
If a man is willing to do so much for me,

66
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,630
I'll definitely give him a thumb up.

67
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,460
What do you mean?

68
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,550
So the dress

69
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,580
and jewelry you're wearing,

70
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,120
as well as the shoes on your feet

71
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,780
were all bought by Gu Xicheng?

72
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,270
I guess so.

73
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,550
I know.

74
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,940
He likes you.

75
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,080
What did you say?

76
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,880
Is there something wrong with your brain circuit,

77
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,660
or that circuit in your brain is too long?

78
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,320
He's the president of Huayan.

79
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,500
He spent 2.8 million

80
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,860
on a necklace for you.

81
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,670
He bought you a haute couture for the dinner party.

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,659
You are not used to wearing high heels,

83
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,540
then he bought dozens of flat shoes

84
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,740
for you.

85
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,250
He must dote on you and like you very much.

86
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:45,840
Or,

87
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,560
is he a freak of dedication?

88
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,080
No, but...

89
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,170
It's impossible.

90
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,340
Wake up, girl!

91
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,870
I feel sorry for Mr. Gu.

92
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,630
Why did he fall in love with a little fool like you?

93
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,190
I should be the one you're looking at.

94
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,300
This necklace is very important to you,

95
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,930
but you are equally important to me.

96
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,020
He...

97
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,650
likes me.

98
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,200
I took this necklace

99
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,750
from my mom's drawer.

100
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,910
You're a prince. Please put it on.

101
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,980
I don't want to wear it. I don't want to act.

102
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,870
Why not?

103
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,130
Isn't it good for us to perform, work together,

104
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,890
and be friends?

105
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,200
You see, you are a prince and I am a princess.

106
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,570
Come with us.

107
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,500
We will be your friends forever.

108
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,970
It's you.

109
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,380
We performed together once.

110
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,520
You were called your nickname by the teacher every day.

111
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,300
Xixi?

112
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,670
I think it's Xixi.

113
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,980
So your name is

114
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,490
He Jinxi.

115
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,320
Have you done taking off your makeup?

116
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,020
Have you used the mask? And the facial cream?

117
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,330
Yes.

118
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,130
Is the company's new product good?

119
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:46,890
Mr. Gu,

120
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,660
do you want to recommend me Huayan's new product?

121
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,340
Which series do you want to use?

122
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,600
I'll ask Situ to send them over tomorrow.

123
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,030
Gu Xicheng,

124
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,240
what do you want to say?

125
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,020
I want to say

126
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,530
I...

127
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,550
say...

128
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,640
It's getting late.

129
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,030
It's time to rest.

130
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,600
Mr. Gu, since I moved into your house,

131
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,460
I've been sleeping on that sofa every day.

132
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,860
My waist is aching and I have a cramp on my legs.

133
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,080
I almost use the Qiantong killer patch.

134
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,650
Could you please

135
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,450
let me sleep on this king-sized bed?

136
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,960
Please.

137
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,880
What are you thinking?

138
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,170
Nothing.

139
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,770
You want to sleep on the bed, right?

140
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,160
How about this?

141
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,790

Whoever wins will sleep on the bed.

143

I'm sure I can beat you.

144
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,460
First of all,

145
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,190
the rule is the best-of-three. No cheating.

146
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,450
I'm afraid you will be the one who cheats.

Sometimes,

I miss the past too.

They were simple

but happy days.

184
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,700
I did live streaming with An'an,

ran for endorsements,

186
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,110
and recommended myself to the companies.

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,620
Although it was hard,

188
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500

00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,150
Because the reason I designed it

377
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,550
lies in that I want to give it to you,

378
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,860

Grandma, you don't need to take this so seriously.

384
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,660
It's just a minor injury.

No.

386
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,820

And personally speaking,

417
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,790
it's meaningless to me.

418
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,670
Are you still blaming me

419
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,060
for leaving without saying goodbye?

420
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,190
That's the reason why you don't want to accept it, right?

421
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,860
I can explain that.

422
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,500
But I hope

these things

The reason I won't fire you now

429
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,420
is because the administration spent a lot of effort

to recruit you.

431
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,080

[How about this, if you order next time, I'll give you an extra gift.]

561
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,020
Aren't you my sponsor, Miss?

562
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,380
Thank you.

563
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,480
How about this, if you order next time,

564
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,659
I'll give you an extra gift.

565
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,310
[Aren't you my sponsor, Miss? Thank you.]

566
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,310
[How about this, if you order next time, I'll give you an extra gift.]

567
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,310
[By the way, what happened to your hand?]

568
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,460
By the way, what happened to your hand?

569
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:34,540
[By the way, what happened to your hand?]

570
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:34,540
[It's just a minor injury. People say losing money can help to avoid misfortune, right? I'm sure I can avoid the disaster this time.]

571
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,420
It's just a minor injury.

572
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,100
People say losing money can help to avoid misfortune, right?

573
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,360
I'm sure I can avoid a disaster this time.

574
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,699
[By the way, what happened to your hand?]

575
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,699
[It's just a minor injury. People say losing money can help to avoid misfortune, right? I'm sure I can avoid the disaster this time.]

576
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,699
[You will be fine. Someone will always protect you by your side.]

577
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,739
You will be fine.

578
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,420
Someone by your side

579
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,820
will always protect you.

580
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,360
[It's just a minor injury. People say losing money can help to avoid misfortune, right? I'm sure I can avoid the disaster this time.]

581
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,360
[You will be fine. Someone will always protect you by your side.]

582
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,360
[How do you know?]

583
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,409
How do you know?

584
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,300
Why are you so silly?

585
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:54,750
[You will be fine. Someone will always protect you by your side.]

586
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:54,750
[How do you know?]

587
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:54,750
[Catch you later. See you next time.]

588
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,620
Catch you later. See you next time.

589
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,480
Thank you, sir.

590
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,730
[Nangong Liuli]

591
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,730
[She's coming.]

592
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,600
[Giorgio Armani]

593
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,980
[Richard Mille]

594
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,330
[Huayan]

595
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,030
[Huayan]

596
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,960
[She's coming.]

597
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,300
She's here.

598
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,750
I'm here.

599
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,130
Why isn't anyone here?

600
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,350
Does the president work overtime too?

601
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,870
It's a pity for the dinner Grandma gave me.

602
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,170
It has only been half a day,

603
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,720
don't you remember my name?

604
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,680
No, I didn't forget.

605
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,820
Gu Xicheng.

606
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,980
Why are you here today?

607
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,890
Do you need my help?

608
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,110
No.

609
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,710
Grandma asked me

610
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,800
to deliver the soup.

611
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,130
Soup?

612
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,600
What soup?

613
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,080
Is it black chicken soup?

614
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,910
It's super tonic soup

615
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,070
with Cordyceps and Colla Corii Asini.

616
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,160
Just kidding.

617
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,220
Aunt Mei made this ordinary meal

618
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,370
for you.

619
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,430
Grandma is afraid that you are too busy to have dinner,

620
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,670
so she asked me to bring it to you.

621
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,550
Dine with me, please.

622
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,130
I'd like to,

623
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,200
but I'm on a diet recently.

624
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,580
Fine, I'll eat it myself.

625
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:56,950
I've always wanted to taste the pigeon soup cooked by Aunt Mei.

626
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,090
I heard it's very delicious.

627
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,880
All right. Let's eat together.

628
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,180
What's wrong?

629
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,700
I only brought one spoon.

630
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,660
My spoon.

631
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,540
It's okay.

632
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,710
We'll use yours.

633
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,500
Let's share.

634
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,460
♫ If the weather is good tomorrow ♫

635
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:00,240
♫ If the shoelaces are always tight ♫

636
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,180
♫ Maybe I'll ask you out tomorrow ♫

637
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,160
♫ Let's go for a walk ♫

638
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:10,850
♫ Three pedestrians wearing floral dresses on the street ♫

639
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,540
♫ Colorful colors are your eyes ♫

640
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:18,390
♫ Saw three contrails ♫

641
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,690
I just used it.

642
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,920
♫ Implies that the process will go well ♫

643
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,700
♫ Need more proofs of luck ♫

644
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,460
♫ Had a hunch that you'll promise before I ask ♫

645
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,310
♫ Promise that we'll continue tomorrow ♫

646
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,990
♫ Continue to chat and laugh with you while we're walking ♫

647
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,240
Xicheng.
