00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,430
[Pretty Boy]

2
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,449
[Episode 16]

3
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,820
Stop wasting time and get over here.

4
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,920
I don't want to live anymore. Kill me.

5
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,890
Wait there.

6
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,880
You don't look like a real man at all.

7
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,560
Everything is fake.

8
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,160
I know all of that.

9
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,880
Beauty is fake.

10
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,930
Everything in this world is fake.

11
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,150
All perfection is a lie,

12
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,490
just self-deception.

13
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,160
I just noticed

14
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,670
that you actually have a bit of literary talent.

15
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,520
What you said makes some sense.

16
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,110
I have fantasies

17
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,420
and hopes for the future.

18
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,960
Hoping that along the way,

19
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,130
I'd have a longer plan for life.

20
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,160
You're an interesting person.

21
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,780
You've become quite adorable

22
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,430
since going crazy.

23
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,980
But in the end,

24
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,310
I got nothing.

25
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,280
Absolutely nothing.

26
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,850
Maybe it's because I was too greedy

27
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,640
and brought it upon myself.

28
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,500
But when the dream ends

29
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,890
and I open my eyes,

30
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,260
it'll be just another, longer dream.

31
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,070
But I hope... this dream...

32
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,600
isn't a nightmare.

33
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:45,990
Wait.

34
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,410
Where am I?

35
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,390
What happened?

36
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,280
You've lost it?

37
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,670
How have I lost it?

38
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,080
He's really lost it.

39
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,030
The strange thing is—

40
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,310
when exactly did you start losing it?

41
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,650
No, seriously.

42
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,580
Where is this place, really?

43
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,340
How come I don't remember anything?

44
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,590
Do you remember me?

45
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,850
Of course.

46
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,300
How could I ever forget you?

47
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,899
But...

48
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,820
Why can't I remember what I'm supposed to forget?

49
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,350
You forgot that I'm your master.

50
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,160
Stop talking nonsense.

51
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,900
If you were truly my master, I would be your husband.

52
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,730
You're not afraid of me anymore?

53
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,690
Why should I be afraid of you?

54
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,110
Wait.

55
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,590
Why are you... tying me to yourself?

56
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,020
Do you still remember Qing Cai?

57
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,820
What?

58
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,920
Qing what? Vegetable?

59
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,280
He's even forgotten Qing Cai.

60
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,400
That doesn't make sense.

61
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,320
No.

62
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,710
The point is, when did he start to forget?

63
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,570
He's forgotten me.

64
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,220
And it doesn't seem like he's faking it.

65
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,250
He's even managed to fool someone as smart as me.

66
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,900
He is really something.

67
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,000
Why did you bring us here?

68
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,430
It can't be to teach us how to bathe, right?

69
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,640
Hu Jiao,

70
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:56,270
your imagination these days

71
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,830
really knows no limits.

72
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:02,150
Aizhen, the way you speak now

73
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,270
is exactly the same as Qing Cai.

74
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,470
We're family, after all.

75
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,790
Come on, you play the accompaniment for me.

76
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,110
Everyone, go pick an instrument and give it a try.

77
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,070
Alright.

78
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,420
There's nothing here that I know how to play.

79
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,070
All I can do is create noise.

80
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,299
What's this? I can't even make a sound out of it.

81
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,740
It's broken.

82
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,440
It's not broken.

83
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,970
If you don't know how to play it, naturally it won't make a sound.

84
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,100
Try the drum.

85
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,150
Here, take it back.

86
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,560
Take it back.

87
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,190
Hu Jiao.

88
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,510
Try the drum.

89
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,720
Don't waste your energy.

90
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,730
This is good.

91
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,410
It'll make a sound no matter what.

92
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,260
Not bad.

93
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,710
This is my first time playing this.

94
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,740
Can we really play as an ensemble?

95
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,290
My own noise is making me dizzy.

96
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,290
And we have to perform together?

97
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,940
Everyone, we're on our own with this.

98
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,510
Are you two really playing the audience here?

99
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,030
Have you seen anything?

100
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,510
You only see that Young Master Wang is dashing, suave, and handsome?

101
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,360
Observe them carefully.

102
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,710
Everyone, pause for a moment.

103
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,500
Pause for a moment.

104
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,210
Pepper, hit the drum once.

105
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,730
Use only about 20% of the strength you use when wrestling.

106
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,930
Alright.

107
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,380
Just like that.

108
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,120
Okay.

109
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,320
Gan Pu.

110
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,720
Play a bit.

111
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,700
Remember,

112
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,580
you just need to stick to this set of notes.

113
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,390
Very good.

114
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,690
Han Aizhen,

115
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,190
play a bit.

116
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,680
Stick to just these notes.

117
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,560
Gao Yin, Qing Cai,

118
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,430
you both already know music.

119
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,290
Just go with what feels right to you.

120
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,730
I'll go there first.

121
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,500
Next, I'll point. Whoever I point to plays,

122
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,140
and whoever I don't point to stops.

123
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,840
This way, we can play as a group.

124
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,300
Let's give it a try.

125
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,800
Gan Pu.

126
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,790
You can play more smoothly.

127
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,730
Good.

128
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,920
Very good.

129
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,020
Han Aizhen,

130
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,810
you just need to stay on those notes.

131
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,430
Not bad.

132
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:23,970
Keep it steady.

133
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,880
Pepper, don't rush the beat.

134
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,340
Watch my gestures.

135
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,840
Softer.

136
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,050
You're worth teaching after all.

137
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,730
Seems like eating a lot

138
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,350
has its benefits.

139
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,290
Gao Yin.

140
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,570
Qing Cai,

141
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,490
you two can play along

142
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,660
with Zhang Fang's melody.

143
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,000
Alright, everyone, get into the groove.

144
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,590
Let's sing a song together.

145
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,140
Are they really going to start playing now?

146
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,030
What is that man doing in the water?

147
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,610
He's performing in the water.

148
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,400
The sound of splashing water is part of the music.

149
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,110
Yes, yes, that's how they play.

150
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,950
They turn everything around them into an instrument.

188
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,900
♫Live your life as it comes♫

189
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,710
Ah, homeward bound I go.

190
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,420
Why not go home, seeing that my field and garden with weeds are overgrown?

191
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,340
So handsome.

192
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,110
Yes, yes.

193
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,320
So handsome, so handsome.

194
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,840
This Wang Yishao really has some talent.

195
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,120
They were like loose grains of sand, but under his direction,

196
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,720
they actually played a song together.

197
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,730
Everyone, stop.

198
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,590
We'll start one-on-one lessons now.

199
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,430
Instruments require repeated practice to master.

200
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,550
It'll lay a solid foundation for you

201
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,280
before you get started with an instrument.

202
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:40,980
Gan Pu.

203
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,600
Let me teach you how to play.

204
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,430
Okay.

205
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,130
Hold it straighter.

206
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,220
Let me teach you.

207
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,540
No need.

208
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,750
You teach me.

209
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,360
Me?

210
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,350
You!

211
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,220
Okay.

212
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,040
Give me.

213
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:12,950
Okay.

214
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,770
See?

215
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,710
Like this, hold it here

216
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,460
and keep it vertical.

217
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,710
Didn't you play very well just now?

218
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,820
Playing like that earlier was so boring.

219
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,390
Alright, alright.

220
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,920
Too noisy, way too noisy.

221
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,360
You're making too much noise.

222
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,680
Why don't we go somewhere else to practice?

223
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,730
Fine, fine.

224
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,590
Let's go, go.

225
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:35,840
Stop.

226
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,270
You want me to carry it?

227
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,930
Hold it.

228
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,250
Put your right hand here. Play it like this.

229
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,780
You fool.

230
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,550
Do you hear me?

231
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,230
Go.

232
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,540
Be natural.

233
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,370
Relax.

234
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,510
Yes, very good.

235
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,640
Pull it across.

236
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,880
Don't rush; take it slow.

237
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,930
Follow my lead.

238
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,569
Yes, put it here.

239
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,270
Put it in front.

240
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,819
Yes, pull it with me.

241
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,000
Okay, smoother now.

242
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,980
Let's find another spot to practice.

243
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,840
Very good.

244
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,050
Relax this hand.

245
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,000
Relax.

246
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,540
Come on.

247
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,030
Here, this hand...

248
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,440
Pull it over...

249
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,180
You're learning fast.

250
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,480
Am I doing it right?

251
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,870
Slow down. Slow down.

252
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,120
Have you noticed

253
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,070
anything strange about Young Master Wang, Qing Cai, and the others?

254
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,770
I saw them all flirting with each other.

255
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,980
Exactly, exactly.

256
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,500
Who exactly is Zhang Fang?

257
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,230
This unconventional and free-spirited music

258
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,890
will likely be criticized, right?

259
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,060
It is said

260
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,400
that they're all self-proclaimed refined individuals,

261
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,770
gathering to enjoy zither-playing, chess, calligraphy, painting,

262
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,250
composing poetry, and reciting verse.

263
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,520
They call this style

264
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,800
the "natural music."

265
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,080
There's no music score at all,

266
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,550
entirely improvised

267
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,920
for their own amusement.

268
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,580
It seems Wang Yishao... is one of them.

269
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,940
Maybe Hong Hui too.

270
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,310
But these refined men

271
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,330
have caught up in the whirlpool of Mingyi Manor's intrigues.

272
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,940
How pitiful.

273
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,730
Yeah.

274
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,740
So, none of them are willing participants,

275
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,130
including Young Master Wang himself.

276
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,590
He hasn't been giving his all.

277
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,570
That's how you managed to exploit the situation.

278
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,020
What's going on between you and Qing Cai?

279
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,390
Your feelings toward each other

280
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,480
are not that simple.

281
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,150
Qing Cai, we should go.

282
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,340
Gan Pu is about to slip up.

283
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,630
Perhaps she already has.

284
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,420
Let's talk somewhere else.

285
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,900
But Gan Pu's reaction is truly strange.

286
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,580
She is seducing Young Master Wang,

287
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,070
using despicable tricks.

288
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,930
Exactly.

289
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,390
Young Master Wang's been bewitched by her.

290
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,210
Gan Pu is nothing but a vixen,

291
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,740
even more shameless than Qing Cai.

292
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,990
If you keep this up,

293
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,150
I'll restrict you from coming over here.

294
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,660
I admire you.

295
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,780
You've managed to overcome your jealousy rather quickly.

296
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,040
I've figured it out.

297
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,920
Since it's impossible,

298
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,710
why should I ask for trouble?

299
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,540
This way, she won't get hurt either.

300
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,160
If I love her,

301
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,600
I have to forget her.

302
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,180
You're using wisdom as a sword to cut through the threads of emotion.

303
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,230
I think in matters of the heart,

304
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,600
one shouldn't hesitate and linger.

305
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,230
You seem experienced.

306
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,290
I've learned this from other knowledge.

307
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,550
When you hesitate to make a decision, chaos ensues,

308
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,630
and the consequences can be far-reaching.

309
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,170
Sometimes, when it comes to love,

310
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,410
making a decision is harder than dealing with practical matters.

311
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,600
You have the makings of an emperor.

312
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,000
Do you think I'd still let myself be distracted

313
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,660
and restrained

314
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,300
to take on such a ridiculous title as Emperor?

315
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,420
What do you think?

316
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,100
Even being a hermit requires decisiveness.

317
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,580
Y-You don't know how to play?

318
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,850
Didn't you play well just now?

319
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:56,950
Why are you playing the drum

320
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,760
with the same energy as when you're doing hard labor?

321
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,120
Are you asking for a beating?

322
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,390
Fine, I'll play.

323
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,410
You're terrible.

324
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,020
What kind of teaching method is that?

325
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,430
Are you a fool?

326
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,230
I told you not to focus on the techniques.

327
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,470
Move over.

328
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,510
If you focus too much on the techniques

329
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,050
during practice,

330
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,070
you'll only turn yourself into a fool.

331
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,850
Isn't this all about techniques?

332
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,560
When we learn martial arts, it's all about practice making perfect.

333
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,530
Practice the basics first.

334
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,990
Once the basics are solid, you can do anything.

335
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,000
You've got a point there.

336
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,270
But that's the kind of thing mediocre teachers would say.

337
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,550
When practicing the techniques,

338
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,990
never forget to feel.

339
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,290
Also, when you're studying,

340
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,190
you need to keep your joy and enthusiasm alive.

341
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,160
Not that you'd understand.

342
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,510
Hand me the pipa.

343
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,710
What did you hear?

344
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,200
Feel it.

345
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,080
Ta...

346
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,850
Did you hear its emotions?

347
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,360
What emotions?

348
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,400
How should I put it?

349
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,030
Every note has a life.

350
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,100
You need to feel...

351
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,700
its life...

352
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,690
and its delicate emotions.

353
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,980
I think its life is pretty short.

354
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,160
You've got some insight.

355
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,210
Humans, born between heaven and earth,

356
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,920
are like fleeting shadows—here one moment, gone the next.

357
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,510
Just like the sound of this note...

358
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,810
vanishing in an instant.

359
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,340
When it comes, it's radiant like starlight;

360
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,830
when it goes, it fades into silence.

361
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,350
There is sorrow...

362
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,170
and reluctance.

363
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,620
Come on, feel it again.

364
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,180
Do you feel that in that fleeting moment,

365
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,260
it's like a person's life...

366
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,630
full of memories?

367
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,810
If even a single note has a life,

368
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,380
what about an entire piece?

369
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,980
You're catching on.

370
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,640
Take it.

371
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,390
An entire piece of music...

372
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,640
An entire piece of music is a world.

373
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,470
Each life within it is created by you.

374
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:55,010
Countless lives... come together to build this world,

375
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,370
and this world, too,

376
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,240
is created by you.

377
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,660
The same piece,

378
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,060
played by different people,

379
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,640
becomes different worlds.

380
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,690
If you only focus on practice,

381
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,480
this will only make the world lack a soul.

382
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,730
All the sounds within it

383
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,770
will be nothing but dull, boring noise,

384
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,180
without soul.

385
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,620
That's so profound.

386
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,380
Does playing the pipa

387
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,720
require talent, like martial arts?

388
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,690
Talent.

389
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,950
What does it mean to be naturally gifted?

390
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,970
It means that when practicing the techniques,

391
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,690
one listens to the sounds within

392
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,430
and immerses oneself in that world to feel

393
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,770
and converse with it.

394
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,470
Within those sounds lie the flowing of years,

395
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,510
the vitality of spring,

396
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,070
the brilliance of autumn,

397
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,780
the budding love of youth...

398
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,730
and the reflections... of wisdom.

399
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,750
Sadly...

400
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,850
our mediocre teachers

401
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,320
are the murderers of talent,

402
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,050
making people

403
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,540
more ordinary the more they learn.

404
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,470
For example, you.

405
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,080
You've been practicing martial arts for years,

406
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,290
yet your aptitude is mediocre.

407
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,670
You're the one who's mediocre.

408
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,700
After hearing so much from me,

409
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,320
shouldn't you be shouting with joy

410
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,560
for having met such a brilliant teacher?

411
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,320
Instead, you just sit there, blinking with those big eyes.

412
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,600
Idiot.

413
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,070
Go and figure it out yourself.

414
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,270
Didn't you just say that I had insight?

415
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,310
Now I'm an idiot

416
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,270
and a mediocre too.

417
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,490
Weirdo.

418
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,370
How long are we just going to sit here in a daze?

419
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,770
I have a lot of questions.

420
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,660
I have a lot of questions about you too.

421
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,120
You think my attitude

422
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,700
has been constantly wavering, haven't you?

423
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,260
How should I put it?

424
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,250
You keep shifting your stance from one side to the other.

425
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,160
Your cleverness fluctuates—sometimes brilliant, sometimes dull.

426
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,480
Even your emotions come and go unpredictably.

427
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,260
I don't understand.

428
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:42,980
Look at him.

429
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,110
He's what I used to be.

430
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,510
Look at Hongxiu.

431
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:57,340
She's what I have to be now.

432
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,930
You mean,

433
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,390
you're very torn right now?

434
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,120
I don't like the current version of myself.

435
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,120
Then that means you don't like Hongxiu either?

436
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,990
No.

437
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,760
Hongxiu is always like this,

438
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,000
which makes her perfect to be the backbone here.

439
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,560
I see.

440
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,290
You're still in the middle of choosing for yourself, right?

441
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,530
The issue isn't with me...

442
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,460
but with this terrible task.

443
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,470
It's forcing me to make a choice.

444
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,970
But this wretched task

445
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,290
is making you choose between betraying your own heart

446
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,060
or betraying your family.

447
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,600
And both are things

448
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,330
you don't want to do.

449
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,180
"Family"

450
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,010
isn't quite the right word.

451
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,500
It's more about...

452
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,970
the bond of lineage.

453
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,640
That's too heavy.

454
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,240
You should know

455
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,400
that most people

456
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,850
ultimately choose to betray their emotions

457
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,180
and return to carry on their family's legacy, don't they?

458
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,720
Yishao,

459
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,650
actually, we both know

460
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,820
that Gao Yin is the best for you.

461
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,180
You love Qing Cai.

462
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,140
He is the son of the late Emperor.

463
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,140
It's all my fault.

464
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,720
Love cannot be concealed.

465
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,120
Even if your lips don't say it,

466
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,780
your eyes will.

467
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,730
It's me who's been misled all this time.

468
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,380
When you finally make your choice,

469
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,810
it might just be the end of our world.

470
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,070
I won't do anything to you.

471
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,480
Because there's no fundamental conflict between us.

472
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:23,180
But I would die for him.

473
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,130
Have your feelings really grown so deep

474
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,550
in such a short time?

475
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,160
It's simple.

476
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,580
Because he's willing to die with me.

477
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,710
That's why I believe he is the one.

478
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,540
Seems like a lot has happened

479
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,420
in the past few days that I'm unaware of.

480
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,490
Tell me.

481
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,440
If it were you,

482
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,820
what would you do?

483
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,440
I'd beat him up.

484
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,910
How dare you fool me for so long and still dare to...

485
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,380
Look at you, all flustered and furious.

486
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,980
At this point,

487
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,850
you can still laugh.

488
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,510
What's there not to laugh about?

489
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,830
After all, we're all going to die anyway.

490
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,020
I knew

491
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,940
that this day would come sooner or later.

492
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,350
I quite like you this way.

493
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,350
Wait, can't you be a little gentler?

494
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,250
Like me.

495
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,750
I can't!

496
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:21,480
You are indeed smart.

497
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,420
Your martial arts skills

498
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:24,900
aren't bad either.

499
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:29,620
You just said my aptitude was mediocre

500
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,220
and untalented.

501
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,990
I haven't even called you out on that yet,

502
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,340
and now you're changing your tune.

503
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,890
Where is your sachet?

504
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,630
This is the sachet that Gao Yin bought.

505
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,410
This is your sachet.

506
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,650
Your sachet was left by the tea table,

507
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,239
Gao Yin found it...

508
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,070
and then I swapped it out.

509
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:14,250
Forgive me for being despicable just this once.

510
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,179
I wanted to keep it as a keepsake.

511
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,190
Take it.

512
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,120
You can recognize it?

513
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,060
In this world,

514
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,290
there are no two identical leaves.

515
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,330
I just

516
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,870
hadn't taken it out these past couple of days,

517
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,670
so I didn't notice.

518
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,130
Seems like it was just my wishful thinking.

519
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,280
Let me ask you.

520
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,449
When you gave me the candles that day,

521
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,719
did you wear the sachet on purpose

522
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,810
to make Qing Cai misunderstand?

523
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,989
That's how you found out my flaws?

524
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,220
You're awful.

525
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,500
I'm sorry.

526
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,840
My scheme

527
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,990
caused a misunderstanding between you two.

528
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:11,730
Forget it.

529
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,620
You are so smart.

530
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,290
If you had wanted to investigate,

531
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,370
you would've found everything anyway.

532
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,100
To be honest, I admire his magnanimity.

533
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,000
And I'm certain...

534
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,680
he truly loves you,

535
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,000
not just out of superficial possession.

536
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,350
When are you planning to act against us?

537
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,170
I won't do anything,

538
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,690
but I will return to the royal city with Hu Jiao and Gao Yin...

539
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,700
to report personally.

540
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,650
You should already know...

541
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,750
that Gao Yin has known Qing Cai's identity for a long time.

542
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,620
Otherwise,

543
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,330
you wouldn't have come to test in person,

544
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,210
would you?

545
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,530
You think Gao Yin won't report the truth?

546
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,200
You're wrong.

547
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,710
Once she receives explicit orders,

548
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,830
she wouldn't dare to defy them.

549
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,020
Because she has a family too.

550
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,670
I already feel grateful.

551
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,670
This is the most merciful approach we could hope for,

552
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:30,540
giving us... a chance to escape.

553
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,450
This is all I can do for you.

554
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,650
I hope you'll manage to escape safely.

555
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,630
And whatever happens,

556
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,520
don't go back to the royal city.

557
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,800
If we still stay in the royal city,

558
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,840
it'll be a fight to the death between us.

559
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,470
That's the last thing I want to see.

560
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,330
We won't stay in the royal city.

561
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,530
We will leave together,

562
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,550
to a place you can't find.

563
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,430
You...

564
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,350
are so certain?

565
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:03,940
Of course.

566
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,390
If we can make it out of here alive.

567
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,420
You're going to rescue him?

568
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,110
Do you think

569
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,420
he'd abandon his father?

570
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,500
Are you throwing your lives away?

571
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,540
Maybe...

572
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,450
that's why I trust him so much.

573
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,630
You're being far too reckless.

574
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,260
This is ridiculous.

575
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,880
Don't you have any other options?

576
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,690
What better option do we have?

577
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,960
Ask the General for help?

578
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,560
What if Mingyi Manor

579
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,150
decides to fight to the death?

580
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,440
What if you get involved too?

581
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,460
What do you think will happen?

582
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,450
But if anything happens,

583
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,640
his father could be killed.

584
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,920
What do you plan to do now?

585
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,040
We'll return to the royal city tomorrow to report.

586
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,120
Thank you...

587
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,570
for giving us one more day.

588
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,430
I've made my choice.

589
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,820
But this is the last time I'll give you a chance.

590
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,530
Then I'm leaving.

591
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,310
Take care.

592
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,630
Think it...

593
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,550
over.

594
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,070
Gao Yin!

595
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:32,600
Look.

596
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,540
Wang Yishao gave my sachet back to me.

597
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,670
Yours...

598
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,040
is with him.

599
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,780
That's what he should do.

600
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,440
So you didn't give Wang Yishao the sachet?

601
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,270
You're surprisingly magnanimous, huh?

602
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,630
Even willing to give me away.

603
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,750
No,

604
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,230
I wouldn't dare.

605
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,840
Besides... you're not really my anything.

606
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,140
Then, in that case,

607
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,810
I won't give you this sachet.

608
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,790
I'll just throw it away.

609
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,780
If you accept this sachet now,

610
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,680
it means you'll be mine from now on.

611
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,390
If you... ever give me away again,

612
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:22,930
I...

613
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,400
I'll strangle you to death.

614
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,300
Do you hear me?

615
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,340
Okay, I won't dare again.

616
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,680
Keep it carefully.

617
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,150
You two, with all your lovey-dovey moments,

618
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,920
it's unbearable.

619
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,140
Let's go.

620
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,760
You play so well.

621
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,210
Let's go.

622
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:54,720
Not bad.

623
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,790
I'm talented, aren't I?

624
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,040
You two...

625
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,230
have nothing in common,

626
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,940
yet you get along so harmoniously.

627
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,610
So strange.

628
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:07,790
You guys talk.

629
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,870
You two...

630
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,350
What's going on?

631
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,770
Let's go.

632
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,390
I have something to tell you.

633
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,640
Okay.

634
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,010
Let's go.

635
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,810
You found out?

636
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,940
You certainly showed patience...

637
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,660
keeping this from me all this time.

638
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,770
My mission...

639
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,430
doesn't involve gathering intelligence.

640
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,830
I'm here to ask...

641
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,810
if you'd help them rescue someone.

642
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,300
I know.

643
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,070
You have the ability to poison the entire Mingyi Manor.

644
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,210
So that they can rescue the person

645
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,060
and run away?

646
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,840
This is not my mission.

647
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,560
Besides...

648
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,350
I won't help our enemies.

649
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,240
Your stance is peculiar.

650
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,140
You won't help either side.

651
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,330
What are you really planning?

652
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,390
I can't make sense of you anymore.

653
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,310
You'll understand... in the future.

654
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,460
In that case...

655
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,320
what can I do to help them?

656
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,930
Wang Yishao will return tomorrow

657
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,080
with Gao Yin and Hu Jiao to report.

658
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:35,550
Why tomorrow?

659
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,950
It's such an important matter.

660
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:38,850
Shouldn't they go back now and report?

661
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,600
Is he being lenient because of you?

662
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,790
Not entirely.

663
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,320
I think

664
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:50,550
he's still conflicted,

665
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:53,010
unsure of his own stance.

666
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:55,560
On one hand, he's giving us time.

667
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,770
On the other hand,

668
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,940
he's giving himself time to sort things out.

669
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,840
Of course, these are just my guesses.

670
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:03,300
I think so too.

671
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,810
Then we need to leave now.

672
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,580
No.

673
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,810
You go alone

674
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,430
and report to the General.

675
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,250
Why?

676
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:15,610
Why are you staying here?

677
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:18,610
You're going to save Father?

678
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,930
No, that's suicide.

679
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,590
If you stay here,

680
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,110
I'm the one courting death.

681
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,560
It's only after you leave

682
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,780
that they won't dare act recklessly.

683
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:30,960
You mean

684
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,320
he might kill us all to silence us?

685
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:33,880
Exactly.

686
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,850
Your stronghold has already been destroyed.

687
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:37,840
The General can't get any news

688
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:39,670
and doesn't even know I'm here at Mingyi Manor.

689
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,320
If we all die,

690
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:43,870
the General will be left completely in the dark.

691
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:44,960
But...

692
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,030
Alright, don't worry.

693
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,960
I'll protect him with my life,

694
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:49,880
okay?

695
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,070
I need to talk to you. Let's talk in private.

696
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,640
It's okay. It's okay.

697
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:23,330
Are you ready?

698
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,720
Aren't we supposed to exchange some pleasantries

699
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,990
before jumping straight into it?

700
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,460
I have nothing to say to you.

701
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:29,430
Wait.

702
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,220
You said you're going to vent your anger.

703
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:36,850
What if you lose?

704
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:37,720
Then what?

705
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:38,630
I'll take full responsibility for my life or death.

706
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,140
Hold on.

707
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,050
You say you are responsible for your own life and death.

708
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,350
But there's no witness here.

709
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,940
What if I accidentally kill you?

710
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:52,350
Then what?

711
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:54,770
Whether I live or die will be up to fate.

712
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,680
Fine.

713
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:58,550
Let's begin, then.

714
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:04,960
Are you playing mind games with me?

715
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,020
I just don't want you to be so impulsive

716
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:09,240
and give you a moment to cool down.

717
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:10,800
We can take our time to fight.

718
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,200
Whether we fight quickly or slowly, we're still going to fight.

719
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,710
Enough talk.
