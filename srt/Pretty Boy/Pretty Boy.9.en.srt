1
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,670
(Pretty Boy)

2
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,600
(Episode 9)

3
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,310
What mourning are you talking about?

4
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,280
Who's mourning?

5
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,230
Aren't you a widow?

6
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,230
Isn't she a widow?

7
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,230
Actually, I am a widow.

8
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,150
My late husband has already passed away.

9
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,710
Yes, right.

10
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,820
I hope you can accept me.

11
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,550
Why are your tactics exactly the same as his?

12
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,270
He already accepted flowers from Young Master Wang last time.

13
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:52,829
He is a widow.

14
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,750
He can't accept your flowers.

15
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:07,990
I guess this is it.

16
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,270
We won't be able to go to class today.

17
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,070
So, are we breaking up?

18
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,070
I'll stay a bit longer.

19
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,030
Let's go.

20
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,430
That Hong Hui is really funny.

21
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,670
He actually sent you flowers.

22
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,740
I might have given him some wrong signals.

23
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,030
I've been observing him all day.

24
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,910
You suspect he's the stalker?

25
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,270
He's the most suspicious.

26
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,270
Besides, there are only a few people around Wang Yishao.

27
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,470
So his teaching of the so-called invisibility technique

28
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,630
is actually an intentional cover-up?

29
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,430
Every man has a fool in his sleeve.

30
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,870
This way of covering up

31
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,660
actually exposed his true intentions.

32
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,190
Are there any countermeasures?

33
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,310
How about you use your charms to win him over?

34
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,909
Wang Yishao seems to like Gan Pu a lot.

35
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,590
Looks like you've known for a while.

36
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,510
This was my first time having deep interaction with you all.

37
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,390
You seem a bit... Jealous?

38
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,030
I feel that between her and me,

39
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,950
it's probably impossible.

40
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,710
You haven't actually fallen for Gan Pu, have you?

41
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,750
We have so many important things to do.

42
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,670
I've got no time

43
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,350
to be caught up in such romantic entanglements.

44
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,510
So what should we do now?

45
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,190
Let's analyze the situation.

46
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,230
Go collect a few props for me.

47
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,430
Okay.

48
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,670
This is the Mo Clan.

49
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,310
The one specialized in slingshots.

50
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,990
This is Mingyi Manor.

51
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,800
Kill.

52
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,790
This is the General.

53
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,030
That's us.

54
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,430
We have armor.

55
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,390
This is Wang Quan.

56
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,470
It's the only one left.

57
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,030
The Mo Clan and Mingyi Manor are enemies.

58
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,990
The Mo Clan and the General are also adversaries.

59
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,810
The General and Mingyi Manor are enemies.

60
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,030
But Mingyi Manor

61
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,740
is actually in a cooperative relationship with Wang Quan.

62
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,550
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

63
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,040
So we should be allies with the Mo Clan, right?

64
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,280
But for some reason, Wang Yishao thinks

65
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,430
that we and the Mo Clan are enemies.

66
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,670
We and the Mo Clan...

67
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,150
We and the Mo Clan are enemies?

68
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,790
Judging from Mingyi Manor's

69
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,510
previous attitude towards my father,

70
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,830
Mingyi Manor must be our enemy.

71
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,270
Not just enemies,

72
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,680
but mortal enemies.

73
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,310
But after learning about your identity as the former Emperor's son,

74
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,060
Mingyi Manor's attitude towards my father has changed.

75
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,670
Could it be that you're not on our side either?

76
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,670
Many alliances would

77
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,430
change due to interests.

78
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,460
There are no eternal enemies,

79
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,230
nor eternal friends.

80
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,550
All the information we've received

81
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,230
might be inaccurate.

82
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,270
Gao Yin works for Wang,

83
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,750
but she hasn't made a move against us yet.

84
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,670
That's really strange.

85
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,140
Should we continue to test Mingyi Manor?

86
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,030
It's necessary.

87
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,280
Father revealed the information that I'm the former Emperor's son.

88
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,000
It's obvious that the information he knows

89
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,390
is much more than what we know.

90
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,360
But since we don't have this information,

91
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,950
we can't immediately know

92
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,190
what to do next.

93
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,710
What we can do now

94
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,150
is to get closer to Mingyi Manor.

95
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,020
If we could find Father, that would be best.

96
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,830
This way, we can learn more information.

97
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,510
Let's go find Yinniang.

98
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,390
But Yinniang is no ordinary person.

99
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,870
Completely false information...

100
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,000
She probably won't fall for it.

101
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,310
Then what should we do?

102
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,100
We can't just tell her I'm with the General.

103
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,790
Wouldn't that be walking right into the trap?

104
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,530
Do you remember how we

105
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,870
tricked you before?

106
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,790
A friend of the former Emperor's son.

107
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,870
Judging from our previous actions,

108
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:07,970
it doesn't seem like the General

109
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,740
or any other faction is behind it.

110
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,070
Using this identity would indeed be safer for you.

111
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,630
And we're telling the truth.

112
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,390
What if they capture me

113
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,550
and interrogate me through torture?

114
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,820
What should I do then?

115
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,990
Treating Father well isn't a trap, is it?

116
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,510
They're not even torturing Father anymore. Why would they torture you?

117
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,630
That's right.

118
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,310
I'll go right away.

119
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,230
Wait.

120
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,240
Don't be hasty.

121
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,210
Let me tell you about

122
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,230
what kind of person Mr. Shang Shan is.

123
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,350
Teacher.

124
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,470
Why are you always doing such weird things?

125
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,710
How dirty the dew water is.

126
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,670
Not to mention it's covered in dust,

127
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,230
before you take a sip of it,

128
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,740
the insects, spiders,

129
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,710
flies, and mosquitoes have all taken a sip of it.

130
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,590
Why is your mouth so foul?

131
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,180
Every word you say stinks.

132
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,070
Who taught you that?

133
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,510
Well, you are my teacher.

134
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,670
Fine, I won't sip it anymore.

135
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,800
Keep it. Hey.

136
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,440
Keep it to collect the dew tomorrow.

137
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,840
I've thrown it away 5,874 times.

138
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,830
As expected of my master.

139
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,480
Your persistent pursuit

140
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,190
is truly awe-inspiring.

141
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,190
Today is the last time.

142
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,360
You're finally kicking me out?

143
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,430
It's not that I'm kicking you out,

144
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,870
but I'm kicking myself out.

145
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,900
You've finally had enough of me.

146
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,150
I've taught you for 15 years,

147
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,110
and played the fool for 15 years.

148
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,630
It's time to set you free.

149
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,230
You've already said this

150
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,110
3,285 times.

151
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,790
That wasn't the number yesterday.

152
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,750
Anyone can make up numbers on the spot.

153
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,840
People

154
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,110
always need to grow.

155
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,630
This time, you'll have to face it alone.

156
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,670
You're serious this time.

157
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,790
In that sense,

158
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,550
your master doesn't really seem like a transcendent being.

159
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,310
He even ghosted you.

160
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:48,870
To be precise,

161
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,490
he was never like a transcendent being to begin with.

162
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,990
The main goal is to make Yinniang believe you.

163
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,790
I heard you brought us some important news.

164
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,470
Yes.

165
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,110
I've found out the identities of those rescuers from yesterday.

166
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,710
I specially came here to inform you.

167
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,390
Who are they?

168
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,950
The person you captured has an adopted son.

169
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,990
They are friends of that adopted son.

170
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,310
How do you know this?

171
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,590
I'm also his friend.

172
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,520
So you knew about the operation in advance?

173
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,270
I... Didn't know.

174
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,900
I came in here to get information.

175
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,120
My mission was to find the location and tell them.

176
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,430
To avoid exposure,

177
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,110
I didn't participate in the operation.

178
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,710
That's contradictory.

179
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,270
Then why are you exposing yourself now?

180
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,910
I've just come to a realization.

181
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,190
I think we might not be enemies.

182
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,790
Why would you think that?

183
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,790
Intuition.

184
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,910
What's the name of that adopted son?

185
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,970
I can't tell you his name.

186
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,420
I came here on my own initiative this time,

187
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,350
without obtaining his consent.

188
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,990
What's his identity?

189
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,990
The son of the former Emperor.

190
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,510
How do you know that?

191
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,550
From Mr. Shang Shan.

192
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,320
Mr. Shang Shan?

193
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,310
That's not someone you could casually meet.

194
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,670
The son of the former Emperor took me there.

195
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,910
Of course he would meet me.

196
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,550
So what does Mr. Shang Shan look like?

197
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,830
He's an old peasant.

198
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,950
He doesn't have any mystical aura around him.

199
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,630
He doesn't look like a famous person at all.

200
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,110
You're just making this up.

201
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,110
It's true.

202
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,510
What do you want?

203
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,270
I want to see the person you've captured.

204
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,510
To ensure he's unharmed.

205
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,390
Not now.

206
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,390
There's no trust between us yet.

207
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,670
Bring that son of the former Emperor here first.

208
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,230
As you said,

209
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,870
we don't trust each other.

210
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,670
The son of the former Emperor is my last card.

211
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,870
I can't tell you now.

212
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,150
Alright then.

213
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,750
We can wait.

214
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,600
Then wait.

215
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,150
I hope you can trust me soon.

216
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,390
I'll take my leave now.

217
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,230
Are they in cahoots with that captive?

218
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,860
They were there to rescue him.

219
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,930
Otherwise, they couldn't have triggered the mechanism.

220
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,060
So it's impossible they conspired in the cell.

221
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,230
Let's wait.

222
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,030
See who loses patience first.

223
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,550
By the way,

224
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,030
should we arrange for someone

225
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,550
to renovate their living quarters?

226
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,470
So they don't have to be cramped together.

227
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,150
We're short-handed. Everyone's out searching.

228
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,950
Try to renovate as much as possible.

229
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,510
Letting them live together

230
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,150
was meant to keep them in check, wasn't it?

231
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,430
It seems that's not working at all now.

232
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,950
Gao Yin does whatever she wants.

233
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,750
Hu Jiao is just a fool.

234
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,490
Since that son of the former Emperor

235
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,230
wants them to have better living conditions,

236
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,590
let's grant his wish.

237
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,630
Yes.

238
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,070
When you have time, go to the town more often.

239
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,910
Take Han Aizhen with you.

240
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,910
Yes.

241
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,470
It rains a lot in the mountains.

242
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,190
You should be more careful about safety in the future.

243
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,770
Are you from the Mo Clan?

244
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,360
I want to ask you a sensitive question.

245
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,910
You don't have to answer.

246
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,900
Over these years,

247
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,190
have you joined any organizations?

248
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,110
Since you've asked,

249
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,630
I'll also ask you a sensitive question.

250
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,240
You don't have to answer either.

251
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,520
You want to be an extraordinary person so much,

252
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,310
so why did you come to Mingyi Manor

253
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,710
and join this whirlpool of right and wrong?

254
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,950
For the little bit of family affection that remains, I suppose.

255
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,430
Be careful.

256
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,510
Did you get it?

257
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,310
I got it! I got it!

258
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,600
Awesome!

259
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,030
Come on, get down.

260
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,100
Green plain, red bridge, same as the good old days,

261
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,830
yet the person is not seen,

262
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,270
and water flows in vain.

263
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,630
The imperial family is the most heartless of all.

264
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,310
When you grow up,

265
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,710
you have no choice but to let a part of yourself die.

266
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,390
For that bit of obsession you can't let go,

267
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,540
like clinging to the most beautiful things in the mortal world.

268
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,350
I can understand you a little now.

269
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,070
Tell us,

270
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,750
why did you come here?

271
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,110
Of course,

272
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,790
you still don't have to answer.

273
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,320
Me?

274
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,510
I'm here because of someone else's obsession.

275
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,790
It's a long story, anyway.

276
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,550
I'll tell you more if there's a chance in the future.

277
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,110
As long as there is a future.

278
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,710
What I mean is,

279
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,190
in a place full of right and wrong like this,

280
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,110
I'm afraid there might not be much of a future.

281
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,270
I was too impulsive before.

282
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,750
I hadn't adapted to my current role.

283
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,829
How can we get involved in romantic relationships easily in a place like this?

284
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:11,910
Indeed.

285
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,109
It's just like a dream.

286
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:20,819
There are sweet dreams,

287
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,589
and there are nightmares.

288
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,390
Isn't life just like that?

289
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,230
Since ancient times, being too sentimental only leads to regret.

290
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,670
The sweetest dreams are always the easiest to wake from.

291
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,270
I'm back to life now!

292
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,190
It's weird.

293
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,710
Why do you all look unhappy?

294
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:43,870
Now that I'm here,

295
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,670
everyone, smile and dance!

296
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,870
You're back to life again.

297
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,550
Can the class this afternoon go as planned?

298
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,070
What are you looking for?

299
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,470
Where's my mask?

300
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,430
Can't teach without your mask?

301
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,400
Of course, the atmosphere isn't right without it.

302
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,830
I'm going to look for my mask now.

303
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,070
Boss, I want one of these.

304
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,790
It's really delicious.

305
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,030
Is it that good?

306
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,020
(Lover's Tears Spicy Hotpot)

307
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,820
I want a hotpot, please.
(Lover's Tears Spicy Hotpot)

308
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,770
Me too.
(Lover's Tears Spicy Hotpot)

309
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,070
(Lover's Tears Spicy Hotpot)

310
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,630
Okay.
(Lover's Tears Spicy Hotpot)

311
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:17,670
(Lover's Tears Spicy Hotpot)

312
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,400
Delicious skewers.
(Lover's Tears Spicy Hotpot)

313
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,270
Delicious skewers.

314
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,190
I'll have a few skewers.

315
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:20,480
(Lover's Tears Skewers)
I'll have a few skewers.

316
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,110
Sure. Sure.
(Lover's Tears Skewers)

317
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,200
(Lover's Tears Skewers)

318
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,250
Sir, come check out our spicy hotpot.

Sir, come check out our spicy hotpot.

321
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,710
It's really good.

(Lover's Tears Grilled Chicken)

323
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,790
The flavor is excellent.

(Lover's Tears Grilled Chicken)

325
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,630
Endless longing is like a heart-wrenching poison,

326
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,070
making lovers shed tears.

327
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,510
This doggerel poem is quite like Young Master Wang's style.

328
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,470
When we're drunk and appreciating flowers, it's all about the beauty of flowers.

329
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,230
When we shed tears because of love, it's all about sorrow in our hearts.

330
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,630
What is this?

331
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,320
Wine. It's Tears of Lovers, you know.

332
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,750
Wine?

333
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,350
Let me have a taste.

334
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,430
Well, I'll have to turn you down.

335
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,870
After all, no one who tasted it bought it.

336
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,830
Are you going to let me taste it or not?

337
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,870
Are you going to buy it or not?

338
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,990
Hey, what do you mean?

339
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,030
What's with your attitude?

340
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,270
You don't know how hot-tempered I am, do you?

341
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,230
Bring it on. Are you here to cause trouble?

342
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,190
What are you trying to do?

343
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,710
Please calm down.

344
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,010
You can taste it. You can taste it.

345
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,990
Big Brother, but if he tastes it...

346
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,390
Let's go, we have goods to sell.

347
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:35,990
Let's go, let's go.

348
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,830
I'll stay here to help him.

349
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,670
Alright, here you are.

350
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,150
It smells good.

351
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,160
What are you waiting for?

352
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,390
This guy is so dramatic.

353
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,310
Tears of Lovers?

354
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,350
This is nonsense!

355
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,820
This is clearly

356
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,390
the bitterness of growing up,

357
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,790
accompanied by the fresh fragrance of the mountains and wilderness.

358
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,070
What... What does that mean?

359
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,060
He must be sick in the head.

360
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,350
Boss, I'll have ten jars.

361
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:31,990
Ten jars?

362
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,510
Are you sure? Ten jars?

363
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,350
What? Don't you understand what I said?

364
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,070
I can speak dog language. Can you understand that?

365
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,390
He really has a foul mouth.

366
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,270
I, I, I, I...

367
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,990
I'll pack.. Pack it for you.

368
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,950
Pack... Pack it up. What else?

369
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,310
You want me to deliver it myself?

370
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,190
It's so heavy.

371
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,990
Deliver it to Mingyi Manor. I'll pay for the transportation.

372
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,710
Isn't Mingyi Manor full of women?

373
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,750
Right... Right.

374
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,710
Don't I look like a woman?

375
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,710
You do, you really do.

376
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,790
What did you say?

377
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,310
Are you insulting me? What's with that look?

378
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,750
Anyway, those from Mingyi Manor are all a bit odd.

379
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,150
Who knows whether you are a girl or not?

380
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,310
It seems you all

381
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,110
must have had contact with people from Mingyi Manor.

382
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,190
I'm telling you.

383
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,470
Something big is about to happen to Mingyi Manor.

384
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,710
Many people will die.

385
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,030
Never mind.

386
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,830
I'm done teasing you.

387
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,740
Deliver the ten jars of wine to Mingyi Manor.

388
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,550
I'll leave the money here.

389
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,950
You must be quite familiar with Qing Cai, right?

390
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,670
Tell me about her, will you?

391
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,390
I've only known him for a few days.

392
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,070
There's a lot I don't know about him as well.

393
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,620
Well, tell me what you do know.

394
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,790
What does she like? What does she dislike?

395
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,110
What are her hobbies?

396
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,510
Your happiness won't be found in Qing Cai.

397
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:25,790
I advise you not to think too much about it.

398
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,590
Why are you saying this too?

399
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,470
It seems like the whole world doesn't have faith in me.

400
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,030
You're not the one I don't have faith in.

401
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,850
It's him I don't have faith in.

402
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,150
What do you mean?

403
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,040
How should I explain this?

404
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,710
Alright, alright, say no more.

405
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,070
Leave me with some hope.

406
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,590
No matter how uncertain the future is,

407
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,030
I will always face the sun in my heart,

408
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,430
searching for the hope that can never be found.

409
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,550
This is for you.

410
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,110
Why are you giving her a white flower?

411
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,110
Are you attending a funeral?

412
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,630
A gentleman wearing white

413
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,190
symbolizes purity and innocence.

414
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,750
This kind of flower

415
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,590
really doesn't suit me.

416
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,870
Let me pass on this gift.

417
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,550
I'll give it to you.

418
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,590
I believe you won't misunderstand my intentions.

419
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,110
Thank you.

420
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,230
Young Master Wang.

421
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,470
I don't think you know me well enough.

422
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,750
Such a pure white flower

423
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,670
doesn't suit me that well.

424
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,990
That's why I gave it to the most suitable person.

425
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,830
I've been in the Martial Arts World for over a decade.

426
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,830
My thoughts aren't as simple as you might think.

427
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,350
But I can see from your eyes

428
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,470
that your innocent heart hasn't changed.

429
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,630
Even though you're caught in a whirlpool,

430
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,710
your heart is still pure white.

431
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,790
Thank you for your compliment.

432
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,550
However,

433
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,540
I already have someone in my heart.

434
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,100
It's okay. I can wait.

435
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,630
Everything went smoothly with Yinniang.

436
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,470
That's good.

437
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,990
What are you doing?

438
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,630
These are the ingredients for Lover's Tears.

439
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,030
No wonder I felt something was off that day.

440
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,790
So it was really you who was behind it.

441
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,900
It was because of your hint.

442
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,030
You said Hu Jiao had money.

443
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,570
That's what you get for not trusting us back then.

444
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,630
You had money but wouldn't give us any.

445
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,020
I reported it to the higher-ups,

446
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,110
but it didn't get approved, right?

447
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,350
However,

448
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,870
it's true that I didn't trust you guys back then.

449
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,550
Trust is the key to cooperation.

450
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,750
We were all so scheming against each other back then.

451
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,670
No wonder we failed to work well together.

452
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,150
I'm sorry.

453
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,750
That's not your fault.

454
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,070
Sometimes,

455
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,340
even close partners don't trust each other,

456
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,270
let alone us who just met by chance.

457
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,710
I trust you unconditionally now.

458
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,310
Thank you.

459
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,190
Speaking of which,

460
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,870
your Lover's Tears

461
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,300
is really spicy as hell.

462
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,310
It burns every part of the body.

463
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,310
It's practically poison.

464
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,680
It's all thanks to Gao Yin.

465
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,110
Gao Yin?

466
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,230
Are you involved with her too?

467
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,110
I...

468
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,910
Why are you so crude with your words?

469
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,210
I grew up in a training camp

470
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,990
full of guys.

471
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,030
They were really slovenly,

472
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,070
so I ended up being like this.

473
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,630
These are the formulas Gao Yin gave me.

474
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,150
Also,

475
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,390
she was the first person to know I'm a man.

476
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,870
Gao Yin is one of them.

477
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,390
Why are you still alive?

478
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,990
You're not actually having an affair with her, are you?

479
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,390
What do you think?

480
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,310
I...

481
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,030
I don't think

482
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,150
her taste is that low.

483
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,950
You rubbed chili on me!

484
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,030
Stop.

485
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,480
Wait a moment.

486
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,340
You're more skilled in martial arts than me.

487
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,110
I admit defeat.

488
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,270
What does this have to do with martial arts?

489
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,470
However,

490
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,550
you don't really act like a girl.

491
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,230
What do you mean?

492
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,670
How am I not like a girl?

493
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,870
I mean,

494
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,510
you don't say things like a girl would,

495
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,480
like 'you're bullying me' or something.

496
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:42,990
Weird.

497
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,310
How could that be bullying?

498
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,950
If I can't win, I can't win.

499
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,740
If I can't beat you, I'll just admit defeat.

500
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,950
Impressive. You're quite the heroine.

501
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,870
You're still in the mood to cut?

502
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,350
So that's your move, huh?

503
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,030
Alright, alright, I won't bother you anymore.

504
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,190
Take your time cooking.

505
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,230
So all those barrier-breaking things you have

506
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,990
were obtained by swindling money from us.

507
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,350
What do you mean swindling? That's just business.

508
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,590
It's a willing transaction.

509
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,150
Gan Pu must have helped a lot, right?

510
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,070
Yes, she has.

511
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,950
Yesterday we were still partners,

512
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,310
yet today we've become strangers.

513
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,630
It's really hard to adjust.

514
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,270
You seem to like her a lot.

515
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,510
It's only been a few days,

516
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,470
and you've developed such deep feelings for her?

517
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,310
I don't know either.

518
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,470
I feel like we are lovers

519
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,750
that have been in love for many years.

520
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,910
This sudden separation

521
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,830
is really quite painful.

522
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,390
Does she feel the same way about you?

523
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,710
I've seen Wang Yishao pursuing her quite attentively.

524
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,110
If we really end up becoming enemies,

525
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,630
I won't go against her.

526
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,710
Well, she might not hesitate to go against you.

527
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,870
She won't.

528
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,070
So sure?

529
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,590
Because at most, we're enemies by faction,

530
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,350
not personal enemies.

531
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,310
That's true.

532
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,150
But your feelings for each other are another matter.

533
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,830
What about me?

534
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,390
How do you plan to treat me?

535
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,390
That was Father's wish.

536
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,830
You don't have to force yourself.

537
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,190
I'm not forcing myself.

538
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,590
I like you.

539
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,030
But...

540
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,310
This...

541
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,870
It's only been such a short time.

542
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,150
It might seem sudden to you,

543
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,000
but I've known you since I was little.

544
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,750
Back then,

545
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,230
I was locked up alone there learning martial arts.

546
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,150
Father would occasionally come to see me.

547
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,870
Every time, he would tell me stories about you.

548
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,350
That's when I realized

549
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,190
whether you were making a fool of yourself

550
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,270
or doing something stupid,

551
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,590
I liked it all.

552
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,550
You accompanied me as I grew up, day by day,

553
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,510
and later on,

554
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:04,030
you became a part of my entire childhood.

555
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:06,750
I think

556
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,670
Father might have wanted to tell me this way

557
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:12,900
that both he and you were by my side.

558
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,270
There's no need to be nervous.

559
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,790
Feelings can be nurtured gradually, you know.

560
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,270
I can wait.

561
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,390
I'm sorry.

562
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,590
What are you sorry for?

563
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,630
People in the Martial Arts World don't fuss over small matters.

564
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,550
Have you ever felt

565
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,950
that you're actually somewhat like a hostage?

566
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,230
A hostage?

567
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,430
Think about it.

568
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,630
Father always raised me,

569
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,670
but he was able to visit you

570
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,190
and develop a relationship with you,

571
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,630
making himself unable to let go.

572
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,590
Isn't this actually safer for me?

573
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,550
I've never thought about it that way.

574
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,400
Logically speaking,

575
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,630
Father carried such an important mission.

576
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,430
Why was he always able to visit you?

577
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,710
Although Father is skilled in martial arts and he's loyal,

578
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,910
without more guarantees,

579
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,390
would the General be at ease?

580
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,550
But they couldn't have sent people to monitor him either.

581
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:33,670
The more people knew, the less safe it would be.

582
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,190
It does seem to be that way.

583
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,070
I practiced martial arts there,

584
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,790
but I wasn't one of their death warriors.

585
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,830
Father might be a death warrior himself,

586
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,470
so you've been his only concern.

587
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:51,870
That's why

588
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,230
he didn't hesitate to entrust you to me on that day.

589
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,910
Father must have felt

590
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,590
really painful.

591
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,910
He has children

592
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,070
but cannot raise them.

593
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,870
As his daughter,

594
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,030
I have never fulfilled my filial duties either.

595
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,310
I've always

596
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:28,790
treated him as my real father.

597
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,150
So,

598
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,820
I will do right by you.

599
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:41,150
Who needs your pity?

600
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,030
As for you,

601
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,960
just be yourself.

602
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,280
Do whatever

603
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,190
you want to do.

604
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,870
Thank you.

605
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,430
As I always say,

606
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,510
people in the Martial Arts World

607
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,390
don't fuss over small matters.

608
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,000
Next, I'll teach you the colors of facial masks

609
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,590
and what they represent.

610
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,830
Black represents fierceness and recklessness.

611
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,630
Wait.

612
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,630
Isn't black for ghosts?

613
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,150
Are ghosts fierce?

614
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,190
Blue represents ruggedness and defiance.

615
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,190
Isn't blue supposed to represent calmness?

616
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,990
I always feel sleepy when I see blue.

617
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:48,950
Then be quiet.

618
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:49,870
You...

619
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,430
Red represents loyalty and bravery,

620
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,510
for example, Guan Yu.

621
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,470
Red!

622
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,910
I know it represents passion.

623
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,910
Like red chili peppers.

624
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,470
It builds up my appetite.

625
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,190
She always ends up talking about food.

626
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:06,660
Alright, alright.

627
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,040
Actually, all of these

628
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,140
are meant to label each character,

629
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,070
making them easier to understand.

630
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,670
Look, there are some costumes here

631
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,030
that go with the facial masks.

632
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,880
You can try them on and experience them for yourselves.

633
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,750
I don't like them.

634
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,270
They're not pretty.

635
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,630
Can I try on this costume now?

636
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,590
Go ahead and try. I borrowed all of them.

637
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:47,580
You're crying one moment and laughing the next.

638
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,390
It really tugs at my heartstrings.

639
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,790
I didn't know you were capable of compassion.

640
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,230
A doctor's heart is like a parent's.

641
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,270
What did you take me for?

642
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,790
A vicious woman, I suppose.

643
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,110
Good.

644
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,510
You can even joke now.

645
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,310
I don't have to worry about you anymore.

646
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,350
Thank you.

647
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,430
I'm not that fragile.

648
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,350
I'm just learning to experience things your way,

649
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,320
viewing my current self through another version of me.

650
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,630
Don't focus too much on the outcome.

651
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,110
But you must fully engage.

652
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,470
Engage deeply.

653
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,870
Life is not easy.

654
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,350
If you don't experience it thoroughly,

655
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,790
wouldn't this life be wasted?

656
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,370
It's easy to say,

657
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,590
but how many people in this world can actually do it?

658
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,210
At the most inappropriate time,

659
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,190
developing feelings that shouldn't exist.

660
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,230
Aren't you an old hand in the Martial Arts World?

661
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,310
Have you noticed

662
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,710
that when people are most comfortable,

663
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,630
they need true feelings the least?

664
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,840
It's often just a playful attitude

665
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,180
or a sense of possession.

666
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,870
It's precisely in the most dangerous times

667
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,990
that true feelings are most easily revealed.

668
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,350
The emotional foundation built at such times

669
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,270
is the most reliable.

670
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,990
What is fate?

671
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,960
It's when two people

672
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,750
meet when their hearts are most unsettled.

673
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,190
You've hardly experienced the Martial Arts World.

674
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,950
How do you know all this?

675
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,950
I've met quite a few people.

676
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:57,710
The more people face life and death situations,

677
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,430
the more easily they reveal their true feelings.

678
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,670
It's the pain of parting, you know.

679
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,670
The pain of parting.

680
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,550
Isn't the pain of parting a denial of feelings?

681
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,470
When love is unrequited,

682
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,550
people need self-comfort even more.

683
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:22,030
Otherwise, they'd go crazy.

684
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,790
When love comes like a tidal wave,

685
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,110
trying to stop it

686
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,310
must take every ounce of strength, right?

687
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,430
Sometimes,

688
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,710
the more you try to stop it, the more dangerous it becomes.

689
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,390
I don't know what to do either.

690
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,670
Do I look beautiful?

691
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,350
Yes.

692
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,550
Take a closer look.

693
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,910
You do.

694
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,990
Why does your face look even more bitter than a bitter melon?

695
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,310
You look good.

696
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,760
Do I look good?

697
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,190
Yes.

698
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,190
What are you two chatting about?

699
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,230
Why didn't you use that time to try on a few more outfits?

700
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,230
What do you two think of this outfit?

701
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,360
Do I have Zhang Fei's aura?

702
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,390
You look even more like Zhang Fei than Zhang Fei himself.

703
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,070
You have good taste.

704
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,710
I think

705
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,510
you need an 18-foot Serpent-headed Spear to complete the look.

706
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,950
The spear is too slender.

707
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,950
I think

708
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,150
this broadsword suits me better.

709
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,350
Young master.

710
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,990
I don't seem to recognize you.

711
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,510
May I ask for your name?

712
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,590
You brought wine again?

713
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,550
Yes, indeed.

714
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,510
Zhang Fang, it's only been a few days,

715
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,630
and you already found a new kind of wine?

716
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,870
I just acquired it. It tastes quite good.

717
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,590
You'll definitely like it.

718
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,350
The fresh aroma of the wilderness.

719
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,870
You truly are a kindred spirit.

720
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,310
Not bad.

721
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,870
You suddenly ran off.

722
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,630
Was it to look for this wine?

723
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:31,630
Well, you know,

724
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,550
one must always find some enjoyment for oneself.

725
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,750
But of course,

726
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,950
I have you.

727
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,790
You can always put me last on your list.

728
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,710
So did you come back early

729
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,630
to help me with something?

730
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,830
When we meet, let's not speak of worldly affairs.

731
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:52,230
Let's wander freely, drunk in dreams of mountains and seas.

732
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,270
Riding a crane, our spirits soar 30 thousand miles.

733
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,840
Waking from a dream, years have already passed.

734
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,750
Your doggerel hasn't improved much.

735
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:05,990
However,

736
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,030
I think the artistic conception is quite good.

737
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,150
Still a kindred spirit.

738
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,230
Come on.

739
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,470
I've only been here for a few days,

740
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,430
and I already feel completely soured.

741
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,390
This world of fame and fortune

742
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,830
really is a big dye vat, isn't it?

743
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,510
You've gained quite a lot of insights these past few days.

744
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,740
You've made progress.

745
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,070
There's still hope for you.

746
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,190
Taking advantage of me again, are you?

747
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,270
Why are you guys so fond of beards?

748
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,110
This doesn't suit you, does it?

749
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,670
You brought this here, so why can't I use it?

750
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,310
I think Hu Jiao should be the one to use this.

751
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,510
As for you,

752
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,670
you should go for a more ladylike accessory.

753
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,550
Are you saying Hu Jiao is more masculine than me?

754
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,990
You've got a good eye. I didn't realize that.

755
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,710
In the entire Mingyi Manor,

756
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,070
including you,

757
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,430
who's more masculine than I am?

758
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,550
You want to be a man?

759
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,030
Why would you say that?

760
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,910
That's what you just implied, isn't it?

761
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,710
As a woman,

762
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:11,840
isn't making men less manly

763
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,390
more interesting?

764
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,490
Making men less manly

765
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,790
and being more masculine than men

766
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,270
are two completely different things.

767
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,710
Are they?

768
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,470
Then it seems we have different understandings.

769
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:25,390
But it doesn't matter.

770
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,870
It's normal for people to have differences.

771
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:29,990
Alright then.

772
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,740
I'm just more interested in men's attire.

773
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:34,750
Do you have any problem with that?
