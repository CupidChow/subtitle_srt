00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:06,780
(Pretty Boy)

2
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,539
(Episode 5)

3
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,490
Let's go check it out.

4
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,670
You really have a lot of tricks up your sleeve.

5
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,270
Hurry.

6
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,840
I've caught both of you red-handed this time, huh?

7
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,470
So, it was you who triggered the alarm bells

8
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,550
to frame the two of us?

9
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,270
Who told you that?

10
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,680
It's clear that you ran in here

11
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,950
and set off the alarm bells yourselves.

12
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,590
Oh, I see.

13
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,560
Then why would the two of us run in here?

14
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,190
You two...

15
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,079
You two were trying to steal the bells.

16
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,910
I've always said that you're so clever

17
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,990
and can always see through to the truth of things.

18
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,470
Why did you come in here?

19
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,470
Hunting, of course.

20
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,360
We were chasing a rabbit and accidentally activated the barrier.

21
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,670
Nonsense.

22
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,560
Then what else could it possibly be?

23
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,190
Do you hunt every day?

24
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,870
Yeah.

25
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,470
Hu Jiao has a cat,

26
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,110
so there's not enough meat to go around anymore.

27
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,990
Am I right?

28
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,990
Well, that's true.

29
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,110
They do indeed hunt every day.

30
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,630
You can go hunting outside.

31
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,150
How is that possible? It's way too far.

32
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,460
And if we had to search all over the mountains for prey,

33
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,120
we'd starve to death...

34
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,190
before

35
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,350
we even found anything.

36
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,430
That's right.

37
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,430
Let's remove all these temporary barriers on the mountain.

38
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,030
What? Why remove the barriers?

39
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,550
How can you remove the barriers?

40
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,620
I mean, that's great!

41
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,830
Then we'd finally have enough meat.

42
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,150
What nonsense is she talking about?

43
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,870
What's all this gibberish?

44
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,709
What are you talking about?

45
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,190
See,

46
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,510
your reputation for talking nonsense has spread.

47
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,720
I was just worried.

48
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,620
Anyway, today's rabbit... isn't even that fat.

49
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,430
Let's go.

50
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,750
Let's go.

51
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,310
Let's go.

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,750
Qing Cai.

53
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,510
Do you think

54
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,710
people really have souls

55
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,550
after they die?

56
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,950
I don't know.

57
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,190
At least... I've never seen one.

58
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,390
I often have nightmares.

59
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,110
In my dreams...

60
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,350
they always push me to seek revenge.

61
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,310
They?

62
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,350
Who are "they"?

63
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,430
My parents.

64
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,430
And many others.

65
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,470
They were all from my clan.

66
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,390
Didn't you say that when you were little,

67
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,710
your uncle took you away?

68
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,909
How would you even know them?

69
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,270
I don't know them,

70
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,470
but that's a dream, you know.

71
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,270
In the dream, I just know it's them.

72
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,270
When you were little,

73
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,270
did your uncle always scare you

74
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,550
by saying that if you didn't seek revenge,

75
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,430
your family members would never rest in peace?

76
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,990
That day when I saw you aiming at Yinniang,

77
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,630
all I saw was despair

78
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,510
and a desire to be freed.

79
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,990
Actually, I know everything.

80
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,270
But I just can't get rid of those nightmares.

81
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,800
You've never even seen your parents.

82
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,150
Where would this obsession with revenge come from?

83
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,310
The one who caused all of this is your uncle.

84
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,470
He was the real demon.

85
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,910
He shifted the burden of the family feud onto you.

86
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,380
You were just a child back then.

87
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:23,590
Don't you dare...

88
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,150
Don't you dare talk about my uncle like that.

89
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,710
I'm saying this for you.

90
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,710
Why can you even joke about

91
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,020
such serious and sad matters?

92
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,150
How do you do it?

93
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,750
Growing up,

94
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,310
all you've felt is tension and fear, right?

95
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,030
You must really want to relax.

96
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,360
♫What kind of encounter♫

97
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,850

So you really like Qing Cai that much, huh?

123
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,950
Anyway, I've already lost my soul.

124
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,470
Hong Hui,

125
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,309
you're not getting any younger.

126
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,750
When are you going to settle down and get married?

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,660
You don't... like Qing Cai too, do you?

128
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,830
Qing Cai is an extraordinary woman.

129
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,030
She's not someone we can like.

130
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,960
You really don't like her?

131
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,710
Hong Hui, what you like

132
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,870
doesn't mean we all like it,

133
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,990
you know?

134
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,710
So, you do like her.

135
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,430
I like Gan Pu.

136
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,070
I've never met a woman like her.

137
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,150
But that Gan Pu

138
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,550
isn't that outstanding, is she?

139
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,070
Gold is still gold,

140
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,390
even when buried in sand.

141
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,750
I get what you mean now.

142
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,070
What's gold in your eyes

143
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,190
might just be sand in others' eyes.

144
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,950
Did you find those instructors?

145
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,470
Why is that Sun Li so unreliable?

146
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,960
I'm unreliable to begin with.

147
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,190
Isn't this the result you wanted?

148
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,030
But she is way too unreliable, isn't she?

149
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,270
Well, there's nothing we can do about it now.

150
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,030
I'll just have to put in more effort myself.

151
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,460
How about you give me a direction

152
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,430
and tell me who the focus of attention is?

153
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,030
Everyone.

154
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,150
Including you?

155
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,260
Gao Yin and Hu Jiao?

156
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,710
Do I need to repeat it again?

157
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,030
Alright.

158
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,750
That's how unreliable I am, actually.

159
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,430
Do you still think I can pull it off?

160
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,030
You're not stupid.

161
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,670
Alright, then.

162
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,350
You even know how to prepare medicinal herbs.

163
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,210
Before coming to Mingyi Manor,

164
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,470
what did you do?

165
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,310
I was originally a maid,

166
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,350
but because I was born strong and smart,

167
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,630
I was sent here.

168
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,870
You seem to... have received special training, right?

169
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,150
I learned martial arts from my master.

170
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,390
So what's your purpose for coming here?

171
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,110
Are you two close?

172
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,270
You and her.

173
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,200
We didn't know each other before.

174
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,110
But you seem pretty close with Wang Yishao.

175
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,990
Wang Yishao...

176
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,060
I also only got to know him

177
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,270
after coming to Mingyi Manor.

178
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,910
Are we close then?

179
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,030
Of course we are.

180
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,470
Aren't we already practically friends now?

181
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,120
She saved my life.

182
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,190
How does your mind work?

183
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,110
I don't get it.

184
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,470
I'm not hiding anything from you.

185
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,780
What about you?

186
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,990
I'll be going then.

187
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,550
What do you think of these people?

188
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,990
They're not exactly small fry, I'd say.

189
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,230
How much trouble can they stir up?

190
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,270
That depends on how deep the water is.

191
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,990
Mingyi Manor is just a small pond.

192
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,910
How much value could it possibly have?

193
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,430
If it's the source of water,

194
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,030
there could be many stories.

195
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,060
Can we trust you?

196
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,260
Do you believe me

197
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,830
if I say that you can?

198
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,020
The moon is so full tonight.

199
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,470
Caught up in worldly feelings?

200
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,590
Tonight's bright moon, everyone gazes upon.

201
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,070
Who knows in which home... someone yearns?

202
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,230
Gazing at the moon, thoughts of love abound.

203
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,790
Moonlit nights make longing... more profound.

204
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,430
No matter how many... partings and deaths one has witnessed,

205
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,470
once the floodgate of emotions opens,

206
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,830
it's hard to hold back.

207
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,430
Is this what human emotions feel like?

208
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,120
How fascinating.

209
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,910
What are you talking about?

210
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,510
Have you transcended to some inhuman state already?

211
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,110
The moon symbolizes family reunions.

212
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,950
But where is home?

213
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,580
♫What kind of encounter♫

214
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,180
♫Sparks both tenderness and excitement?♫

215
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,470
♫I can see in your eyes♫

216
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,310
♫A vast and boundless sky♫

217
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,310
♫Brushing past in a sea of people♫

218
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,380
♫Waiting for time to glance back♫

219
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,470
♫If love shines like a shooting star♫

220
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,260
♫Who can truly hold it close?♫

221
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,950
♫The wandering I long endured♫

222
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,930
♫Once had someone by my side♫

223
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,030
♫The heartfelt moments in my memory♫

224
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,750
♫How to describe them with words?♫

225
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,230
♫I dare not reach out♫

226
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,590
♫Afraid to shatter the dream♫

227
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,470
Good morning, everyone.

228
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,270
We have a new teacher giving lessons today.

229
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,070
Hua Gu.

230
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,510
Starting today,

231
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,510
we will begin martial arts training.

232
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,550
Next, let's welcome our martial arts instructor, Liu Yiyi.

233
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,350
Alright.

234
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,390
I'm not much of a talker.

235
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,390
But just for today,

236
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,630
I'll share a few words with you

237
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,490
regarding the complex rules of the Martial Arts World.

238
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,030
There are some points that you must pay attention to

239
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,830
if you want to make a name for yourself in it.

240
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,030
Does he look like someone who doesn't like to talk?

241
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,360
He's someone who likes to say useless things.

242
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,310
All he says is nonsense.

243
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,470
Pay attention.

244
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,990
He's quite fierce.

245
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,280
I don't like being interrupted

246
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,750
when I'm speaking.

247
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,350
I'm going to lay down a rule now.

248
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,790
My rule is the rule.

249
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,390
What is a rule?

250
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,550
A rule is something

251
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,150
that everyone must follow.

252
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,750
This is

253
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,270
a circle where, without rules, there's no order.

254
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,270
I'm going to say the rules now.

255
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,540
Two of you will be standing inside,

256
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,670
face to face.

257
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,790
First, no goofing off.

258
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,180
Second, no foul play.

259
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,420
Third, no fighting.

260
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,910
Fourth, no insulting each other.

261
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,030
Stop.

262
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,050
How about this? I'll demonstrate,

263
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,470
and you explain to us one by one. That should be fine, right?

264
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,630
Come on, then.

265
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,990
Okay, okay, hurry up.

266
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,670
Come on.

267
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,710
When do we start fighting?

268
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,550
Right now.

269
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,829
-Stop talking. Just do it.
-Come on.

270
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,829
Alright, alright.

271
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,190
So, this means we can touch each other, right?

272
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,870
Foul! Foul!

273
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,270
Why?

274
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,480
No bumping into your opponent.

275
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,030
Alright, let's continue.

276
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,070
Are they practicing wrestling?

277
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,750
It's said to be a martial art learned from the Japanese.

278
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,430
Actually... it's the Japanese who learned it from us.

279
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,350
No wonder Liu Yiyi has been practicing for so long,

280
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,830
yet still seems mediocre.

281
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,830
Foul! Foul!

282
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,590
Hitting me is also a foul!

283
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,350
Enough whining. Let's go again.

284
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,510
The people Young Master Wang found for us

285
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,070
are just a mixed bag.

286
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,550
He

287
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,710
is really good at reading our minds.

288
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,510
The courses he's arranged are similar to those in our manor,

289
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,510
yet somewhat different.

290
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,710
It's perfect for fooling those

291
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,430
who want to mess with us.

292
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,110
He's no ordinary person.

293
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,470
Hu Jiao is going too far, isn't she?

294
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,110
Hu Jiao's personality has always been like this.

295
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,750
It clashes a bit with Liu Yiyi's personality.

296
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,710
This Liu Yiyi...

297
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,020
is going to be in trouble.

298
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,750
Today, we should be able to test

299
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,630
the depth of these people's martial arts skills.

300
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,270
Then why didn't you let Liu Yiyi go on the first day?

301
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,510
The intention would have been too obvious.

302
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,030
They would have been on guard.

303
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,350
The timing now...

304
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,830
is just right.

305
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,010
I think Liu Yiyi

306
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,110
must be really thick-skinned.

307
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,510
Why do you say that?

308
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,230
Look at how he fell like that,

309
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,400
and yet there isn't a single scratch on his face.

310
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,150
I guess her face must be mostly dead skin.

311
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,170
Now I finally understand why Hu Jiao

312
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,710
dragged you to the pond that day.

313
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,910
It was "carried."

314
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,550
It doesn't matter.

315
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,510
Anyway,

316
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,710
you couldn't even beat a woman.

317
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,150
He still hasn't even gotten up yet.

318
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,630
I'm fine.

319
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,110
You're fine, huh?

320
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,710
You... you...

321
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,750
You... you... you...

322
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,590
If you don't speak up, I'll make the arrangements.

323
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,430
Who among you wants to fight me?

324
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,390
Who gave you the authority to make arrangements?

325
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,510
I guess I went too easy on you, huh?

326
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,750
Or shall we go at it again?

327
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,990
Does anyone of you dare to fight me?

328
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,670
I do.

329
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,790
Come on.

330
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,710
If they weren't wrestling,

331
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,850
Hu Jiao really wouldn't be a match for her.

332
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,510
However, we still can't see what kind of martial arts skills she has.

333
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
If I fought like Han Aizhen,

334
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,480
it would be too embarrassing.

335
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,340
A real man doesn't fight with women.

336
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,930
It doesn't matter if you can't win.

337
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,200
Han Aizhen couldn't be one of them, could she?

338
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,510
Let's wait and see.

339
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,790
Enough, enough.

340
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,830
We can switch now.

341
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,470
Alright.

342
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,550
I'm exhausted too. You guys fight.

343
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,350
You, and you.

344
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,350
The last person I want to fight is you.

345
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,830
It's okay.

346
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,550
But men and women should keep their distance.

347
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,230
I always feel it's quite inappropriate.

348
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,310
They're not women?

349
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,270
They're all martial artists. Fighting them is different.

350
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,310
You're a healer.

351
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,710
I just don't feel that it's right.

352
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,870
It's precisely because I'm a healer

353
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,190
that it doesn't matter.

354
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,470
Didn't you say

355
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,110
that I look at people as if they're little mice?

356
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,510
Grappling with women like this

357
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,830
isn't very appropriate, is it?

358
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,190
You've already slept in the same room with us.

359
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,470
Are you still worried about a little grappling?

360
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,170
I... I didn't do anything

361
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:54,840
improper.

362
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,110
Which is why you're still alive and kicking.

363
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,190
I... don't scare me.

364
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,150
It's alright, come on.

365
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,430
It's just practice.

366
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,310
Then I'll just grab your sleeve.

367
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,420
Don't be so rigid. I'm fine with anything.

368
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,550
I... I...

369
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,790
Of course, I have to be rigid.

370
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,990
I... I wouldn't dare offend you.

371
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,100
What are you two doing?

372
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,750
Why are you two chatting?

373
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,990
Is this a teahouse?

374
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,030
Come on.

375
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,110
It's starting. It's starting.

376
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,630
It's like choosing a top courtesan.

377
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,590
They're two beauties.

378
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,390
What's going on here?

379
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,550
No idea what they're talking about.

380
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,050
Why didn't you expose my identity?

381
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,270
For me,

382
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,670
unless it's a matter of life and death,

383
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,670
I won't make a move.

384
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,950
Stop it. Stop right now.

385
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,990
What are you doing?

386
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,910
Did we break any rules?

387
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,030
No.

388
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,750
Then, what's wrong with this?

389
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,740
You need to try your best

390
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,950
to push your opponent out of this circle.

391
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,950
We are trying our best.

392
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,310
You're just pretending to fight.

393
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,990
I think the way you're fighting is pretty good.

394
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,270
I'll learn from this and fight like this too.

395
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,750
You're... you're just fake fighting.

396
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,600
How can you prove we're fake fighting?

397
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,570
I can tell just by looking.

398
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,990
My eyes are sharp.

399
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,190
Then how can you prove

400
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,590
that what you see is real?

401
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,640
Forget it. Forget it.

402
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,390
Both of you, get out of the circle.

403
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,710
Gan Pu.

404
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,670
Let's fight.

405
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,790
What should we compete in?

406
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,070
Our skills

407
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,630
aren't really suited for this kind of match, right?

408
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,470
That's true.

409
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,830
You're skilled with crossbows,

410
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,910
and I'm skilled with poisons.

411
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,790
Both are suitable for striking from the shadows,

412
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,750
where a single strike can seal life or death.

413
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,150
How about this?

414
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,830
Let's just compare strength.

415
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,990
Whoever steps out of the circle first loses.

416
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,670
Alright.

417
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,310
It's starting.

418
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,020
Okay.

419
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,910
Push harder, harder.

420
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,790
Good, good, this is real fighting.

421
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:44,990
Conscience.

422
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,350
Not everyone lacks it.

423
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,670
You both are good, very good.

424
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,350
You have a great competitive spirit.

425
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,870
You can trip her... with your leg.

426
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,390
Trip her up.

427
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,830
You can pull her down.

428
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,590
Good.

429
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,310
Good.

430
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,670
That's enough.

431
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,390
Enough.

432
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,430
Okay.

433
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,390
It's a draw.

434
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,340
You hopeless cases.

435
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,340
You hopeless cases.

436
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,160
There is... there is no winner or loser.

437
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,190
Don't get me wrong.

438
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,500
You should know whom I like.

439
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:30,790
I know.

440
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,270
I'm just a little jealous.

441
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,710
I understand.

442
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,030
Actually, I don't care that much.

443
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,390
Can you understand?

444
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,270
I can understand you.

445
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,110
But I really don't quite get it.

446
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,510
I want to challenge you.

447
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,470
Fine.

448
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,030
I'll let you vent your anger.

449
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,750
Very good.

450
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,750
This is the kind of honest fight we need.

451
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,350
This is real fighting. This is true competition.

452
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,030
I'm fine. I'm fine.

453
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,510
Are you alright?

454
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:20,900
I'm fine.

455
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,550
Come on, come on.

456
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,310
I'm fine.

457
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:22,990
Come on.

458
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,870
No, what are you doing?

459
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,400
Why are you treating someone without martial arts skills like this?

460
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,590
If you have a problem, come at me!

461
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,550
Fine, come on then.

462
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,910
Great, great, you two fight.

463
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,190
We must uphold the spirit of competition.

464
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,150
How do we fight this time?

465
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,350
Fight without holding back.

466
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,150
Okay.

467
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,750
Don't forget where we are.

468
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,910
That's true.

469
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,790
We can't be fools.

470
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,750
Then let's fight with half of our strength.

471
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,430
What do you mean by "half strength"?

472
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,790
I'll use my feet, and you will use your hands.

473
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,630
Just my hands;

474
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,070
that's not fair for me, is it?

475
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,830
Hands are the door, while feet do the fighting.

476
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,830
That puts me at a disadvantage.

477
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,510
What now? You still want to teach me a lesson?

478
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,910
Fine, let's fight like that, then.

479
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,190
If I win, don't hold it against me.

480
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,670
Let's call it even.

481
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,880
Deal.

482
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,070
It's on.

483
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,330
Foul! Foul!

484
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,630
Stop, stop, stop.

485
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,100
What's going on?

486
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,190
Are there any other places

487
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,230
besides Mingyi Manor

488
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,750
that train women in martial arts?

489
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,430
Qing Cai... is surprisingly excellent.

490
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,500
It's truly enigmatic.

491
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:45,000
These two have solid martial arts foundations.

492
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,470
It's just that their techniques are a bit lacking.

493
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,230
They're holding back.

494
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,920
Stop, stop, stop.

495
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,190
You're insulting.

496
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,080
You're insulting the martial arts.

497
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,300
All settled now.

498
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,480
Deal.

499
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,030
What are you two doing?

500
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,030
You're treating the competition like a transaction.

501
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,540
This is a... blatant desecration.

502
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,420
Well... He...

503
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,990
Gao Yin, take a look at him.

504
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,190
It's over. Liu Yiyi is done for.

505
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,430
How is he?

506
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,070
He's fine, just a bit riled up.

507
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,710
I'll give him an acupuncture treatment. That should do it.

508
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,710
He seems to be quite principled after all.

509
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,870
We really were a bit over the line.

510
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,070
What a pity.

511
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,950
A defender of rules

512
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,430
and a true warrior,

513
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,150
yet has such a fragile heart.

514
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,480
I didn't expect him to be like this either.

515
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:06,270
It's indeed hard for someone too pure to survive.

516
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,230
Are you implying we're dirty?

517
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,710
Including me.

518
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,720
In-including...

519
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,190
Where there's day, there's night.

520
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,940
Let's not be too harsh on ourselves.

521
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,750
It seems you're not so simple either.

522
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,750
You were too careless just now.

523
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,310
Thankfully, you reminded us, or it could've been worse.

524
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,270
However, we managed to get Han Aizhen off our backs,

525
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,550
so it's not a bad trade-off.

526
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:53,910
What are you doing?

527
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,710
You were dancing so well with Gao Yin just now—

528
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,710
such a lovely performance.

529
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,590
Are you jealous?

530
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,830
Of what?

531
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,470
I...

532
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,230
I was afraid you'd be poisoned if you touched her sleeve.

533
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,390
I was just looking out for you.

534
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,830
Seriously.

535
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,510
Is that so?

536
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,550
If I'd be poisoned by touching her sleeve,

537
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,630
since you just touched my sleeve,

538
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,920
wouldn't that mean you'd be poisoned too?

539
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,170
You talk too much.

540
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,550
I don't think you're that smart after all.

541
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,790
What do you think Han Aizhen's true identity is?

542
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,190
When your teacher used to chat with you,

543
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,510
did he ever mention

544
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,630
how many opposing factions there are in the kingdom?

545
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,550
It's said that the Prime Minister and the Emperor are on the same side,

546
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,630
while the General is on the other.

547
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,230
They seem to be at odds with each other.

548
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,880
Look,

549
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,390
Gao Yin, Wang Yishao, and Hu Jiao,

550
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,430
although they have their own plans,

551
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,710
they're all on the Emperor's side.

552
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,470
What about the General's men?

553
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,510
Right.

554
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,830
I was so focused on saving him

555
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,590
that I, I've become a bit flustered.

556
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,050
The two of us have no background.

557
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,390
If the Emperor's men are here,

558
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,430
then the General's men shouldn't be absent.

559
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,710
Based on our current speculation,

560
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,470
Han Aizhen is very likely

561
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,550
to be one of the General's people.

562
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,270
And the Emperor's people

563
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:06,830
are helping Mingyi Manor to monitor us.

564
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,200
In other words, they're our opposition.

565
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,790
That means we need to

566
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,070
test Han Aizhen thoroughly.

567
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,790
You're awake. Are you alright?

568
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,240
Indeed, we need to test her carefully.

569
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,070
Let me help you up.

570
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,430
Don't beat yourself up too much.

571
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,230
I found him too fierce and felt disgusted.

572
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,190
He appears so tough,

573
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,190
yet has such a fragile heart—

574
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,950
as delicate as red glass.

575
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,740
That's all for today's lesson.

576
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,670
Everyone, you may go now.

577
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,470
Everyone, dismissed.

578
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,440
Let's go.

579
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,350
Take care.

580
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:45,590
Hua Gu, get someone.

581
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,790
Someone, come and help me take him down.

582
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,190
We're going hunting in the mountains. Want to join us?

583
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,590
Sure.

584
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,470
Let's go.

585
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,990
It seems the three of them are trending towards an alliance.

586
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,550
Let's watch and see how things unfold.

587
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:36,710
The barrier here is really gone.

588
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,910
It's truly gone.

589
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,750
Don't be so afraid.

590
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,560
What kind of place is this? So many mosquitoes.

591
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,350
My face is all swollen from bites.

592
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,140
Why did the Prince send you here?

593
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,670
Where could the Prince find women with combat skills?

594
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,260
I was chosen because of my strength,

595
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,699
standing out among the female guard candidates.

596
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,330
That's why the Prince sent me here.

597
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,870
No wonder I haven't seen you before.

598
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,710
You're a Royal Physician, right?

599
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,550
They wouldn't call you for common illnesses at the Prince Manor.

600
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:22,190
The Prince still trusts you very much.

601
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,179
The matters here are so important.

602
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,429
Relying on force alone is not enough.

603
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,790
Of course.

604
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:30,850
Well, the Prince

605
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:34,100
has also noticed my quick wit and clever nature.

606
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:42,360
We're the ones who got you bitten by the snake before.

607
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:43,750
We're very sorry.

608
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:47,389
At least I can't die now.

609
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,790
We almost made a terrible mistake.

610
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,860
I was just too scared.

611
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,920
So I lashed out at you both.

612
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,750
I'm sorry.

613
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,910
It was our fault in the first place. It has nothing to do with you.

614
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,150
Did you two... know each other before?

615
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,170
No, we didn't.

616
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,690
It was only after coming to the Mingyi Manor

617
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,830
that we truly got to know each other.

618
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,990
Then how can you be sure you're not enemies?

619
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,150
I can be certain...

620
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,190
that we are not enemies.

621
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,070
Even if we were enemies,

622
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,910
I wouldn't harm her.

623
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,230
You two...

624
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,430
are in that kind of relationship.

625
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,350
I'm speaking from a human perspective.

626
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,310
Some people have been through a lot of hardships

627
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,670
but still remain kind.

628
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,190
I don't want to be enemies with such people.

629
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,830
Even if we were enemies,

630
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,110
I wouldn't harm her.

631
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,590
This has nothing to do with feelings.

632
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,030
You're a kind person too.

633
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,910
But kind people always find trouble for themselves.

634
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,550
Kind people

635
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,230
shouldn't get involved in court disputes.

636
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,990
Court disputes?

637
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,070
The problem is,

638
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,180
we've been dragged in involuntarily.

639
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,110
Involuntarily?

640
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,510
Who isn't?

641
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,430
Let's go.

642
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,190
It's getting harder to hunt these days.

643
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,230
You were really impressive before.

644
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,630
You could catch anything.

645
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:41,110
Why don't we go check out the nearby village?

646
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,670
There are no barriers now anyway.

647
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,110
I know there are many small animals

648
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,910
that like to steal vegetables from people's gardens.

649
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:46,870
Let's go look there.

650
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,150
I remember that the village is over there.

651
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,270
Looks like you often come up the mountains.

652
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,070
Of course.

653
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,150
Haven't we all been wandering around the mountains these days?

654
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,430
That's true.

655
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,660
You seem to know a lot about formations and barriers.

656
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,110
Is that knowledge passed down through your family?

657
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,840
Yes.

658
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,990
What have you discovered?

659
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,790
Something might happen in the next couple of days.

660
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,590
What kind of thing?

661
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,110
It's hard to say.

662
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,510
It may be related to the prisoners.

663
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,350
On our turf,

664
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,000
you can actually notice things that even we didn't catch.

665
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,880
You're quite the talent.

666
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,390
Out of necessity.

667
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,590
A dragon hiding in the depths. What a pity.

668
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,750
Maybe the dragon has already surfaced.

669
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,110
I have no such ambitions.

670
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,430
You don't need to test me either.

671
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,510
Be careful.

672
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,630
Look.

673
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,830
There are many barriers in the courtyard,

674
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:28,990
and there are guards as well.

675
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,310
We'd better not go in.

676
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,380
So, you're saying

677
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,710
that the barriers over there weren't set up just now?

678
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,110
And the barriers there

679
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,110
seem to be much more advanced than those in the mountains

680
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,390
and far more complex.

681
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,070
What do you think that place is?

682
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,550
We've been here before.

683
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,870
From what we've observed,

684
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,510
it appears to be a prison.

685
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,590
But that's none of our business.

686
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,030
We'd better stay out of this mess.

687
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,150
Why are we setting a trap here?

688
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,870
To test Mingyi Manor's security measures.

689
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:12,840
Just using this...

690
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,630
Be careful.

691
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,750
Will this trap really catch a rabbit?

692
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,350
Of course, it will.

693
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,960
Look,

694
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:20,510
this branch

695
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,670
is placed widely around the hole.

696
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,950
Once a rabbit touches our little trap,

697
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,430
the rope will snap back.

698
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:28,950
Then, this loop here

699
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,390
will tighten securely around the rabbit.

700
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,630
It's a slipknot.

701
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,190
So, the rabbit can be...

702
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,190
Do you understand now?

703
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,150
That's impressive.

704
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,630
Who did you learn this from?

705
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,870
It's also knowledge passed down through my family.

706
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,850
What are you doing?

707
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,870
Hunting, catching rabbits.

708
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,060
Let's take a break.

709
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,030
Just wait for the rabbits.

710
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,070
You like Young Master Wang too, right?

711
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,510
Then you must really hate me.

712
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,280
See, we've found common ground.

713
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,630
Actually,

714
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,710
there's nothing wrong with liking someone.

715
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,030
But you shouldn't go as overboard as I did,

716
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,870
right?

717
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,970
We've reached another agreement.

718
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,870
I know, deep down,

719
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,370
you probably wish you could do what I did too.

720
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,390
But you couldn't because of female dignity,

721
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,510
right?

722
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,470
I've already apologized to Young Master Wang.

723
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,020
I, I won't pursue him anymore.

724
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,300
You don't need to worry at all

725
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,390
that I'd do something extreme again.

726
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,670
Hearing you say that,

727
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,190
you don't seem so bad after all.

728
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,020
Yes, yes.

729
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,710
I won't dislike you anymore then.

730
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,550
But I just saw you at the training ground.

731
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:21,310
How come now

732
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,790
you suddenly appear here?

733
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,970
We've just switched shifts.

734
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,220
To see Young Master Wang,

735
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,590
we discussed with our sisters

736
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,950
that we all switched to night shifts.

737
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,780
You have to work night shifts?

738
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:31,950
That's tough.

739
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,210
But why do you need to be on duty?

740
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,860
Yinniang said things have been unsettled lately, so we need to increase security.

741
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,190
But we don't know

742
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,390
why things are unsettled.

743
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,950
Things have been unsettled lately.

744
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,340
Then, when you're on duty,

745
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,270
please take good care of your safety.

746
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:48,550
This Qing Cai is so cunning.

747
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,590
He was never a good person to begin with.

748
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:54,910
Also,

749
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,710
let me give you one last piece of advice.

750
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,520
Don't be so reserved anymore.

751
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,070
When you meet someone you like, be brave and express yourself.

752
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,590
Otherwise, what if you miss the chance?

753
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,390
We don't really expect anything.

754
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,960
We just think he's cute; just looking at him is enough.

755
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,070
Yes, yes.

756
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,910
You're very cute too.

757
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,670
Really? What's cute about us?

758
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,500
Cute in your foolishness.

759
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,750
Sister Hongxiu always says we're foolish.

760
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,430
You can really catch a rabbit?

761
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,340
Of course.

762
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,590
This rabbit is so cute.

763
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,620
Are you going to eat it?

764
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,510
We have no choice.

765
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,140
We don't have much meat to eat.

766
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,990
What a pity. I want to keep a rabbit as a pet.

767
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,470
I want to keep one too.

768
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,330
If you like,

769
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,030
I'll give this rabbit to you.

770
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:47,950
-Really?
-Really?

771
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,590
My name is Chunlan.

772
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,990
We're friends from now on.

773
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,150
I'm Qiu Ju.

774
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,670
You're such a nice person.

775
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,790
You're the nice ones.

776
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,760
Rabbit.

777
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,110
Then what are we going to eat?

778
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,470
Let's find another spot.

779
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,390
Here, take the rabbit.
