00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,660
[Pretty Boy]

2
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,669
[Episode 17]

3
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:28,810
Stop.

4
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,020
Stop.

5
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,420
You little brat, how dare you ambush me?

6
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,130
I learned from you.

7
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,710
If you can stop,

8
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,430
why can't I?

9
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,690
You're good, huh?

10
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,310
We were fighting.

11
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,630
What?

12
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,670
You couldn't take it anymore

13
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,610
and wanted to commit suicide?

14
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,160
Why would I want to commit suicide?

15
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,270
I just thought the view here was really nice.

16
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,180
I've been thinking for a long time,

17
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,720
and I wanted to see the cliff's steepness

18
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,730
from this angle.

19
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,490
You're quite the refined person.

20
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,240
Don't listen to the sound of the wind through the forest and the rain on the leaves.

21
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,340
Why not hum and stroll slowly?

22
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,750
You're so composed.

23
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,190
I admire you.

24
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,300
Impressive.

25
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,800
Looks like you can make it up here by yourself.

26
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,410
Go!

27
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,610
I knew you wouldn't want to fall behind.

28
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,510
What do you think?

29
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,870
Isn't this view nice?

30
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,020
Indeed.

31
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,610
To quietly observe all things is to find contentment.

32
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,540
But this is active observation.

33
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,630
Where's the contentment?

34
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,110
We have to stay calm.

35
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,750
At this point,

36
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,160
how can we stay calm?

37
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,800
It seems you want to die with grace.

38
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,110
I admire you.

39
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,940
Fighting with someone like you,

40
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,210
I definitely wouldn't get an advantage.

41
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,340
You ambushed me first.

42
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,950
I just gave you a taste of your own medicine.

43
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,350
I didn't expect you, a gentleman,

44
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,750
to do such a petty thing.

45
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,010
At least you didn't take advantage

46
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,970
when I fell off the cliff.

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,400
This isn't a martial arts duel.

48
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,540
Besides,

49
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,470
shouldn't you feel guilty

50
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,770
and stand there without fighting back?

51
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,540
You even think I ambushed you?

52
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,250
I'm standing here to beat you up

53
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,430
and vent my frustration.

54
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,990
I didn't expect you to know martial arts,

55
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,580
but you don't have to resort to ambushing.

56
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,840
We could settle this properly.

57
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,700
If you want to let off some steam, use your real ability.

58
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,720
I'll gladly accompany you.

59
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,320
Move aside!

60
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,650
You actually hit me on the face.

61
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,290
When letting off anger, it must be a slap to the face.

62
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,810
Turns out you're not a pedantic scholar.

63
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,370
You can play this kind of clever tricks.

64
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,620
Looks like you don't understand me at all.

65
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,360
Alright.

66
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,930
I'll beat you into submission based on my skill.

67
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,580
I'll turn your face into a pig's head,

68
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,030
so you won't want to show your face to anyone.

69
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,410
Do the tricks I played earlier still work?

70
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,890
Are you afraid of snakes?

71
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,910
A very poisonous one.

72
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,850
It won't work. You can't trick me.

73
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,750
No, don't blame me for not warning you.

74
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,460
Gao Yin isn't here.

75
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,010
I can't save you.

76
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,220
Don't move.

77
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,750
There's a snake right behind you.

78
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,720
I'll save you.

79
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,130
Don't move.

80
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,220
I see you don't understand me at all.

81
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,140
I love using the same tricks that others have used.

82
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,690
It's much more satisfying that way.

83
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,450
Don't try to lull me with a smile

84
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,590
and then say some words like

85
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,310
“feeling a bond” or something.

86
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,300
Let me tell you, I'm not buying that.

87
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,680
Watch your step.

88
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,730
Look at you, running out of tricks.

89
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,770
So pitiful.

90
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,100
You were distracted.

91
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,560
You had just studied the terrain.

92
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,840
When I smiled at you,

93
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:43,400
you thought I was playing tricks,

94
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,409
but didn't expect me to attack directly.

95
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,760
You didn't notice,

96
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,170
and once you realized the bad terrain behind you,

97
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,220
you were already caught.

98
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,850
Good job.

99
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,470
You took both the terrain

100
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,710
and psychology into account.

101
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,550
Although your martial arts skills are not as strong as mine,

102
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,230
you haven't been at a disadvantage.

103
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,410
Alright, two to one,

104
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,360
you're not bad.

105
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,390
This game, where you hurt both yourself

106
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,030
and others equally,

107
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,190
are you still going to play?

108
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,810
If we keep playing, we'd probably lose our noses.

109
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,610
Alright then,

110
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,810
two punches on the nose for one.

111
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,610
I've vented my frustration now.

112
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,930
You won't fight anymore?

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,140
Unless you want to keep fighting?

114
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,760
You said you wouldn't hit me,

115
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,300
but I never said I wouldn't hit you.

116
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,760
And,

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,280
what exactly do I owe you

118
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,640
to make you try to take your anger out on me?

119
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,260
I get it now.

120
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,310
You're trying to say

121
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,120
I've been sleeping in the same room as your wife,

122
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,670
right?

123
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,270
But I've been sleeping with my wife,

124
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,910
miles away from yours.

125
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,270
I haven't even touched the hem of her clothes.

126
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,780
How have I wronged you?

127
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,780
-You...
-Or…

128
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,530
Are you interested in my wife?

129
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,030
Do you feel that I owe you something?

130
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,940
No, you owe me.

131
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,600
You've been eyeing my wife all the time.

132
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,460
I... I...

133
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,150
You slick-talking guy.

134
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,020
When did I become your wife...

135
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,460
When did Gan Pu become your wife?

136
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,860
This is clearly a gentleman seeking a virtuous match

137
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,860
with a graceful lady.

138
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,820
Yes, if you put it that way,

139
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,150
then it's all fair competition.

140
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,460
What exactly do I owe you?

141
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,070
Well...

142
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,490
Look.

143
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,380
Look.

144
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,160
Look.

145
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,180
Look.

146
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,960
Haven't you had enough?

147
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,030
Haven't we already fought to a draw?

148
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,630
Now don't start playing the victim.

149
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,730
You called me here to teach me a lesson,

150
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,110
hanging a sachet to mislead me,

151
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,250
almost making me lose my wife.

152
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,780
How can I let this go?

153
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,630
How did this

154
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,080
become you needing to vent your frustration?

155
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,820
You grew up in a royal palace, right?

156
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,540
The prime minister is magnanimous,

157
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,660
and your royal status

158
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,030
is even higher than the prime minister's,

159
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,120
so naturally, you must be even more magnanimous.

160
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,760
I'm just a lowly person with a petty mind,

161
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,660
so it's clear you can bear it, but I can't.

162
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,480
That means I vent, and you have to endure.

163
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,770
Fine.

164
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,710
Better to offend a gentleman than a petty person.

165
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,650
You willingly choose to be a petty person,

166
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,610
so there's nothing I can do.

167
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,300
You're truly a gentleman,

168
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,310
and I'm truly a petty person.

169
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,570
We are both showing our true colors,

170
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,270
so we're even.

171
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,580
Alright then, we won't fight anymore.

172
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,530
I admit defeat.

173
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,800
Let's sit down and talk.

174
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,760
Qing Cai doesn't like to eat vegetables.

175
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,210
You'd better keep an eye on him.

176
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,480
He should eat more meat too.

177
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,670
He spends all his time grilling meat for others

178
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,710
and never eats any himself.

179
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,270
He grills all night long,

180
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,970
and in the end, no meat is left for him.

181
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,470
Also, you two are kids,

182
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,550
so you need to look after each other.

183
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,000
Make sure to protect him.

184
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,980
I'm still worried about him.

185
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,370
You've already said you don't feel at ease fifty times.

186
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,760
What more can you be worried about?

187
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,160
Has there been so many times?

188
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,440
You make sure to protect him.

189
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,980
You've said that fifty-two times already.

190
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,070
Well,

191
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:25,830
since it's been over fifty times,

192
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,470
can you just promise me?

193
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,130
Be a little patient.

194
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,810
Promise me you'll protect him.

195
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,630
Aizhen,

196
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,300
it's getting dark; you really need to hurry now.

197
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,380
It's getting dark?

198
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,190
Well,

199
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,420
Qing Cai isn't very bright, you know.

200
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,670
Look, it's really getting dark now.

201
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,470
It's even raining.

202
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,220
Be careful later.

203
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,310
This is as far as I'll take you. I won't go any further.

204
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,910
Don't want to make you an easy target on the way.

205
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:57,850
Alright.

206
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,790
Or maybe you want to stay with me for a while longer?

207
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,480
I still have a lot of things to remind you about.

208
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,040
You've already said too much.

209
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,270
Usually, you're pretty quick and efficient,

210
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,710
but today you're being so nagging.

211
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,660
Alright,

212
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,140
stop worrying about him.

213
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,360
He's grown up now.

214
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,220
And you don't want him

215
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,400
to see you like this, right?

216
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,100
Once he's here, you won't be able to leave.

217
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,350
Thank you,

218
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,540
for sticking by him at a time like this.

219
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,080
Why are you thanking me? He and I go way back.

220
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,990
Well, now I can be at ease.

221
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,210
Take care.

222
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,890
You're really going to fight?

223
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,750
What? You want to stop me?

224
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,960
I haven't received any orders to stop you.

225
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,440
What if you do get the order?

226
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,340
Does being nagging spread?

227
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,770
In the end, it's going to be a fight,

228
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,520
so everyone's going to be nervous.

229
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,530
It's not that.

230
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,350
If I were alone, I wouldn't be nervous.

231
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,850
Worrying only causes confusion.

232
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,190
On the battlefield,

233
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,970
what's needed is calmness,

234
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,780
sometimes even cold-bloodedness.

235
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,730
Your feelings can easily ruin things.

236
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,430
The reason I can be with him

237
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,240
is because he's not cold-blooded.

238
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,680
If things really go wrong...

239
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,240
We'll deal with it then.

240
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,070
It turns out the saying “no fight, no acquaintance”

241
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,430
applies to us.

242
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,300
We didn't know each other before,

243
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,970
and it was precisely because we didn't fight.

244
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,950
You're truly emotional.

245
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,980
If we weren't enemies,

246
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,020
I'd really want to be friends with you.

247
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,700
Who says enemies can't be friends?

248
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,050
When we're enemies, we fight;

249
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,360
when we're friends, we joke and chat.

250
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,580
It doesn't interfere at all.

251
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,760
You're a crude guy,

252
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,080
but I like this personality.

253
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,230
You really are at ease,

254
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,520
enjoying the peace here.

255
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,100
Here, take this.

256
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,720
You even brought a pot of wine.

257
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,040
Let me tell you,

258
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,630
here,

259
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,410
there are only friends, no enemies.

260
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,380
Have a drink.

261
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:53,930
Hong Hui,

262
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,210
look at your unlucky face.

263
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,740
I just didn't tell you (about) Qing Cai's identity.

264
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,090
Did you have to chase me here to mock me?

265
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,290
I'm going crazy.

266
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,150
Do I really need to talk about such trivial things?

267
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,720
Trivial things?

268
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,820
We're really good friends.

269
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,250
Young Master Wang,

270
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,760
you really can't control

271
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,950
such low-level emotions.

272
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,450
Seems like I've infected you.

273
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,700
You're becoming a real petty person now?

274
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,220
Since we're all emotional,

275
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,370
if I'm a petty person, I'll accept it.

276
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,750
That's true.

277
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,680
The friends you make

278
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,330
usually

279
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,710
look down on you, right?

280
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,760
This says something about your

281
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,090
special nature.

282
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,100
Cursing me while flattering me-

283
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:52,610
what's this?

284
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,210
Have you defected like him?

285
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,300
It's not flattering.

286
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,230
You've made friends in the opposing camp.

287
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,820
I used to underestimate you.

288
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,610
You're thorough in your actions.

289
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,510
I'm curious,

290
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,720
how do you even support yourself?

291
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,470
Do you just sponge off others?

292
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,510
He, on the other hand, lives off our support,

293
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,230
that's why he can live so carefree.

294
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,130
Why do you support him?

295
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,260
Without him, don't you live just fine?

296
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,660
I'm way too important to them.

297
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,530
Without me, they would lose a lot of enjoyment,

298
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,960
and

299
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,130
they'd lose themselves.

300
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,010
Do you understand?

301
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,400
So you're like the Bodhisattva in a temple,

302
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,380
useful to those who need you,

303
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,380
but just a pile of junk to those who don't.

304
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,540
It really is true that one thing conquers another.

305
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,380
You've finally met someone

306
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,960
who can restrain you.

307
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:56,410
Actually, Zhang Fang is the one with a wealth of knowledge.

308
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,120
Many important figures wanted him as a strategist,

309
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,260
but he yearned for a free life

310
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,130
and didn't want to go.

311
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,640
I know,

312
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,160
I just can't stand

313
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,450
his arrogant attitude.

314
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,800
What I like most

315
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,060
is to ruin good things.

316
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,000
And I often end up your target.

317
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:17,569
At the time, I just thought you were an extraordinary woman.

318
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,010
I was curious.

319
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,849
I found him strange too.

320
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,170
So, Young Master Wang,

321
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,150
you don't have any other feelings for him?

322
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,520
I don't have any other feelings for him.

323
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,820
Hong Hui,

324
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,490
aren't you going to help Qing Cai spy for some information?

325
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,840
Young Master Wang,

326
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,920
you want me to gather information?

327
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,730
Han Aizhen is going to leave?

328
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,660
Young Master Wang, you sure have a lot of talented people.

329
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,360
But none of them are my surbordinates.

330
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,770
So why do you keep them around?

331
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,650
Why not let them fend for themselves?

332
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,800
You're right.

333
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,110
Right?

334
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,680
Vegetable.

335
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,700
I've been good enough to you, haven't I?

336
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,870
When I first met him,

337
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,130
I knew he was a man, understand?

338
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,030
If I were his person,

339
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,160
you'd be finished by now.

340
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,320
Is that true what he said?

341
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,260
As for me, I couldn't stand

342
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,570
how he sadly became infatuated

343
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,530
with a man, do you know?

344
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,110
So I couldn't help but speak up.

345
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,390
Slow down.

346
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,680
Didn't we agree to learn an instrument?

347
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,720
I was so absorbed in playing alone,

348
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,590
and when I opened my eyes, you were all gone.

349
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,010
Did you not run into Hong Hui on the way?

350
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,710
It was only because I ran into Hong Hui that he told me

351
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,840
you were up on the mountain.

352
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,890
Hong Hui is that fast?

353
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,080
What about those instruments?

354
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,670
You left them all by the water's edge.

355
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,170
Oh no, those are treasures.

356
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,150
I have to go get them.

357
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,990
Let's go together.

358
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,230
I'll help you.

359
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,990
Carry them down.

360
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,030
Thanks.

361
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,390
Drink it yourself.

362
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,190
You...

363
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,370
Aizhen,

364
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,780
are you leaving?

365
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,420
What's going on?

366
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,970
Are you going to meet the son of the late Emperor?

367
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,700
Sort of.

368
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,650
You're not good at lying,

369
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,800
at least when all the lies are made up,

370
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,180
it's easy for me to tell.

371
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,740
What do you want from me?

372
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,200
You're not trying to test me, are you?

373
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,780
Since you're going to meet the son of the late Emperor,

374
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,620
shouldn't you meet his foster father first?

375
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,320
You're not going to meet him, are you?

376
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,810
Let's go, then.

377
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,030
Are you afraid to meet him

378
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,840
and worried that being in contact with me too much

379
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,450
will expose your true identity?

380
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,110
I've already said, let's go.

381
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,840
I'm not talking to you anymore.

382
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,240
You think if you don't say anything

383
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,530
it won't get exposed?

384
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,310
You're about to make a big move, aren't you?

385
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,490
Look at you,

386
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,300
you're not someone trained professionally

387
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,480
to be an undercover agent,

388
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,370
your emotions are all written on your face.

389
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,280
You're just trying to deceive me.

390
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,660
That was a good comeback.

391
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,800
Quite clever.

392
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,030
You spoke your true thoughts

393
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,800
and covered up the probing words I said earlier,

394
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,070
so I couldn't observe

395
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,190
your reaction to it.

396
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,910
Last time you saw me,

397
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,520
you said you wanted to be friends with me.

398
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,810
Why are you so eager this time?

399
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,580
I sense danger.

400
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,610
If Qing Cai were here,

401
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,330
he would say you're a dog.

402
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,090
Qing Cai.

403
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:13,130
Recently, his emotions have been quite unstable,

404
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,250
just like his relationship with all of you,

405
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,910
chaotic and unpredictable.

406
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,130
What have you discovered?

407
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,880
I think he seems to have had his heart broken,

408
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,110
but not by Young Master Wang, it's by Gan Pu.

409
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,000
You're good at observation.

410
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,820
You even noticed that?

411
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,160
Isn't he attracted to men?

412
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,370
He was entangled with Young Master Wang before.

413
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,730
Did I see that wrong?

414
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,750
He's jealous of Young Master Wang.

415
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,970
Maybe he really has fallen for Gan Pu.

416
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,000
A change of heart, I guess.

417
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,690
Well, let's go.

418
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,500
Wait for me.

419
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,830
Wait.

420
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:04,880
Stop.

421
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,320
It's too heavy. Let's rest for a bit.

422
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,470
I asked you here because I want to advise you not to act too rashly.

423
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,550
When facing a poisonous snake,

424
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,330
should I fight like a cat,

425
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,020
or flee like a rat?

426
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,510
I know I can't convince you.

427
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,500
You're just too sentimental.

428
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,920
Be careful, you might lose your life over this.

429
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,140
At least there's a chance

430
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,970
when fighting a poisonous snake,

431
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,070
but I'm afraid my claws aren't sharp enough.

432
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,650
There's no choice.

433
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,510
I'll just have to find more exits.

434
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,660
As long as you understand.

435
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,410
You've let Han Aizhen report back to the royal city?

436
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,810
I had no choice.

437
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,510
This is a backup move.

438
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,100
Though it's not ideal,

439
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,080
it has to be done.

440
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,470
It's a cornered animal's struggle.

441
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,720
Do you want to stir things up or help?

442
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,520
What do you think?

443
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,490
You want to help Gan Pu, don't you?

444
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,410
I didn't expect you

445
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,570
to be so emotional.

446
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,490
But you've underestimated Mingyi Manor.

447
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,980
That Hongxiu isn't simple, you know.

448
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,470
You all wait here.

449
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,550
Yes.

450
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:47,630
Father.

451
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,200
You carry on,

452
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,490
I won't disturb you.

453
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,220
Father.

454
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,910
Qiu Ju,

455
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,750
hurry and report to Yinniang

456
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,490
that Qing Cai is the son of the late Emperor.

457
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,750
Got it.

458
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,810
How did you get hurt like this?

459
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,220
I'm fine.

460
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,550
Were you found out?

461
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,660
It was just the Second Prince who noticed,

462
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,220
but now,

463
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,990
it seems like Mingyi Manor knows too.

464
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,350
You were captured by them?

465
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,610
Captured?

466
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,110
They don't look like they intend to capture me.

467
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,420
Worry leads to confusion.

468
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:00,820
This time, it's really exposed.

469
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,430
Exposed what?

470
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,960
While we're not sure

471
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,600
whether Mingyi Manor will act against you,

472
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,070
you'd better leave quickly.

473
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:11,840
Father,

474
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,480
are you saying

475
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,420
they might hold me back?

476
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,450
There are

477
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:23,070
too many secrets here that we don't know yet.

478
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,560
Of course,

479
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,380
if he can escape smoothly,

480
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,340
that's the best outcome.

481
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,870
Otherwise,

482
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,390
we'd be too passive.

483
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,110
I'll go inform him.

484
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,180
It's too late to inform him now.

485
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,780
If you reach the royal city safely,

486
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,010
you've already helped him.

487
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,670
The longer the wait, the more likely problems arise.

488
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,220
Hurry and leave.

489
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:51,930
Father,

490
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,190
I...

491
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,480
Hurry up and go.

492
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,760
Father,

493
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:05,840
take care.

494
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,270
Let's go.

495
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,360
Take your time.

496
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,950
Hongxiu took Han Aizhen to the prisoners' quarters.

497
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,720
Thank you.

498
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,820
This time,

499
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,680
they really have no more moves to make.

500
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,070
Maybe they will let Han Aizhen go.

501
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,810
That's enough for now.

502
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,190
I won't see you off.

503
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,950
I'm leaving.

504
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,230
Are you asking Yinniang to capture that Vegetable?

505
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,760
No need.

506
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,780
Once Yinniang hears the news, she'll know what to do.

507
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,080
I really didn't expect

508
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,470
that person

509
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,810
is actually right under our noses.

510
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,730
How did you figure it out?

511
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,510
It was just that Han Aizhen entered the room.

512
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,500
As long as Han Ai Zhen leaves,

513
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,060
everything makes sense.

514
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,340
She's going to Wang City to report,

515
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,020
making us afraid to act rashly.

516
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,710
How did I miss all of this?

517
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,300
You should pay attention to the right people,

518
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,650
don't just focus on Young Master Wang.

519
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,470
Your mind's gone rusty.

520
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,390
So, did you take her to see that prisoner

521
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,610
just to make a final confirmation?

522
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,780
Han Zhong is such a shrewd person.

523
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,020
I observed that

524
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,970
when he saw Han Aizhen holding the bundle,

525
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,710
there was a flash of panic in his eyes.

526
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,750
He must have guessed

527
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,200
that Qing Cai had been exposed.

528
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,410
He thought Han Aizhen truly wanted to go back and report,

529
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,320
but got captured?

530
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,530
At least you're still saved, your brain hasn't completely rotted.

531
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,670
But how can we confirm

532
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,390
that Vegetable is the son of the late Emperor?

533
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,680
If the son of the late Emperor wasn't in the manor,

534
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,460
when Han Aizhen had been captured on her way down the mountain,

535
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,840
Han Zhong wouldn't have panicked.

536
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,640
Only when the son of the late Emperor

537
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,330
was exposed right under our noses

538
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,500
would Han Zhong despair.

539
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,440
But if we let Han Aizhen go back to report,

540
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,200
aren't we putting ourselves in a passive position?

541
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,510
Why don't we just detain her?

542
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,060
This is a complicated issue.

543
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,270
Think it over slowly yourself.

544
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,890
Why do you think Young Master Wang is so set on finding Qing Cai?

545
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,690
Does he want to fight?

546
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,540
Even if he wanted to fight, he couldn't defeat Qing Cai.

547
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,050
Even if he can't win, he'll still try.

548
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,450
Young Master Wang is so smart.

549
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,280
He won't suffer a major loss.

550
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,250
When dealing with Qing Cai,

551
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,980
he's definitely going to lose.

552
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,730
You trust Qing Cai that much?

553
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,410
You don't understand Qing Cai.

554
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,640
He's been from the streets since he was young.

555
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,490
He can use any dirty trick.

556
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,500
As for Young Master Wang,

557
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,720
he's a gentleman from a noble family,

558
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,310
if he provokes Qing Cai,

559
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,930
isn't that like the birthday boy hanging himself,

560
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,830
asking for an early death?

561
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,500
You sure know a lot of folk sayings.

562
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,960
But,

563
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:48,440
I'd like to see Young Master Wang get his comeuppance.

564
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,160
Right?

565
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,380
I've exposed myself.

566
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,670
I need to leave immediately,

567
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,890
I'll sneak back tonight.

568
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,090
I'll go with you.

569
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,390
It's too late.

570
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,660
With Yinniang's martial arts skills,

571
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,520
you can fight her head-on.

572
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,530
If we start fighting,

573
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,980
I can only be your enemy.

574
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,550
I want you to meet someone.

575
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,250
I'll go with you.

576
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,230
It has nothing to do with you.

577
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,410
Stay here and wait for me.

578
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,230
Let's go.

579
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,660
I still didn't help.

580
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,560
I've only helped this much.

581
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,060
Starting tomorrow,

582
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,040
he and I will be enemies.

583
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,510
Starting tomorrow,

584
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,520
your conscience will be eaten by a dog.

585
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,260
In his heart,

586
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,140
there's both a saint and a vicious dog.

587
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,190
Tomorrow, the saint will be devoured by the dog.

588
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,870
I've told you before,

589
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,310
you're going to

590
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,030
ruin everything with this relationship.

591
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,460
Gan Pu is going to be in trouble.

592
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,280
People who fall in love

593
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,320
are often unreliable.

594
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,730
You're wrong.

595
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,460
Since she's here,

596
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,860
she never planned to go back alive.

597
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,440
She's the orphan of the Mo Clan.

598
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,140
No wonder.

599
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,770
That's unstoppable now.

600
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,400
I know

601
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,830
why you've fallen for her.

602
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,070
A woman who clings to death

603
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,910
but still yearns for love,

604
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,800
the kind of tragic and complex emotions,

605
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,520
indeed,

606
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,550
I've fallen into it.

607
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,430
How pitiful.

608
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,520
An old man like me can't understand it.

609
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,360
I didn't understand either,

610
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,690
why she would attract me.

611
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,380
Enough already.

612
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,940
Love.

613
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,890
Does love need understanding?

614
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,790
Love arises without knowing where it comes from,

615
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,200
and deepens without warning.

616
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,740
It's truly pitiful.

617
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,230
Your love only has one day left.

618
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,560
Grieve as you will.

619
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,740
At least you have a conscience.

620
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,270
You even wait for me.

621
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,710
What are you two doing, staring like that?

622
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,830
Isn't there anything wrong?

623
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,170
You're getting smarter.

624
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,240
That's not a good thing.

625
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,280
Do you think the only way to find your life's purpose

626
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,360
is to think I'm a fool?

627
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,630
I'll tell you,

628
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,520
one day, if I become smarter,

629
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,890
you'll feel lost.

630
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,920
Then you won't have a purpose in life anymore.

631
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,610
Young Master Wang,

632
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,510
maybe your goals are all illusions.

633
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,540
Your intelligence

634
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,370
is just like mine,

635
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,220
high one minute, low the next,

636
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,850
and even

637
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,390
a bit cute.

638
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,620
Agreed.

639
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,900
We're only two steps away from sitting.

640
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,140
Why do you two have to stand here and talk?

641
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,190
How silly.

642
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,820
I don't care about you two. I'm sitting down.

643
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,580
Delicious skewers.

644
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,950
Take a look.

645
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:47,950
How much for this lamb skewer?

646
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,830
Five wen each.

647
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,070
What about ten wen?

648
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,800
Three skewers.

649
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,650
Six skewers.

650
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,200
-Alright.
-That person is back again.

651
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,070
The person over there.

652
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,080
They've been walking in circles.

653
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,850
That person is still secretly watching us.

654
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,760
It's fine. We're keeping an eye on each other.

655
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,320
If anything happens, we'll shout

656
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,160
and make a big scene.

657
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,150
We can't let them catch us again.

658
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:05,770
Alright.

659
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,500
I'll go back to my stall. Contact me if anything comes up.

660
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,960
Why do those two keep staring at us?

661
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,420
As long as they don't act, we won't either.

662
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,550
Hongxiu doesn't want us to alarm the snake by hitting the grass.

663
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:24,790
Do you want to try it?

664
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,429
Lover's Tears grilled skewers, a family recipe.

665
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,960
Gao Yin, what are you doing here?

666
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,340
Gan Pu left.

667
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,130
I don't feel at ease.

668
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,310
I want to go take a look.

669
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,620
I'll go with you.

670
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:47,480
Well...

671
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,350
I'll stay here, too. It's too boring.

672
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:52,440
I'll stay here,

673
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:53,719
waiting for your news.

674
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,300
I can't go either. I don't want to.

675
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,390
I'm exhausted. I'm going to sleep.

676
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,040
What did you do to Han Aizhen?

677
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,580
She left.

678
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,900
I didn't make things hard for her.

679
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,470
I let her leave safely to report back.

680
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,140
Are you relieved now?

681
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,120
Now I'm very curious.

682
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,040
What's your attitude toward the Emperor?

683
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,540
We're using each other.

684
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,710
This can barely

685
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,330
be justified,

686
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,970
but it really is a stretch.

687
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,180
You figured it out?

688
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,290
Looks like you have a big plan.

689
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,630
Impressive.

690
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,310
You truly live up to being a disciple of Mr. Shang Shan.

691
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,600
So unusual.

692
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,310
Anyone with a bit of a brain could see it.

693
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,950
Thanks for the reminder.

694
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,460
Looks like we need to be even more vigilant.

695
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,810
Why don't you inherit the throne?

696
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,300
Why stay here risking your life for a foster father?

697
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,140
Do you want to hear the truth or a lie?

698
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,160
But I can't lie.

699
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,630
Because my truth sounds like a lie.

700
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,390
Different people see it differently.

701
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,770
You're so pretentious.

702
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,500
When Yinniang asked you that question,

703
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,580
she just wanted to understand your character.

704
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,860
I'm speaking about my character.

705
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,050
You can go in by yourself.

706
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,320
We won't go with you.

707
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,880
Chunlan, Qiu Ju.

708
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,910
I have this feeling inside me,

709
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,800
that something's going to happen today,

710
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,300
and we need to be on guard.

711
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,800
Blocking me like this is useless.

712
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,460
Be careful you don't end up trapped yourself.

713
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,320
To be honest,

714
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,810
if I could save Qing Cai, I'd be willing to do it.

715
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,910
You still have feelings for him?

716
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,910
I really don't get you.

717
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:18,890
I don't.

718
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,680
You really are a big romantic.

719
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,040
But what's the point of following him like this?

720
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,270
Can you use your invisibility technique

721
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,270
to sneak him out?

722
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,380
Young Master Wang has already said,

723
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,320
he's giving us only one day.

724
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,560
After today,

725
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,680
you'll raise the slaughtering knife against us.

726
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,770
I won't.

727
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,920
You won't?

728
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,170
Yes.

729
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,920
Maybe you won't lay a hand on Qing Cai,

730
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,630
but you don't feel anything for me.

731
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:50,670
What about Young Master Wang?

732
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,580
He probably won't target me,

733
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,040
but will he let Vegetable go?

734
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,230
You all know,

735
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,170
Vegetable and I are in this together.

736
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,670
No matter who among you

737
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,670
hurts us,

738
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,170
we'll fight back with everything we've got.

739
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,590
Understand?

740
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,840
Step aside.

741
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,410
Father.

742
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,780
You've been exposed after all.

743
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,530
Don't blame Aizhen.

744
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,830
She didn't do anything wrong.

745
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,790
She's just

746
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,550
the final verification tool for others.

747
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,480
What's happened to her now?

748
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,340
Mingyi Manor didn't make things hard for her.

749
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,520
They sent her off.

750
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,460
I guess Mingyi Manor

751
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,000
is about to do something big.

752
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,800
Yinniang has been holding back all these years,

753
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,990
and now she wants to take a risk.

754
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,440
But I don't know what she's planning.

755
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,680
It's not easy.

756
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,480
The other side is also very cunning,

757
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,950
and they've been planning for over a decade.

758
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,130
What are we doing here?

759
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,600
Are we here to warn Yinniang and the others?

760
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,690
I came to rescue someone.

761
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,870
If anyone gets hurt,

762
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,560
I'll treat them.

763
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,220
You always deceive yourself.

764
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,360
From where you stand,

765
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,900
never think about immediate satisfaction.

766
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,240
Balance is the key.

767
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,520
Balance?

768
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,640
In a sense,

769
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,460
you've been pushing for it.

770
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,590
But you've created such a complicated situation,

771
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,140
this isn't balance,

772
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,250
it's subversion.

773
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,590
So what do you want to do?

774
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,720
Break the balance

775
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,160
or maintain it,

776
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:11,720
waiting for the right moment?

777
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,550
I can vaguely sense

778
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,630
what kind of result you want,

779
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,270
but don't you think it's too difficult?

780
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,280
If it weren't for you not cooperating with me,

781
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,000
it wouldn't be this difficult.

782
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,510
I…

783
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,190
The balance you want

784
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,480
may be broken tonight.

785
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,790
No one can control the future developments.

786
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,460
Never give up,

787
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,540
because every accident

788
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,010
could be a better opportunity.

789
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,810
Aren't you supposed to be resting?

790
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,210
Why are you here again?

791
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,640
I want to rest too,

792
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,410
but seeing them all so anxious,

793
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,840
I couldn't sit still.

794
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,530
Why don't you go see for yourself?

795
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,880
If you go, you'll know everything.

796
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,950
The problem is, I don't know

797
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,790
what's happening right now.

798
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,440
I see.

799
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,500
Let me tell you.

800
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,270
Vegetable was captured.

801
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,570
Gan Pu is going to save him,

802
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,360
but she might lose her life.

803
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,510
How did such a serious thing suddenly happen?

804
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,870
No, I have to go take a look.

805
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,890
You go ahead.

806
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:08,890
Give me the wine.

807
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,920
I'm dying of thirst.

808
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,890
Knowing it's impossible, but still doing it.

809
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,800
Aren't you tired?

810
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,530
I'm just a fool.

811
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,820
My only ability is to run fast.

812
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,150
Let me tell you,

813
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,210
if the direction is wrong,

814
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,560
it doesn't matter how long you run.

815
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,880
The faster you run,

816
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,380
the farther you'll get

817
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,030
from your goal.

818
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,250
You'll only waste your energy in vain.

819
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,620
Smart people are one in a hundred.

820
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,380
I'm one of the ninety-nine.

821
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,320
If you're too focused on the goal,

822
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,380
won't that just bring trouble upon yourself?

823
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,720
After all, we are friends.

824
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,140
No matter our status, it's only about character.

825
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,340
Good.

826
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,050
Fellow travelers in life.

827
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,260
Let's drink to that.

828
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:05,820
Give me the wine.

829
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,130
Let's drink today, for today's joy,

830
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,410
and let tomorrow worry about tomorrow.

831
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,760
Do we just wait here?

832
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,640
What else can we do?

833
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:34,430
I can only act after something

834
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,970
happens.

835
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,500
This feeling of waiting in the unknown

836
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,430
is tormenting.

837
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:47,840
Yeah.

838
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,250
Knowing it will happen,

839
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,990
but being unable to stop it.

840
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,580
I encounter

841
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:57,730
this situation often in my medical practice.

842
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:01,570
I can imagine.

843
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,360
A doctor fights against fate.

844
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,170
Everyone has their own persistence.

845
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,180
Knowing that what they're doing will harm themselves,

846
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,130
but still doing it because it must be done.

847
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,600
Others can't interfere.

848
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,520
Everything is interconnected.

849
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,990
This is also the helplessness of a doctor.

850
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:27,910
Sometimes you can only watch helplessly,

851
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,040
but can't change it.

852
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,770
But you still want to change it.

853
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,430
I'm just going with the flow.

854
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,000
The rise and fall of a dynasty, its collapse or its flourishing,

855
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,590
are all destined.

856
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,030
I'm just accelerating it.
