00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,410
[Pretty Boy]

2
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,300
[Episode 15]

3
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,300
Now that the serious talk is done,

4
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,480
I'm going to pick some chili peppers.

5
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,890
Qing Cai,

6
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,640
you've got a big heart.

7
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,590
Just now, we were talking about life and death,

8
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,000
and now you're back to thinking about your gang of ruffians?

9
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,220
I'm just a simple guy.

10
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,050
Plus, my dad's safe for now,

11
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,190
so why not

12
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,070
enjoy life a little?

13
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,090
Always worrying about court politics

14
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,480
seems pretty dull to me.

15
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,710
Matters of the state are nothing

16
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,990
more than power struggles among the elite.

17
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,640
Rarely are they truly about people's welfare.

18
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,480
With your talent,

19
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,250
don't you feel like it's being wasted?

20
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,900
Stop testing me.

21
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,520
I know my limits.

22
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,390
Besides, I've led too rough a life

23
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,830
to be familiar with the schemes and intrigues

24
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,480
of the court.

25
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,140
If I were thrown into that world,

26
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,690
I'd just be overwhelmed

27
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,080
and accomplish nothing meaningful.

28
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,030
Better to work

29
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,120
within my own familiar sphere

30
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,410
and do some small, practical good.

31
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,000
The wise often hide among the common folk.

32
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,190
Those power struggles among the elite?

33
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,070
Just a pack of scoundrels squabbling.

34
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,050
Nothing admirable about it.

35
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,070
Are you talking about Wang Yishao?

36
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,750
Indeed.

37
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,260
He should take on something meaningful for a change.

38
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,960
But that's not his place.

39
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,340
His unique position

40
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,920
might cost him his life

41
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,329
if he makes a move.

42
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,770
It's all about effort.

43
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,060
You're a surviving member of the Mo Clan?

44
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,180
No wonder you've been drifting around

45
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,110
and ended up here.

46
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,770
I came here for revenge.

47
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,390
So, does that mean

48
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,990
we're destined to clash in the future?

49
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:15,380
Actually, the Mingyi Manor has always

50
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,240
dealt with the royal family half-heartedly,

51
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,940
only avoiding offense to them.

52
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,650
So, does that mean

53
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,070
you'd side with me

54
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,440
to go against Mingyi Manor?

55
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,590
No.

56
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,760
My orders are to protect Mingyi Manor.

57
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,260
If you make a move,

58
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,159
just don't let me catch you.

59
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,580
And if you do catch me?

60
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,260
I'll stop you.

61
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,470
What if your orders were to kill me?

62
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,159
What if you found the son of the late Emperor?

63
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,250
My father's orders are clear:

64
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,380
If I encounter that person, eliminate them on the spot.

65
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,000
But I didn't know the target

66
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,440
was the son of the late Emperor.

67
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,640
So now,

68
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,090
are you following orders

69
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,630
or defying them?

70
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,240
This situation is far more complicated

71
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,160
than I anticipated.

72
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,930
I haven't figured it all out yet.

73
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,659
I still want to know what you will do.

74
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,550
The late Emperor was a tyrant.

75
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,010
So what?

76
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,060
What does it have to do with the son of the late Emperor?

77
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,659
The General was loyal to the late Emperor.

78
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,510
They are a bunch of accomplices to his tyranny.

79
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,110
I see.

80
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,870
So you're worried

81
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,710
if the son of the late Emperor returns,

82
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,700
it will bolster the General's power.

83
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,710
And maybe,

84
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,460
he'll even kill your father and brothers.

85
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,210
So, you'd still kill the son of the late Emperor,

86
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,810
right?

87
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,300
General and Mingyi Manor colluded to destroy the Mo Clan,

88
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,270
wasn't it?

89
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,460
That's something everyone in power knows.

90
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,280
Then doesn't your father

91
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,760
working with Mingyi Manor

92
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,610
prove that

93
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,120
he's no saint either?

94
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,250
I get why you'd resent us,

95
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,409
but you can't have it both ways.

96
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,870
See?

97
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,440
When it comes to these things,

98
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,040
you're sharp and insightful.

99
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,090
Good.

100
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,180
I'd rather stay naive.

101
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,200
Naivety brings its own blessings.

102
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,060
Sometimes,

103
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,300
I really envy Hu Jiao.

104
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:55,260
Who said I'm naive?

105
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,950
I'm so smart and quick-witted.

106
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,130
Where's the naive part in that?

107
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,790
Gan Pu,

108
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,750
come hunting with us.

109
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,190
We've been at it all day and haven't caught a thing.

110
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,050
Take a seat first. It's raining outside.

111
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Stupid weather.

112
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,720
It started raining all of a sudden.

113
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,720
Let's wait for it to stop before heading out.

114
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,710
Let me take a break as well.

115
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,420
Have some hot tea.

116
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,420
Try it.

117
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,400
Your tea's awful—terrible, really—

118
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,740
but it's surprisingly refreshing.

119
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,490
You really got a big heart.

120
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,560
At a time like this,

121
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,500
you're still doing errands for those ruffians.

122
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,240
Why are you the only one back?

123
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,120
Hu Jiao and I didn't catch a thing.

124
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,909
She went to find Gan Pu to go hunting.

125
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,330
Give it to me.

126
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,720
You two go have some tea.

127
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,740
I'll handle things here.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,570
Go on, have some tea.

129
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,830
Gan Pu and Wang Yishao

130
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,610
are probably having tea right now.

131
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,550
Didn't you just say

132
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,020
Hu Jiao dragged Gan Pu off to go hunting?

133
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,730
Hu Jiao's worn out.

134
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,700
She's probably still resting.

135
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,160
I'll take care of things here.

136
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,460
What are you waiting for?

137
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,020
Gan Pu and Wang Yishao are having tea!

138
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,610
Okay then.

139
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,460
Fine.

140
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,140
Look at Hong Hui, wandering around like he's lost his soul.

141
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,520
What's wrong with you?

142
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,530
Why do you look more natural in men's clothing than in women's?

143
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,080
Before I came to Mingyi Manor,

144
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,670
I always dressed as a man.

145
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,560
No wonder.

146
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,900
Hong Hui.

147
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,770
Can you stop acting like a teacher all the time?

148
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,270
You look so punchable.

149
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,910
Pepper.

150
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,830
Stop bullying Hong Hui.

151
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,790
He's a grown man,

152
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,210
but now he's like a lamb.

153
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,680
Aren't you tired of it?

154
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,910
How would I know?

155
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,900
I see him, and I just lose my temper.

156
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,980
That's what you call flirting with insults.

157
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,740
Nonsense!

158
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,250
Don't make me hit you!

159
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,820
Stop!

160
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,260
Stop it and come back.

161
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,270
I'm so mad!

162
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,580
I just saved up some energy, but it's gone again.

163
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,220
The hunting crew's all here.

164
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,780
How could it be a man?

165
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,780
How could it be a man?

166
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,610
Hong Hui.

167
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,750
What's wrong?

168
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,800
Is there a problem?

169
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,130
What's wrong?

170
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,030
I have something to tell you.

171
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,250
I'll be going now.

172
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,410
I told you he's sick.

173
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,850
He's having an episode and ran off.

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,870
But don't worry.

175
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,310
He'll be back.

176
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,140
Stop being so snarky!

177
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,900
Alright, alright.

178
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,330
Don't take it to heart.

179
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,870
Let's head up the mountain—I'll teach you how to hunt.

180
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,950
Qing Cai.

181
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,600
You and Gan Pu make the perfect hunting pair.

182
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,550
Let's go together.

183
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,120
Let's go.

184
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,070
You two enjoy your tea.

185
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,400
Let's go.

186
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:22,920
Let's go.

187
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,340
Your expression just now seemed off.

188
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,130
Do you know what's going on with Hong Hui?

189
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,660
You should ask him yourself.

190
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,890
I've always felt

191
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,450
that you know things

192
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,780
but refuse to tell me.

193
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,020
Maybe Hong Hui knows by now too?

194
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,130
If you already know that,

195
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,970
then you shouldn't ask me.

196
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,580
"Virtue wins allies,

197
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,250
lack of virtue loses support."

198
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,080
That's why I didn't force you.

199
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,560
If you push Hong Hui too hard,

200
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,180
you'll lose a friend.

201
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,620
You should judge for yourself.

202
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,310
So many people have figured out

203
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,240
the truth about something.

204
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,310
Why can't I see it?

205
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,120
What am I missing?

206
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,430
I'm not going to give you any hints,

207
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,520
so don't bother probing me indirectly.

208
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,080
But you're right.

209
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,690
Virtue wins allies.

210
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,970
Even though our orders are different,

211
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,510
I won't deceive myself like you do.

212
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,850
Is this something Gan Pu left here,

213
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,780
or did she lose it?

214
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,010
Probably something she dropped.

215
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,920
You should return it to her.

216
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,510
Looks like you're not making any progress with her.

217
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,650
She treats me like a brother now—

218
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,510
completely shutting me out.

219
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,650
I'll return it to her for you.

220
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,680
This is my sachet.

221
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,980
Would you accept it?

222
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,400
This is one of the older designs, isn't it?

223
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,380
They don't make this pattern anymore.

224
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,590
You've seen that sachet shop, right?

225
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,580
I went there with Gan Pu last time in town.

226
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,020
You can't return someone's sachet

227
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,380
after accepting it.

228
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,260
That's just cruel.

229
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,170
You'll have to keep one of these two.

230
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,420
I didn't accept it.

231
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,110
I was just curious,

232
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,730
comparing the two.

233
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,100
Give this to her.

234
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,570
This is my sachet.

235
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,480
So,

236
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,240
you can be pretty dark too.

237
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,880
Just balancing the scales.

238
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,280
Though people are different,

239
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,720
from

240
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,300
a medical perspective,

241
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,870
commonalities outweigh differences.

242
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,010
Using your medical knowledge to deceive yourself?

243
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,590
I agree.

244
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,840
I'll return it to her for you.

245
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,590
But

246
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,230
you're ruthless.

247
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,680
You've never been ordinary.

248
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,330
I see.

249
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,340
This is my punishment for not cooperating with you.

250
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,050
Finally remembered me, have you?

251
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,870
Ever since the prison break,

252
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,110
you stopped sharing information with me.

253
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,230
Today, your group's movements seem unusual.

254
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,160
Did you discover something?

255
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,180
Your instincts are sharp.

256
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,520
Yes,

257
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,750
but I'm completely in the dark.

258
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,380
You? In the dark?

259
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,290
That's rare.

260
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,770
Aren't you usually

261
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,410
the first to notice something's wrong?

262
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,720
Not necessarily.

263
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,430
Everyone has their own specialties.

264
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,750
So,

265
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,130
your team's already falling apart.

266
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,430
We were never united to begin with—

267
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,050
just like you and me.

268
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,410
It's merely a collaboration in certain areas.

269
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,000
So, what do you think we've overlooked?

270
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,090
From the start,

271
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,260
who did we think was the most suspicious?

272
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,869
Qing Cai.

273
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,270
He's full of flaws,

274
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,569
constantly contradicting himself.

275
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,800
The key point is that other than appearances,

276
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,839
he's nothing like a woman.

277
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,750
But his identity as a woman

278
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,010
has been confirmed by everyone.

279
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,160
But what if, from the very beginning,

280
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,970
everyone was lying?

281
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,990
Why would everyone lie for him?

282
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,480
Everyone has their reasons, I suppose.

283
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,910
If everyone's lying,

284
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,600
we'd have to analyze their motives one by one.

285
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,020
Why not just verify it directly?

286
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,040
If he's a man,

287
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,250
then it's almost certain

288
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,680
he's the son of the late Emperor.

289
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,110
Otherwise, there'd be no reason to disguise himself as a woman.

290
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,420
That's true.

291
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,470
He's deeply concerned about his father,

292
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,540
yet he lacks support or power.

293
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,360
All he can do is take risks alone.

294
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,880
So,

295
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,230
can we still afford to act recklessly?

296
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,160
Besides,

297
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,810
our stances

298
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,740
on this matter

299
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,450
might not align.

300
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,860
Are you worried about

301
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,460
how your faction might react?

302
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,740
If I find the person,

303
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,580
they won't dare hide the truth.

304
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,020
Besides,

305
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,550
the son of the late Emperor

306
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,250
is like a hot potato right now.

307
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,280
I'm curious, though.

308
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,980
Others might have

309
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,600
their own agendas,

310
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,420
but would Hu Jiao lie?

311
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,100
She's the least likely person to lie.

312
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,560
How could she possibly be a man?

313
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,220
We all bathed together.

314
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,240
All of you?

315
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,130
Of course.

316
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,300
We all bathed together—nothing to hide.

317
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,070
This is getting more and more complicated.

318
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,580
Let's keep observing.

319
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,480
Hopefully, this won't

320
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,040
escalate into open conflict between us.

321
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,580
Why do you think

322
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,050
it might come to that?

323
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,640
This isn't just about a single life.

324
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,090
In a nest of snakes,

325
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,800
you never know

326
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,570
when you'll get bitten.

327
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,230
Spread a bit more of that.

328
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,940
Cover it with leaves more densely.

329
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,970
This is so much work.

330
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,440
Yes.

331
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,900
Add more later.

332
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,140
Cover it up well.

333
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,750
Not bad, right?

334
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,470
Don't get cocky.

335
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,690
Once I've learned this,

336
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,370
I'll catch you and make chicken soup out of you.

337
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,530
This pit trap

338
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,290
can only catch ground animals.

339
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,170
It's useless for wild pheasants.

340
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,900
Can't catch them, huh?

341
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,620
Is she completely crazy?

342
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,250
You can do this kind of work?

343
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,630
I thought you were always lofty and above it all.

344
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,320
You're the disciple of the Fairy Doctor.

345
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,000
I think you're halfway to being a miracle physician.

346
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,480
I started out processing herbs.

347
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,690
Where's the loftiness in that?

348
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,350
I've done all kinds of odd jobs.

349
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,720
I see.

350
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,630
My master always said,

351
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,170
"Those of the lowest station often possess the greatest wisdom."

352
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,630
To gain wisdom,

353
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,560
one must practice hands-on.

354
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,370
He lived by that principle.

355
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,240
He said it helped him stay grounded.

356
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,180
Even the Fairy Doctor does that?

357
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,010
Hard to imagine.

358
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,970
Someone so high-ranking

359
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,000
doing such humble tasks.

360
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,990
My master's wife is the complete opposite.

361
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,170
She never does any chores.

362
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,560
She used to say, "I'll take intelligence over wisdom any day."

363
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,430
She let me choose for myself.

364
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,270
And you chose wisdom.

365
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,240
I bet

366
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,690
your master's wife had quite a temper.

367
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,200
You're right.

368
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,210
She said the least wise person is someone like her—

369
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,610
always impatient

370
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,530
and loves scolding others.

371
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,230
She never lifts a finger for chores

372
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,230
and only cares about her own comfort,

373
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,080
regardless of whether others resent her.

374
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,300
Is she still around?

375
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,210
They're both very long-lived.

376
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,950
I know what you mean.

377
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,740
It seems only good-tempered people can live long.

378
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,570
But my master said

379
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,660
a person's temperament doesn't determine their lifespan.

380
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,420
What matters is self-awareness—

381
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,610
knowing who you are

382
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,150
and following your nature.

383
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,180
That sounds odd, no matter how you put it.

384
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,340
Your master's wife must be quite annoying.

385
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,610
She knows she's unlikeable,

386
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,320
so she avoids people as much as possible.

387
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,460
She also said

388
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,960
the real disaster

389
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,700
is when people don't realize

390
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,780
how irritating they are.

391
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,950
She has never wanted to change?

392
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,000
It's a matter

393
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,610
of perspective.

394
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,250
She said

395
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,960
she didn't want to change herself.

396
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,330
She openly admitted she was a "bad person,"

397
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,340
so she enjoyed

398
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,510
studying harmful poisons.

399
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,740
But she has never harmed anyone.

400
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:07,470
I think my master kept her in check.

401
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,250
So,

402
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,100
they sound like a perfect match.

403
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,760
Yes.

404
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,590
She even said if

405
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,230
it weren't for him,

406
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,980
she probably would've been beaten to death long ago.

407
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,020
Aizhen, look.

408
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,640
The rooms are mostly tidied up.

409
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,800
Time to divide them.

410
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,330
Then I'm taking the biggest one.

411
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,890
Sneaky!

412
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,160
Fine, I'll go prepare the wild game.

413
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,360
You guys handle the fire.

414
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,640
Okay.

415
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,700
Good evening, everyone.

416
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,450
Qing Cai.

417
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,090
Gan Pu.

418
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,260
I know you're staying in single rooms tonight,

419
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,730
so I brought you some candles.

420
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,060
You can keep them burning through the night.

421
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,650
I'm really a rough person.

422
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,940
I didn't even think of that.

423
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,240
Let me know when they run out,

424
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,570
and I'll bring more.

425
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,440
Okay, thank you.

426
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,500
You're so considerate.

427
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,340
They'll be useful.

428
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,520
You guys start the fire.

429
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,930
Fine. What's with the attitude?

430
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,650
I'll help.

431
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,820
Let me help.

432
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,550
Be careful.

433
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,480
Gan Pu.

434
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,140
Take a look.

435
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,570
Is this what you lost earlier?

436
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,530
Is it my sachet?

437
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,150
It seems to be mine.

438
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,880
Thank you, Gao Yin.

439
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,340
I'll leave the candles in your room.

440
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,330
Okay.

441
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,340
I'll keep working on the fire.

442
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,660
Seeing you all in men's clothes

443
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,330
is still a bit jarring.

444
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,980
You're just not used to it yet.

445
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,040
It's funny though.

446
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,230
But honestly, wearing men's or women's clothes

447
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,490
isn't that different—clothes are just clothes.

448
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,820
Men and women don't dress alike.

449
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,280
Men and women don't sit together.

450
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,720
Society decides these things. But you don't care that much.

451
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,200
In a place like Mingyi Manor,

452
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,260
you can be free.

453
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,580
But if we were in the royal city,

454
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,650
I'd be mindful of appearances

455
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,740
to keep you from being criticized.

456
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,110
So that's why you hang out with

457
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,710
free-spirited types like Hong Hui and Zhang Fang—

458
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,010
to enjoy a laid-back life?

459
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,820
Young Master Wang,

460
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,910
if you're willing to befriend someone eccentric like Hong Hui,

461
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,690
you must be a bit unconventional yourself.

462
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,670
I have something to handle.

463
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,570
I'm leaving.

464
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,520
Hong Hui.

465
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,770
How dare you ruin my sight

466
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,400
with that appearance?

467
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,250
Get out!

468
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,030
He...

469
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,770
What's wrong with him?

470
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,900
Is he dead?

471
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,900
No, just exhausted

472
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,390
and weak right now.

473
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,250
Someone fetch water.

474
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,000
I'll go.

475
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,280
Is he really fine?

476
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,650
He's okay.

477
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,020
Hu Jiao.

478
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,440
You're always so jumpy.

479
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,560
You made me think you killed him.

480
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,930
I only realized something was off after kicking him—

481
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,260
he didn't feel alive.

482
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,040
Don't talk nonsense.

483
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,340
Have you ever thrown a corpse before?

484
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,570
He was running like crazy earlier,

485
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,640
almost to the point of collapse,

486
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,880
and crawled the rest of the way here.

487
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,740
Stop pretending. Get up.

488
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,480
Here's the water.

489
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
How do you feel?

490
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,600
Why am I so dizzy?

491
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,200
He's too weak.

492
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,590
Someone will need to take care of him tonight.

493
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,030
I... I'll do it.

494
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,590
Let me do it.

495
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,580
Let me.

496
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,940
I owe him.

497
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,520
Get up.

498
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,790
Get up.

499
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,690
Don't help him. Come here.

500
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,500
Slow down.

501
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,680
Come with me.

502
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,080
He's fine.

503
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,150
I won't stay for dinner.

504
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,470
Goodbye.

505
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,180
Lie down.

506
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:25,250
Gao Yin, are you sure he's okay?

507
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,780
Can you check again?

508
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,190
Please, just check again for me.

509
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,450
I didn't expect you to be so fickle.

510
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,840
I've misjudged you.

511
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,630
Why are you acting weird all night?

512
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,180
What are you talking about?

513
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,820
Do you misunderstand me?

514
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,760
Don't play dumb.

515
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,160
You're way too close to that Second Prince.

516
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,930
What's there to misunderstand?

517
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,730
Don't be like this.

518
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,290
I told her to do it.

519
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,930
She didn't do anything wrong.

520
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,750
You told her?

521
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,380
This...

522
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,960
Anyway,

523
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,000
don't get involved in this.

524
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,830
She really didn't do anything wrong.

525
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,340
Oh, I see. You're trying to be like me—

526
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,110
giving up the one you love.

527
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,740
I had no choice.

528
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,310
But you're different from her.

529
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,090
You liked her from the beginning,

530
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,330
so I gave you two my blessings.

531
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,370
She liked you as well.

532
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,460
And now, just after one day, she's changed her mind?

533
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,350
Nobody's changed their mind.

534
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,130
You're misunderstanding everything.

535
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,200
Nothing's going on between me and him.

536
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,980
You don't like him, yet you're all smiles and laughter with him?

537
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,220
When Qing Cai tried so hard to persuade you to stay,

538
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,640
you refused, but as soon as he spoke, you stayed.

539
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,190
I...

540
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:00,920
Aizhen.

541
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,970
Stop this, please.

542
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,360
You know Gan Pu's situation—

543
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,090
she just can't face me.

544
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,280
That's why she left.

545
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:08,830
Besides,

546
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,420
Wang Yishao brought her back.

547
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,380
I haven't even thanked him yet.

548
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,900
I'm defending you.

549
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,680
Go thank him, then!

550
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,710
Don't blame her.

551
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,170
You know her personality.

552
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,330
I don't blame her.

553
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,760
It's not what she thinks.

554
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,290
When I left,

555
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,600
I regretted it immediately.

556
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,540
I didn't know what I was doing

557
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,460
or where I was going.

558
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,150
I felt completely lost,

559
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,770
like the world was so big

560
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,170
but I was all alone.

561
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,320
That's when I realized

562
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,280
I had to come back.

563
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,530
It has nothing to do with Wang Yishao.

564
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,260
Well,

565
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,590
I have a question.

566
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,410
I hope you'll answer honestly.

567
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,730
Go ahead.

568
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,890
What do you think of Wang Yishao?

569
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,390
Why are you asking that?

570
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,630
He's a nice guy.

571
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,170
I see him as a friend.

572
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,130
That's all.

573
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,940
So,

574
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,340
you're just putting yourself through this.

575
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,300
That must be hard.

576
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,530
You and Han Aizhen really love

577
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,260
projecting your thoughts onto others.

578
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,380
Did I say that?

579
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,830
You're acting so weird.

580
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,350
I'm hungry.

581
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,760
Here.

582
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,500
I thought you were full from being angry.

583
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,650
Turns out you still know what hunger feels like.

584
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,880
I've calmed down.

585
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,040
He's fine.

586
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,240
Take good care of him tonight.

587
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,270
Really?

588
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,850
I'll leave now.

589
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,970
Don't go.

590
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,520
Who's going to help me watch over him if you leave?

591
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,710
Take care of him for me for a while.

592
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,140
I'll grab him some food.

593
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,060
I'm going.

594
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,650
Here.

595
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,510
I'm full.

596
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,990
You're such a big guy, yet you eat like a baby chick.

597
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,030
You've barely eaten anything!

598
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,290
Eat it.

599
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,520
Finish it and drink the water.

600
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,080
Gao Yin's orders.

601
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,580
I already drank a whole bowl of water.

602
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,020
Get up.

603
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,650
Get up.

604
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,440
Drink it.

605
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,130
Drink.

606
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,159
Just drink!

607
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,670
What are you looking at?

608
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,650
Trying to find an escape route?

609
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,719
I just think it's dangerous here.

610
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,050
Eat it.

611
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,760
Eat!

612
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,920
Eat it!

613
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:59,830
Big bites!

614
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,260
What's up with you today?

615
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,500
I've recovered.

616
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,200
I was just exhausted and dazed earlier,

617
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,580
but I'm fine now.

618
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,100
I just want to go for a walk.

619
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,040
At least you came up with an excuse.

620
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,770
But for your safety,

621
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,470
I'll tag along.

622
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,670
Can't have you tripping and dying out there

623
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,680
and leaving me to take the blame.

624
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,760
I wouldn't blame you!

625
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,660
Of course you wouldn't!

626
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,890
If you're dead, you can't blame anyone.

627
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,580
I'm worried about others blaming me.

628
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,850
Fine, follow me then.

629
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,680
No.

630
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,280
To prevent you from running off,

631
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,430
I need to take precautions.

632
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,670
Come here.

633
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,380
Come here.

634
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,920
Come here.

635
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:54,930
You are...

636
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,760
Why did you tie Hong Hui up?

637
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,990
He wanted to take a walk,

638
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,410
so I'm "accompanying" him.

639
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,330
That's quite a special kind of walk.

640
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,730
You're not planning to lure him out

641
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,240
and bury him alive, are you?

642
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,190
You know, the kind where the body's never found?

643
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,610
I'm tying him up to keep him

644
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,410
from dying out there.

645
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,870
I think

646
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,930
if Hong Hui sticks with you,

647
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,560
he's destined for an early grave.

648
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:23,930
Let's go.

649
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,290
Come here.

650
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,730
Stop looking.

651
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,250
Be gentle.

652
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,440
Come here.

653
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,760
Poor Hong Hui,

654
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,520
being led around like a little puppy.

655
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,240
I really feel for him.

656
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,400
Who would've thought that the quirky, funny Hong Hui

657
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,270
from class would end up like this?

658
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,310
She's just in a bad mood today.

659
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,850
Don't take it personally.

660
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,060
Actually,

661
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,310
Hong Hui already knows who I am.

662
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,990
No wonder he looked so devastated when he saw you.

663
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,430
It seems like he wanted to

664
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,580
report your identity to Wang Yishao

665
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,760
but managed to hold back.

666
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,270
That's why he lost control earlier.

667
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,340
This is serious.

668
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,110
If even Hong Hui knows,

669
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,600
the secret won't hold for long.

670
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,140
Qing Cai, we need to leave.

671
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,660
But if I leave, what about Father?

672
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,660
I can't just leave him here alone.

673
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,330
If Father were here,

674
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,870
he'd want you to go.

675
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,240
I'm just a worthless life.

676
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,520
It's nothing significant.

677
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,380
How can you degrade yourself like this?

678
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,100
Father and I risked our lives to protect you.

679
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,440
If your life is worthless, what does that make ours?

680
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:44,960
And now, look at this mess—

681
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,810
Father is in danger, and so are you.

682
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,660
You've left the choice to me.

683
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,950
What am I supposed to do?

684
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:56,120
Aizhen, don't worry.

685
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,980
I'll protect Qing Cai.

686
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,660
We'll die If we have to die, we die together.

687
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,070
I heard everything

688
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,710
you just said.

689
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,320
Do you know something?

690
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,750
It's only been a few days.

691
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,260
And you already seem like a stranger to yourself.

692
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,310
I can't compare to you,

693
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,640
cutting ties with the filth

694
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,980
of the mundane world so cleanly.

695
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,980
Who can live in this world

696
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,610
without some stain?

697
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,230
It's just that I don't want to let the dust pile up more than it already has.

698
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,810
Dust to dust, ashes to ashes.

699
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,010
Everything is void.

700
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,680
Don't worry.

701
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:13,960
What's the matter with you?

702
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,480
You're the one who wanted to come out,

703
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,090
and now you're already tired after a few steps?

704
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,280
I drank too much water.

705
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,820
What do you mean? Are you going to throw up?

706
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,230
Not exactly…

707
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,830
What do you mean?

708
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,760
Okay, I'll turn around.

709
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,460
Such trouble.

710
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,230
What are you doing?

711
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,410
Why are you standing there?

712
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,370
What if after I untie you, you run away?

713
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,070
Just one hand.

714
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,490
Fine, I'll untie one hand.

715
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,200
But if both your hands

716
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,970
so much as touch,

717
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,420
I'll make sure you regret it.

718
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,000
Are you turning around or not?

719
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,180
How can I make sure you're not breaking the rules

720
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,500
if I'm not watching?

721
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,060
I can let it out

722
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:23,220
with you staring at me.

723
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,490
Hold it then!

724
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,070
Come here.

725
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,640
Gao Yin,

726
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,920
if Wang Yishao finds out about Qing Cai's identity,

727
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,410
what will he do?

728
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,650
He might report it to Mingyi Manor,

729
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,410
or he could secretly send word back.

730
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,460
If Mingyi Manor finds out,

731
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,980
I'll have no chance of escape.

732
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,300
Which option seems more likely?

733
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,050
Sending word back secretly.

734
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,730
It sounds like Mingyi Manor and your faction

735
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,050
aren't as close as they once were.

736
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,810
That's just my guess.

737
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,280
Qing Cai,

738
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,740
are you really going to take such a huge risk

739
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,760
by staying here?

740
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,520
How did Hong Hui find out?

741
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,840
That doesn't make sense.

742
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,300
Zhang Fang.

743
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:30,320
Zhang Fang?

744
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,320
That beggar?

745
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,920
Zhang Fang is not a beggar.

746
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,220
He's a wandering master.

747
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:39,610
If it weren't for seeing Hong Hui too deep in the act,

748
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,120
he wouldn't have said a word.

749
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,360
How ironic.

750
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,600
The sharpest of us all, Wang Yishao,

751
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,750
ends up being the last to know.

752
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,730
Not necessarily.

753
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,660
If it weren't for some unexpected events,

754
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,510
with his sharp mind,

755
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,660
he might've been the first to figure it out.

756
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,720
Wasn't it you who figured it out first?

757
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,330
I'm a doctor.

758
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,300
From the moment I met you, I could tell you were a man.

759
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,180
Does Zhang Fang know medicine, too?

760
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:10,860
No.

761
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:14,160
But as a master,

762
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,130
he must have some unique skills.

763
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,840
So he's known all along, but he only said something

764
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,590
when he couldn't stand watching anymore?

765
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,230
Actually, Hongxiu knows too.

766
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,850
Yes.

767
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,980
But your behavior that day

768
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,680
confused everyone.

769
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:45,980
If not for

770
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,010
the others covering for you,

771
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,470
your identity would've been exposed.

772
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,730
The Martial Arts World is too dangerous.

773
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:56,920
Gao Yin,

774
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,470
I have a question.

775
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,900
Since you knew from the start that Qing Cai was a man,

776
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,800
why did you follow him to the town?

777
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,260
That's my question too.

778
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,330
I just wanted to see if you were some rogue

779
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,800
trying to take advantage of us.

780
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,330
Showing myself

781
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,140
was also a test to see how you'd react.

782
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,490
Weren't you worried I'd kill you?

783
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,980
Not with the precautions I had in place.

784
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,890
You couldn't kill me.

785
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,320
Looks like

786
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,010
it's a miracle I'm still alive.

787
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,400
Exactly, so you'd better treasure it and live well.

788
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,650
You...

789
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,270
Let's go. Let's go.

790
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:28,840
Stop dawdling and get moving!
