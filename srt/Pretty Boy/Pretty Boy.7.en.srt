00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,720
(Pretty Boy)

2
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,570
(Episode 7)

3
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,150
For someone who is poorer

4
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,470
and treats me better,

5
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,430
I'll just keep him as a pet for fun.

6
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,460
Are you being serious or joking?

7
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,460
What do you think?

8
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,800
I really don't know.

9
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,230
That's why I said you're a fool.

10
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,550
You're not even angry when I'm saying this?

11
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,510
Why should I be angry?

12
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,150
I'm actually a fool in this aspect.

13
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,740
You look quite pretty in women's clothing.

14
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,710
They've all left already.

15
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,270
Maybe all the ingredients have been sold out.

16
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,790
That's possible.

17
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,430
The business was so good today.

18
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,790
They've probably all gone home.

19
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,100
Come on. Let's go find them now.

20
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,790
Okay.

21
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,230
You're back again.

22
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,870
Is it because I wasn't here,

23
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,950
and you still wanted to eat for free?

24
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,280
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

25
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,350
They've sold out everything today.

26
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,110
There are also many other people waiting to eat here tomorrow.

27
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,110
But let me tell you.

28
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,230
Don't eat that Lover's Tears.

29
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,550
Eat other dishes. They are really delicious.

30
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,110
Big Sister.

31
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,400
Don't be discouraged just because you've lost to me.

32
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,270
Don't be discouraged.

33
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,670
Except for me,

34
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,350
you're the most beautiful woman in our town.

35
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,470
The most beautiful woman.

36
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,430
It's alright. Don't be jealous of me.

37
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,670
I'm not a threat to you.

38
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,950
Little girl,

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,950
why are you saying that you're not a threat to her?

40
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,110
I'm still young.

41
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,670
If she wants to find a husband,

42
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,630
not everyone will wait for me to grow up.

43
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,670
She still has a chance.

44
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,590
You still have a chance.

45
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,430
Little girl, you're the Top Belle now.

46
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,190
Shouldn't you be showing off a bit?

47
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,029
She's a kid. Don't describe her as a Top Belle.

48
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,269
I know what a Top Belle is.

49
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,670
What do you mean? How should I show off?

50
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,000
Look.

51
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,060
After a man passes the imperial examination, he'll wear a red flower and parade through the streets.

52
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,700
You wouldn't want to miss this opportunity, would you?

53
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,430
You should let everyone in town know that

54
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,670
you're the Top Belle.

55
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,790
Do you think I'm a fool?

56
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,230
But if you're going to do something foolish,

57
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,740
I can do it with you.

58
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,420
I...

59
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,150
I'm the Number One Top Belle.

60
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,670
And you rank second.

61
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,550
Let's parade through the streets together.

62
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,150
I was worried that you might be upset,

63
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,380
so I came to comfort you.

64
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,430
I didn't expect you to be so foolish.

65
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,150
How many worries can a fool have?

66
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,790
It's not necessary to comfort you at all.

67
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,390
Alright, alright.

68
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,710
I won't waste my precious time anymore.

69
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,070
A fool.

70
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,470
What she said makes so much sense.

71
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,610
What should we do?

72
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,750
Are all kids like that nowadays?

73
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,030
You need to tell their Boss

74
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,710
not to mistreat those two people.

75
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,190
I'm not someone to be messed with.

76
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,230
If you mistreat them, I'll...

77
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,580
What will you do?

78
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,710
You'll cry, make a scene and threaten to kill yourself.

79
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,310
It won't be that dramatic.

80
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,130
-Boss!
-Boss!

81
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,190
Let's not talk about this today.

82
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,520
Let's discuss it properly later.

83
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,590
-Okay.
-I have to go.

84
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,870
Sit down. Just sit down.

85
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,630
Come on. Let's sit down.

86
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,580
Mother, do you want to sit down?

87
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,380
You sit, you sit.

88
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,430
I still need to cook.

89
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,710
I didn't realize that.

90
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,550
I thought our Jing had made something of himself,

91
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,020
and a wife came here on her own.

92
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,230
Wife.

93
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,510
I haven't got even with you guys yet.

94
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,590
You're asking for trouble now, aren't you?

95
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:01,980
No, no, no.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,790
No, no, no.

97
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,350
What have you done?

98
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,720
I'm just kidding.

99
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,260
Let me tell you.

100
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,700
You're lucky as your boss supports you so much.

101
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,350
You should be conscientious

102
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,690
and always be grateful.

103
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,870
Madam.

104
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,190
We won't be ungrateful. Don't worry.

105
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,230
-That's right.
-We're very loyal.

106
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,570
Alright. Just have fun for now.

107
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,710
I'll go make dinner for you guys.

108
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,270
Let's have a good celebration today.

109
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,510
Good! Good! That's great!

110
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,610
Madam, I want to eat Braised Chicken Legs.

111
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,390
Okay.

112
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,460
And Fish Flavored Pork Slices.

113
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,070
Okay.

114
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,790
Who's this man coming inside?

115
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,950
Which one? Who's this?

116
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,590
Why do you always like to pat our boss?

117
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,070
Usually when I see such a beautiful woman,

118
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,150
I don't dare to pat her.

119
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,550
Today, I've met a fake one.

120
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,310
Shouldn't I take the chance to pat him?

121
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,750
You're going to get beaten again.

122
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,670
You stinky old man!

123
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,830
Which girl have you taken a fancy to again?

124
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,150
You still want to pat him?

125
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,550
Don't pat him!

126
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,190
What's wrong?

127
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:05,870
You patted him?

128
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,750
Don't pat him! How dare you do that again?

129
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,630
I'll pat you to death.

130
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,350
What are you doing?

131
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,870
He patted you, so I'm patting you, too.

132
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,790
Boss! Boss!

133
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,510
As a woman, why are you patting me just like him?

134
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,750
Show some respect for me.

135
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,000
You...

136
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,950
Is this our boss's wife?

137
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,600
She hasn't married him yet.

138
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,430
Can't you even sense that?

139
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,140
Mind your own business! I...

140
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,710
Jing's Father and Jing's Mother.

141
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,750
My name is Gan Pu. I'm Qing Cai's friend.

142
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,590
Qing Cai?

143
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,909
They don't know my name yet.

144
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,590
Alright. Guys, just have fun.

145
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,230
I'm going to cook now.

146
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,390
Okay, okay, okay.

147
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:52,350
Thank you, Ma'am.

148
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,470
I've noticed that you guys got off work quite early today.

149
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,270
That's right.

150
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,630
We sold out the food a long time ago.

151
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,950
And the girl who helped us with the ingredients last time

152
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,910
had a stomachache after she ate something,

153
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,700
so we had to help her get back home.

154
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,150
So Gao Yin came with you?

155
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,480
She even helped you guys prepare the ingredients?

156
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,350
She followed me here.

157
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,110
She always pops up out of nowhere.

158
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,380
This boy is too handsome.

159
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,150
There must be many girls who like him.

160
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,720
Don't let someone else snatch him away.

161
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,390
We are just friends.

162
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,190
He can do whatever he wants.

163
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,590
Boss.

164
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,780
We made a lot of money today, Boss.

165
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,940
Can you help us divide it?

166
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,590
We don't dare to share it if you don't take a share.

167
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:41,820
Just divide it.

168
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,070
I won't take a share.

169
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,390
I borrowed money from you guys, didn't I?

170
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,230
I'll find a way to return the money to you later.

171
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,710
That's not okay.

172
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,310
If you don't take a share, then...

173
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,550
You have to take a share of the money which we've earned.

174
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,640
-That's right.
-Yeah.

175
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,660
That's right.

176
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,230
Boss, we've learned all our skills from you.

177
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,790
That's right.

178
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,680
Okay.

179
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,110
Since we've already earned some money,

180
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,190
then we can

181
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,750
officially start our business.

182
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,650
Now we can buy some equipment

183
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,230
for setting up our stall.

184
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,510
But it's really troublesome to carry those stoves, pots,

185
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:12,790
bowls and utensils.

186
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,710
When we go out every time, we have to use a cart,

187
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,710
but it's both heavy and inconvenient.

188
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,300
-I don't know how to solve it.
-Yeah.

189
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,540
Tuan and I don't have a cart in our home.

190
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,860
Jing helped us carry those things with a cart.

191
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,190
He transported the things several times.

192
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,990
Don't worry.

193
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,030
I can

194
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,110
design a small cart for you all.

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,190
By that time, we can embed a stove

196
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,600
on it, too.

197
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,790
We also won't need to disassemble it often.

198
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,610
Then we can put all the pots, bowls, and utensils

199
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,700
in it.

200
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,870
In this way, it will be very convenient.

201
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,510
That's really good.

202
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,230
This is good. This is good.

203
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,660
This is a great idea.

204
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,490
Miss, can you make it?

205
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,510
This is roughly what it'll look like.

206
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,870
When you went to the small town today,

207
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,070
did you notice anything unusual?

208
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:01,910
Hong Hui.

209
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,780
Is your stomach still aching?

210
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,150
Gao Yin's medicine is really effective.

211
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,070
It isn't aching so badly now.

212
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,110
Your stomach is aching as you're missing your lover, right?

213
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,710
I admit that I'm deeply in love.

214
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,670
But what can I do?

215
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,230
What can you do?

216
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,000
She doesn't even like you.

217
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,470
But I like her.

218
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,320
It has nothing to do with her. Just stop it.

219
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,460
You're just consoling yourself as you can't obtain her love.

220
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,550
How come the way you are

221
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,550
talking today is different from usual?

222
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,430
It's like you're a different person.

223
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,870
Am I different?

224
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,200
You think

225
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,630
only Qing Cai can talk like this, right?

226
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,750
Indeed.

227
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,630
Liking someone

228
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,550
doesn't have much to do with that person.

229
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,270
What you said

230
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,990
seems to have a different meaning, right?

231
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,750
If it were reciprocated,

232
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,870
his feelings wouldn't be so intense.

233
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,270
What does this mean?

234
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,790
It means you're making a fool of yourself.

235
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,670
If you want to experience these intense feelings,

236
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,870
then don't try to obtain it.

237
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,670
What you said

238
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,310
shows that you're terrifying.

239
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,230
Well,

240
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,270
what should I do if I never obtain it even after a long time?

241
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,000
Emotional agony is real.

242
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,470
Suffering will make you sick.

243
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,230
For example, though you like eating chillies,

244
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,070
your stomach might ache.

245
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,070
So why do you still want to eat chillies?

246
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,240
Then what should I do?

247
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,230
Do whatever you want.

248
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,430
Anyway, no matter how many chillies I eat, my stomach won't ache.

249
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,430
But I can't get over it.

250
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,150
I like... her too much.

251
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,790
Why exactly can't you get over it?

252
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,070
Do you even know her well?

253
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,070
You always say that you like her.

254
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,590
Love originates from ignorance.

255
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,080
The doctor's words have made life tasteless.

256
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,590
Dr. Gao, let me ask you.

257
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,510
What do you think is the source of gluttony?

258
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,670
I know the answer.

259
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,230
Gluttony is innate.

260
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,670
Get out of here!

261
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,870
If you want life to be more colorful,

262
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,030
you should stay muddled.

263
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,390
You're right.

264
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,790
You should be like me.

265
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,270
Being blissfully muddled.

266
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,110
That's true wisdom.

267
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,140
That's why I envy you.

268
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,720
Did you hear that?

269
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,110
You guys should learn from me from now on.

270
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,140
Then let's stay muddled.

271
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,320
What will be written on this signboard?

272
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,870
Lover's Tears, of course.

273
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,900
Isn't "Lover's Tears" too monotonous?

274
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:05,830
Big Brother,

275
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,230
how about calling it Sweet and Sour Lover's Tears?

276
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,390
Wherever we go, we'll just sell your sweet dumplings.

277
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,720
How could those tears possibly be sweet?

278
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,470
My mother has brewed a kind of wine.

279
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,470
It really does taste like tears.

280
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,710
What kind of wine is it?

281
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,110
My mother used the method for brewing rice wine.

282
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,950
She picked some wild olives.

283
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,990
On the day she finished brewing it,

284
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,940
drunkards from miles around came to our house to drink it.

285
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,190
-Then what happened?
-Then what happened?

286
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,030
What happened in the end?

287
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,030
In the end... In the end, we barely sold two jars.

288
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:35,970
They complained that it was too bitter.

289
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,190
Is it very bitter?

290
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,550
It's not that bitter.

291
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,110
But it's very fragrant.

292
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,690
Why don't you go home and bring some of it here

293
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,780
so that we can taste it together?

294
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,710
Okay. I'll go right now.

295
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,390
-Wait for me.
-Be careful.

296
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:46,950
Be careful.

297
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,710
Be careful.

298
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,550
How is it?

299
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,700
It's very refreshing.

300
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,350
I like it, too.

301
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,540
What is this stuff?

302
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,390
How can something taste so awful?

303
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,090
I think this stuff is pretty good.

304
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,310
It looks like not everyone can appreciate it.

305
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,310
This is only fit for monsters to drink.

306
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,590
I actually think that

307
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,430
it's for people with stories to tell.

308
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,190
But if you want to say it's for monsters, that's fine, too.

309
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,350
What are you doing?

310
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,550
You're the monster!

311
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,110
Alright. Well...

312
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,480
It looks like this wine

313
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,710
goes well with what we're going to sell.

314
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,230
Now Tuan has Lover's Tears to sell, too.

315
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,510
They're all called Lover's Tears.

316
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,710
How do we tell them apart?

317
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:15,950
It's okay.

318
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,900
One can be called Lover's Tears,

319
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,790
and the other can be called Tears of Lovers.

320
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,670
You'll all be there anyway,

321
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,710
so you can explain it to the customers.

322
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,190
I think that's pretty good.

323
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,430
Lover's Tears might make people cry,

324
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,590
while Tears of Lovers

325
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,000
can let people taste the flavor of tears.

326
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,030
So after all this talk,

327
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,510
what exactly is our slogan?

328
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,150
When we're drunk and appreciating flowers, it's all about the beauty of flowers.

329
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,030
When we shed tears because of love, it's all about sorrow in our hearts.

330
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,590
That's good. Our boss is so good at composing poems.

331
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,110
Your master even taught you poetry?

332
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,150
Of course. I'm good at both literature and martial arts.

333
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,960
(Mingyi Manor)

334
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,190
Have you known Jing and the others for a long time?
(Mingyi Manor)

335
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,630
Have you known Jing and the others for a long time?

336
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,190
Jing's father is a bit odd.

337
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,670
But he's quite interesting.

338
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,830
He's not an ordinary person.

339
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,990
What do you mean?

340
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,230
He's very capable.

341
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,390
He analyzed that

342
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,110
Gao Yin might be from a prominent family.

343
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,630
There might be high-ranking officials in her family.

344
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,310
I see.

345
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,390
Then why hasn't Gao Yin exposed you?

346
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,270
I'm not sure about that, either.

347
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,310
But it definitely has nothing to do with romantic love.

348
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,110
Stop pinching me.

349
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,990
My waist is going to have calluses.

350
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,150
But when I look at Jing and his family,

351
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,280
I really envy them.

352
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,550
All the family members live together

353
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,080
and are so happy.

354
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,710
I also miss the days I spent with my father.

355
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,190
Those were happy times, too.

356
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,670
My uncle...

357
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,510
Is it fun?

358
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,069
I feel like I'm flying!

359
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,240
That's great!

360
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,430
It's fun!

361
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,310
Come on.

362
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,550
This is the life of ordinary people.

363
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,710
How many times have I told you?

364
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,540
You are not an ordinary person.

365
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,590
You are someone who has to take revenge for your family.

366
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,350
Don't be distracted by these ordinary people's emotions.

367
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,190
Do you understand?

368
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,470
You've disappointed me so much.

369
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,590
Next time,

370
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,440
don't let me see you like this again.

371
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,950
Your clan members in the netherworld

372
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,350
and your deceased parents

373
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,190
wouldn't want to see you like this, either.

374
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,270
When I was a kid,

375
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,830
I really envied those who had mothers,

376
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,470
because their mothers

377
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,910
could often take them to play on swings.

378
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,510
It's fun, isn't it?

379
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,870
I have no idea

380
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,430
what my mother even looked like.

381
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,750
I can't imagine it.

382
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,630
Let's not talk about this.

383
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,550
The good news is that we can

384
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,070
go rescue your father tonight.

385
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,990
Then let's not go back to our dwelling now

386
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,070
lest we have to find an excuse to come out later.

387
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,550
You're right.

388
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,270
So what should we do now?

389
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,790
I've been sweating from blacksmithing today.

390
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,470
How about we go take a bath?

391
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,750
The sun will be setting soon.

392
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,950
Let's go now.

393
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:08,750
Let's go.

394
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,910
Bring this small wine jar.

395
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,190
Let's go.

396
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,070
Let's go.

397
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,750
You go take a bath first.

398
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,350
I'll wait for you outside.

399
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,880
I'll guard the entrance here.

400
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,550
If a wolf comes,

401
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,070
I'll fight against it with all my strength.

402
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,510
I'm worried that you might be that wolf.

403
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,950
Can't you have a little faith in me?

404
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,070
What?

405
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,750
There are no monsters in the water, right?

406
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,990
Have you been taken away by a monster?

407
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,240
I'm coming to save you.

408
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,670
What do you want to do?

409
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,830
So there are no monsters in the water.

410
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,990
That's good.

411
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,340
I just want you to know that

412
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,940
I'm here to guard this place and accompany you.

413
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,230
Alright.

414
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,030
Then just talk to me for a while.

415
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,950
You suddenly wanted me to talk seriously.

416
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,910
I don't even know what to say.

417
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,550
You're just a monkey.

418
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,550
What's there to be serious about?

419
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,950
Then tell me

420
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,350
what your real name is.

421
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,260
My name is Wang Lvdou.

422
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,910
Wang Lentil?

423
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,940
How come it's food again?

424
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,710
It's L-V for LV, and D-O-U for DOU.

425
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,270
That's quite interesting.

426
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,670
So is Qing Cai your alias?

427
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,910
I just didn't expect that

428
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,590
you guys would call me Vegetable.

429
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,270
But I think it's quite amusing.

430
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,060
It's fine to call me Vegetable.

431
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,550
It is quite interesting indeed.

432
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,400
Who gave you this name?

433
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,750
My teacher gave this name to me.

434
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,670
He said that "Lv" means rules.

435
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,350
And "Dou" means holes.

436
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,670
When they're put together, it means "rules can be seen in small details."

437
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,550
Isn't that quite profound?

438
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,910
It is indeed quite profound.

439
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,590
It seems that your teacher is quite amazing.

440
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,550
Does it mean that

441
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,470
you're not an ordinary person either?

442
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,910
Of course I'm not ordinary.

443
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,430
I'm just a monkey that looks like a human.

444
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,950
Of course I can't be ordinary.

445
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,750
Nonsense.

446
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,640
Let's talk about something serious.

447
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,630
Your father suddenly got involved in such a big matter,

448
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,230
and the target was you.

449
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,230
Don't you think it was very strange?

450
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,990
But I'll be able to see my father tonight.

451
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,750
He'll have no reason to keep hiding things from me anymore.

452
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,110
Are you so confident that

453
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,990
you can rescue your father successfully?

454
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,110
I have confidence in you.

455
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,310
Qing Cai.

456
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,480
Actually, I've never

457
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,990
thought about romantic love before.

458
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,710
Why?

459
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,350
Because...

460
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,590
I'm someone who might die at any moment.

461
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,470
What rights do I have to talk about romantic love?

462
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,790
Actually, that day,

463
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,830
when I saw that you were ready to risk your life,

464
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,310
I already realized it.

465
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,470
But why did you accept me?

466
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,150
Because...

467
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,590
you were willing to go through thick and thin with me

468
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,950
and die with me.

469
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,350
I actually just blindly

470
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,240
followed you to do that.

471
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,470
I didn't think too much about it, either.

472
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,790
You know what?

473
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,870
You're really kind-hearted.

474
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,460
You couldn't bear to see me risk my life alone,

475
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,950
even though we were practically strangers.

476
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,110
So later I thought,

477
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,190
since neither of us cared so much about life and death,

478
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,060
why I couldn't

479
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,130
open up my heart,

480
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,350
even if it would last for just a short moment.

481
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,070
You know what?

482
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,550
Actually, even before that day,

483
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,830
I had already liked you for a long time.

484
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,150
Really?

485
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,030
But we had just met then.

486
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,790
Does it need a reason?

487
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,350
Doesn't Wang Yishao like you too?

488
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,350
You're actually very special.

489
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,670
Do you know that?

490
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,830
Aren't you a monkey?

491
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,070
How come you're so good at saying mushy things?

492
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,070
I... I'm not facing you directly.

493
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,710
I'm talking to the air right now.

494
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,750
Only in this way can I have the guts to say these things.

495
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,990
Qing Cai.

496
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,270
I... I'm almost done bathing.

497
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,390
Do you want to come and bathe?

498
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,870
I... I'm done bathing. I'll leave first.

499
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,790
I...

500
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,790
I...

501
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,510
I... I'm done bathing.

502
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,070
Just... Just go take a bath.

503
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,630
So you're done bathing?

504
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,910
Then I'll go take a bath now.

505
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,750
Gan Pu, why are you here?

506
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,110
When did you come back?

507
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,670
I've been back for quite a while.

508
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,550
I had nothing to do, so I came here to take a bath.

509
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,780
Didn't Qing Cai come with you?

510
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,110
Qing Cai said she would go hunting in the mountains.

511
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,790
She'll come here to take a bath later.

512
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,710
I'm waiting for her here.

513
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,160
You've taken a bath?

514
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,190
Why don't you join us for another bath?

515
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,830
No.

516
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,150
I bathed for quite a while just now.

517
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,750
My skin is all wrinkled. Look.

518
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,070
So you won't bathe with us?

519
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,030
Then we'll leave you alone.

520
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:51,950
Alright.

521
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,230
Let's go.

522
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,990
Come on.

523
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,270
Just go. I'll guard the entrance for you here.

524
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,590
Be careful.

525
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,470
I'm fine.

526
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,630
It feels so good, doesn't it?

527
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,230
Be careful!

528
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,910
It feels so good, doesn't it?

529
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,950
Hu Jiao!

530
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,920
Just start bathing.

531
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,710
Okay.

532
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,390
Gao Yin, come over here now!

533
00:26:59,130 --> 00:26:59,950
I'm coming.

534
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,000
We're done bathing. Let's go.

535
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,510
So you're done bathing?

536
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,150
Why are you still here?

537
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,390
How scary it is to be alone here.

538
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,550
Maybe Qing Cai has already gone back.

539
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,430
Why don't you go back with us and wait for her?

540
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,020
You're right.

541
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,350
Let's go.

542
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,150
Let's go.

543
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,140
Be careful.

544
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,190
Will you come over or not?

545
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,110
Gan Pu! I can't find my clothes!

546
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,950
Wait a moment.

547
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,000
Qing Cai, you've come so soon.

548
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,270
I just heard from Hu Jiao that you were coming to take a bath.

549
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,790
Don't come over here!

550
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:14,670
What?

551
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,030
What's wrong?

552
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,510
Don't come over here.

553
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,830
What's wrong?

554
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,430
The... The water here is dirty.

555
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,500
Don't come over here.

556
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,110
Nonsense.

557
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,160
If the water is dirty, why are you still in the water?

558
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,430
I dropped my hairpin. I'm looking for it.

559
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,750
Have you found it?

560
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,790
Not yet.

561
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,720
If you can't find it, just forget it.

562
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:46,830
Can you do me a favor?

563
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,110
What favor?

564
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,720
Help me scrub my back.

565
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,550
I'm thinking that as our relationship was so tense previously,

566
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,470
we should try to mend our relationship, right?

567
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,630
How about this? Help me scrub my back first.

568
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,550
Then I'll scrub yours.

569
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,110
The water seems quite deep here.

570
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,390
It's too dangerous.

571
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,150
Why don't we go to a shallower area?

572
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,070
No! I can't leave here.

573
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,950
Why?

574
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,960
Because I dropped my hairpin here.

575
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,320
If I leave now,

576
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,550
I won't be able to find it.

577
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,710
Hairpin?

578
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,950
I'll buy you another one.

579
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,320
No.

580
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,190
This hairpin is a memento to me.

581
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,270
I have to find it.

582
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:41,200
You're quite a sentimental person, aren't you?

583
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,590
Then I'll take a bath by myself over there.

584
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,430
That's strange. I dropped it here just now, didn't I?

585
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,270
Why can't I find it now?

586
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,480
Qing Cai!

587
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,430
I'm already used to your jumpy reaction.

588
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,950
Have you found it?

589
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,000
Not yet.

590
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,710
Let me help you look for it.

591
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,850
It's okay.

592
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,480
I can do it myself. Really.

593
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:10,230
Are you still angry with me?

594
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,670
No, I'm not.

595
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,870
Well, I'm done bathing.

596
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,790
I'll leave first.

597
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,950
Just leave first.

598
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,110
When I was looking for you just now, you didn't show up.

599
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,630
I'm not looking for you now, but you've appeared.

600
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,830
I want someone to scrub my back, too.

601
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,230
Why are you sneaking around like a ghost?

602
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,350
I think you're the real ghost here.

603
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,360
And you're a big perverted ghost.

604
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,270
If you overheard our conversation just now...

605
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,150
I didn't look at her. Nor did I want to touch her.

606
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,910
So you even wanted to look at her and touch her?

607
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,880
I didn't!

608
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,590
So you're just teasing me?

609
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,230
You're a monkey, aren't you?

610
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,550
How can I have fun if I don't tease a monkey?

611
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,750
Just... Just wait there!

612
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,790
I think Jiaoniang seems to have recovered.

613
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,710
Do you really like Wang Yishao?

614
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,460
Alright.

615
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,590
From today onwards,

616
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,300
I'll give up the idea of asking Qing Cai to chase Wang Yishao.

617
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,870
I'll support you.

618
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,110
Why did you change your mind?

619
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,510
Because I think

620
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,430
Qing Cai and Wang Yishao

621
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:02,270
aren't really interested in each other.

622
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,190
In matters of romantic love,

623
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,510
can support really be useful?

624
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,630
I can't hang in angmore.

625
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,790
I'm so tired. I'm very sleepy.

626
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,710
Jiaoniang, stop eating.

627
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,070
It's time to sleep.

628
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,110
You should go to sleep, too.

629
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,590
Let's go to sleep.

630
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,590
The formation has been set up.

631
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,150
How come you're so experienced?

632
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,390
Even the escape route is planned so thoroughly.

633
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,070
I've learned this basic skill from my uncle

634
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:40,910
since childhood.

635
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,790
If I want to take revenge,

636
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,310
I have to plan the route for the possibility of failure.

637
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,710
The possibility of failure?

638
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,030
I only need to escape if I fail.

639
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,070
Otherwise, there will be no chance for revenge.

640
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,470
What do you mean?

641
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,190
You know what I mean.

642
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,070
Then I'll go meet up with Han Aizhen.

643
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,670
Let's go then.

644
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,810
(Mingyi Manor)

645
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,990
There are eight people in the building next door.

646
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:16,990
It's unlikely that we can

647
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,480
deal with them silently.

648
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,960
We don't need to deal with them.

649
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,470
We'll probably be able to quietly

650
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,680
open the barrier and the lock.

651
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,160
Probably?

652
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,950
What if we make a noise?

653
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,070
Then we'll have to fight desperately.

654
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,590
Then we'll all be doomed.

655
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,110
Once Madam Mieqing arrives,

656
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,790
we'll all be killed.

657
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,350
It's also possible to escape.

658
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,390
We've made a backup plan for the escape route.

659
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,400
If you want to rescue him after escaping,

660
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,350
it will be very difficult.

661
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,870
There are only the few of us.

662
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,350
This is our only option.

663
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,630
We still have some people in our place.

664
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,960
Let's ask them to come here.

665
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,550
I don't trust you guys.

666
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,390
I also don't know who you guys are.

667
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,230
You probably don't fully trust us either, do you?

668
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,600
Treating this as a trap

669
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,550
is also possible.

670
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,670
Alright. Let's take action.

671
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,230
We'll do the work while you should stay alert to the enemy.

672
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,469
Wait.

673
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,389
If you also go inside,

674
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,310
who will guard the entrance?

675
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:55,750
You two.

676
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,510
What if there are barriers inside?

677
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,630
I don't trust you two.

678
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:02,990
I don't trust you, either.

679
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,230
Both of you can go inside, and I'll stay here.

680
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,670
If anything goes wrong, you'll have to take full responsibility.

681
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,830
-Father!
-Father!

682
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,440
It's you?

683
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,070
How come you're here?

684
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,190
Has the general conquered this place?

685
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,110
Both of you are wearing masks.

686
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,630
Did you sneak in here?

687
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,270
This is not good.

688
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,750
I didn't tell you the truth before,

689
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,950
because I wanted to protect you.

690
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,350
You are the son of the former Emperor.

691
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,670
You are the heir to the throne.

692
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,310
Father!

693
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,870
Your uncle is only the acting Emperor now.

694
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,510
You and your uncle didn't get along,

695
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,470
so the general asked me to bring you out.

696
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,710
You... You are the heir to the throne.

697
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,430
You can't do this.

698
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,470
You two need to leave now!

699
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,240
This is my own daughter.

700
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,840
You have to take good care of her for me.

701
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:15,870
Aizhen.

702
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,830
Also,

703
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,870
I've always treated him like my own son.

704
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,830
You have to take good care of him.

705
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,910
Leave now! Leave at once!

706
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,950
How can I leave?

707
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,430
Even if I might be killed,

708
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,670
I'll still take you to leave with me.

709
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,230
Leave now! You'll ruin the big plan if you stay.

710
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:33,870
Father!

711
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,390
There are traps here. You need to leave now!

712
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:37,990
Father!

713
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,830
Oh, no! There's a trigger mechanism under him.

714
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,510
This is a trap. We must leave now!

715
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,600
If we don't leave now, it'll be too late.

716
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,140
Hurry!

717
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,870
Go back and report it to the general. Then come back to save me.

718
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,710
Leave now!

719
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,840
Just go!

720
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,670
-Our father won't die if you're alive.
-Go!

721
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,590
Let's leave now.

722
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,940
There's a formation over there. Let's go that way.

723
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:24,440
Yes!

724
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,030
Yes!

725
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,310
What place did you lure them to?

726
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,470
The direction of the main formation.

727
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,150
Your tactic of diverting their attention is really impressive.

728
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,840
I never thought that we'd turn out to be a family.

729
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,870
She's here to help me.

730
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,190
But we have different purposes.

731
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,870
So her purpose is...

732
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,230
I want to kill Madam Mieqing.

733
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,720
Then we're still a family.

734
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,230
Gan Pu knows how to set up formations.

735
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,390
It's too dangerous here.

736
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,870
Come back to the royal city with us.

737
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,830
I haven't been exposed yet. You two can go back first.

738
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,310
I haven't completed my mission yet.

739
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,310
Alright.

740
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:00,950
We'll leave first.

741
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,550
After you go back, inherit the throne.

742
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,950
Then come back to save our father.

743
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,630
If I inherit the throne,

744
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,270
will our father still be safe?

745
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,430
But no matter what,

746
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:14,590
I still need to report your situation to the general.

747
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,430
If you report my situation to the general,

748
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,750
what will the general do?

749
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,390
He'll dispatch troops to besiege Mingyi Manor.

750
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,710
If he bypasses the kingdom and dispatches troops privately,

751
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,920
it'll be treason, won't it?

752
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,710
No matter what we do,

753
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,790
our father will still be killed by that time.

754
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,470
Qing Cai.

755
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,310
I can't let my personal matters interfere with the big plan.

756
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,550
This is my personal matter, too.

757
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,390
I won't sacrifice my father's life

758
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,590
for my own safety.

759
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,660
The general has death warriors.

760
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,150
Can the death warriors outnumber Mingyi Manor's people?

761
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,510
No matter what,

762
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,430
I can't abandon my father's life.

763
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,070
No matter who I am,

764
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,510
I don't think my life

765
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,750
is more important than my father's life.

766
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,390
Have you made a decision?

767
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,190
They'll break through the barrier soon.

768
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,470
We need to get out of here as soon as possible.

769
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,390
Let's go back to our dwelling.

770
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:06,910
Let's go.

771
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,550
He's still here.

772
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,150
It's the same as last time.

773
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,790
It's the Mo Clan's technique.

774
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,470
Go check the place where those several people are living.

775
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,310
-Yes.
-Yes.

776
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,590
Let's go.

777
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,110
Who is it?

778
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,150
Are you crazy?

779
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,870
Stop knocking!

780
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,070
Stop knocking.

781
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,910
Stop knocking!

782
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,750
Why are you still up so late? Stop knocking!

783
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,030
Who is it?

784
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,400
Everyone, wake up.

785
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,070
Who wasn't here just now?

786
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,960
We're all here. Can't you see?

787
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,300
When did you go to sleep? Did you all sleep together?

788
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,430
Of course we slept together.

789
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,320
That's not right.

790
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,390
I'm not fully awake. I don't know.

791
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,430
Check it yourself.

792
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,880
I went to bed quite early. I've slept for about an hour.

793
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,830
I went to bed early.

794
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,510
I'm always the first one to sleep every day.

795
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,120
These people must be crazy.

796
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,830
They didn't even let us sleep in peace.

797
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,110
We tortured and interrogated that person again.

798
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,350
He refused to talk.

799
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,580
Who do you think would come to rescue that person?

800
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,990
Logically speaking, the general's people would come to save him.

801
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,550
But how come someone knows

802
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,230
how to set up the Mo Clan's profound formations?

803
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,710
Is it that profound?

804
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:04,910
It was set up temporarily.

805
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,910
But it was quite impressive that it could trap seven

806
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:07,870
or eight people for a while.

807
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,230
Could it be that there are still some secret manuals from the Mo Clan circulating?

808
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,790
That set of ancestral secret manuals was taken away by Yinniang.

809
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,190
Only someone from the original high-ranking circle

810
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,230
could have access to such core content.

811
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,070
What's more, without a teacher,

812
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:22,710
it's impossible to use it so skillfully.

813
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,450
At least, though I learned it from the ancient books,

814
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,670
I couldn't reach that level.

815
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,030
So it means that

816
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,440
there are other survivors from the Mo Clan?

817
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,020
Then how did they end up

818
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,260
colluding with the general's people?

819
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,270
They might not be the general's people.

820
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,740
If the general's people had known how to set up formations,

821
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,590
they wouldn't have sent just a few people.

822
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,690
And they certainly would have saved that person out of here.

823
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,630
They wouldn't have left him alone in this place.

824
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,950
Then they must be the Emperor's people.

825
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,710
So why didn't the Emperor directly ask us for the person?

826
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,510
What was the point of coming here to gather information?

827
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,150
Does he think that we have ulterior motives?

828
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,310
The Emperor doesn't dare to ask us for the person.

829
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,830
He can't interfere in this matter.

830
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,230
After all, it's directly opposing the general.

831
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,890
The Emperor could have asked someone to interrogate us.

832
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,190
But there hasn't been any movement at all.

833
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,440
Perhaps it's a sensitive period right now.

834
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,390
He's afraid of exposure.

835
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,950
So he simply sent a few people to sneak into our place.

836
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,880
Among our trial disciples, there are the Emperor's people.

837
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,870
Unless these several factions have united together...

838
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:16,790
Is it possible?

839
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,470
It's impossible.

840
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,070
A few days ago, there was a rumor that

841
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:23,310
our Mingyi Manor mistreated the trial disciples.

842
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,630
It means

843
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,270
that person is still near us.

844
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,750
So it was those hooligans who spread the news?

845
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,510
According to our investigation,

846
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,070
it was very likely that those hooligans did it.

847
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,690
Moreover, we investigated the families of those hooligans.

848
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,360
They're all from ordinary families.

849
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,950
Most of them were just used by others.

850
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:45,390
Could it be that this person was here to rescue his father?

851
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,230
We originally suspected that this person

852
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,400
had entered Mingyi Manor.

853
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,790
Now it looks like

854
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,830
that person has really entered Mingyi Manor.

855
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:53,710
And he's just near us.

856
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,550
Maybe certain things happened to that person,

857
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,070
so he took action by himself.

858
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,660
He was going to rescue someone today.

859
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,590
But due to lack of manpower,

860
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,710
the rescue failed.

861
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,270
This speculation is quite reasonable.

862
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,430
Since that person might still be in contact with the hooligans,

863
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:15,830
this might be a breakthrough point.

864
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,390
I'll ask someone to keep an eye on them.

865
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,910
I'll also try to make contact with these people later.

866
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,950
Don't just focus on your Wang Yishao.

867
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,230
Your son has come to rescue you.

868
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:11,990
You must be very happy.

869
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,230
Can you tell me what his identity is?

870
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,390
He's not your biological son, is he?

871
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,270
You're a death warrior.

872
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,230
I thought you were just a liaison.

873
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,990
I didn't expect that

874
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,870
your son would be such an important figure.

875
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:29,950
You've really misled me.

876
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,550
You're still laughing?

877
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,060
You're a death warrior,

878
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,670
and you also have a blood feud with us.

879
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,670
You should be grateful that you're still alive.

880
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:41,220
If you tell me that

881
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,590
he's a very important person,

882
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:46,550
perhaps we can spare his life.

883
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,230
Your operation has failed and been exposed this time.

884
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,870
It's very likely that there's a traitor among your death warriors.

885
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,500
So the general

886
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,950
surely won't reveal your son's true identity.

887
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,030
Therefore, your son couldn't trust anyone else.

888
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,390
Because of that, he had to take action alone.

889
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,220
Do you think he has a chance of success

890
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,670
under our surveillance?

891
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:16,190
Of course,

892
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,190
if he's not important,

893
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:20,030
weapons will be used indiscriminately.

894
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,910
If he is killed,

895
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:23,670
don't blame us.
