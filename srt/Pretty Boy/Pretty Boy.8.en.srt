1
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,600
(Pretty Boy)

2
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,590
(Episode 8)

3
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,030
Of course,

4
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,030
if he's not important,

5
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,870
don't blame us

6
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,750
if he's killed

7
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,510
by accident.

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,110
If

9
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,350
I tell you

10
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,270
he's the son of the late emperor,

11
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,440
will he be of any use to you?

12
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,870
How is that possible?

13
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,829
Why would they let

14
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,790
the son of the late emperor stay so close to the royal city?

15
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,910
Stop talking nonsense.

16
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,910
Don't tell me you think

17
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,870
the most dangerous place

18
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,230
is the safest place.

19
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:56,670
You let such an important person

20
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,050
stay at such a dangerous place.

21
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,510
You're too bold.

22
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,070
What if

23
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,830
it was Mr. Shang Shan's request?

24
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,990
What?

25
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,990
How could this

26
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,830
have anything to do with Mr. Shang Shan?

27
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,190
You're talking nonsense.

28
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,440
Why would Mr. Shang Shan

29
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,030
help that cruel emperor?

30
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,430
The late empress

31
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,310
was Mr. Shang Shan's only female disciple.

32
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,270
If the late empress

33
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,990
hadn't died in childbirth,

34
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,230
I guess

35
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,800
we wouldn't have become enemies.

36
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,030
Then why does your son know members of the Mo Clan?

37
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,870
Go find someone to save him now and treat him well.

38
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,110
What he said is a bit far-fetched.

39
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,340
Should we just believe it?

40
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,920
Better safe than sorry.

41
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,390
Okay.

42
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,470
I'll go make arrangements now.

43
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,950
What you did to him was too heavy-handed.

44
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,350
We didn't know.

45
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,029
We didn't plan to let him live originally.

46
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,790
He killed many of our people, right?

47
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,830
Life's twists and turns

48
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,790
are beyond words.

49
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,750
I'm very curious.

50
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,390
When you went in to save your father just now,

51
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,550
how come you weren't worried there would be a barrier inside?

52
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,230
I saw you breaking the barrier together.

53
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,080
I thought you could do that too.

54
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,670
I was worried you wanted to get rid of me

55
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,790
and had other plans.

56
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,350
I just gave her a hand.

57
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,350
I guess we still don't trust each other enough.

58
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,550
Do you have a plan?

59
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,830
If I don't report this,

60
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,750
I really don't know what to do.

61
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,200
Were you sent by General Han?

62
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,430
Yes.

63
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,790
I'm just one of the people he sent.

64
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,710
Because we didn't know if Mingyi Manor did it

65
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,190
or if my father was still alive.

66
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,870
Why did you suspect Mingyi Manor?

67
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,710
Mingyi Manor is our sworn enemy.

68
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,550
As for the reason,

69
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,350
I don't know either.

70
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,870
Father might know.

71
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,860
A rumor in the Martial Arts World

72
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,450
says that Mingyi Manor

73
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,020
has colluded with the current emperor.

74
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,350
Is that the information you received?

75
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,430
I think Mingyi Manor and Wang Quan

76
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,510
have a relationship of mutual exploitation.

77
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,990
In recent years,

78
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,310
their relationship has become increasingly strained.

79
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,909
That's the same as what Mr. Shang Shan said.

80
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,230
But do you think Mingyi Manor knows

81
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,190
the person they're looking for is the son of the late emperor?

82
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,710
It's hard to say.

83
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,510
Mingyi Manor...

84
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,240
If the relationship between Mingyi Manor and Wang Quan

85
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,470
isn't that good,

86
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,270
I don't think Wang Quan would tell the truth.

87
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,630
Maybe he just wanted to use the hostility

88
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,030
between Mingyi Manor and us

89
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,750
to lure Mingyi Manor to take action.

90
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,430
If Mingyi Manor

91
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,990
knows the identity of the person they're looking for,

92
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,430
what do you think they'll do?

93
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,390
They'll use this person to make a deal with Wang Quan.

94
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,710
They might take you as a hostage.

95
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,710
This move is too dangerous.

96
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,670
But what else can we do now?

97
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,390
I don't know why

98
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,630
I always feel Madam Mieqing

99
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,280
is not like what the rumor

100
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,270
in the Martial Arts World says.

101
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,110
She looks very fierce.

102
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,390
You can't judge a book by its cover.

103
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,670
I grew a beard before

104
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,390
and looked very fierce too.

105
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,470
Should we continue to test Mingyi Manor?

106
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,270
Tomorrow, you directly tell the news to Madam Mieqing.

107
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,590
You can't address her like that face to face.

108
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,790
Yinniang.

109
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,110
They all call her Yinniang.

110
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,790
Okay.

111
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,990
You don't need to say anything else.

112
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,430
Yinniang dare not do anything to you.

113
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,110
After that, we'll see how they react

114
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,230
and then come up with a strategy.

115
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,670
Well... I should get going.

116
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,510
Wait... a sec.

117
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,550
You and Gan Pu knew each other before?

118
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,150
No.

119
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,270
We knew each other after coming to Mingyi Manor.

120
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,350
So you've only known each other for a few days.

121
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,430
That means

122
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,710
you met her and me at the same time.

123
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,390
That's right.

124
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,150
What's wrong?

125
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,640
You two trust each other so much.

126
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,470
I thought you had known each other for a long time.

127
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,670
It was a coincidence, I guess.

128
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,950
I met her when I was investigating

129
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:09,950
Mingyi Manor before.

130
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,070
Come to think of it, I'm quite unlucky.

131
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,510
You two became friends as soon as you met,

132
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,630
but we became enemies

133
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,560
and even hurt each other.

134
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,260
That couldn't be helped.

135
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,150
But luckily,

136
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,710
no major damage has been caused.

137
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,110
Then from today onwards,

138
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,750
I'll protect you closely.

139
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,549
Closely?

140
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,190
My father asked me to do that.

141
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,870
Is it hard for you to disguise yourself as a girl?

142
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,230
I noticed you're always disorganized.

143
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,030
I thought that was how you are.

144
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,350
I didn't expect that it's because...

145
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,190
What's wrong?

146
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,510
Does Gan Pu know that too?

147
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,150
When we acted together before,

148
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,270
she found out too.

149
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,830
Who else knows?

150
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,830
Gao Yin.

151
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,190
So I'm the biggest fool in the world.

152
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,230
Well...

153
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,070
does Hu Jiao know?

154
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,190
She doesn't know.

155
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,070
Then I'm the second biggest fool in the world.

156
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,710
It can't be helped.

157
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,910
I've been practicing martial arts since I was a kid.

158
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,630
I haven't had much contact with the outside world.

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,910
I'm still not very observant.

160
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,070
It's okay.

161
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,630
I think your personality is quite good.

162
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,550
And if you ever need to disguise yourself as a man,

163
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,430
I think you're quite suitable.

164
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,030
No way.

165
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,150
I don't want to be with a bunch of men every day.

166
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,430
They're dirty and smelly.

167
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,280
But your situation is different.

168
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,030
You must be happy.

169
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,070
You sleep with us every day.

170
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,950
You even showered with us!

171
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,480
I have never peeked

172
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,470
at any of you.

173
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,550
I...

174
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,190
Fortunately, that day,

175
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,110
I didn't let you scrub my back.

176
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,110
Otherwise, it would have been so embarrassing.

177
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,990
That was because I made many excuses.

178
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,590
But... it doesn't matter.

179
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,430
Father has already entrusted me to you.

180
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,870
You can do whatever you want.

181
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,710
What does that mean?

182
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,840
You... don't want me?

183
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,310
I...

184
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,070
Then I'll become an orphan.

185
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,470
No, I still have Father.

186
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,030
I'm sorry, Father.

187
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,950
I'm not an orphan.

188
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:32,950
No.

189
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,150
Then... Anyway, it's not okay.

190
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,470
What... What orphan?

191
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,070
No one saw you?

192
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,710
They broke into the prison but failed to rescue him.

193
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,670
I followed them for a while.

194
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,150
I found a formation on their escape route.

195
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,430
So I didn't dare to pursue them.

196
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,430
I was worried it might cause misunderstanding.

197
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,980
That's it?

198
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,390
When Mingyi Manor was alerted last time,

199
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,270
it was also because of a formation, right?

200
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,070
Formation?

201
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,590
Such a temporary formation can trap people?

202
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,070
Is she really a member of the Mo Clan?

203
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,590
The Mo Clan has been eliminated by Mingyi Manor, right?

204
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,310
Advanced formations have long been lost.

205
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,440
Then where did Mingyi Manor get

206
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,870
the mountain-protecting formation?

207
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,110
Did Mingyi Manor already get it before?

208
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,430
No.

209
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,990
Wang Guo wanted to besiege Mingyi Manor, right?

210
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,630
What happened to that?

211
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,590
The former emperor died suddenly.

212
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,190
There's also another theory.

213
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,550
Someone in the royal city pled for Mingyi Manor.

214
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,710
The emperor issued a secret decree.

215
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,870
So Wang Guo didn't dare to send troops.

216
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,870
What's wrong with these mosquitos?

217
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,470
They're only biting me.

218
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,060
Isn't this prisoner a death warrior of General?

219
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,230
How did they know the Mo Clan's members?

220
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,350
Yinniang is also a member of the Mo Clan.

221
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,390
Yinniang went to the prison before.

222
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,310
The doctor went there too.

223
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,070
They even took many daily necessities there.

224
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,270
That's strange.

225
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,110
What does that mean?

226
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,630
That means... this person... is of some use, I guess.

227
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,990
Looks like the person my father wants me to find

228
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,060
is not ordinary.

229
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,190
He has attracted so much attention from Mingyi Manor.

230
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,070
Find an opportunity

231
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,290
to investigate this person again and find out his identity.

232
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,030
Your father and your brother...

233
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,250
didn't tell you...

234
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,830
who you need to find?

235
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,190
So itchy!

236
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,910
The answer seems quite clear now.

237
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,150
So who is that person?

238
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,870
I'd better keep you in suspense before it's confirmed.

239
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,630
What if my guess is wrong?

240
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,390
Aizhen.

241
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,390
I'm really sorry... for what happened before.

242
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,960
I hope you can forgive me.

243
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,590
It's okay.

244
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,790
I know you're straightforward.

245
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,790
Let bygones be bygones.

246
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,510
Thank you.

247
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,030
I should also thank you

248
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,310
for taking good care of Qing Cai.

249
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,390
She is my daughter.

250
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,030
You must take good care of her for me.

251
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,110
Why don't we go inside?

252
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,150
It's chilly out here.

253
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,470
Okay.

254
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:07,900
Let's go.

255
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,080
Let's go.

256
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,230
You're still practicing dance moves at this hour?

257
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,550
He's dancing to attract mosquitos.

258
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,350
I'm dancing to attract mosquitos,

259
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,590
so that they won't bite you guys.

260
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,310
That's quite practical.

261
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,870
Go dance in front of my door later.

262
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,420
Why are the mouths

263
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,870
of these mosquitos so long?

264
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,280
They can even bite through a few layers of clothes!

265
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,590
Mingyi Manor is quite lively tonight.

266
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,270
Someone broke into the prison, but they escaped.

267
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,590
Who are those people?

268
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,790
I still don't know. We're investigating.

269
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,390
What can we do?

270
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,390
What I want to confirm with you is

271
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,220
they are not your people.

272
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,280
I only know it has nothing to do with me.

273
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,590
As for the others,

274
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,990
it's hard to say.

275
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,070
I've checked the rooms.

276
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,990
Your people were all sleeping.

277
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,980
I don't think it has anything to do with those disciples.

278
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,230
Who can break the formation and enter Mingyi Manor?

279
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,430
That shouldn't be anyone ordinary.

280
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,470
Theoretically,

281
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,670
only the Mo Clan's members can enter.

282
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,830
The Mo Clan isn't the only sect in the world that knows formations, right?

283
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,990
But Mingyi Manor's formation is not an ordinary one.

284
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,790
Gan Pu.

285
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,070
Can you switch beds with me?

286
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,110
Sure.

287
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,800
Those trial disciples

288
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,590
all tested the temporary barrier.

289
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,870
What's your opinion?

290
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,470
Gao Yin and Hu Jiao only tested it a bit.

291
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,510
Qing Cai,

292
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,310
Gan Pu,

293
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:16,910
and Han Aizhen

294
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,030
made frequent moves.

295
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,350
I guess the fightback of these three people

296
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,240
was not a sympathy ploy.

297
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,710
No one would risk his life for a sympathy ploy, right?

298
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,910
But among your people,

299
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,870
it's easy to see through Hu Jiao.

300
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,310
Gao Yin...

301
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,310
is a bit mysterious.

302
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,830
Her father and General are sworn enemies.

303
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,110
It's a conflict between two great families.

304
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,670
Her stance is definitely not an issue.

305
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,470
I agree with that.

306
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,020
She's not an ordinary person.

307
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,430
She has her own considerations.

308
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,870
She was directly entrusted by my father.

309
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,750
I'm just a figurehead.

310
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,630
You're actually here to help your brother, aren't you?

311
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,790
It seems Mingyi Manor's spies

312
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,720
have infiltrated the kingdom's inner circle.

313
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,710
I'm just a figurehead on my brother's side too.

314
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,790
The real liaison is Hu Jiao.

315
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,630
She's his trusted subordinate.

316
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,510
Hu Jiao is brainless.

317
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,829
I guess you were sent here to help her.

318
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,710
That is just an excuse.

319
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,470
I guess the real purpose is to supply medicine.

320
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,470
Actually, I've always been curious.

321
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,870
Do you really dislike power? Or is it just a facade?

322
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,760
What do you think?

323
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,230
Considering your intelligence and ability, I don't know.

324
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,470
Success or failure, right or wrong, all turn out in vain.

325
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,670
Only green mountains still remain

326
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,950
to see the setting sun's departing ray.

327
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,990
How many things before and after

328
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,030
all melt into gossip and laughter?

329
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,830
Your eyes are pure and clear.

330
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,220
Actually, you're quite suitable for being an emperor.

331
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,430
Given my thoughts,

332
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,270
why would I want to endure that kind of hardship?

333
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,270
Now the mosquitos can't catch up with me.

334
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,470
Can you not be so impatient?

335
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,800
Both of you seem to have a connection with Qing Cai.

336
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,710
Affectionate men have always been the most romantic.

337
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,550
We are the same type.

338
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,630
That person was tortured too severely.

339
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,110
I'm afraid he's about to die.

340
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,830
Our people can't cure him?

341
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,630
Young Master Wang,

342
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,430
that prisoner is dying.

343
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,910
We need help from the miracle-working doctor's disciple.

344
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,990
Is she really as skilled as they say?

345
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,150
You can give it a try.

346
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,670
Let's go.

347
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,710
Don't turn your back on me.

348
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,590
Gao Yin,

349
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:00,970
sorry to bother you.

350
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,410
Someone is dying.

351
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,580
We want you to save him.

352
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,370
Let's go.

353
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,970
Could that person... be my father?

354
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,660
It's very likely.

355
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,050
It can't be.

356
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,610
Last time I saw him...

357
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,580
he was fine.

358
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,540
It can't be. It can't be.

359
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,660
I thought you didn't care whether he was alive or dead.

360
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,300
He might be useful if he stays alive.

361
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,140
How did you know he's also a death warrior of theirs?

362
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,180
All of General's underground forces are death warriors.

363
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,820
We really should thank your father for providing the information.

364
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,930
I didn't know the inside story at all.

365
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,340
He wants to use us, but he also wants to hide things from us.

366
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,420
I'm not driving a wedge. It's the truth.

367
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,940
He has capable subordinates, but he doesn't want to use them.

368
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,260
How can an emperor like this govern a country?

369
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,300
Your brother too.

370
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,180
One shouldn't meddle in affairs beyond one's position.

371
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,700
She saved my life.

372
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,180
I respect her very much.

373
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,900
You... don't respect Gan Pu?

374
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,060
Indeed, affectionate men are the most romantic.

375
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,020
You and Hong Hui really are the same type.

376
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,540
Thank you. I'm going back.

377
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,470
Don't worry. He's fine now.

378
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,580
And they've sent someone to specially take care of him.

379
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,380
You can rest assured now.

380
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,420
Thank you.

381
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,140
I owe you two lives.

382
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,180
I am a doctor.

383
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,860
It's my duty.

384
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,940
You all are still up?

385
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,700
I can't sleep.

386
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,340
I'm going to bed first.

387
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,580
I was woken up twice tonight.

388
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,420
Thank you.

389
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,820
Gan Pu,

390
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,620
if it weren't for you today,

391
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,270
I wouldn't have seen my father.

392
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,990
I've been worried.

393
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:46,870
It's okay.

394
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,340
What a coincidence.

395
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,350
You all are still up tonight.

396
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,820
Qing Cai,

397
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,740
why don't we take a walk?

398
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,020
Your operation tonight failed?

399
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,420
What makes you think

400
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,780
I was involved?

401
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,240
Don't you think it's too ridiculous?

402
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,980
You're a member of the Mo Clan?

403
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,000
Looks like you already have evidence.

404
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,980
If you are,

405
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,090
you helped your enemy.

406
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,950
What do you mean?

407
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,180
I don't like fights,

408
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,910
but since I'm already involved,

409
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,900
it's a matter of life and death.

410
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,710
So you need to understand

411
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,030
when it's time to act,

412
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,980
you have to act even if you

413
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,590
don't want to.

414
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,910
What makes you think I'm a member of the Mo Clan?

415
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,900
You, Gan Pu, Han Aizhen, and Hu Jiao

416
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,310
went together to Mingyi Manor's formation.

417
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,590
After that, you disappeared.

418
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,140
He misunderstood.

419
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,140
He thinks I broke through the formation on my own.

420
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,620
You guys broke into the prison together.

421
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,720
Then you broke the barrier.

422
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,070
Maybe there are other powerful martial artists following us.

423
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,940
Then why didn't you report us to Mingyi Manor?

424
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,780
I alerted Mingyi Manor.

425
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,390
That's all.

426
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,790
Why?

427
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,790
I need to show goodwill towards them,

428
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,180
but I can't completely side with them.

429
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,470
Everything here

430
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,830
is a scheme.

431
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,540
So you're just a pawn too.

432
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,820
So,

433
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,100
I just need to play the role of a pawn.

434
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,510
I'm telling you this

435
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,830
because I don't want you to be used by others

436
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,180
in this mess

437
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,060
or die without knowing why.

438
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,140
Besides, we are natural allies.

439
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,800
Gan Pu is his natural ally?

440
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,510
Then she's my enemy.

441
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,590
Then what's the deal with Gan Pu and Mingyi Manor?

442
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,410
(Mingyi Manor)

443
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,270
What happened?

444
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,630
What did Wang Yishao talk to you about?

445
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,830
Have you got any news?

446
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,430
Nothing.

447
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,190
That's good then.

448
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,790
It's a bit stuffy in the room.

449
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,830
I want to go out for a walk.

450
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,020
Let me accompany you.

451
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,230
It's late. Why don't we all go together?

452
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,000
No need. I won't go far.

453
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,470
I'll just take a walk around.

454
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,030
I want to be alone for a while.

455
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,550
Then be careful.

456
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,260
According to what Gao Yin said,

457
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,540
Father seems to be on the same page as us.

458
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,350
I think so.

459
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,310
Father revealed my identity.

460
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,660
Plus what Wang Yishao just said,

461
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,720
it seems the parties are in a game of rivalry.

462
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,510
Mingyi Manor has its own thoughts.

463
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,070
I'm still worried about her.

464
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,140
I'm going to follow her.

465
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,670
Okay.

Enemies?

507
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,740
You heard that from Wang Yishao?

508
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,830
Is it reliable?

509
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,220
Wang Yishao thinks I'm a member of the Mo Clan.

510
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,990
Where did he get the information?

511
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,750
Wang Yishao confused the identities

512
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,550
of me and Gan Pu.

513
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,430
Even so,

514
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,950
how could we be enemies of the Mo Clan?

515
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,030
I don't know anything about this.

516
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,310
All I know is

517
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,510
Wang Yishao is definitely our opponent.

518
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,590
Even though he's an opponent,

519
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,350
I still believe what he said very much.

520
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,530
He's the type who prefers open strategies

521
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,830
rather than underhanded schemes.

522
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,030
This type of person makes a great friend.

523
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,180
What a pity.

524
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,590
Whether we are friends

525
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,630
or enemies,

526
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,560
it's a lucky thing.

527
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,350
Because at least

528
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,830
the game will be played openly.

529
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,750
That's good then.

530
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,790
But...

531
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,470
how was Wang Yishao misled?

532
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,750
Hu Jiao.

533
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,150
Then stamp your foot and spin around.

534
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,110
The key is the footwork.

535
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,110
You need to take a few steps to the right,

536
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,710
then ten steps to the left.

537
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,390
Shake your head twice.

538
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,830
That's not right.

539
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,310
When we broke the barrier,

540
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,520
Hu Jiao was still sleeping.

541
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,430
When I returned to the room that day,

542
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,790
I checked Hu Jiao and Gao Yin's breathing while they were sleeping.

543
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,310
Given Hu Jiao's strength,

544
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,430
if she followed us,

545
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,950
she would have been panting heavily.

546
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,230
So it was someone more powerful.

547
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,630
And this person is very good at hiding.

548
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,490
We actually didn't notice him at all.

549
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,870
I think so too.

550
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,740
Wang Yishao knows a lot

551
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,120
about our movements in Mingyi Manor.

552
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,350
Hu Jiao is just a smokescreen

553
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,750
to mislead us.

554
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,300
I just don't know if that person

555
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,750
followed us to the town.

556
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,030
You won't tell Wang Yishao

557
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,450
you're not a member of the Mo Clan, will you?

558
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,750
I'm not that pedantic.

559
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,280
I didn't intentionally mislead him either.

560
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,580
He misread the situation himself.

561
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,710
It has nothing to do with us.

562
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,710
That's good then.

563
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,110
The ground is wet.

564
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,470
It must have rained in the mountain just now.

565
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,800
Gan Pu is alone, and she doesn't know martial arts.

566
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:32,880
It's very dangerous.

567
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,590
Qing Cai!

568
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,070
-Gan Pu!
-Qing Cai.

569
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,670
Qing Cai!

570
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,600
Gan Pu.

571
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,110
Qing Cai.

572
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,890
-Gan Pu!
-Gan Pu!

573
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:55,370
Qing Cai.

574
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,400
Gan Pu!

575
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,710
Gan Pu!

576
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,140
Gan Pu!

577
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,990
Where are you?

578
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,470
Gan Pu, where are you?

579
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,880
-Qing Cai.
-Gan Pu!

580
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,070
Gan Pu!

581
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,670
Gan Pu!

582
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,909
Gan Pu!

583
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,920
Gan Pu!

584
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,719
Gan Pu!

585
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,679
Gan Pu!

586
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,380
Come on!

587
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,750
Grab my hand!

588
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:29,350
Gan Pu!

589
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,550
Gao Yin.

590
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,949
Gan Pu, what happened to you?

591
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:49,429
Take a look at her and see how she is.

592
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,230
What happened to you? Who hit you?

593
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,240
Who would hit me?

594
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,910
I accidentally fell.

595
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,670
People who get beaten often claim

596
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,350
they simply fell.

597
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:09,830
Did you hit her?

598
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,190
Gan Pu is so well-behaved. Why did you hit her?

599
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,280
It's nothing. It's just a scratch.

600
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,070
Did you fall down the mountain?

601
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,150
Yes, the ground was too slippery.

602
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,600
You hit her so hard that she fell down the mountain.

603
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,950
I'll teach you a lesson tonight.

604
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,430
Alright.

605
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,110
It really has nothing to do with them.

606
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,920
I was careless when I was walking.

607
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,200
I accidentally fell down the mountain.

608
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,710
They went there to rescue me.

609
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:33,790
I see.

610
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,430
I shouldn't have hit you.

611
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,120
It's almost dawn.

612
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,710
I don't want to argue with you anymore.

613
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,750
I need to sleep.

614
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,200
Gan Pu,

615
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,480
apply this to your face at night.

616
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,040
It can help your wound heal.

617
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,800
Okay.

618
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,640
Just sleep.

619
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,480
You seem to care a lot about Gan Pu.

620
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,750
During this period,

621
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,560
I've grown accustomed to her presence.

622
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,480
Have you fallen in love with her?

623
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,560
The problem is

624
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,240
it's very likely that we are her enemies.

625
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,150
I'm telling you this

626
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,240
because I don't want you to be used by others

627
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,670
in this mess

628
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,510
or die without knowing why.

629
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:06,510
Besides, we are natural allies.

630
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,650
Yinniang has been practicing a lot lately.

631
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,120
She's troubled.

632
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,080
Have you been slacking off recently?

633
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,480
I'm troubled too.

634
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,520
It's still early, and you're already sleepy?

635
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,000
I'm sleepy every day.

636
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,740
I guess that fragile wrestler

637
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,070
has already left.

638
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,720
We've already started to have indoor classes.

639
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,320
When will he come?

640
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,910
He'll be here soon.

641
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,120
Why hasn't he come yet?

642
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,710
Today, we'll start a new course.

643
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,880
Let's welcome your instructor, Hong Hui.

644
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,240
-So handsome!
-He's here.

645
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,510
You guys, be quiet.

646
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,480
If you continue to make noise, I won't let you in.

647
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:43,560
Now, let's welcome Hong Hui, who's going to give a lecture.

648
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,920
Today, I'll teach you the invisibility technique.

649
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,200
The invisibility technique? Then why are you dressing like this?

650
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,370
Are you worried others won't know what you look like?

651
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,270
The most important part of the invisibility technique is makeup.

652
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,060
What I'm going to teach you today is

653
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,680
makeup and costumes.

654
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,880
Let's take a look at these masks.

655
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,690
Now, let's talk about

656
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,510
the characteristics these masks represent

657
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,800
and the personalities they portray.

658
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,390
Hu Jiao. Hu Jiao.

659
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,360
Hu Jiao.

660
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,240
Wake up.

661
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,640
She's such a sleepyhead.

662
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,480
She's really unique.

663
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,360
Why... is she so sleepy?

664
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,000
We were woken up three times last night.

665
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,070
She enjoys sleeping more than anyone else.

666
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,280
So it had the biggest impact on her.

667
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,730
Luckily, I held back my strength!

668
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,080
Otherwise, I would have punched you to death!

669
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,830
Who asked you to pretend to be a ghost and scare people?

670
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,440
Is he alright?

671
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,120
It's nothing serious.

672
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,810
Fortunately, it's just a scratch on his nose.

673
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,600
But... he needs to rest.

674
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,400
Looks like this curse can't be broken.

675
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,550
Every instructor ends up getting hurt.

676
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:19,680
Be careful.

677
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,840
Let's suspend today's lecture.

678
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,280
Everyone, you can leave now.

679
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,440
Um...

680
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,640
I... I'm fine.

681
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,080
Just let me rest for a bit.

682
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,000
Are you sure?

683
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,760
I'm just feeling a bit dizzy.

684
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,440
I'm going to have some tea so that I can feel better.

685
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:41,920
Alright then.

686
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,840
Everyone, let's go have tea together.

687
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,820
I'm not going. I'm so sleepy.

688
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,200
Call me if there's anything.

689
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,890
What happened to your face?

690
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,680
Nothing. It's just a superficial wound.

691
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,480
Gao Yin has already treated it.

692
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,120
She said it will heal in a few days.

693
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,360
How did you get hurt?

694
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,080
I had nothing to do that day,

695
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,890
so I wanted to go for a walk in the mountain.

696
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,810
Unexpectedly, it started raining. The mountain path was slippery.

697
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,050
So I fell.

698
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,110
Next time, if you can't sleep at night,

699
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,560
you can come to me to have tea.

700
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,760
I'm a night owl.

701
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,630
You're asking a girl to go to you in the middle of the night.

702
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:38,600
Is that appropriate?

703
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,960
I...

704
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,480
I'm sorry.

705
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,320
I... I was thoughtless.

706
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,330
It's okay. I know you didn't mean anything else.

707
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,200
Gan Pu, if you can't sleep,

708
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,400
you can come to me.

709
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,720
I'll take you for a walk.

710
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,640
I know martial arts. I'll protect you.

711
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,690
Don't go to those stinky men.

712
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,780
This is your first time coming to have tea with me, right?

713
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,960
I don't think you wanted

714
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,450
to have any dealings with me in the past.

715
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,520
I don't like to deal with princes.

716
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,730
The gap in the status is a bit significant.

717
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,440
Then what made you change your mind?

718
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,770
I just realized that princes are humans too.

719
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,520
It's not like you have three heads.

720
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,730
What's the big deal?

721
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,920
When will the cycle of vengeance ever end?

722
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,680
We only live once.

723
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,720
Since we're alive,

724
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,800
we should enjoy the happiness of living.

725
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,010
Am I right, Qing Cai?

726
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,720
Gao Yin noticed Wang Yishao's misjudgment.

727
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,120
She has feelings for him.

728
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,170
And they're on the same side.

729
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,560
Will she give a hint to Wang Yishao?

730
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,130
Or will she remain a bystander?

731
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:13,470
Sometimes, what you see may not be the truth.

732
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,920
Weren't you at odds with Qing Cai before?

733
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:32,800
How come you seem a bit... close now?

734
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,130
Qing Cai is my brother.

735
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:42,720
My brother's wife.

736
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,710
Your brother's wife?

737
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:48,120
Her brother is my husband.

738
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,290
My condolences.

739
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,290
What?

740
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,240
Who?

741
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,200
Aren't you a widow?

742
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,210
Isn't she a widow?
