00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,680
[Pretty Boy]

2
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,630
[Episode 13]

3
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,900
What you see may not be true.

4
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,810
Brainless.

5
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,079
I... I only got it right once?

6
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,640
But Hong Hui is brainless for sure.

7
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,700
I came here

8
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,770
just for fun.

9
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,329
I don't know any invisibility technique.

10
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,680
It's just for fun.

11
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,470
I'm not a professional tracker.

12
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,710
Actually, it's good to play games.

13
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,650
No need to make the atmosphere so tense every time.

14
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,250
I observed their reactions.

15
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,880
He's the son of the late emperor!

16
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,190
He's the real prince!

17
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,000
All three of them

18
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,100
know the person we're looking for is the son of the late emperor.

19
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,260
I noticed that too.

20
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,460
Why... didn't I notice anything?

21
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,750
I didn't notice anything either.

22
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,910
Now let's analyze it.

23
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,920
All three of them know

24
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,870
the person we're looking for is the son of the late emperor.

25
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,550
But we were not informed in advance.

26
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,220
So,

27
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,290
how did they know?

28
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,840
They know the son of the late emperor?

29
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,880
Or they are friends with the son of the late emperor?

30
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,000
One of them

31
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,790
is the son of the late emperor.

32
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,650
It must be so.

33
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,040
They know the son of the late emperor.

34
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,120
It must be so.

35
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,090
Didn't you hear what I said?

36
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:46,800
All of them

37
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,400
were quite surprised when they heard the late emperor was the culprit

38
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,630
of the Mo Clan's extermination.

39
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,290
That was the order of the late emperor!

40
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,620
Look how they reacted.

41
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,440
Qing Cai and Han Aizhen turned their gazes towards Gan Pu.

42
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,750
Gan Pu's reaction is worth our attention.

43
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,970
So you mean...

44
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,890
Gan Pu will betray the son of the late emperor?

45
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,680
I...

46
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,260
Gan Pu.

47
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,560
I think when there's a problem,

48
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,360
it's better to just say it.

49
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,270
I think it's the best way

50
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,390
to solve a problem.

51
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,990
Hiding your thoughts

52
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,190
will only make things worse.

53
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,050
So what I want to say is

54
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,690
there might be something wrong

55
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,600
with our collaboration.

56
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,780
It's the previous generation's matter.

57
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,180
It has nothing to do with you two.

58
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,730
Sister,

59
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,200
will you collaborate with your sworn enemy?

60
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,170
And we're not the kind of people who play power games.

61
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,180
We will not...

62
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,290
We will never

63
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,390
do those...

64
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,710
those dirty things for our own interests.

65
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,770
But now,

66
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,320
we have a common enemy:

67
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,040
Mingyi Manor.

68
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,730
Easier said

69
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,970
than done.

70
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,560
I also need to think carefully about it.

71
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,090
I think

72
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,360
something is wrong

73
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,170
with their collaboration.

74
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,390
Of course.

75
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,880
Then why don't we just

76
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,610
win Gan Pu over?

77
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,130
It's still not dawn yet?

78
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,770
All right, then.

79
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,420
How come there was a tense situation?

80
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,800
W-When was there a tense situation?

81
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,210
You need to

82
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:01,500
find out more things yourself.

83
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,400
Are you testing me?

84
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,990
I'm leaving.

85
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,580
Gan Pu still needs someone to comfort her.

86
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,280
Gan Pu still needs someone to comfort her?

87
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,880
What's going on? Why is Gao Yin leaving?

88
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,510
I support Gao Yin.

89
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,170
Why did she leave... to comfort Gan Pu?

90
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:43,650
She... She gave up?

91
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,990
You've been caught up in it.

92
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,130
I didn't expect

93
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,360
you guys to become like this.

94
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,070
Why do I have bumps all over my body?

95
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,540
I was bitten by mosquitos!

96
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,240
Hong Hui is like a big mosquito repellent coil.

97
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,000
He ran...

98
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:09,770
N-No.

99
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,040
Mosquitos will bite me since he has left.

100
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,210
I'm leaving.

101
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,400
Aren't you tired?

102
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,070
I'm tired.

103
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,680
Come on.

104
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,560
Take them away.

105
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,380
-Yes.
-Yes.

106
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,920
Don't.

107
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,410
Move.

108
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,220
Do you need help?

109
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,130
No, I want to do it myself.

110
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,340
You scared me!

111
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,860
You're still practicing at this hour?

112
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,850
I'm hitting mosquitos.

113
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,470
Well,

114
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,110
there are a lot of mosquito repellent plants.

115
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,250
Why are you hitting mosquitos?

116
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,100
There are many mosquitos.

117
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,370
You...

118
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,170
You can hit mosquitos just like this?

119
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,030
I've killed countless mosquitos.

120
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,200
Look, there are so many on the ground.

121
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,470
I don't see any.

122
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,190
Are you stupid?

123
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,540
How can you see them at night?

124
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,570
Try again during the daytime tomorrow.

125
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,320
I can see them tomorrow morning.

126
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,390
You really are stupid.

127
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,320
How can you see them during the daytime?

128
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,930
At night,

129
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,230
the mosquitos' bodies will be carried away by ants.

130
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,790
What is Qing Cai doing?

131
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,440
He's making a swing.

132
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,060
Why does he suddenly want to make that?

133
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,080
Gan Pu.

134
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,100
That was close today.

135
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,140
I almost made a huge mistake.

136
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,700
It happened so suddenly.

137
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,040
I was thoughtless.

138
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,310
I'm reluctant to fight against you.

139
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,780
I owe you two lives.

140
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,910
That doesn't count.

141
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,940
As a doctor, it's my duty to save people.

142
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,180
To you, it's your duty.

143
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,570
But to me, it's a favor.

144
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,290
If you need to fight against me one day,

145
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,250
no need to show mercy.

146
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,060
I owe you.

147
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,110
You can't die yet.

148
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,750
Your life isn't yours either.

149
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,600
So,

150
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,780
when you should fight against me,

151
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,680
you don't need to show mercy either.

152
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,880
How come... you know everything?

153
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,850
Not really.

154
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,070
I found out through investigations.

155
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,370
I'm very curious.

156
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,470
How did you manage to follow Qing Cai?

157
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,310
You weren't there.

158
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,440
And you don't know martial arts,

159
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,060
let alone the speed for it.

160
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,010
Mingyi Manor's Soul-tracking Incense

161
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,640
is like a child's toy to me.

162
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,780
I see.

163
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,030
But why did you only investigate

164
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,310
and never make a move?

165
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,110
We are pawns.

166
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,110
We just need to do what a pawn should do.

167
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,070
As a pawn,

168
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,790
what should you do?

169
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,950
My mission

170
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,850
is to protect the people of Mingyi Manor from being poisoned.

171
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,050
I also accept missions

172
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,690
to poison someone.

173
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,930
What you just said makes us rest assured.

174
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,390
So you won't interfere

175
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,590
in anything else?

176
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,590
Not really.

177
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,710
I revealed Gan Pu's identity today.

178
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,180
I told Wang Yishao that Gan Pu is a member of the Mo Clan.

179
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,630
It's normal.

180
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,190
But it's not normal that you didn't reveal

181
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,710
Qing Cai's identity.

182
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,750
I went beyond my role

183
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,960
and disrupted the game.

184
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,470
So you're telling me this

185
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,030
in order to balance

186
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,190
the situation?

187
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,680
Yes.

188
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,100
It's just irrelevant information.

189
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,360
But

190
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,320
this will

191
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,670
make Wang Yishao get close to Gan Pu earlier, right?

192
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,950
I don't think it's good for you.

193
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,800
You mean emotionally?

194
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,150
You already gave up.

195
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,200
Why can't I?

196
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:46,640
I...

197
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,030
We are different, I think.

198
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,520
Do you... really love Wang Yishao?

199
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,820
Great love is love without attachment.

200
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,470
I don't understand.

201
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,430
I'm exhausted.

202
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,650
What were you two chatting about?

203
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
You look so happy.

204
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,130
Something... I don't understand.

205
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,860
You were chatting about something you don't understand so happily?

206
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,790
You win.

207
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,550
That's interesting. I...

208
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,520
Don't go there yet.

209
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,680
Why?

210
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,840
He tried so hard to make that

211
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,630
for a reason.

212
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,150
Why are you doing this?

213
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,420
I hope the first swing you're on

214
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,900
is made by me.

215
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,290
Do you know this would

216
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,290
put me in a dilemma?

217
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,170
We don't have many shared memories.

218
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,380
I just want to create more moments

219
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,920
for us to remember.

220
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,950
Don't feel burdened.

221
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,320
Because...

222
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,900
this might be the last time

223
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,620
I do something for you.

224
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,950
♫When encounters are separated by distance♫

225
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:37,170
♫Memories are all anonymous♫

226
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:43,590
♫I push the door open, reluctant to leave♫

227
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,600
♫I can only conceal my name and relinquish all hope♫

228
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,130
♫Even keeping feelings hidden has turned into an unspoken understanding♫

229
00:16:55,210 --> 00:17:00,510
♫Who can gather these countless thoughts?♫

230
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,210
♫Never leave or forsake each other♫

231
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,670
♫It's the only way to honor our meeting♫

232
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,930
♫I just fear you will never appear in my dreams♫

233
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,240
♫I simply watch you in silence♫

234
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,960
♫Quietly guarding the remnants of our memories♫

235
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:28,730
♫But I dare not face the inevitable end♫

236
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,420
♫Thousand words left unspoken♫

237
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,250
♫That one regret I can never shake♫

238
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:39,490
♫I fear I will never be able to stand by your side♫

239
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,130
♫Even your silhouette has become unclear♫

240
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:51,120
♫Even if tears fall like frozen rain♫

241
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:56,080
♫I will still return the clear sky to you♫

242
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:21,670
♫I simply watch you in silence♫

243
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,450
♫Quietly guarding the remnants of our memories♫

244
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:33,060
♫But I dare not face the inevitable end♫

245
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,810
♫Thousand words left unspoken♫

246
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,720
♫That one regret I can never shake♫

247
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,830
♫I fear I will never be able to stand by your side♫

248
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,480
♫Even your silhouette has become unclear♫

00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:55,560
♫Even if tears fall like frozen rain♫

250
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:00,400
♫I will still return the clear sky to you♫

251
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,320
Love once begun,

252
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,230
will never end.

253
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,310
Love, once ended,

254
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,160
begins no more.

255
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,190
I really didn't understand

256
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,110
love in the past.

257
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,080
But you guys treat love

258
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,350
as something very sacred.

259
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,880
I have to say

260
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,730
it has truly influenced me.

261
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,640
To be moved by things is human.

262
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,420
To remain unaffected by them is the virtue of a true gentleman.

263
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,660
Otherwise, one has fallen into madness.

264
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,550
What does that mean?

265
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,900
Fool.

266
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,890
It means

267
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,040
one is only truly human when they have emotions.

268
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,040
But if one is controlled by them

269
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:48,380
and is too obsessed, they'll fall into madness.

270
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,920
Is there... anyone who doesn't have emotions?

271
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,860
Of course.

272
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,340
Those who are deeply hurt by love.

273
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,170
And

274
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,290
those cultivators.

275
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,860
They seek to transcend emotions and desires.

276
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,360
How can they be normal?

277
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,760
Then...

278
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,120
am I a human being?

279
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,590
Don't you like to be a ghost?

280
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,640
I am

281
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,600
loyal and heroic,

282
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,980
resourceful and brave, and tough... and gentle.

283
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,270
You laughed.

284
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,640
That means you agree to what I said.

285
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,690
What are you playing?

286
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,930
I don't understand either.

287
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,870
Take a look.

288
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,030
I don't understand it. It's too complicated.

289
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,760
It's been so many days.

290
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,980
You haven't come to ask me anything.

291
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,190
I thought you had forgotten me.

292
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,350
Looks like you've recovered well.

293
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,560
Fairly well.

294
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,030
I was saved by someone who wanted

295
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,890
to kill me.

296
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,050
And you've treated me politely.

297
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,630
Thank you.

298
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,330
We have found

299
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,400
your stronghold.

300
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,210
It has been destroyed.

301
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,570
Are you here to celebrate?

302
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,010
You wouldn't be so bored, would you?

303
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,100
Recently, a group of people

304
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,570
attacked the hooligans in the town.

305
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,060
Later, they fled to somewhere in the town amid chaos.

306
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,460
Of course, we let them go on purpose.

307
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,930
That place is under our surveillance.

308
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,840
We heard someone would go there tonight.

309
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,840
So we followed the messenger

310
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,000
and found your stronghold.

311
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,610
Do you know them?

312
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,910
Maybe.

313
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,670
But we haven't had much contact these years.

314
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,100
As you know,

315
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,280
friendship means

316
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,530
nothing to death warriors.

317
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,120
Those hooligans

318
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,830
had the guts to cause trouble in your territory.

319
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,050
I guess they were desperate.

320
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:05,960
Yes.

321
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,830
We tolerate you because of your son.

322
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,260
We will never allow others

323
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,340
to behave unscrupulously in our territory.

324
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,160
My son?

325
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,400
It's not easy for you

326
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,120
to find him.

327
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,570
He's smarter than a monkey.

328
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,450
Yes.

329
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,780
He's the leader of the hooligans in the town.

330
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,710
But I haven't found a clue yet.

331
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,210
Then why didn't you

332
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,700
arrest those hooligans?

333
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,170
If you torture them,

334
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,080
they'll definitely tell you what you want to know.

335
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,430
We have our own principles.

336
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,400
We are not like you.

337
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,420
The one who came to save you that day

338
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,320
was your son, right?

339
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,920
Yes.

340
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,340
But they were short-handed

341
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,860
and activated the mechanism.

342
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,510
Indeed.

343
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,750
I didn't expect him to escape successfully.

344
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,330
There's someone named Han Aizhen.

345
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,410
She said she's a friend of your son's.

346
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,940
She came here to help him save you.

347
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,430
I followed Han Aizhen

348
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,520
and found that she passed your stronghold.

349
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:32,660
What kind of expression do you want to see on my face?

350
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,840
Surprise?

351
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,900
Or something else?

352
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,990
Han Aizhen

353
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,040
infiltrated into our group of trial disciples.

354
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,800
One day, she said she wanted to see you.

355
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,180
But I don't know her background.

356
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,390
So I didn't agree.

357
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,590
Since you didn't agree,

358
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,010
why did you come to me?

359
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,580
I'm here to ask your opinion.

360
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,820
Since she's my son's friend,

361
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,530
of course she should come to see if I'm fine.

362
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,750
That's how my son can trust you.

363
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,980
How can I trust Han Aizhen?

364
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,930
Actually, you wanted to follow her

365
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,380
to find my son.

366
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,500
Fine, I'll be frank with you.

367
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,990
Even though she's your son's friend

368
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,090
and she has notified your son,

369
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,550
your son wouldn't dare to come.

370
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,580
Because he's worried he would fall into our trap.

371
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,210
So now,

372
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,280
I've decided to bring Han Aizhen to you.

373
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,380
No matter what,

374
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,200
it's a way to show my sincerity.

375
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,820
At least

376
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,990
it shows your positive attitude.

377
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,880
Gan Pu, are you alright?

378
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,780
I had a nightmare.

379
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,600
Sorry for waking you up.

380
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,630
I've also been struggling to fall asleep lately.

381
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,340
Smell this. It can calm your nerves.

382
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,880
Okay, thank you.

383
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:33,830
How are you feeling?

384
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,360
I'm feeling better.

385
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,990
Keep it.

386
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,240
Sleep.

387
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,480
Sorry for waking you up.

388
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,140
Sleep.

389
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,610
The candle...

390
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,440
Let it burn.

391
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,250
Sleep.

392
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,760
Gan Pu!

393
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,570
I'm here to see you off.

394
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,780
I thought

395
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,960
you came to persuade me to go back.

396
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,940
I want to.

397
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,600
But I don't have a reason.

398
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,550
How so?

399
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,010
We still have a common enemy, right?

400
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,000
I don't want to put you in a difficult situation.

401
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,340
Do you mean facing you?

402
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,670
You know this.

403
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,780
Taking revenge has never been my obsession.

404
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,680
Do you know

405
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,990
how painful it is to forget

406
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,330
someone you love?

407
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,110
Since you're here to see me off,

408
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,630
why are you telling me this?

409
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,470
I want to tell you there is a way

410
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,550
to relieve the pain.

411
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,960
When someone falls into the whirlpool of love,

412
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,180
they magnify their affection endlessly,

413
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,270
as if they've fallen ill.

414
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,050
Maybe the person you love

415
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,630
has many shortcomings,

416
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:38,810
but...

417
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,750
you... you'll realize

418
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,830
there are many other people

419
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,950
better than this person around you.

420
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,010
I don't understand what you're talking about.

421
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,840
Do you mean

422
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,490
we should see through the person we love?

423
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,460
We can't.

424
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,300
I don't understand what you mean.

425
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,800
Since we've fallen sick,

426
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,090
how can we see through them?

427
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,010
The...

428
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,960
The way I want to...

429
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,350
want to tell you is

430
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,350
you can find someone you like the most.

431
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,150
At the same time, this person

432
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,860
is better than anyone else.

433
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,070
And...

434
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,910
you choose to accept him.

435
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,880
What on earth are you trying to say?

436
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,880
Because people in love are confused.

437
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,070
You may not

438
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,010
fall in love with this outstanding person right away.

439
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,600
But after you spend enough time with him,

440
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,330
you will realize that

441
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,000
actually, this person has many strengths.

442
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,100
Even if you're not in love with him,

443
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,310
you'll also realize

444
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,310
you have broken free

445
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,610
from the pain unknowingly.

446
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,130
I...

447
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,080
You said so much.

448
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,390
Are you suggesting

449
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,760
I should accept Wang Yishao?

450
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,140
I'm not that great.

451
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,590
I'm just telling you the way.

452
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,630
And during the process,

453
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,790
you can also realize if your feelings...

454
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,340
are true

455
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,330
or... if you're sick.

456
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,250
When did you become so generous?

457
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,470
I remember you got jealous easily in the past.

458
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,820
Well...

459
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,220
What about Wang Yishao?

460
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:38,230
He has a bit of an otherworldly temperament.

461
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,020
What do you think?

462
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,280
You think so highly of him.

463
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,120
I'm starting to get jealous.

464
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,070
It's like...

465
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,370
I'm in love.

466
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,090
But you're a "celestial crane".

467
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,640
In the end, aren't you supposed to ride the crane to the afterlife?

468
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,460
How can you entertain such worldly feelings?

469
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,450
It's too spicy. Let me eat it.

470
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,650
I'll eat it.

471
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,510
Look.

472
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,040
You just smiled.

473
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,760
It's not that painful now.

474
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,430
I won't do such a boring thing.

475
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,260
Didn't you say we have a common enemy?

476
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,000
Even though taking revenge is not your obsession,

477
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,720
it's the root cause of your nightmare.

478
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,010
The way I just told you

479
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,510
is to help you suffer less

480
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,880
when you see me in the future.

481
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,950
Even though it hurts your feelings when you see me,

482
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,530
you'd smile.

483
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,030
I won't do such a stupid thing.

484
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,510
Unless I really like him.

485
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,610
Otherwise, I won't use him

486
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,140
to achieve my goals.

487
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,000
Have you ever thought

488
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,620
maybe you'll really like him?

489
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:13,550
♫When encounters are separated by distance♫

490
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,190
Sorry, I...

491
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,680
I shouldn't have done this.

492
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:14,990
But I...

493
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,820
♫Memories are all anonymous♫

494
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,030
I really don't want this to be our last goodbye.

495
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,700
If you're in love with someone else, it doesn't matter.

496
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,220
I can accept it.

497
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:25,270
♫I push the door open, reluctant to leave♫

498
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,670
I just hope...

499
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,740
I just hope I can see you.

500
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,450
♫I can only conceal my name and relinquish all hope♫

501
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:37,010
♫Even keeping feelings hidden has turned into an unspoken understanding♫

502
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,800
Is this what you really want?

♫Who can gather these countless thoughts?♫

504
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,740
Stop following me.

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,070
♫Never leave or forsake each other♫

00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:04,810
♫Quietly guarding the remnants of our memories♫

♫But I dare not face the inevitable end♫

00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,900
Why is there a swing here?

♫Thousand words left unspoken♫

513
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,540
♫That one regret I can never shake♫

514

Don't move!

515

You, come here.

516
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,870
Come here!

517
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,750
There is a story

518
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,990
behind the swing.

519
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,420
Even I dare not play on it. How dare you?

520
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,760
Do you think

521
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,480
I have the guts to throw you away

522
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,990
like trash?

523
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,220
Yes.

524
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,480
You still have the guts to play on the swing?

525
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,030
No.

526
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,890
I mean you have the guts to throw me away.

527
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,760
Make yourself clear.

528
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,810
Otherwise, I'll really throw you away like trash.

529
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,640
I already made myself clear.

530
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,570
How dare you talk back?

531
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,250
I dare not.

532
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,820
Do you think

533
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,480
I dare not throw you away

534
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,250
like trash?

535
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,370
My dear grandma, please.

536
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,710
Stop torturing me.

537
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,760
I'm weak and I can't withstand your torture.

538
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,230
When did you learn to be glib-tongued?

539
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,150
But how dare you call me Grandma?

540
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,730
Please forgive me.

541
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,710
My heart can't withstand... any fright.

542
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,630
Hu Jiao,

543
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,020
when did you learn to fool people?

544
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:27,889
I learned it from someone.

545
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,840
Qing Cai?

546
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,070
You're a fast learner.

547
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,900
With my smartness,

548
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,000
my master will be useless

549
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,210
once I learn all his skills.

550
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,230
You think I'm a cat in gloves

551
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,170
that catches no mice?

552
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,139
Why isn't Qing Cai here?

553
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,739
Are you asking me?

554
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,560
I don't know.

555
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,679
Do you dare to ask me again?

556
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,630
He went out with Gan Pu.

557
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,370
When will she come back?

558
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,960
She...

559
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,450
What's the matter?

560
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,270
N-Nothing.

561
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,970
I was just asking.

562
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,600
Don't move!

563
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,610
Why?

564
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,220
They said there is a story behind it.

565
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,550
It's quite weird.

566
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,500
I think it's... a ghost story.

567
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,450
Sweet dreams. Nightmares.

568
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:44,100
There is indeed a ghost story behind it.

569
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,450
Han Aizhen,

570
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,550
we've agreed to what you requested back then.

571
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,750
Come with me.

572
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,380
You and Qing Cai knew each other long ago?

573
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,900
We knew each other after coming here.

574
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,490
But you were like enemies before.

575
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,710
Of course.

576
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,580
They almost got me killed.

577
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,750
If it weren't for Gao Yin,

578
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,140
I would have died.

579
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,460
You're quite generous.

580
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:45,420
You let go of the grudge easily.

581
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,860
We made a promise in the wrestling class.

582
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,670
We promised we'd be even after the fight.

583
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,940
You truly became close

584
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,730
after you broke into the prison, right?

585
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,500
She found out my secret,

586
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,060
but she didn't expose me.

587
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,040
Whose side do you think she is on?

588
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,820
I thought about that before.

589
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:11,170
Maybe she is also a friend with the son of the late emperor.

590
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,950
It's just that we didn't know each other before.

591
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,350
You're guiding the direction of my thoughts?

592
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,990
I'm... guiding you?

593
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,710
I know myself well.

594
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,210
I'm simple, straightforward,

595
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,120
and hot-tempered.

596
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,690
I can't hide my emotions.

597
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,520
So I can only tell the truth.

598
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,260
You mentioned a lot of your shortcomings.

599
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,960
Don't you know you have strengths?

600
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,170
My strengths?

601
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,310
You're smart.

602
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,250
It makes up for your shortcomings.

603
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,860
Thank you.

604
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,630
I hope it's enough to make up for them.

605
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,230
If you're not a spy,

606
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,120
your shortcomings may not be a bad thing.

607
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,250
You're straightforward.

608
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,180
Many people are willing to be friends with you.

609
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,100
Unlike me.

610
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,850
I'm enigmatic.

611
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,560
I don't have friends anywhere.

612
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,490
Indeed.

613
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:08,220
I have no idea of your thoughts at all.

614
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,820
If you want to make friends with me,

615
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,800
forget it.

616
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,360
You know how to smile?

617
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,520
Actually,

618
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,630
I don't think you're scheming.

619
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,380
You can make friends.

620
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,980
It's just that the environment is too depressing.

621
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,720
You always think too much.

622
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,850
You must be under a lot of pressure, right?

623
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,900
I really want to be your friend.

624
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,070
I dare. Do you dare?

625
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,280
You're really smart.

626
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,630
What's your name?

627
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,750
Just call me Hongxiu.

628
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:46,910
Call me Aizhen.

629
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,080
They all call me that.

630
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,060
Okay.

631
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:56,470
♫Even keeping feelings hidden has turned into an unspoken understanding♫

632
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,720
♫Who can gather these countless thoughts?♫

633
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,000
Men and women should maintain a proper distance.

634
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,180
You always pinch me.

635
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,930
Do you have special feelings for me?

636
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,230
Don't flatter yourself, okay?

637
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,500
♫Never leave or forsake each other♫

638
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,720
I'm an idiot.

639
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,080
♫It's the only way to honor our meeting♫

640
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,350
You are an idiot.

641
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:13,320
♫I just fear you will never appear in my dreams♫

642
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,030
What's wrong with me?

643
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,470
♫I simply watch you in silence♫

644
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,810
Am I going to give up my life goal

645
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,960
just because I'm unwilling to face him?

646
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:24,250
♫Quietly guarding the remnants of our memories♫

647
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,120
What should I do in the future?

648
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,590
Where should I go?

649
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:30,020
♫But I dare not face the inevitable end♫

650
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,730

652

Miss, what would you like?

653
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,870
I...

654
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,040
Can I sit here?

655
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,630
Sit.

656
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,900
Then... give us a pot of tea.

657
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,290
Okay. Please wait a moment.

658
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,190
Why are you here?

659
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,910
Someone saw you leaving with your luggage.

660
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,310
So I came after you quickly.

661
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,550
Luckily,

662
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,620
I finally found you.

663
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:03,970
It was Hong Hui, right?

664
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,370
Looks like his invisibility technique is quite good.

665
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,670
So you noticed him long ago.

666
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,190
This guy

667
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,630
was so complacent.

668
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,100
Someone guessed it.

669
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,520
Qing Cai?

670
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,800
I knew he couldn't hide it from her.

671
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:26,090
You are a group of smart people.

672
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,850
It's indeed not wise

673
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,150
to compete with you.

674
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,060
She's a heroine.

675
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,880
I feel ashamed.

676
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,160
I don't think she should be described as a heroine.

677
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,010
Are you talking about... Yinniang?

678
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,040
I don't know Yinniang well. I can't comment.

679
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,230
Then it's Gao Yin.

680
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,580
Describing her as a heroine doesn't quite capture her essence.

681
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,110
She should be described as a person with great wisdom.

682
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,150
Someone who said a skilled doctor has the ability to treat the illness of a nation

683
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,760
is more than a doctor.

684
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
Since she's not simple

685
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,520
and she's very smart,

686
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,200
why won't you accept her?

687
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,800
She's the type that can calm people down.

688
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:19,840
Emotionally,

689
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,720
for this type of person,

690
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,860
it's very hard...

691
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,010
I understand.

692
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,960
She's a little too smart

693
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,500
and a little too perfect.

694
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,700
That

695
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,230
makes her a bit... aloof from the world.

696
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,880
Something like that.

697
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,100
Seeing him alive

698
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,480
makes me relieved.

699
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,940
You don't need to explain to me.

700
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,400
I want to explain.

701
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,920
I treat you as my friend.

702
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,270
Your personality is really appealing.

703
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,170
Fine.

704
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,020
There is always one thing to conquer another.

705
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,640
You're going

706
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,410
to stand here and watch us talk?

707
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:26,060
I have no choice. It's the only way.

708
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,330
Didn't you...

709
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,040
No.

710
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,830
Is it serious?

711
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,830
Nothing serious.

712
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,080
Go back and tell him

713
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:43,780
to rest assured.

714
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,690
Don't let him do anything stupid again.

715
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,360
I can't make decisions for him.

716
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,520
I don't think

717
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,970
he'll leave you behind.

718
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,350
That brat.

719
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,840
Looks like

720
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,320
the relationship between you two is not ordinary either.

721
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,890
Are you badly injured?

722
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,650
It's really nothing.

723
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,170
I heard

724
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:14,480
that girl is a disciple of the miracle-working doctor.

725
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,160
It was all thanks to her.

726
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:19,700
Hongxiu,

727
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,720
I want to ask him something. Can I?

728
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:22,970
Be careful with your questions.

729
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,910
Was exterminating the Mo Clan

730
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,300
an order of the late emperor?

731
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,300
Did Mingyi Manor

732
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,050
tell you that?

733
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:50,710
Now,

734
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,470
there's no need to hide it.

735
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,770
Yes, it was.

736
00:43:58,910 --> 00:43:59,550
Then...

737
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,790
were you involved?

738
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,930
I was one of the people in charge.

739
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,540
I don't want you

740
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,610
to consider me a treacherous person.

741
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,800
It's meaningless to explain,

742
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:15,600
but I still want to tell you.

743
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:19,050
I'm a death warrior.

744
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:23,590
My life is not up to me.

745
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,710
I have to obey

746
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,620
higher-ups' orders.

747
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,910
He's too weak.

748
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:36,720
He can't talk too much.

749
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,950
I won't ask anything else.

750
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,350
I won't ask anything else.

751
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,380
Can I stay here a little longer?

752
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:50,550
Okay.

753
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,130
[Smithy]

00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,870
[Smithy]

755
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,680
You got the tools used to break

756
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,640
into the prison there, right?

757
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,430
Sometimes, people can't be too smart.

758
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:35,450
Being too smart makes people less cute.
