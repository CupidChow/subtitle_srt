1
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,670
[Pretty Boy]

2
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,699
[Episode 22]

3
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,760
Slaughter them all! Slaughter them all! Slaughter them all!

4
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,960
I'm out of arrows. Forget it.

5
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,020
Form up!

6
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,920
Kill them all!

7
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,690
Can I leave now?

8
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,230
You silly disciple of mine.

9
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,890
Looks like we'll have to do it ourselves.

10
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,920
Leave those two aside for now.

11
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,090
Let's handle our own business first.

12
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,520
Qing Cai, let's leave here now.

13
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,740
Young Master Wang,

14
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,110
from the way you're acting,

15
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,950
you don't seem like to wield the slaughter knife against us.

16
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,330
Instead, you look ready to draw your sword to help us.

17
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
Do you want to die?

18
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,050
Do you know those people's backgrounds?

19
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,380
No matter what, you must leave first.

20
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,190
My master was killed by them.

21
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,050
Old Weirdo Ding. Old Devil Ding.

22
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,520
The Heaven-Destroying Formation.

23
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,829
Which means

24
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,579
we just had a brush with death.

25
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,970
That formation is disabled for now.

26
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,270
If the two devils join forces,

27
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,410
we'll all be doomed.

28
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,620
We don't need to worry about them for now.

29
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,840
They shouldn't be able to join forces.

30
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,600
I've just sealed Old Weirdo Ding's martial arts.

31
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,579
How did you manage that?

32
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,540
The acupoint I shot with my sleeve arrow

33
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,510
is not an ordinary acupoint.

34
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,230
It's the Sealing Magic Power Point.

35
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,520
No matter how skilled a martial artist is,

36
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,480
as long as this acupoint is sealed

37
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,840
with the arrow remaining in their body,

38
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,060
they temporarily can't use their martial arts

39
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,190
and become like ordinary people.

40
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,100
That amazing?

41
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,410
But what if they find someone

42
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,430
to remove the arrow from their body?

43
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,860
It would be very difficult,

44
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,130
and that acupoint

45
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,770
is crucial to martial artists.

46
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,990
If damaged,

47
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,860
one may lose their martial arts skills.

48
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,990
It's similar to certain poisons,

49
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,220
but they're rare

50
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,630
and difficult to control.

51
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,250
Then let's kill them all at once while we can

52
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,520
to avenge my master.

53
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,430
I agree.

54
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,360
But what if their Heaven-Destroying Formation

55
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,590
isn't actually disabled?

56
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,470
It's really hard to say.

57
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,310
You saw that scholar earlier.

58
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,409
His way of thinking is very strange

59
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,510
and unpredictable.

60
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,800
Scholars sometimes get stuck in their ways of thinking,

61
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,210
so

62
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,290
we need to investigate further and assess the situation.

63
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,710
They've likely returned to the Tea Inn by now.

64
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,610
I'll go check again.

65
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,150
I'll go with you.

66
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,730
Old Weirdo Ding will think I'm his savior.

67
00:04:59,290 --> 00:04:59,800
Be careful.

68
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,390
You too.

69
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,680
Why did you catch me?

70
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,040
You guys, keep an eye on this guy.

71
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:18,920
-Yes.
-Yes.

72
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,600
You bunch of treacherous punks.

73
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,790
Master already let me go.

74
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,620
Why did you bring me back?

75
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,570
Bringing you back is giving you a chance to rejoin us.

76
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,010
You're the ones who need to return from your lost path!

77
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,370
Stop using fancy words with me.

78
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,790
It's irritating.

79
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:37,110
Keep talking nonsense, and I'll kill you.

80
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,260
Go ahead, kill me.

81
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,100
Kill me. If I even make a sound, I'll be your son.

82
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,500
Brother, what happened?

83
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,470
You don't know what happened.

84
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,260
When I was ambushed, my martial arts skills were sealed.

85
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,090
How is that possible? Just one arrow?

86
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,250
It's like the Sealing Magic Power of the Mo Clan,

87
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,060
which is also a type of acupoint sealing formation.

88
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,060
This technique uses sleeve arrows.

89
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,470
Sleeve arrows?

90
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,770
Then, those are impossible to defend against.

91
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,010
Not exactly.

92
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,070
Just don't let them get close for a sneak attack.

93
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,090
Those two did it? I'll deal with them.

94
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,600
Without the Heaven-Destroying Formation,

95
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,900
how can we deal with them?

96
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,150
Are those two really that skilled in martial arts?

97
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,430
Weren't they just using sneak attacks?

98
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,230
From what I saw, that tall one's martial arts skills are no worse than mine.

99
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,380
Your hidden weapons wouldn't get him

100
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,410
if it wasn't a sneak attack.

101
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,060
If we cast poison at close quarters,

102
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,700
that short one has sleeve arrows.

103
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,560
It would end in mutual destruction.

104
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:35,750
What should we do?

105
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,430
First, stabilize the Heaven-Destroying Formation.

106
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,909
Don't let our seven disciples get separated,

107
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,960
ready to form up the formation all the time

108
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,350
to prevent sneak attacks.

109
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,960
Seventh Disciple, come up.

110
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,980
This is a time of crisis. Don't leave.

111
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,140
Do you think something will happen?

112
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,140
I'm afraid it already has.

113
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,900
W-What's going on?

114
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,120
Why did Master leave just now?

115
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,620
Yes, why?

116
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,490
Given the Master's usual way,

117
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,659
he should have killed those two people.

118
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,690
But why did he leave?

119
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,500
I think there's something wrong with Master's martial arts.

120
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,510
How could that happen?

121
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,340
Are you asking me?

122
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,110
It's your fault.

123
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,290
Now with enemies eyeing us,

124
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,360
can you still leave?

125
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,520
No need.

126
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,510
I promised him. Let him leave.

127
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,800
It's not his fault.

128
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,870
I was the one who carelessly fell for their scheme.

129
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,430
Boren died because of me.

130
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,430
It has nothing to do with our Seventh Disciple.

131
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,910
I can't wash my hands of this.

132
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,700
Master.

133
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,570
I won't leave.

134
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,890
It's okay.

135
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,440
Tell your seniors

136
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,170
to stay ready to form the formation at any moment

137
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,690
to guard against surprise attacks.

138
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,920
Yes, Master.

139
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,510
This stubborn kid is so single-minded.

140
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,370
Though we can't go on like this forever.

141
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,830
This kid isn't reliable.

142
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,350
We need to find a new disciple.

143
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,450
That's more reassuring.

144
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,250
Go see if anyone's watching us.

145
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,100
Brothers, Master has ordered us

146
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,230
to be prepared to form up at all times.

147
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,070
Brother, our disciple, the Fairy Doctor, is here.

148
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,230
The Fairy Doctor is here!

149
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,380
Hurry up. Welcome her in, hurry!

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,410
Your Highness, Fairy Doctor,

151
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,590
you came just in time.

152
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,820
Could we speak privately?

153
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,390
Okay.

154
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,790
Big Brother,

155
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,020
if something's really wrong with Master's martial arts this time,

156
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,600
what should we do?

157
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,040
Now, Seventh Brother has become crucial.

158
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,510
We need to find a way to persuade Hu Jiaow.

159
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,240
Otherwise, we'll be too passive.

160
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,130
We never know when our Seventh Brother might act up again.

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,030
You must have noticed something

162
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,710
and come to us, right?

163
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,070
Indeed.

164
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,240
I know there's something wrong with you,

165
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,270
so I came specifically to help.

166
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,970
Thank you for your aid, Your Highness.

167
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,960
Although we work for your father,

168
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,440
we'll remember forever

169
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,820
that you offer help in our time of need.

170
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,020
In the future, if you have any requests, Your Highness,

171
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,560
we'll go through fire and water for you.

172
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,640
No need for formalities.

173
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,440
Helping you...

174
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,890
is also helping my father.

175
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,690
Thank you.

176
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,840
Thank you, thank you very much.

177
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,380
Here.

178
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,250
Have you made up your mind

179
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,800
to join us as fellow disciples?

180
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,800
That won't work.

181
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,190
Right now, we're friends.

182
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,470
If I join you,

183
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,400
won't I become the youngest disciple?

184
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,030
I won't do such a losing deal.

185
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,270
If you're willing to join,

186
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,850
I'll give you the position of Big Senior.

187
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,090
You said it.

188
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,310
Now, that's something worth considering.

189
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,040
But I need to eat first before I can think about it.

190
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,180
Your acupoint is sealed

191
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,680
by something like the ox-hair needle.

192
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,220
The needle is inside your body.

193
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,160
If we try to remove it through ordinary means,

194
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,280
you might lose all of your martial arts skills.

195
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,230
But if we leave it in,

196
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,580
you just can't use your martial arts skills.

197
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,960
You still have your martial arts skills.

198
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,470
I still have my martial arts skills.

199
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,440
How should we deal with this strange situation?

200
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,720
Only the person who caused the problem can fix it.

201
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,700
Perhaps the person who used this technique

202
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,370
may know how to remove it.

203
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,870
Then we still need to find those two people.

204
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:28,600
Brother,

205
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,450
we can use the Heaven-Destroying Formation now.

206
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,390
Combined with my poison techniques,

207
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,670
dealing with those two won't be a problem.

208
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,690
I'll bring them here to cure you.

209
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,770
They're not simple.

210
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,510
If we fight, we must go all out.

211
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,210
What if we accidentally kill them?

212
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,870
Fairy Doctor, is there any other way?

213
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,110
You flatter me.

214
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,910
But if we could draw out the ox-hair needle,

215
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,890
it might solve everything permanently.

216
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,720
There's such a method?

217
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,440
Is this ox-hair needle made of iron?

218
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,510
I think so.

219
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,990
I know magnets can attract iron,

220
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,670
but... I've never encountered

221
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,990
a situation like yours before

222
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,760
and don't know how effective it would be.

223
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,300
After all, I don't practice martial arts.

224
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,850
Where can we find such a thing?

225
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,020
I'll look for it.

226
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,590
If I find it, I'll bring it right away.

227
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,710
Thank you very much.

228
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:17,960
This technique

229
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,770
is very similar to the legendary Mo Clan's Sealing Magic Power technique,

230
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,760
which also uses sleeve arrows.

231
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,830
Very likely.

232
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,430
Whose side are they on really?

233
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,970
The mountain-protecting formation of Mingyi Manor is remarkably intricate.

234
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,850
I think it's related to Mo Clan's techniques.

235
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,240
No wonder they attacked us.

236
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,040
But how could there be men at Mingyi Manor?

237
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,310
Mingyi Manor is flourishing.

238
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,610
It's normal for them to have some friends in the Martial Arts World.

239
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,790
A few days later,

240
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,500
we need to accompany His Majesty to Mingyi Manor.

241
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,650
It's troublesome then.

242
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,400
This is a major matter. We can't delay it.

243
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,920
Exactly.

244
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,010
Those two

245
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,360
may not serve the Mingyi Manor with their lives.

246
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,080
Perhaps we could try to divide and win them over.

247
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,730
So, you already have a plan, Your Highness?

248
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,260
They are still in town,

249
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,380
probably waiting for a chance to strike.

250
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,140
I'll go talk to them.

251
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,050
We're counting on you, Your Highness.

252
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,350
Thank you, Your Highness.

253
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,960
Please be careful.

254
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,130
In broad daylight,

255
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,570
no one would dare to harm a prince.

256
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,030
Please.

257
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:34,590
Please, please.

258
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,620
Please, please.

259
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,600
Please, please.

260
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,270
Your Highness, please.

261
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,520
Do you know that person?

262
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,970
That person? One of my brother's subordinates,

263
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,420
here at Mingyi Manor undercover,

264
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,550
just like me.

265
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,710
One of us.

266
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,600
Brother.

267
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,410
Is that man trustworthy?

268
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,650
We work for his father.

269
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,620
What do you think?

270
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,820
We're all on the opposite side of the General,

271
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,170
so it should be fine.

272
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,520
Brother, have some tea.

273
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,510
Kid, where did you come from?

274
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,520
I don't know you guys well.

275
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,630
Why should I tell you?

276
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,750
Master.

277
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,970
We've just met him

278
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,780
and are trying to persuade him to become your disciple.

279
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,250
T-To replace Seventh Brother.

280
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,350
He knows martial arts?

281
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,710
No, but he's incredibly strong.

282
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,090
Didn't you say

283
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,730
that Seventh Brother's position requires someone strong?

284
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,190
You've competed with him in strength?

285
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,550
No.

286
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,450
No, but earlier with that stone...

287
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,670
I know. I know.

288
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,020
Why are you two looking at me like that?

289
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,650
It's like you're trying to eat me.

290
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,070
Let me tell you in advance.

291
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,710
I'm tough and not tasty!

292
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,190
Kid, you're quite straightforward.

293
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,270
We're kindred spirits.

294
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,680
It's the first time someone called me a kindred spirit.

295
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,430
In that case,

296
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,590
you're a nice guy.

297
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,230
You work for the Crown Prince?

298
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,060
Did that Wang Yishao tell you that?"

299
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,970
What kind of prince is he?

300
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,760
We are not on the same side.

301
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,460
Your master is the real prince.

302
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,920
Who are you two?

303
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,480
Why do you know Wang Yishao?

304
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,990
We're hired by His Majesty to deal with Mingyi Manor.

305
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,790
Do you understand now?

306
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,950
I see.

307
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,880
Are we on the same side as you?

308
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,040
Sort of.

309
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,250
Young man,

310
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,510
are you interested in becoming my disciple?

311
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,070
Since you know my identity,

312
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,400
you still dare to poach me?

313
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,030
It's not necessarily poaching.

314
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,260
If you become my disciple,

315
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,960
your master and I will have a connection.

316
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,230
Your master may be quite pleased.

317
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,440
I see.

318
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,780
But I'm a rough person.

319
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,210
I can't figure out what you're planning here.

320
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,829
I need to go back and ask for instructions.

321
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,050
No problem.

322
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,119
You can ask the Crown Prince.

323
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,790
The terms are negotiable.

324
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,690
We are kind of a family, right?

325
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,490
Okay.

326
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,680
When I'm full, I'll go back and ask for instructions.

327
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,800
Take your time eating. Eat well.

328
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,819
Eat more. Eat more.

329
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,440
So, that Zhang Fang saved you.

330
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,620
But for some reason,

331
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,710
I can't feel grateful to him at all.

332
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,220
Why? Because he's too aloof?

333
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,950
It's not just aloofness;

334
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,580
he's completely putting on an act.

335
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,840
That's probably what makes him formidable.

336
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,910
He saved you

337
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,530
without letting you feel grateful,

338
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,810
thereby avoiding any karmic ties.

339
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,990
What are you talking about?

340
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:55,990
Are you talking about Zhang Fang?

341
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,480
Who else could it be?

342
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,790
Come on.

343
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,550
It appears you don't truly understand him.

344
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,110
He has invincible martial arts that can kill enemies with one strike.

345
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,720
He could do so much with that.

346
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,100
Not only does he have the invincible martial arts,

347
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,720
but he can be strong against the strong

348
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,490
and weak against the weak.

349
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,260
His exceptional martial arts skills came from his knowledge and character.

350
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,620
A moment of enlightenment,

351
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,890
leading to instant mastery.

352
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,600
It's quite miraculous.

353
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,720
Everything is interconnected.

354
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,380
In fact, he has made an exception for you

355
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,840
and put himself in danger.

356
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,820
Although he didn't kill for you,

357
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,820
he created negative karma for this.

358
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,990
In that case,

359
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,400
I've wronged him.

360
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,580
How was your conversation with Old Weirdo Ding?

361
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,010
That Seventh Disciple

362
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,340
has indeed stayed to continue serving him.

363
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,010
So, wasn’t all we did for nothing?

364
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,340
How could it be?

365
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,700
Disabling their strongest fighter

366
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,030
is at least a partial victory for us.

367
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,620
If we could truly dismantle

368
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,910
that Heaven-Destroying Formation,

369
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,870
it would be a permanent solution.

370
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,300
We just saw Hu Jiao getting involved with them.

371
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,050
That biggest fool in the world.

372
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,060
What can she do?

373
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,560
She may not be stupid.

374
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,590
A truly foolish person

375
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,330
couldn't reach that position.

376
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,220
She's pretending to be foolish?

377
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,840
Then she's incredible.

378
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,280
She has fooled us all.

379
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,200
Do you all know about that?

380
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,040
I'm the only fool here.

381
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,790
I didn't confirm it

382
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,350
until I saw Hu Jiao

383
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,150
associating with those people earlier.

384
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:47,130
Whose side is she really on?

385
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,640
She works for my brother.

386
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,390
Maybe they have other plans now.

387
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,660
What plans could your brother have?

388
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,280
Could he be scheming to usurp power?

389
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,220
Judging by your past record,

390
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,190
you always manage to guess the truth.

391
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,890
Maybe you've actually got it right this time.

392
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,320
Really?

393
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,880
Who knows?

394
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,740
Why have you been

395
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,300
hanging around with those dangerous people lately?

396
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,840
It's none of your business. Stay out of it.

397
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,410
Are you worried about me?

398
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,540
You wish.

399
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,010
Go back quickly. Go back now.

400
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,340
Stop following me.

401
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,700
I-I'm going back to the royal city.

402
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,180
Didn't you just return from there?

403
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,520
This time, it's for joining another sect.

404
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,510
I need to go back and ask the Crown Prince for instructions.

405
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,660
Go back now.

406
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,690
Join another sect?

407
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,930
Master, I...

408
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,780
I will make amends for my mistakes.

409
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,720
Good.

410
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,640
Having this intention to make amends is enough.

411
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,890
Do well in the future.

412
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,490
What's past is past.

413
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,370
Yes, Master.

414
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,630
You're well-educated and skilled in martial arts.

415
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,350
Let me ask you.

416
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,620
Without any damage to the body,

417
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,720
can a magnet extract an ox-hair needle?

418
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,910
Is that an iron needle?

419
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,800
Yes.

420
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,370
A magnet combined with your internal force

421
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,200
should be able to push the iron needle out.

422
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,540
How about I ask the blacksmiths and doctors?

423
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,780
They may have one.

424
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,980
I'll go.

425
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,970
You shouldn't be separated.

426
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,320
With my martial arts and poison skills,

427
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,700
ordinary people can't hold me.

428
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,030
Let me tell you.

429
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,130
If you see those two people, avoid them.

430
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,570
Don't engage in battle.

431
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,460
Master, if we are looking for something,

432
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,970
wouldn't it be more effective to find local people to help us?

433
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,370
Definitely.

434
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,430
That kid has been wanting to become your disciple.

435
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:08,930
Kid.

436
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,020
Come here. Come here.

437
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,080
This is my master.

438
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,750
If you do well,

439
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,140
he might take you as his disciple.

440
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,940
Greetings, Master. Greetings.

441
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:21,670
Greetings, Master.

442
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,740
You're quite smooth-talking and quick-witted.

443
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,050
Are you from this town?

444
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,150
Yes, yes.

445
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,540
I was born and raised here.

446
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,380
Jing, let me give you a test.

447
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,470
If you can do it,

448
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,510
I'll consider taking you as my disciple.

449
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,100
You're not asking me to kill someone, are you?

450
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,950
What are you talking about? Can you kill people?

451
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,460
No, no, no.

452
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,580
I can kill chickens, though.

453
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,300
I can kill

454
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,540
all the chickens in town.

455
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,260
I just want you to find something for me.

456
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,600
Finding things.

457
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,780
No problem, no problem.

458
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,610
I can turn the whole town upside down

459
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,650
to find it.

460
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,910
Those are my buddies.

461
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,900
They know everyone in town.

462
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,250
Everyone in town knows me.

463
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,670
That's good then.

464
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,920
Seventh Disciple, tell him.

465
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,310
Yes, Master.

466
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,700
We're looking for a kind of stone that can attract iron.

467
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,890
I don't know about it,

468
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,390
but I'll definitely find it.

469
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,090
Even if I have to turn this town inside out,

470
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,160
I'll find it for you.

471
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,920
I'll wait for your good news.

472
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,400
Okay, okay, okay.

473
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,510
Master, I'll go now.

474
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,160
Okay, okay.

475
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,140
Here, Master.

476
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,620
Master.

477
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,580
Even if I left,

478
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,940
I'd never

479
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,320
reveal the secrets of the Heaven-Destroying Formation.

480
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,690
How could you reveal it?

481
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:30,890
I trust you.

482
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,410
Master, you still don't trust me.

483
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,410
How could I not believe you?

484
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,710
Don't overthink it.

485
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,320
Don't think too much about it.

486
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,640
Hu Jiao went back to the royal city,

487
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,740
saying she was going to become someone's disciple.

488
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,070
The Seventh Disciple is in danger.

489
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,270
What do you mean?

490
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,560
He's likely to be replaced.

491
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,620
Replaced?

492
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,410
Doesn't that mean "killed"?

493
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,360
Because the formation's secrets can't be revealed.

494
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,950
They wouldn't kill their own disciple, would they?

495
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,390
They're a bunch of ruthless villains.

496
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,260
In a few days, they'll attend

497
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,290
the Mingyi Manor Conference with my father.

498
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,220
What a devious group of people.

499
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,310
So, you... betrayed your father?

500
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,650
Now, Hongxiu has the trump card

501
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,370
of having much support.

502
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,230
Weren't you just teasing her earlier?

503
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,860
I tease everyone I admire.

504
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,090
Based on what I know,

505
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,410
a magnet should be able to counteract your Sealing Magic Power technique, right?

506
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,700
Indeed, if they use magnets,

507
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,450
they can extract the needle from his body.

508
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,070
That Old Weirdo asked me to find something...

509
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,070
a stone that can attract iron.

510
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,200
Is there one in this town?

511
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,920
Yes.

512
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,780
I've seen children playing with it on the street,

513
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,560
but I don't know to which family they belong.

514
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,860
I don't think it'll be useful.

515
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:02,660
Oh right,

516
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,200
before I left,

517
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,650
one of the old weirdos ran out first

518
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,310
and seemed to be looking for something.

519
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,580
Old Devil Ding?

520
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,000
These people are too dangerous. Don't get involved.

521
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,160
Okay.

522
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,580
No problem.

523
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,280
Where can we find the magnets?

524
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,550
In our Mo Clan, we use magnets

525
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,950
to make many things.

526
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,870
We also use them in medicine-making.

527
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,940
Then we'll go to the pharmacies and blacksmith shops

528
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,110
to get hold of all the magnets.

529
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,670
Young Master Wang, I'm going to get some medicine.

530
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,340
I'll go to all the pharmacies with you.

531
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,630
Then, let's go to the blacksmith shops.

532
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,660
Let's split up.

533
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,210
Let's go.

534
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:43,930
Let's go.

535
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,190
What... about... me?

536
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,230
Where should I go?

537
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,120
Who's in charge here?

538
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,130
What can I do for you, sir?

539
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,140
You're just a blacksmith; why put on airs?

540
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,400
Just pretending.

541
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,580
This proves you and I are not cut from the same cloth.

542
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,350
I can see you're not ordinary.

543
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:21,440
Have you seen that iron-attracting stone?

544
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,110
You mean magnets?

545
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,180
Indeed, I have.

546
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,430
Where have you seen them?

547
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,240
As you said, I'm not ordinary.

548
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,940
How could I not have seen such stone before?

549
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,330
Where can I find such stones?

550
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,570
I remember that they sell them in the royal city.

551
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,760
People over there need it.

552
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,010
Do you have any left?

553
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,990
Maybe.

554
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,750
Then hurry and find some for me.

555
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,670
With that attitude, why should I find anything for you?

556
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,520
Sir, do you have any?

557
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,530
Please help me find some.

558
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,180
Okay, wait for me here.

559
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,090
Let me see if I can find some for you.

560
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,190
Aizhen.

561
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,150
You're injured.

562
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,240
Don't go in with us.

563
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,590
If we really fight together,

564
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,110
don't get involved. It's too dangerous.

565
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,050
Listen to us.

566
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,030
Let's go.

567
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,050
Sir, do you have any?

568
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,450
If you can find some, I'll reward you generously.

569
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,910
You're in luck.

570
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,390
I actually found one.

571
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,110
Really?

572
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,250
Look.

573
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,970
Is this one enough?

574
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:39,900
Don't give it to him!

575
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,150
Put it here. Later, you should get out of here too.

576
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,480
[Smithy]

577
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,760
Brother!

578
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,680
Are you alright?

579
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,230
I was hit by arrows too.

580
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,050
It's dangerous. Get ready to leave.

581
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,150
It's too dangerous. Don't come near.

582
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:53,990
Be careful.

583
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,950
Qing Cai, save Aizhen!

584
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,620
How did you get hit? You were so careless.

585
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,060
They suddenly appeared,

586
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,240
catching me off guard.

587
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,140
You followed me?

588
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,710
Calm down, calm down.

589
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,860
I just want to join your sect.

590
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,070
Join our sect?

591
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,750
To join our sect.

592
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,880
Our sect isn't easy to join.

593
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,150
Master said

594
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,010
that as long as I get the magnets,

595
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,270
I can be his disciple.

596
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,810
Can I trust you?

597
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,980
Of course, you can.

598
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,449
Even Master trusts me.

599
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,600
Are you smarter than him?

600
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,590
Seems like it.

601
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,030
I was going to give it to him,

602
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,340
but I was afraid I couldn't escape.

603
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,730
Now that you're here,

604
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,659
I don't need to go.

605
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,360
Here's the magnet.

606
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,969
Where are the Masters?

607
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,090
Just over there.

608
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,050
Hurry, then.

609
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,270
Thank you. I'm going.

610
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:38,929
Bye.

611
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,250
[Swallow]

612
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,489
[Swan]

613
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,179
[Swan]

614
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,150
What are you doing?

615
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,780
I'm here to deliver this magnet.

616
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,860
How did you find us here?

617
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,940
That Seventh Disciple... told me

618
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,930
that you might be here.

619
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,800
What about our other disciples?

620
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,690
They're all dead.

621
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,250
How did they die?

622
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,770
It was chaos,

623
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,200
blood everywhere.

624
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,240
The Seventh Disciple was knocked into the blacksmith shop.

625
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,360
I went to save him

626
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,350
and found this magnet in there.

627
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,820
No wonder it looks so familiar.

628
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,640
Brother, check if this stone is a magnet.

629
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,350
You're quite smart.

630
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,950
Are you interested in becoming my disciple?

631
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,240
Though I still need to find a few more sharp people

632
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,050
to learn the Heaven-Destroying Formation together.

633
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,130
What do you mean by people with good aptitude?

634
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,030
Those who've liked fighting since childhood.

635
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,470
Yes, my buddies running stalls

636
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,370
all like fighting.

637
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,680
How many?

638
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,230
Including me, five.

639
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,220
Counting Hu Jiaow, we're still one short.

640
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:06,900
We still have...

641
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,760
Who's there?

642
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,320
Who are you?

643
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,990
He's Hu Jiaow's little follower.

644
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,550
He was with Hu Jiaow just now.

645
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,580
He's sissy; just looking at him irritates me.

646
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,110
He runs very fast.

647
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,100
When your Second Disciple fought him,

648
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,300
your Second Disciple kept chasing him but couldn't catch him at all.

649
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,630
He couldn't do anything with him.

650
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,850
Our Second Disciple was the fastest of all seven disciples.

651
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,470
Now we have seven people, don't we?

652
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,400
Kid, come here!

653
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:37,990
What are you doing here?

654
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,330
Nothing, just running around here.

655
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,000
Running around here?

656
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,410
Are you interested in becoming my disciple?

657
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,290
But I don't know martial arts.

658
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,150
Aren't you good at running?

659
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,010
That's my only strength.

660
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,220
That's enough. You two can become our disciples together.

661
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:56,820
But...

662
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,760
I don't want to be your disciple.

663
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,710
Aren't you Hu Jiaow's follower?

664
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,230
He's already my disciple.

665
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,740
You'll be our buy-one-get-one-free disciple.

666
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,060
Then I'll wait for Hu Jiaow!

667
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,810
Fine, you can go find him in town.

668
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,550
Come to us when you find him.

669
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,930
Alright, I'll go first.

670
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:18,680
He runs fast indeed.

671
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,890
Right, bring your buddies here.

672
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,880
I'll train them first.

673
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:22,810
Okay.

674
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:23,330
By the way.

675
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:24,990
Help me investigate

676
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,630
who broke our Heaven-Destroying Formation.

677
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,310
Also,

678
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,320
and that storyteller.

679
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,860
Find out his background.

680
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,400
That storyteller?

681
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,000
Okay, I'll dig up everything

682
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,990
there is to know about him for you.

683
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:39,970
Find everything.

684
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,570
This thing is quite effective.

685
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,460
Should we make a comeback

686
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,470
and finish them off?

687
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,840
Do you know how to use darts?

688
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,800
If we get close, I can use poison powder.

689
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,240
Those people are not simple.

690
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,230
They even broke our Heaven-Destroying Formation.

691
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:03,870
It won't be easy.

692
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,190
Even if we joined forces,

693
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,150
without knowing the formation's weaknesses, we couldn't break it,

694
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,310
and we might even die.

695
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,290
I brought them here.

696
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,420
Slow down.

697
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,340
What... can you do?

698
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,650
We can fight,

699
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,260
been fighting since we were kids.

700
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,520
Next!

701
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,880
I love bullying people the most.

702
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,050
Next!

703
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,880
You're so skinny, and you can fight too?

704
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,780
I use dirty tricks.

705
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,290
I've never lost a fight against them.

706
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,870
Are you saying I lost?

707
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,500
Well, I didn't lose either.

708
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,590
Come on, let's have a fight over there.

709
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,550
Alright, don't fight here.

710
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,630
Fine, fine, that short guy.

711
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,430
The shortest one!

712
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,480
I can prove they're telling the truth.

713
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,910
They beat me up so badly.

714
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,370
I used to be as tall as him.

715
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,530
Seems you all have some spirit.

716
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,950
I'll take you on as my disciples then.

717
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,300
I'll teach you the world's greatest martial art.

718
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,040
Okay.

719
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,900
Do you dare to kill people?

720
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,370
Kill people? We don't have the guts.

721
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,440
Yeah, even the pigs have more guts than we do.

722
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,330
Yeah, yeah,

723
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,680
we don't even dare to kill a chicken.

724
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,760
We're like mice.

725
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,030
We might kill a bug at most.

726
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,390
To join our sect, you need to offer a token of loyalty.

727
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,450
What is that? Headbutt?

728
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,850
-Head, head.
-Head where?

729
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,740
Headbutt where?

730
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,150
Do we really have to kill someone?

731
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:26,820
Yes.

732
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,550
You can only become our disciples if you kill anyone in the town.

733
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,530
That won't work. The town is... in a delicate situation.

734
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,730
If we randomly kill someone,

735
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,630
the people of Mingyi Manor might get suspicious.

736
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,020
What else can you suggest?

737
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,860
We... we can kill animals.

738
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,340
Yes, yes, yes.

739
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:41,920
Yes, yes, yes.

740
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:42,610
Kill animals.

741
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,910
Kill animals. Kill animals.

742
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,440
Then catch some animals

743
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,930
and kill them before us to prove yourselves

744
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,160
Okay, okay, okay.

745
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:50,790
Okay, okay, okay.

746
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,540
Let's go, go.

747
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,470
Let's go, go.

748
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,010
These little thugs can't do much.

749
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,230
No choice. We need to make up the numbers.

750
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,420
His Majesty hires us for our Heaven-Destroying Formation.

751
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,170
Without it, we have nothing exceptional to offer.

752
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,850
True.

753
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,120
Otherwise, His Majesty wouldn't put us in such an important position.

754
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,800
You attacked the same spot as my master.

755
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,880
Why was the result different?

756
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,410
Han Aizhen,

757
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,150
your master was right.

758
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,580
The scholar was the weakest link

759
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,780
in their formation,

760
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,730
yet there was a hidden trap.

761
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:28,840
If they all attack,

762
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,680
this trap can't be activated.

763
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,850
Only when everyone was attacking the formation

764
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,760
and I focused all my force on the scholar could we break it.

765
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,060
But unfortunately,

766
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,240
your master was too concerned with his status,

767
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,340
so he fell for it.

768
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,790
Aizhen,

769
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:55,220
it's such a pity that he is gone.

770
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:57,820
My condolences.

771
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,760
The Heaven-Destroying Formation

772
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,620
is more formidable than we expected.

773
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,720
Fortunately, you helped us.

774
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,910
Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

775
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,460
I didn't expect

776
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,730
that my crossbows would be completely useless at that time.

777
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,700
Yeah,

778
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,180
and I never got the chance to get close enough to use poison.

779
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,220
Old Devil Ding

780
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,150
is a master of poisoning.

781
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:27,020
His disciples must have countermeasures against poison.

782
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:29,760
What's wrong?

783
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:32,910
You...

784
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,830
Are you saying goodbye to us?

785
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,370
You have decided to enter the mundane world.

786
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,060
We have nothing in common anymore.

787
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:43,920
I...

788
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,740
Then you don't want to witness history anymore?

789
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,680
No need.

790
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,560
I've made too many exceptions already.

791
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,360
I just feel it's a bit of a shame.

792
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,990
Three years.

793
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,690
I think the fate between us has run its course.

794
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:02,410
What are you talking about?

795
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,380
I don't understand.

796
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,960
Wandering among the flowers,

797
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:11,830
yet remaining untouched by a single leaf.

798
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,520
I still don't understand.

799
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,770
You don't need to understand.

800
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,980
We won't meet again anyway.

801
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,440
You're leaving?

802
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,240
You can't.

803
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:26,790
I...

804
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,310
I still owe you the debt of saving my life twice.

805
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,340
I must repay you.

806
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:32,860
You care

807
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,950
because it's your life.

808
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,760
I don't care.

809
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,020
Because I'm Zhang Fang,

810
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:43,890
the famous Wild Crane in the Martial Arts World,

811
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,080
and the playboy

812
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,210
who has girls chasing me

813
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,060
through the streets wherever I go.

814
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:52,640
Bye.

815
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,230
Well...

816
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:57,120
He's really good at putting on an act.

817
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,200
He is a fine man, ruined by his mouth.

818
00:43:59,400 --> 00:43:59,910
I...

819
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,630
He did it on purpose.

820
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,840
Seems like you won't be able to

821
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,000
repay this debt.

822
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,890
He deliberately

823
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:11,450
made himself appear frivolous.

824
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,940
Within those sounds

825
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,540
lie the flow of years,

826
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,060
the vitality of spring, the brilliance of autumn,

827
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:30,730
and the budding love of youth...

828
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,360
I saved you because of the bond we shared before,

829
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:36,950
but that doesn't mean you owe me.

830
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:41,190
In life's long journey,

831
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,490
some people...

832
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,200
just drift apart...

833
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,510
as we walk our separate paths.

834
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,390
It's true.

835
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:01,350
Some people

836
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:03,630
just drift apart

837
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,500
as we walk our separate paths.
