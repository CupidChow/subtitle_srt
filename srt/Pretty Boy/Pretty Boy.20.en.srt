00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,520
[Pretty Boy]

2
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,539
[Episode 20]

3
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,670
Qing Cai.

4
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,760
It's done.

5
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:25,300
It's almost finished over there.

6
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,680
Logically speaking,

7
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,010
it should be very safe now.

8
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,870
Moreover,

9
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,460
I've set up some special counter-attack devices.

10
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,840
Being with an experienced person in the Martial Arts World

11
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,140
really gives a sense of security.

12
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,740
Of course.

13
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,030
I'm very reliable.

14
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,380
From now on,

15
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,710
I'll look after you.

16
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,780
Alright, Boss.

17
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,800
I'll stick with you from now on.

18
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,829
If I protect you,

19
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,070
you'll have to give me your position as the boss.

20
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,340
Let me take over.

21
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,850
It's clean enough. Come down.

22
00:02:58,829 --> 00:02:59,990
It's really sunny today.

23
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,990
I originally thought this place was a safe haven.

24
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,070
Even if I went out to explore the Martial Arts World,

25
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,180
there would always be a home here.

26
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,840
And my father would be waiting for me.

27
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,530
I didn't expect

28
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,140
my father would turn out not to be my real father.

29
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,420
That comfortable life between father and son

30
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,900
is gone forever.

31
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,260
Don't be so sad, okay?

32
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,460
Think about it.

33
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,450
No matter what,

34
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,030
you still had

35
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,610
a happy time as father and son.

36
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,750
Unlike me.

37
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't even know

38
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,220
what my parents look like.

39
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,550
I really envy those

40
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,770
children who have both parents.

41
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,560
They must be very happy

42
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:43,870
to have their mother by their side since childhood.

43
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,790
You have me now.

44
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,770
I'll try to learn

45
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
to treat you like a mother would.

46
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,760
Don't just say it.

47
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,300
You think it's that easy to be someone's mother?

48
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,070
Being a mother is very difficult.

49
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,320
I've noticed that mothers all cook delicious food.

50
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,880
Can you cook?

51
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,310
Can you cook delicious food?

52
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,740
No, I can't.

53
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,150
It's okay, I can't either.

54
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,810
I also wish I had a family like that.

55
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,910
Then why don't you get married?

56
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,660
Who needs those stinky men?

57
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,209
Is Young Master Wang a stinky man too?

58
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,910
There's only one Young Master Wang.

59
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,060
What about Qing Cai?

60
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,680
He's not bad either.

61
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,310
And he's gentle and good-looking.

62
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,400
But there's only one Vegetable too.

63
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,900
They're both taken.

64
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,810
Well, everyone is unique.

65
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,510
Who knows,

66
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,390
you might find the one you like.

67
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,210
Ma'am.

68
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,150
Ma'am.

69
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,750
What brings you here?

70
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,520
Jing will be back soon.

71
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,850
Let's sit down and talk.

72
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,750
Okay.

73
00:04:58,909 --> 00:04:59,580
Ma'am.

74
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,860
I came today because I have a favor to ask of you.

75
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,840
What favor do you need from me?

76
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,580
I don't know anything except cooking.

77
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,460
You're not here to learn cooking from me, are you?

78
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,350
That's exactly it. I want you to teach me how to cook.

79
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,830
You're a big shot.

80
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,080
Why... Why do you want to learn housewife skills?

81
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,550
I'm no big shot.

82
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,900
I'm trying to learn how to be a mother.

83
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,950
From now on,

84
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,110
you'll have to call me Mom.

85
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,670
Otherwise, there'll be no point in me learning to cook.

86
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,060
Mom.

87
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:27,870
Daughter.

88
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,370
Mom...?

89
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,560
Once I've learned how to cook well,

90
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,540
I'll make sure to raise you to be plump and healthy.

91
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,659
This is just a thug's house.

92
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,630
They seem quite familiar with each other.

93
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,390
So he's been hiding here all along.

94
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,960
How did we not discover this before?

95
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,909
Once a riddle is solved, it'll seem very simple.

96
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,710
Well, alright then.

97
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,790
Let's go to the kitchen.

98
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,510
Chunlan, Qiu Ju.

99
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,880
Don't just stand outside.

100
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,790
Hurry up and come in.

101
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,670
Come in.

102
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,630
Let's go.

103
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,030
You're both pretty good-looking.

104
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,080
Come on, let's go cook.

105
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,760
Okay.

106
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,950
Let's go.

107
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,510
Oh no.

108
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,560
I ran out of cat food.

109
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,610
And Qing Cai and Gan Pu aren't here.

110
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
What should I do?

111
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,890
Didn't you learn how to set up traps?

112
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,110
Oh right, how could I forget about that?

113
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,520
I'll go set up some traps in a bit.

114
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,680
Where are you going to set them?

115
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,560
At the entrance.

116
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,840
If you set them at the entrance, you'll be catching us,

117
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,580
not animals, okay?

118
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,830
That's true.

119
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,470
But if I set them too far,

120
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,330
I'll get tired walking.

121
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,750
I won't want to go.

122
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,130
Fine, we'll just be more careful on our way out then.

123
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,300
It's okay, just put up a sign.

124
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,680
When you see it, you'll know,

125
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,020
Animals can't read anyway.

126
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,780
Clever.

127
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,260
Is this how it should be cut?

128
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,390
Jing.

129
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,990
I'm back.

130
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,190
Are you from Mingyi Manor?

131
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,900
Yes, we are.

132
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,360
Are you afraid of us?

133
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,720
Who from the outside world isn't afraid of Mingyi Manor?

134
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,690
But you don't look

135
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,670
fierce or evil.

136
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,220
Fierce and evil?

137
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,070
Mingyi Manor has a notorious reputation outside.

138
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:55,600
Don't you know?

139
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,080
No, we don't.

140
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,840
We've never heard of it.

141
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,990
How can this be?

142
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,170
You two probably don't get out much, do you?

143
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,310
Stop looking.

144
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,350
Jing.

145
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,790
Actually, before,

146
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,550
I also had misconceptions about Mingyi Manor.

147
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,040
Many of the rumors about Mingyi Manor

148
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,000
aren't true.

149
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,420
Some people deliberately spread those rumors.

150
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,040
I see.

151
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,270
Look.

152
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,670
Your boss and I

153
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,250
are now part of Mingyi Manor, too.

154
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,590
Do you find us scary?

155
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,050
When you put it that way,

156
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,159
I'm really not afraid anymore.

157
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,100
Not afraid anymore?

158
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,380
Weren't you quite afraid of your Big Brother before?

159
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,890
I was before,

160
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,370
but he's so good to us now.

161
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,549
So why should I be afraid of him?

162
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,410
What's he doing?

163
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,540
Our family has really become wealthy.

164
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,590
Even the pigs' diet is being improved.

165
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,410
Don't talk nonsense.

166
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,580
He's learning to cook.

167
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,110
Was that chewed by a dog?

168
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,190
Yes, it was chewed by my little dog here.

169
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,150
Is there any woman like you who would call her mother a dog?

170
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,190
All daughters are like this.

171
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,340
Mom?

172
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,140
What does that mean?

173
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,530
Your boss has become a mother.

174
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,580
[TRAP]

175
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,350
-The oil temperature is almost ready.
-Well…

176
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,470
Pour those potatoes in.

177
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,710
Just a portion of them would be enough, right?

178
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,430
Be careful. Be careful.

179
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,110
Just pour in a portion.

180
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,430
Be careful. Slowly.

181
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,660
That's right.

182
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,550
Yes, just like that.

183
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,990
When you see them turning slightly yellow,

184
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,790
scoop them out.

185
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,310
-Right, add sugar.
-This...

186
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,030
Add a bit more. A bit more.

187
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,540
No, that's not right.

188
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,870
Wrong, it's wrong.

189
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,190
The foreplay isn't enough yet.

190
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,420
This way, the flavor can't be brought out.

191
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,430
There are kids here.

192
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,760
How could you say those obscene words?

193
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,810
You old rascal. Stop right there!

194
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,190
Where do you think you're running?

195
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,590
-I'll beat you to death!
-My leg is broken!

196
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,870
-What were you talking about?
-My arm is almost broken!

197
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,270
It's fine when you joke around normally, but...

198
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,470
Is it burnt?

199
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:37,990
It's burnt.

200
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,390
-It's burnt.
-It's all burnt.

201
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,360
Look, look.

202
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,800
You overcooked it.

203
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,670
The sugar. You've burnt the sugar.

204
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,150
Quick, get it out. Get it out.

205
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,870
Hurry, get it out.

206
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,150
-Try it again.
-Get it out.

207
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,240
Put the sugar in.

208
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,520
When it starts to bubble,

209
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,860
pull it out.

210
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,560
When you pull it out, it should form strings.

211
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,590
The way you did it...

212
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,640
Look at it.

213
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,130
-It's all ruined.
-How should it be cooked?

214
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,190
Get some oil, and let's start over.

215
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,730
Start over.

216
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,050
Come on, come on.

217
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,110
Come on.

218
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,260
Come on, come on.

219
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
Take it. Take it to the side.

220
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:12,920
Okay.

221
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,840
Why don't we taste it?

222
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,460
That's not a good idea, is it?

223
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,540
Yeah, not a good idea.

224
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,050
Not a good idea, indeed.

225
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,300
Well...

226
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,770
We'll just take one bite.

227
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,390
-Yeah.
-Just one bite.

228
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,710
How is it?

229
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,480
It's good.

230
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,150
Add more.

231
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,400
Add a bit more.

232
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,890
-Is that enough?
-Yes.

233
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,440
Stir slowly.

234
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,710
-Stir slowly. Be careful.
-Slowly.

235
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,430
Stir in one direction.

236
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,840
I'm so hungry.

237
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,550
I'm not hungry. Who's hungry? I'm not.

238
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,110
I'm just tasting it. I'm not hungry.

239
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,540
Although it's burnt, it still smells pretty good.

240
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,410
Burnt but aromatic potatoes.

241
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,550
Enjoying the food?

242
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,930
Is it delicious?

243
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,600
It is.

244
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,510
It's delicious?

245
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,100
Really?

246
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,000
You're not learning this dish?

247
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,140
You don't want to learn how to make ten servings of candied potatoes?

248
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,650
I've come around.

249
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,690
Since I've got a mom who takes care of me and dotes on me,

250
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,210
why should I trouble myself?

251
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,230
I won't learn it anymore.

252
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,610
A doting mother always spoils her child.

253
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,100
Should I force you to learn?

254
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,930
Otherwise, how will you get married in the future?

255
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,830
I can stay with my mom.

256
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,220
I don't want to get married.

257
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,460
But when I see my mom's cooking,

258
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,440
it seems getting married might be my only way out.

259
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,850
I'm so full.

260
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,290
[TRAP]

261
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,780
My trap caught something so fast.

262
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,750
Let me tell you,

263
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,110
my prey is this big.

264
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,310
It might be a roe deer.

265
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,530
Does the roe deer in your area talk?

266
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,680
Let's go check it out.

267
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,270
Let's go see.

268
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,190
Let's go see.

269
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:41,950
This...

270
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,430
Why did you destroy my trap?

271
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,830
It's your trap that destroyed me, okay?

272
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,190
I've put up a sign here.

273
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
[TRAP]

274
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,980
Can't you see such big letters?

275
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,670
Who can see anything in this pitch darkness?

276
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,330
You set the trap in the middle of the road.

277
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,050
Were you trying to catch people or animals?

278
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,600
If I can't catch animals,

279
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,180
catching a person is not bad either.

280
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,790
Help me up.

281
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,010
-It really hurts.
-Hong Hui.

282
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,310
Answer my question first.

283
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,440
In this pitch darkness,

284
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,340
what were you sneaking around for?

285
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,750
I...

286
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,460
I was bored, so I just wanted to take a walk.

287
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,280
-You...
-No.

288
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,360
You need to come up with a different excuse.

289
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,710
I don't have any other excuse.

290
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,570
I'm dizzy from the fall.

291
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,560
The fall has messed up my brain.

292
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,510
I can't come up with anything.

293
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,670
You...

294
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,520
Gao Yin, look at him.

295
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,870
He's not dead from the fall, is he?

296
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,150
Can you check on him for me?

297
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,160
It's just a face-plant.

298
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,750
At most, it's embarrassing.

299
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,190
Embarrassing to death.

300
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,670
Is he dead?

301
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,710
He didn't die of embarrassment, did he?

302
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,510
Can you check for me?

303
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,760
He's dead? Embarrassed to death?

304
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,630
Died of embarrassment?

305
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,390
I'm off.

306
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,010
He...

307
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,750
What does she mean?

308
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:11,910
I'm off too.

309
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:12,790
Wait.

310
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:13,910
You...

311
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,580
You just left like that.

312
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,300
I...

313
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,210
Don't hit me. I'm awake.

314
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,820
Playing dead.

315
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,310
Next time you play dead, I'll really beat you to death.

316
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,130
I'll see if you dare to play dead again.

317
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,390
It hurts. It hurts so much.

318
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,790
Untie me. Untie me.

319
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,740
Untie me. Untie me. Untie me.

320
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,820
Play dead?

321
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,550
I shouldn't have helped you up.

322
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,170
Next time, I'll tie you up here for a day.

323
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,310
There won't be a next time.

324
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
Hong Hui!

325
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,080
Next time, I'll set a trap at your doorstep.

326
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,670
You'll be caught as soon as you step out!

327
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,840
You think I'm scared of you?

328
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,800
-I'm off.
-Stop!

329
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,850
Damn Hong Hui.

330
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,110
You did a good job learning this dish today.

331
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,670
However,

332
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,310
being a mother shouldn't just be about cooking, right?

333
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,030
What else should a mother know how to do?

334
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,400
I don't know about that.

335
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,570
I've never been a mother either.

336
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,720
Okay.

337
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,910
I'll learn to be a good mother.

338
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,980
How do you plan to learn?

339
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,350
All mothers are different.

340
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,070
Then I'll learn from the best of every mother.

341
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,090
You can do that?

342
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,460
It's so comfortable living here.

343
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,740
Look how big this bamboo forest is.

344
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,670
Tell me.

345
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,510
Will I

346
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,950
be able to eat your cooking every day from now on?

347
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,350
Of course.

348
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,110
Then,

349
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,800
will your cooking keep getting better?

350
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,180
Definitely.

351
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,560
Great.

352
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,119
I don't like cooking anyway.

353
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,790
So you can do all the cooking.

354
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,960
It's so quiet tonight.

355
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,280
It feels really comfortable.

356
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,349
This is nice.

357
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,080
You can even strum like this.

358
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,010
You haven't drunk any wine yet.

359
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,750
Why have you become even more sorrowful?

360
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,800
Gallant deeds always get sent away by driving wind.

361
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,050
With wrath I draw my sword and I look around, feeling completely at a loss.

362
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,440
Qu Ping indulges himself on the river, only missing the wine.

363
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,230
After a thousand cups of wine, there will be no more worries.

364
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:15,670
Nice.

365
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,410
Life is about knowing each other,

366
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,710
and knowing each other is all about wine.

367
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,390
You guys are so flirtatious.

368
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:37,920
Hong Hui.

369
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,600
Don't you dare be like them.

370
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,390
Or I'll beat you to a pulp.

371
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,650
Suddenly I heard the roar of the lion from the east of the river,

372
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,090
and I felt a chill coming out of my whole body.

373
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,190
You're teaching him bad things again.

374
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,710
Zhang Fang, I'll teach you a lesson.

375
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,040
-Suddenly I heard the roar of the lion from the east of the river...
-Come here.

376
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,430
And I felt a chill coming out of my whole body.

377
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,270
-Stop!
-Don't. Don't.

378
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,350
-Come here.
-Don't.

379
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,030
Don't move.

380
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,190
Pepper. Pepper.

381
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,520
Stop messing around.

382
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,120
Come back.

383
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,150
I'm doing this for you.

384
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Go ahead and keep making trouble.

385
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,670
A chill comes out of my whole body.

386
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,630
You better be careful.

387
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,430
If you keep this up,

388
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,430
you'll be feeling a chill coming out of your whole body too.

389
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,110
What are they doing here?

390
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,550
Could this family be suspicious in some way?

391
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,190
It's probably Wang's stronghold for informants.

392
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,670
We've failed in our duty again.

393
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,710
We didn't notice at all.

394
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,480
Let's send someone to monitor this family when we get back.

395
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,310
Yesterday, at this doorway,

396
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,710
I saw a mother and daughter playing.

397
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,710
It's just

398
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,360
I don't know when they'll come out today.

399
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,710
Why are we standing here,

400
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,910
sneaking around like this?

401
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,640
How weird.

402
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,080
Why don't we go peek through the window?

403
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,790
It's all women inside. What are you trying to peek at?

404
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,190
What are you thinking?

405
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,030
I've pretended to be a woman for too long.

406
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,870
I've forgotten that I'm not actually a woman.

407
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,950
This is really becoming a problem now.

408
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,230
They're really not coming out, huh?

409
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,640
Why don't we go for a walk on the street?

410
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,510
Waiting here

411
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,030
seems like a waste of time.

412
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,910
Let's go.

413
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,190
It's always like this every time we go out.

414
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,710
Look, the wind has picked up.

415
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,050
I told you to wear more, but you just wouldn't listen.

416
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,500
I'm not cold.

417
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,680
You must be cold. Look, you're shivering.

418
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,760
You'll catch a cold again.

419
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,500
I'm really not cold.

420
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,590
I've noticed that you

421
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,990
are becoming more and more disobedient.

422
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,480
You weren't like this before.

423
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,720
I used to be naive.

424
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,830
I thought everything you said was right.

425
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,460
Now I won't be fooled by you anymore.

426
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,600
Fooled?

427
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,920
Do I have any reason to fool you?

428
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,080
You're always telling me what to do,

429
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,450
but you can't even do it yourself.

430
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,340
I'm just trying to do what's best for you.

431
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,990
If you weren't my daughter,

432
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,290
I wouldn't bother caring about you at all.

433
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,710
Always meddling in everything.

434
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,630
Is it really for the daughter's good?

435
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,310
I don't think so.

436
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,040
If everything has to be controlled so strictly,

437
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,470
then I might

438
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,940
not like this mother as much anymore.

439
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,640
You're so lazy.

440
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,900
Your in-laws will despise you when you get married.

441
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,170
Then why aren't you despised by your in-laws?

442
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,260
That's because your grandmother passed away early.

443
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,380
I was just lucky, okay?

444
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,410
Then I'll marry a man without a mother.

445
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,980
But you'll still have a father-in-law.

446
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,500
He'll despise you too.

447
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,570
Then I'll marry a man without parents.

448
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,920
You're really driving me crazy.

449
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,720
A man without parents must be from a poor family.

450
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,110
He won't even be able to afford the bride price.

451
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,380
I actually fit that condition quite well.

452
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,730
That being said,

453
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,640
actually,

454
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,640
I'm quite envious of this daughter.

455
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,850
I thought you didn't like it?

456
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,380
I just don't like this form of it.

457
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,100
But

458
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,290
I've never had anyone be so strict with me since I was little.

459
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,210
No one has ever disciplined me so seriously.

460
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,060
I think being disciplined like this

461
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,210
might be another kind of happiness.

462
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,410
They've been following them.

463
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,510
Could there be something wrong with this mother and daughter?

464
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,990
There must be something wrong with them.

465
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,130
Otherwise, why would they observe so carefully?

466
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,080
Is Wang using this kind of people now?

467
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,530
This is too covert.

468
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,410
No wonder we hadn't found any clues.

469
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,850
His strategies are almost as good as our Mingyi Manor's.

470
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,920
Could they be the General's subordinates?

471
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,790
Why would Vegetable follow the General's people?

472
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,800
That's true.

473
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,210
They're on the same side now.

474
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,360
I never thought that

475
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,510
we'd be on the same side as our old enemies some day.

476
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,100
The world is too complicated.

477
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,430
My brain can't keep up.

478
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,530
Go away.

479
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,830
Don't follow me.

480
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:46,510
Mom.

481
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,270
Seriously.

482
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,270
So fierce.

483
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,950
Will Chunlan and Qiu Ju misunderstand?

484
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,280
They might think there's something wrong with that mother and daughter.

485
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,390
We'll explain to them later.

486
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,240
How should we explain?

487
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,590
Telling them I'm learning how to be a mother?

488
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,590
Don't pull me like that.

489
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,370
Mom.

490
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:09,880
Don't.

491
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,110
Go follow someone else.

492
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:11,470
Mom.

493
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,360
Don't pull me.

494
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,970
Mom.

495
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,790
You're so annoying.

496
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,230
You never listen to what I say.

497
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,080
It's so ugly.

498
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,770
I don't want to wear this color.

499
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,270
Only old ladies wear such dark clothes.

500
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,640
I want this pink one.

501
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,210
You're just a little kid.

502
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,370
What do you know?

503
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,570
You're so fat.

504
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,990
You'll look like a pig in pink.

505
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,160
Why don't we change a few more targets?

506
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:34,840
This one it is.

507
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,310
-This way, they should be able to figure it out.
-You always provoke me.

508
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,310
There are no pink pigs, okay?

509
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,590
There will be one when you wear it.

510
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,830
You really are my own mother.

511
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,370
Can't you say something nice?

512
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,460
If I weren't your own mother,

513
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,330
would I take you to buy fabric for new clothes?

514
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,810
Try finding a stepmother.

515
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,690
Maybe a stepmother would be better than you.

516
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,640
You ungrateful child.

517
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,980
How did I give birth to a daughter like you?

518
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,410
What a sin I've committed.

519
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,290
It's not like I asked you to give birth to me.

520
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,790
You could have not given birth to me, right?

521
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,910
You're driving me crazy.

522
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,070
If I had known, I would have thrown you away.

523
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,690
Even an adopted daughter would be better than you.

524
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,560
If you're so capable, throw me away now.

525
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,780
-Throw me! Throw me!
-You...

526
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,100
You'll understand when you become a mother.

527
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,840
What an unfilial daughter.

528
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,490
When I become a mother,

529
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,290
if I have a daughter like you,

530
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,290
I'll definitely throw her away.

531
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,820
You!

532
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,820
Stop right there!

533
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,630
I said stop!

534
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,230
What kind of fabric would you like to buy this time?

535
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,260
Well, this time,

536
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,460
I'd like to buy some fabric that you don't have at your stall.

537
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,840
Can you sell it to me?

538
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,600
Fabric that we don't have...

539
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,290
You're getting more and more mischievous.

540
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,020
You scared the stall owner silly.

541
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,660
That's what he gets for acting like a petty swindler before.

542
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,260
Indeed, women are not to be trifled with.

543
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,360
You know,

544
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,590
you've said the same thing to me before.

545
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,190
But now,

546
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,480
I finally understand what you meant.

547
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,820
However,

548
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,610
why are all the mother-daughter pairs we've observed

549
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,630
so disharmonious?

550
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,790
Are all mother-daughter relationships like this?

551
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,620
I guess most of them are like this.

552
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,000
They all quarrel a lot.

553
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,620
I don't think there are many

554
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,790
mother-daughter relationships

555
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,910
that are very harmonious and peaceful.

556
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,390
You've seen the world more than I have,

557
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,890
and you've been to more places.

558
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,770
So what do you think is the reason for that?

559
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,310
I think when it comes to families,

560
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,170
the more they argue, the closer they are.

561
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,690
Don't you think being polite

562
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,940
is more like how you treat strangers?

563
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,140
According to what you're saying,

564
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,700
I should curse at you every day from now on.

565
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,840
That would show how close we are, right?

566
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,900
Curse at me?

567
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,620
It'd make more sense if I curse at you, okay?

568
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,310
Alright, alright.

569
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,660
After all, I'm your mother.

570
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,870
I'll put up with it.

571
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,300
Hong Hui.

572
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,730
You went to observe that courtyard this morning.

573
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,190
What did you find?

574
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,730
I didn't find anything.

575
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,590
Chunlan and Qiu Ju weren't there.

576
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,920
Vegetable didn't seem to go out like he did the past couple of days.

577
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,310
So, in that case,

578
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,840
they might have all left.

579
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,640
It's only been a while.

580
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,660
It's hard to say.

581
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,000
Then keep observing.

582
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,200
I really don't like this feeling.

583
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,520
Qing Cai is obviously a good person.

584
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,350
Young Master Wang.

585
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,710
Are you really planning to make a move against him?

586
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,790
Isn't this the order you received too?

587
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,070
I'm just curious.

588
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,990
But I have my own principles.

589
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,390
I'm

590
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,910
feeling worse and worse.

591
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,150
I'm tired. I'm done playing.

592
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,590
You've made quite a progress on those few notes just now.

593
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,870
It seems you've retained some of your spirituality.

594
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,280
You made it sound like I'm practicing some kind of magical power.

595
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,310
I think all things are interconnected.

596
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,070
Don't you think so?

597
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,630
As for the principles you mentioned before,

598
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,950
I think I'm slowly starting to understand them.

599
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:43,870
Is that so?

600
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,590
Who are you?

601
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,110
Why don't you get involved in their affairs?

602
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,560
Why don't I get involved in their affairs...

603
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,270
Because I think

604
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,430
the things they do

605
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,350
are a bit boring to me.

606
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:10,550
That's because you have no attachments.

607
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,510
Otherwise,

608
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,070
you'd be just like everyone else.

609
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,630
After all,

610
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,590
the Bodhisattva fears the cause,

611
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,990
while ordinary beings fear the effect.

612
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,510
As for me,

613
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,830
I've already cut off...

614
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,630
Right.

615
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,560
I've cut off

616
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,950
all the causes and conditions of emotions that trouble people.

617
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,150
But without these attachments,

618
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,550
haven't you also lost a lot of warmth?

619
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,750
That depends on what kind of person you want to become.

620
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,230
Those who know others are intelligent,

621
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,110
while those who know themselves are enlightened.

622
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,910
If one likes solitude,

623
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,350
they'll make such a choice.

624
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,040
You like solitude?

625
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,760
Perhaps.

626
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,310
Then why are you still staying here?

627
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,870
Because I still can't fully endure

628
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,310
complete solitude.

629
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,750
So,

630
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,350
it's fine to make some ordinary friends.

631
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,550
Of course,

632
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,270
the premise is that we are like-minded.

633
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,720
No wonder you and Wang Yishao

634
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,150
are always so close yet so distant.

635
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,430
So,

636
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,070
you and Wang Yishao are like-minded people?

637
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,990
Like-minded people...

638
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,440
How should I put it?

639
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,280
I believe in the long years of life,

640
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,070
some people, you know,

641
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,350
over time,

642
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,520
will naturally go their separate ways.

643
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,070
I'm not thirsty yet.

644
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,710
Drinking tea like this

645
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,030
isn't really about quenching thirst.

646
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,390
I just don't like this feeling at all.

647
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,710
Seeing these tiny cups and plates irritates me.

648
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,870
Alright, I get it.

649
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,350
It also bothers me when you look at me like that.

650
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,110
If you have something to say, just say it.

651
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,550
If not, I'm leaving.

652
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,120
Can you tell me about your mission?

653
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,990
Why are you being so fussy?

654
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,830
Didn't I just tell you?

655
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,800
I want to hear what you haven't told me.

656
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,390
Go ask your brother.

657
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,070
I can't afford to offend

658
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,270
big shots like you.

659
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,030
So you did hide information from us.

660
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,880
You're too cunning.

661
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,390
I'll stay away from you.

662
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,390
Why are you all staring at me?

663
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,230
Don't try to scare me. I'm leaving.

664
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,230
What do you think Hu Jiao is hiding?

665
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,490
It's hard to say.

666
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,670
I just feel that my brother

667
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,510
couldn't possibly be this well-behaved.

668
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,190
You truly are brothers.

669
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,010
The sad thing is

670
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,470
we are brothers.

671
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,630
So what do you think I'm hiding?

672
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,270
Can I get any information from you?

673
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,270
Well, I can reveal unimportant information.

674
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,910
It's a misunderstanding. It's a misunderstanding.

675
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,270
Let's go. Hurry up.

676
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,910
Aunt He, you're here.

677
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,270
Who are those people?

678
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,430
Aunt He, they're bad people.

679
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,500
They tried to attack us.

680
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,950
It seems their target is Mingyi Manor.

681
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,710
They looked like they were here for revenge.

682
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,900
What?

683
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,140
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

684
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:33,670
Hurry up!

685
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,990
Their appearance at this time

686
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,490
is very likely to be related to Wang Quan.

687
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,920
Those two look like disciples.

688
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,070
When we encountered them yesterday,

689
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,070
there were two others who looked like masters.

690
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,510
They all seem to be formidable characters.

691
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,150
Should we follow them?

692
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,070
After being born,

693
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,070
in the process of growing up,

694
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,720
there's sadness of parting,

695
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,390
brief moments of happiness,

696
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,470
expectations,

697
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,920
and more often,

698
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,990
long periods of waiting.

699
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,560
And then,

700
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,700
everything is gone.

701
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,460
Those are

702
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,710
all the life experiences you've been through.

703
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,260
Didn't you say

704
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,080
each note was a life?

705
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,140
Yes.

706
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,240
Those are all your experiences

707
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,090
and what you've come to realize.

708
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,600
It's all about your life,

709
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,770
not its.

710
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,970
So you're saying,

711
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,690
a person's experiences are very important.

712
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,320
Of course experiences are important.

713
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,980
If you want to express the breadth of life,

714
00:33:59,010 --> 00:33:59,980
or its depth,

715
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,580
experiences are essential.

716
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,280
Life is too complicated.

717
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:08,090
What if I just want to express nature?

718
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,550
Express nature...

719
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,000
This is what I think.

720
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,699
There's no completely independent nature.

721
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,600
Just express

722
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,780
the nature you perceive.

723
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,940
The nature I perceive...

724
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,360
The sky is vast,

725
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,989
the earth is profound,

726
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,620
and life is carefree and content.

727
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,630
Feel it.

728
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,700
Now it's your turn to feel.

729
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Is this Aunt He?

730
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,040
All of them were killed with a single strike.

731
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,720
The opponent is very skilled in martial arts.

732
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,100
She was poisoned.

733
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,540
And it was a deadly poison.

734
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,180
Was Aunt He very skilled in martial arts?

735
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,480
Yes, indeed.

736
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,740
In Mingyi Manor, she was second only to Yinniang.

737
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:28,450
That's right.

738
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,150
Her martial arts skills were on par with Hongxiu and Dongmei.

739
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:30,780
They're all about the same level.

740
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,400
She was not far behind Yinniang either.

741
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,940
For such a skilled expert,

742
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,720
poison alone wouldn't have been enough to kill her instantly.

743
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,280
The opponent must have had another powerful fighter.

744
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,700
If that's the case, it's terrible.

745
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:40,920
Qing Cai.

746
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,680
Let's hurry back and prepare some things.

747
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,010
Otherwise, it'll be difficult for us to deal with them now.

748
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,180
Give it to me.

749
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,060
Give it to me.

750
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:10,940
You...

751
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,230
Give it to me.

752
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,240
Stop right there.

753
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:19,860
Stop!

754
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,010
Stop!

755
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,710
Stop!

756
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,100
Come on.

757
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,580
I'm exhausted.

758
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,190
Come on.

759
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,990
I can't take it. I can't.

760
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,230
Come on.

761
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,120
Come here.

762
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,220
Come here.

763
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,060
Wasn't that Qing Cai?

764
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,540
Did I see it wrong?

765
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,220
Hong Hui.

766
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,420
Hong...

767
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,580
Hong Hui!

768
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,460
Hong Hui!

769
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,660
Hong Hui, come out here!

770
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,370
You bastard!

771
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,310
Hong Hui!

772
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,350
I'll grind your bones to dust!

773
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,500
[Smithy]

774
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,840
What could Hongxiu want to see us for?

775
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,390
I'm not sure either.

776
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,580
Something's happened.

777
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,750
What is it?

778
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,470
Aunt He has been killed.

779
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,510
How is that possible?

780
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,010
The news just came from the townspeople.

781
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,240
It's confirmed that she was poisoned.

782
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,050
Can we find out who did it?

783
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,000
It's said to be Old Devil Ding's technique.

784
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,330
Aren't the Ding brothers already dead?

785
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,390
Back then, Yinniang...

786
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,180
It might be Old Devil Ding's disciples who did it.

787
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,770
But their skills are as good as Old Devil Ding's.

788
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,240
Otherwise, Aunt He wouldn't have died.

789
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,740
With Aunt He's martial prowess,

790
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,850
even if poisoned,

791
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,660
she wouldn't have been completely defenseless, right?

792
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,820
At least it would have been a fight to the death.

793
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,200
That's exactly the problem.

794
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,030
So I believe

795
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,190
there must be another person

796
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,910
with martial arts skills comparable to Old Devil Ding's.

797
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,010
Could it be that the Ding brothers are really not dead?

798
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,610
We must now focus on

799
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,910
the important event ten days from now.

800
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,050
We don't have the energy to deal with those experts.

801
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,120
How about I go to the town to preside over the work?

802
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,550
We can't afford to waste time now.

803
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,840
Then what should we do?

804
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,680
I think it's necessary for us

805
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,390
to bring in the General's people now.

806
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,400
Right, let them fight each other.

807
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,090
Now I need to bring Qing Cai back.

808
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,290
Let me go.

809
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,800
His safety is more important.

810
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,980
He has captured you before.

811
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,820
Don't you have any grudge against him?

812
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,180
I would be lying if I said I didn't mind it at all.

813
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,440
So you're still not convinced.

814
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,350
Right, I'm not convinced.

815
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,790
I want to have a face-to-face battle with him.

816
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,590
I know it's not the right time yet.

817
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:03,980
Don't worry.

818
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,560
You've found Qing Cai?

819
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,540
They're in the town?

820
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,860
Hu Jiao also stayed in the town.

821
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,250
Qing Cai might be in danger in the town.

822
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,780
What happened?

823
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,660
Some very powerful enemies have arrived in the town.

824
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,950
I'll be there right away.

825
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:07,070
[Wine]

826
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,390
Take a look.

827
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,510
Please take a look. Delicious skewers.

828
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:08,230
Spicy hotpot. Spicy hotpot.

829
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,740
Fried skewers here!

830
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,080
Come on, take a look!

831
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,020
Spicy hotpot.

832
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,390
Delicious skewers. Check it out.

833
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,120
Tasty spicy hotpot!

834
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,990
Delicious and affordable!

835
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,030
You won't gain weight after eating!

836
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,360
Come and check it out.

837
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,980
Miss, would you like some?

838
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,510
Give me ten of these.

839
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,370
Alright!

840
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,800
-Please have a seat over there.
-Bring them to me when they're ready.

841
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,270
Okay.

842
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,540
No problem, go ahead.

843
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,550
Aromatic and spicy.

844
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,320
Miss, your skewers are ready.

845
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,530
Thanks.

846
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:16,500
You ordered so many skewers. Are they good?

847
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,630
I've eaten all over the country,

848
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,500
but I've never had anything this delicious.

849
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:25,080
I can't sleep if I don't eat it for two days.

850
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,130
[Lover's Tears]

851
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,390
I want ten skewers.

852
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,830
Do you want regular ones

853
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,440
or Lover's Tears?

854
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,840
What is Lover's Tears?

855
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,230
Lover's Tears is what that gentleman ordered.

856
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,230
It's called Lover's Tears.

857
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,130
Is Lover's Tears good?

858
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,350
Would someone as extraordinary as me

859
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,410
eat ordinary things?

860
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,760
Alright!

861
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,460
Give me ten skewers of Lover's Tears.

862
00:42:58,490 --> 00:42:59,330
Alright!

863
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,390
You're also from the Martial Arts World, aren't you?

864
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,730
You're very forthright.

865
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,430
I like it.

866
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:09,570
You also work and live here?

867
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,790
I'm just passing by.

868
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,360
If it weren't for the delicious food here,

869
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,830
I would have left days ago.

870
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,390
So you're also from the Martial Arts World, right?

871
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,690
Then we must have a drink together.

872
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,300
Okay, I'll go buy some wine.

873
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,070
No need, no need.

874
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:29,930
No need to bother.

875
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,250
They have wine here.

876
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:34,910
Boss.

877
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,000
That wine you have here,

878
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,110
what's it called again... Something Tears?

879
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:40,070
Give me a jar of that.

880
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,270
Okay, okay.

881
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,710
Here you are.

882
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:46,270
Tears of Lovers.

883
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:47,550
Okay.

884
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,080
-Enjoy. Enjoy.
-Go.

885
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,140
Come on.

886
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,410
Cheers, bro.

887
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:02,790
Come on.

888
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:16,950
What wine is this? It tastes so awful.

889
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:19,470
A kindred spirit, I see.

890
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,080
The flavor is quite mellow and fragrant.

891
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,750
You look like a real man.

892
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,550
Why are you acting like those pretentious folks?

893
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,590
Talking nonsense.

894
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:33,420
You're absolutely right, sir.

895
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:36,530
Don't be fooled by his manly appearance.

896
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,060
He's actually quite pretentious.

897
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,140
Those pretentious people say

898
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,870
this wine has the fragrance of mountains and the wilderness.

899
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,070
That's just nonsense.

900
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:48,700
The mountains stink.

901
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,950
There's no fragrance at all.

902
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,350
Right, right.

903
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,660
Kindred spirits.

904
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,030
Kindred spirits indeed.

905
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:04,860
Your stronghold is still here.

906
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,590
We bought this place to begin with.

907
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,390
We're not enemies now.

908
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:09,750
There's no need for me to hide it from you.

909
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:10,830
Alright then.

910
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,200
I'll go find Qing Cai.

911
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,510
Let's meet here later.

912
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:14,870
Okay.

913
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,510
Master.

914
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:23,710
Sit.

915
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,750
I heard the Ding brothers from back then didn't die.

916
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,630
I've come specifically to deal with them this time.

917
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,670
They've been really rampant.

918
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:37,350
Even a big shot from Mingyi Manor

919
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:38,430
has been killed by them.

920
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,510
Old Devil Ding's poison is their only real threat.

921
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,430
As for Old Weirdo Ding,

922
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,830
he almost got killed by Yinniang back then.

923
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,610
His martial arts skills are no longer what they used to be.

924
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,420
As it happens, I'm not afraid of poison.

925
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,130
I'm the perfect counter to them.

926
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,280
With the help of the experts the General sent to assist,

927
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,570
dealing with them will be no problem.

928
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,300
Master, you're certainly formidable.

929
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,910
But please be very careful.

930
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,840
Don't worry.

931
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,720
My martial arts skills were on par

932
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:10,710
with Old Weirdo Ding's back then.

933
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:13,880
Now, my martial arts skills have improved.

934
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,540
I'll go with you then, Master.

935
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,060
Your current mission

936
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:20,600
is to protect your lover.

937
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:23,280
Leave the rest to me.
